# First steps

## API keys

For the data collection from 'The Guardian' and 'Pytrends' we make use of the provided APIs. Therefore you need your own API keys. The keys are stored in a .env file which can be created from the .env.sample file. The .env file should be placed in the root directory of the project.

## Python environment

We use a virtual environment to run our code. To create the environment run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# You can deactivate the environment with:
source .venv/bin/deactivate
```

To install the required packages run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data collection
