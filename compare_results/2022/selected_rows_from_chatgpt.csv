20;20;20;20;22;22;Rihanna lets the world know she’s pregnant in the most Rihanna way possible ;2022-01-31;['Grace Medford'];['Life and style', 'Rihanna', 'A$AP Rocky', 'Music', 'Culture'];"The glossy, posed, era of celebrity pregnancy announcement photo in effect ended last September when Gen Z’s imp prince Lil Nas X expertly parodied the genre with a People magazine exclusive in which Nas posed with a baby bump to announce the release of his debut album Montero. Leave it to music’s perennially best-dressed couple, Bajan superstar Rihanna and her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky, to reinvent the genre; “papped” by the fashion-friendly photographer Miles Diggs; walking the streets of Harlem, where Rocky grew up, in a snowstorm wearing a hot pink archive Chanel coat fastened with a single button and a Christian Lacroix necklace draped over her bare stomach, in what can only be described as the most Rihanna way to let the world know she is expecting a baby. Friends since their 2012 collaboration Cockiness (Love It) and an official couple since early 2021, the his and hers looks are perfect – Rihanna in loose-fit ripped jeans and Rocky wearing a Carhartt jacket and vinyl pants. It’s difficult not to be suspicious that they have been paid a significant sum of money by the Census Bureau to make parenthood cool again.
Effortlessly chic, completely unexpected and with a knowing wink to the loud contingency of fans who have been yelling at her to “TAKE THOSE COATS OFF, WE KNOW YOU’RE PREGNANT” since the start of the year, it’s the kind of shoot only someone who treats their fame as playfully as Rihanna could pull off. The beads hanging over her bump in a reference to Madonna’s Like a Prayer album cover, Rih and Rocky holding hands and smiling at each other like stock models, Rocky’s tender kiss to Rihanna’s head as the snow falls beautifully, delicately, perfectly around them: it all lands effortlessly. How could anyone not named Aubrey Graham not be happy for them? The announcement lands days after Rihanna’s fans celebrated, for lack of a better word, the sixth anniversary of the singer’s last studio album, 2016’s Anti. In the intervening period, Rihanna has launched a hugely successful cosmetics line (Fenty Beauty), skincare range (Fenty Skin), lingerie brand (Savage X Fenty), fashion house (Fenty), been made a national hero of Barbados (The Right Excellent Robyn Rihanna Fenty) and found time to start a family (Baby Fenty – coming soon) but hasn’t so much as teased a note of new music. It seems unlikely that the long-awaited R9 will drop before she goes on maternity leave. Could Rihanna’s next move be to expand the Fenty brand out into the kids’ market, delaying R9 yet again? Optimists can perhaps hold on to the hope that impending motherhood will spark the flame of musical creativity in her once again – Madonna and Kelis both released career-best records after becoming parents for the first time, turning to the dancefloor for inspiration (potentially the dancefloor at a mother and baby day rave). • This article was amended on 1 February 2022. An earlier version of the text said Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” album cover showed the singer’s bare midriff; this was actually the cover of Like a Prayer.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/31/rihanna-asap-rocky-pregnancy-announcement;entertainment and culture
85;85;85;85;87;87;Belgian civil servants given legal right to disconnect from work;2022-01-31;['Daniel Boffey'];['Belgium', 'Work-life balance', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Money', 'Work & careers'];Belgian civil servants will no longer need to answer emails or phone calls out of hours after the country became the latest in Europe to offer workers the right to disconnect. The law, which comes into effect on Tuesday, means 65,000 federal officials are able to make themselves unavailable at the end of the normal working day unless there are “exceptional” reasons for not doing so. There are also government plans to extend the right to private-sector employees despite the opposition of some business groups. Petra De Sutter, the Belgian minister for public administration, said the law was necessary to combat a culture of people feeling they should always be available. That perception is said to have been exacerbated by the necessity to work from home during the Covid pandemic, a situation that is likely to lead to permanent changes in people’s habits. In a recent survey on remote working more than four out of five (84%) Belgians, of which 40% held managerial positions, said they would like to continue to work from home for two or more days a week post-pandemic. Without the right to disconnect, said De Sutter, “the result will be stress and burnout and this is the real disease of today”. The federal government is also examining a proposal to move to a four-day week of 38 to 40 hours for full-time staff, meaning longer working days but a three-day weekend. Belgium has followed a trend set in Europe by Volkswagen in Germany, which decided in 2012 to ban certain employees from accessing emails after hours in order to avoid burnout. In France, the sense that a different work-life balance needed to be struck was turned into action in 2017, when organisations with more than 50 workers were required to start negotiations to define the rights of employees to ignore their company smartphones and laptops. Portugal went further last year by approving legislation under which employers with more than 10 staff can be liable to fines if they text message, phone or email workers who are off the clock. Companies must help pay for expenses incurred by remote working. However, the Portuguese parliament rejected a proposal to include a legal right to switch off work-related messages and devices outside office hours. Last November, the European parliament backed a resolution calling on the European Commission to draft an EU-wide law that would protect workers who wished to “disconnect”. Alex Agius Saliba, a Maltese MEP, who drove the vote, said: “We cannot abandon millions of European workers who are exhausted by the pressure to be always ‘on’ and overly long working hours. “Now is the moment to stand by their side and give them what they deserve: the right to disconnect. This is vital for our mental and physical health. It is time to update worker’s rights so that they correspond to the new realities of the digital age.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/belgian-civil-servants-given-legal-right-to-disconnect-from-work;business and economy
101;101;101;101;103;103;Norma Waterson obituary;2022-01-31;['Robin Denselow'];['Music', 'Culture', 'Folk music', 'Jazz', 'Mercury prize', 'Awards and prizes', 'Norma Waterson', 'Eliza Carthy'];"Norma Waterson, who has died aged 82, was one of the finest and most versatile singers of the British folk revival. She spent most of her life singing traditional songs, many from her native east Yorkshire, in two highly successful groups, the Watersons and Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by other members of her family. But her no-nonsense, soulful and unashamedly emotional approach was well-suited to a wide variety of other musical styles, as she displayed in the solo recordings and collaborations with Eliza Carthy, her daughter, that won her a following far beyond the folk scene. She was a hard-working, prolific artist who refused to stop recording or touring, and was singing as well in her 70s as she had in her 20s. Her final album, Anchor (2018), was the second that she had recorded with Eliza, and was a typically varied and experimental affair. It included Norma singing lead on a dramatic, jazz-edged treatment of the Tom Waits song Strange Weather and on a gently powerful version of Nick Lowe’s The Beast in Me. The duo’s award-winning debut album, Gift (2010), was followed by a tour, during which Norma fell seriously ill, suffering from heart problems. She recovered, and returned to her home in Robin Hood’s Bay, on the Yorkshire coast, cared for by her husband, the singer and guitarist Martin Carthy, and Eliza. Although she found it hard to travel, she wanted to continue singing, and performed at the local annual festival, Normafest, set up in her honour. Her last such appearance was in January 2018.
Norma was brought up in the port of Hull, Yorkshire, by her maternal grandmother, Eliza Ward, partly of Irish Gypsy descent, who ran a second-hand shop during the second world war. Norma’s parents, Florence and Charles, died when she was very young and she spent much of her childhood looking after her younger brother Mike and sister Elaine, better known as Lal. It was a time, Norma said, when “most people had a piano in the parlour. We didn’t have a telly but my grandma knew all the music hall songs and we listened to pop music on Radio Luxembourg”. The children sang together around the house, and formed a group, the Mariners, during the trad jazz and skiffle era of the 1950s. From American folk, they became increasingly interested in the English tradition. They started a folk club in a Hull pub, the Blue Bell, and changed their name to the Watersons. The group consisted of Norma, Mike and Lal, and their second cousin John Harrison, and they transformed the 60s folk revival in Britain partly because they dressed like any other fashion-conscious young musicians of the time (they were nicknamed the “folk Beatles”), but mostly because of their attacking, unaccompanied harmony treatment of ancient English songs. As Mike commented at the time “we’re earthy, like the Rolling Stones”. He and Norma handled most of the lead vocals, with Lal providing often highly adventurous harmonies – this was a group that followed no traditional rules. As Norma explained: “If you couldn’t find a note, you sang a harmony.” The Watersons’ first album, Frost and Fire (1965), was followed by The Watersons and A Yorkshire Garland. The group were widely praised but split up in 1968, exhausted from touring.
Norma’s first marriage (in 1958), to Eddie Anderson, had also ended, and now she spent time away from her brother and sister, moving to Montserrat in the West Indies, where she worked as a DJ. When she returned in 1972, she married Carthy, who joined the reformed Watersons, taking the place of Harrison. The new line-up recorded three albums, For Pence and Spicy Ale (1975), Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy (1977) and Green Fields (1981). In 1977 Norma also recorded the album A True Hearted Girl with Lal. In 1976, all three siblings and their families moved to Kirk Moor, a group of isolated farming cottages on the edge of the North York Moors. It is an exquisite, remote location, reached down a narrow lane that can be snowbound in winter, and was known to local villagers as “the hippy commune”. The arrangement ended in the late 80s when Norma and Lal and their families moved to Robin Hood’s Bay. Lal left the Watersons in 1990, but Norma kept working in a new group, Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by her husband and daughter. This group differed from the Watersons because it made use of instrumental backing, with Martin Carthy demonstrating his celebrated guitar work and Eliza playing the fiddle. Waterson:Carthy recorded six albums, first as a trio (on Waterson:Carthy, 1994 and Common Tongue, 1997), then with Saul Rose joining them on melodeon (Broken Ground, 1999), and later with Tim van Eyken taking his place (A Dark Light, 2002, Fishes and Fine Yellow Sand, 2004 and Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man, 2006). They concentrated on English traditional songs, but also included material from the Bahamas, the US, or a song by Mike. Norma was also part of the occasional folk harmony “super-group” Blue Murder. On their 2002 album, No One Stands Alone, she was joined by Martin and Eliza, Mike and the vocal trio Barry Coope, Jim Boyes and Lester Simpson, for a set that included a rousing treatment of Mike’s Rubber Band.
Norma was one of the finest exponents of English traditional songs, but displayed her love of other styles in her eclectic and soulful solo albums. Norma Waterson (1996) included songs by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson and Lal, as well as the self-composed Hard Times Heart. The album was nominated for a Mercury prize, an award usually associated with pop and rock rather than folk, and very nearly won – the prize went instead to Pulp’s Different Class. Three years later, she expanded her range with The Very Thought of You, which included an emotional (but never sentimental) reworking of Over the Rainbow, and Love of My Life, by Freddie Mercury – along with the first recording of Lal’s angry Reply to Joe Haines, written after Harold Wilson’s former press secretary had written what Lal thought to be a deeply offensive article about Mercury’s death from Aids. In 2000, Norma recorded her first solo album of traditional songs, Bright Shiny Morning. With the album Gift, and the subsequent tour, she brought all these different musical influences together. She had suffered from a series of health problems, and had difficulty in walking, but was still in magnificent voice and handled the majority of the solos during the tour. At the BBC folk awards in 2011, Gift was named album of the year, and the song Poor Wayfaring Stranger, taken from the album, best traditional track. In 2016 she received a BBC folk awards lifetime achievement award. She was made MBE in 2002. Her last London concert, at which she appeared alongside Eliza at the Union Chapel, in 2010, was recorded and released as The Gift Band – Live on Tour album. It provided a triumphant and suitably emotional summary of her career. She told her audience that “it’s hard to stick to just one kind of music”, before joining her daughter for a set that included folk songs, contemporary songs by Thompson, the slow and emotional Dreaming, written for her by Loudon Wainwright, along with the gloriously tuneful Bunch of Thyme, a song about mortality, and songs she had learned in her childhood. Between songs, she chatted to the audience in the same easy-going and humorous way that she chatted to those who visited her home. Lal died in 1998; and Mike in 2011. Norma is survived by Martin and Eliza; and by Tim, her son from her first marriage. • Norma Christine Waterson, singer, born 15 August 1939; died 30 January 2022";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/norma-waterson-obituary;entertainment and culture
110;110;110;110;112;112;David de Peyer obituary;2022-01-31;['N/A'];['Cancer research', 'Civil service'];My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/31/david-de-peyer-obituary;health
138;138;138;138;140;140;Bootleggers, bondage and law-breaking bashes! The scandalous history of the wild party;2022-01-31;['Jonathan Jones'];['Culture', 'Celebrity', 'Life and style', 'F Scott Fitzgerald', 'Books', 'The Rolling Stones', 'Kate Moss', 'Fashion', 'Music', 'Cocktails', 'Freddie Mercury', 'Silvio Berlusconi', 'World news', 'Alcohol'];"For more than a month now, the press has been full of stories of “illegal” parties in Downing Street. The government, we are told, has almost ground to a halt because of the scandal. Given the coverage, one might easily get the impression that the law-breaking bash is a recent invention, something that could only happen in lockdown, driven by privilege and an unhealthy sense of entitlement. Yet the modern party began life as a crime just over a century ago, when the Volstead Act banned the production and sale of alcohol in the US. As the New York Times explained in 1920: You cannot carry a hip flask. You cannot give away or receive a bottle of liquor as a gift. You cannot take liquor to hotels or restaurants and drink it in the public dining rooms. You cannot buy or sell formulas or recipes for homemade liquors. You cannot … It was not technically illegal to drink at home – but procuring the booze for a party meant breaking the law. Not that that stopped everyone. The first “cocktail parties”, claimed the hard-drinking writer F Scott Fitzgerald, who was at most of them, were held in 1921. By the following year the New York Times was complaining that the once-innocent word “party” now meant, by definition, an “inebriate” bash. Fitzgerald found the whole thing so intoxicating that he wrote one of the century’s defining novels, The Great Gatsby, about a bootlegger famous for his decadent parties and limitless cocktails. Prohibition was America’s first culture war, imposing the conservative morality of teetotal small towns on cities vilified as warrens of drunken immigrants – Italians with their wine, Irish with their whiskey, Germans with their beer. Revisionist historians claim it was a success, reducing illness and crime. But that’s a narrow view of an extreme attempt to remake modern life. Prohibition changed behaviour all right – for it put wild parties at the centre of modern culture. Cocktails, the classic lubricant of the 1920s party, may have helped hide the awful taste of bootleg spirits. Or perhaps they just got you drunk faster. Either way, the rise of cocktail parties redefined what a party was. Soon this cocktail scene had spread to Europe. Even though drinking was legal in the UK, the aristocratic Bright Young Things in 1920s England managed to give their parties a spectacular excess that outraged and entertained the onlooking, purportedly sober and dull, masses. When police deferentially but firmly tried to end a party at St George’s Baths, London, in 1928, the Bright Young guests, all boozing in their bathing costumes, tried to get the bobbies to join them in the pool. Another novelist, Evelyn Waugh, evoked the permanent drunkenness of the decade in Vile Bodies’ nauseous opening on a wave-tossed ship in the Channel: “Oh,” said the Bright Young People. “Oh, oh, oh.” “It’s just exactly like being inside a cocktail shaker,” said Miles Malpractice. Yet those who really wanted to party hard in the 20s and early 30s headed for Weimar Berlin or surrealist Paris, where the norms of the time were more profoundly defied. Brassaï’s 1931 photograph Gay Ball at Magic City is sometimes mistaken for an image of Weimar decadence but actually shows men in everything from full drag to black tie dancing at a decaying Paris amusement park that found a new lease of life as a gay party venue. Brassaï was delighted by its “immense, warm, impulsive fraternity”.
The Weimar republic’s endless uneasy party is preserved in paintings such as Max Beckmann’s Die Nacht – a true party from hell, with bondage, in a room that’s drunkenly shrinking – and Otto Dix’s depictions of sailors, sex workers and jazz bands. It was crushed in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. But – in modern mythology at least – they kept the decadence going. The image of Nazis cavorting in wild romps was paradoxically created by Hitler’s own propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels. After Hitler had the leaders of the SA, the party’s streetfighting wing, massacred in 1934, it was said at least one of the leaders was caught in bed with another man in a Bavarian hotel. Goebbels whipped this up into a denunciation of the SA as “asocial” Weimar types.
But did the Nazis actually party hard? A Soviet war correspondent, Konstantin Simonov, told how when the Red Army entered Berlin in 1945 he found the wreckage of a final fascist feast. Some German officers and their girlfriends had sealed themselves in a bunker with as much champagne as they could find for a blowout worthy of the dying gods. A half-century later, artist Mat Collishaw restaged this debauched scene in a series of pictures called Burnt Almonds, portraying a “desperate last party of champagne, sex and cynanide”. Yet the artifice of his photographs acknowledges that an obscene party involving Nazi officers and sex workers mixes history with our fantasies of what evil looks like. The liberation of Paris in 1944 was welcomed with a much nicer orgy – a spontaneous bacchanal of drinking and sex took over the city. From there it was just a short hop to the postwar party era, where decadence was no longer the privilege of Bright Young Things but available to everyone in an age of consumer democracy and pop culture. Rock’n’roll generated parties to make Fitzgerald blush – yet here again the real mayhem was laced with fiction. What Marianne Faithfull and Mick Jagger got up to in 1967 is one of those fantasies. Britain was blown away when an overheated press added its own lurid details to what was actually a quiet drug-taking party at Keith Richards’ house, Redlands. The civilised, if trippy, evening became a myth of excess when police raided (egged on by the News of the World) and were horrified by the “strong sweet smell of incense”. It did result in one of the greatest modern British artworks, when Richard Hamilton turned a photo of Jagger and art dealer Robert Fraser handcuffed in a police van into his acid-coloured masterpiece Swingeing London 67. Rock stars, not least the Stones themselves, would party much harder. Unfortunately, some of the most shocking stories about Led Zeppelin’s antics appear to be absolutely true. Witnesses have confirmed the story of the sublime hard rock band’s hotel room party in 1969 involving a freshly caught shark – the hotel was on a Pacific pier – and a young woman. It’s best told by Frank Zappa in his song The Mud Shark: “Say one night you checked into the Edgewater Inn motel with a 8mm movie camera, enough money to rent a [fishing] pole, and, just to make it more interesting, a succulent young lady with a taste for the bizarre …”
As they say on BBC iPlayer, these lyrics reflect the time in which they were written. So does the claim that people with dwarvism were paid to walk around Freddie Mercury’s party at the Fairmont hotel, New Orleans, in 1978 with plates of cocaine strapped to their heads. That seems to be folklore, but some of the many stories about this party must be true, such as that naked models wrestled in a pit filled with raw liver. One party this century that competed with it, and even had Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood in attendance among the much younger artists and fashion stars, was Kate Moss’s 30th in 2004. It reputedly climaxed with some of the guests taking part in an orgy at Claridge’s. With true erudition in party history, Moss called it The Beautiful and the Damned, after Fitzgerald’s second novel. Don’t stop me now … Compared with the sins of the rock patriarchs, the parties that got Britain’s authorities outraged in the late 1980s and early 90s were joyous and harmless. That didn’t stop the Criminal Justice Act 1994 using some unintentionally comic language to try to specify exactly what was so wrong with a rave. Section 63 on “powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave” defines one as “a gathering on land in the open air of 20 or more persons (whether or not trespassers) at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and … by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality”. It carefully explains that “for this purpose … ‘music’ includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. Music characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats once again pumped out illegally in 2020 at lockdown raves in warehouses left empty by the pandemic. Participants who were caught were, of course, fined without any need for a Cabinet Office inquiry to establish if they were at a rave or just a noisy, sweaty work meeting.
Even before the pandemic so severely narrowed the field of social interaction for law-abiding citizens, the politics of wild parties was changing. Values are different. Many of the rock world’s legendary antics now look like abuse and elicit not amusement but revulsion. And there’s another kind of party that shocks: the depraved secret gatherings that rulers and the rich enjoy, or are imagined to enjoy. Here again fictional outrages abound, ever since Marie Antoinette went to the guillotine for imaginary crimes including depravity and keeping wine under her bed to bribe the Swiss Guards. But former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s “bunga bunga parties” appear to have been real. According to young women who were there, the politician and media magnate’s private gatherings started as dinner parties and ended with women having to strip and pole dance until Berlusconi chose his partner for the night. One account describes him starting the entertainment by producing a statuette with an enormous penis, which the women had to lick. A pole dancing room also features in recently released photographs of what is claimed to be Vladimir Putin’s new secret palace. If excess is always enlivened by a hint of the criminal, the definition of wildness will change with the laws. It’s a long way from The Great Gatsby’s Prohibition shindigs where flappers and stockbrokers danced in the moonlight, to Boris Johnson and the staff of 10 Downing Street getting in the Tesco rosé and M&S snacks. The scandal is in proportion to the limits imposed by lockdown on everyone else, of course. At the No 10 double party on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral someone, it seems, drunkenly sat on a child’s swing and broke it. It’s a detail in its pathos worthy of Fitzgerald.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/bootleggers-bondage-and-law-breaking-bashes-the-scandalous-history-of-the-wild-party;entertainment and culture
142;142;142;142;144;144;The Winston Machine review – the joys and dangers of dreaming about the past;2022-01-31;['Miriam Gillinson'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Second world war', 'Culture'];"The Winston Machine is a typically probing and playful work from Kandinsky theatre, shot through with music and mischief. It’s about a young woman called Becky who dreams of the 1940s and the dashing wartime romance between her grandparents, while planning to buy a house in a town she does not like, with a boyfriend she does not love. It’s a rich production, which dances nimbly across the decades and explores how our links with the past can be a joyful and enriching thing – but painful, misleading and crushingly claustrophobic, too. Directed with head-rushing freedom by James Yeatman and with deft dramaturgy from Lauren Mooney, this show is also about communication. And noise. The scenes in the present are full of clamour: a cacophony of constant distraction. Becky’s boyfriend tries to get her to look at their house listing on the internet but, in one continuous line of speech (which Hamish MacDougall delivers with such skill and humour), he also vocalises everything else that Becky is looking at on her laptop screen: Instagram feeds, Facebook likes and, of course, pictures of cats.
The present might be closest to us, suggests Kandinsky, but with all that scrolling and clicking it can also feel very far away. What are the feelings and experiences, then, that help to keep us grounded? Music. Definitely music. Becky (Rachel-Leah Hosker) is a singer and the way she most easily accesses the past is through song. Vera Lynn. Summertime. Songs rise up through the cracks between the past and present and – with Hosker’s deep and beautifully centred voice – hold everything still. Nathaniel Christian, in a strikingly mature professional stage debut, plays the romance in Becky’s life. He is her pilot grandfather and he is also Lewis, an old friend and successful musician recently returned home from London. Christian spends a lot of time wearing a blue RAF jacket. The picture of a hero. But as the scenes fracture and deepen, that heroic image blurs. Becky’s grandfather wasn’t always a good person. Lewis’s career has barely even begun. It’s all just a matter of perspective. The Winston Machine is at New Diorama theatre, London, until 19 February.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/the-winston-machine-review-new-diorama-theatre-london;entertainment and culture
147;147;147;147;149;149;America Over the Water by Shirley Collins review – a vivid tale of ballads, gunfire and rattlesnakes;2022-01-31;['Neil Spencer'];['Music books', 'Books', 'Shirley Collins', 'Culture', 'Folk music', 'Music'];"In 1959, transatlantic travel was still a niche privilege, not least for a young, single, working-class woman. Shirley Collins owed her ticket to New York on the SS United States to her romance with the American folklorist Alan Lomax, whom she had met in London a couple of years previously. She was an ambitious 21-year-old folk singer from Sussex, he a celebrated song collector and musician 20 years her senior. Lomax had been in Europe for several years, effectively in exile from the anti-communist witch-hunt that had blacklisted musicians such as Pete Seeger, alongside Hollywood stars including Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin. Even when collecting Spanish folk songs, Lomax had found himself shadowed by “the black crows” of Franco’s guardia. After returning to the US, Lomax invited Collins to join him on a song-hunting trip through the deep south, a journey memorably recounted in this memoir – reissued after 15 years out of print, albeit without the atmospheric photographs of the first edition. It offers a vivid and sometimes shocking portrait of a country yet to confront the civil rights era. The couple’s encounters ranged from pentecostal choirs (both black and white) and hellfire preachers to blind fiddlers and mountain ballad singers, some of them familiar to Lomax from a previous trip with his father. For Collins, this was a new world of epic landscapes, rattlesnakes, racism and nocturnal gunfire. St Leonards-on-Sea it wasn’t.
In Arkansas the pair recorded singer Almeda Riddle, who delivered a poignant version of The Merry Golden Tree, a British naval ballad from “the ocean she’d never seen in her life”. In search of the Memphis Jug Band, who had been a popular outfit in the 1920s and 30s, they found a scene of quarrelling musicians and whiskey-soaked squalor. In Mississippi they met (and “discovered”) 57-year-old Fred McDowell, who arrived in dungarees after a day in the cotton fields before proving himself a formidable blues guitarist, one who went on to enjoy professional glory. Also in Mississippi was the notorious Parchman Farm penitentiary, in whose fields Lomax recorded prisoners hollering work songs as they toiled, while Collins endured the unwanted attention of a guard. Decades later, one tune, Po’ Lazarus, would appear on the bestselling soundtrack of the Coen brothers’ southern jaunt O Brother, Where Art Thou?, leading Lomax’s daughter, Anna, to track down the lead singer, James Carter, by then 76 and living in Chicago, so that she could present him with a cheque for $20,000. Interspersed with Collins’s account of this “southern journey” (though New York, Chicago, California and the Newport festival also feature) are chapters describing her upbringing in Hastings. The Collins family were poor but resilient, and on her mother’s side arty and politically active, with uncles who were painters and writers. It was a warm, extended family whose lives were full of singing. Her father was a milkman for a local farmer until conscription took him into the army. He survived the second world war but his marriage did not. Collins and her big sister, Dolly (who would become a composer and accompanist to Collins), had much of their childhood claimed by wartime. Twice evacuated, they returned to Hastings to watch dogfights above the Channel and shelter beneath the stairs from deadly “doodlebugs” (V1 rockets). As postwar teenagers their screen idol was Laurence Olivier (the pair learned chunks of Hamlet to imitate him), their favourite singers Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, listened to on the radio while their mother was at work – as a communist she thought American pop was a corrupting influence (a view extant in some folk circles). The alternating chapters make for a jarring chronology but provide some striking contrasts. Food is a constant subtext, austerity-era Britain with its powdered eggs and watery trifles and a new world of steak, chicken, exotic produce (avocados!) and, in New York, pizza.
At 18, Collins left home for London and the nascent folk revival, which is all too briefly described here, along with a capsule account of her later career, her ascent to doyenne of the folk scene, the loss of her singing voice and its recent, happy return, episodes explored more fully in her 2018 memoir All in the Downs, which followed her return to music making with 2016’s Lodestar album and her rediscovery by a new audience. Collins’s affair with Lomax didn’t endure (though in 1960 he came to England and proposed), but their mutual affection remained. Her American adventure receded into memory, but her experience reinforced her resolve to become “an English singer of English songs”, a description that applies to this day. • America Over the Water by Shirley Collins is published by White Rabbit (£14.99).

148;148;148;148;150;150;Throwing muses: the Black female artists who create with clay;2022-01-31;['Skye Sherwin'];['Art', 'Ceramics', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Life and style'];"When Ladi Kwali met the British studio potter Michael Cardew in the early 1950s, her traditional hand-built water jars were already well known in Nigeria’s Gwari region. Having spotted her work in the Emir of Abuja’s home, Cardew swiftly invited her to join his local government-backed pottery training centre. There she added modern industry’s wheel and kiln to her toolkit to create thrown tableware, and became a star turn within the touring demonstrations Cardew organised in Europe and America.
She was a phenomenal figure, “taking two cultures in her stride”, explains Jareh Das, the Nigerian-British curator of Body Vessel Clay, the forthcoming exhibition teasing out lineages between Black female artists across three generations. Kwali provides the show’s baseline, yet her place in ceramics history is far from straightforward. Also in the exhibition is Bisila Noha, a ceramics artist whose work in Body Vessel Clay looks to pottery’s unsung African mothers. For her, UK museum collections only tend to include Kwali “because of the connection with a white British man, rather than elevating her pieces in themselves”. Das wants the exhibition to bring Kwali out of western patriarchy’s shadow, “to individualise her and where she’s coming from, the stories the pots tell us about her life and culture”. To do so, she draws attention not to Cardew, the British incomer, but to the matrilineal teaching crucial to global pottery traditions. Kwali learned her skills from her aunt and went on to train others, such as Magdalene Odundo, the lauded Kenyan-born British artist known for her swan-necked, swollen-bellied pots. Although they didn’t share a spoken language, Odundo has recalled how she learned from Kwali as a baby might – through touch, not words. “Craft is a language in itself that is universal,” says Noha, who has studied with female potters in Mexico and Morocco. “We can all come together through it, regardless of our background.”
At the same time, the exhibition is a reminder that clay can be as edgy and political as it is timeless. Of the younger artists, Phoebe Collings-James’s ceramic torso with body piercings and scarred skin conjures sweaty club nights, Roman armour, tribal markings and war wounds. “I wanted them to be charged with a queered eroticism,” she says. Shawanda Corbett, an artist born with one arm and without legs, creates motley-glazed pots fashioned from tilting spheres. They invite us to imagine what it’s like to inhabit different vessels, different bodies. Jade Montserrat, meanwhile, explores the raw material in its most natural state. In a mud pit on a shooting estate in her home county of Yorkshire, she massages clay over her skin and hair, a Black woman “unearthing and building identity”, she says, as well as raising questions around land, belonging and ownership. It offers a radical conclusion to an exhibition that begins with traditional indigenous pottery. Montserrat’s interest in clay could be the show’s guiding principle. “It’s about making the circuits of energy evident,” she reflects. “It’s about potential.” Clay for today: five highlights from the exhibition Ladi Kwali (main picture) The Nigerian potter Ladi Kwali garnered international renown for her fusion of traditional Gwari forms and modern pottery techniques. “Her work went from functional domestic jars into works of art through glazing and the introduction of new technology,” explains curator Jareh Das.
Jade Montserrat In this performance for video, Yorkshire artist Jade Montserrat covers her naked body with clay. It was filmed on a shooting estate where she grew up and “explores Black presence in northern England”.
Magdalene Odundo This acclaimed Kenyan-born British ceramicist studied at the pottery training centre with Ladi Kwali in the early 1970s. “She started making pots in that Gwari style and learned how to hand build,” explains curator Jareh Das. “The experience also influenced her looking closely at pottery traditions in other parts of Africa and the world.”
Bisila Noha The Spanish-Equatorial Guinean ceramicist Bisila Noha first created her bi-part vessels to portray her sense of being “in between countries, culture and heritage”. When she discovered an African potter, Kouame Kakaha, had used similar forms, it inspired her ongoing research project into “the unnamed women of clay; our shared mothers and grandmothers”.
Phoebe Collings-James While making her ceramic torsos, Phoebe Collings-James says that “Makonde and Yoruba ceremonial body masks featuring pregnant bodies and Roman armour with door knocker nipple rings were all recent memories”. Her interests include “our clumsy signifiers of race, class, sexuality and genders, and how awkwardly or disobediently we may wear them”. • This article was amended on 10 February 2022 to remove the word “near” from a line saying that Jade Montserrat’s performance “was filmed on a shooting estate near where she grew up”.

149;149;149;149;151;151;Everyone is a loser in the messy saga of Ousmane Dembélé and Barcelona;2022-01-31;['Sid Lowe'];['Barcelona', 'Sport', 'Football', 'La Liga'];"“We have to stop this right now,” Xavi Hernández said. The day he took over as Barcelona manager Xavi had insisted that “in his right position, worked on well, Ousmane Dembélé could be the best in the world” and that extending the Frenchman’s contract was a “priority”. Sitting alongside him, a little giddy at the opening of a new era, was Joan Laporta. The Barça president, who had declared Dembélé “better than [Kylian] Mbappé” a week earlier, flashed a knowing smile. “Understood,” he said, and everybody laughed. More than two months later, no progress has been made. Months of negotiations achieved nothing except mutual accusations. Dembélé could already talk to other clubs and although Xavi had wanted him to stay, there was no deal, the gap between offer and demand too great. Barcelona concluded he didn’t really want to stay and that it was time to cut their losses. Xavi handed him an ultimatum: “renew your contract with us or go now.” Or, you know, don’t.
It is 12 days since the Barcelona manager told Dembélé to leave and 11 since he left him out of the squad, warning that he would not play again. It is also 11 days since the director of football, Mateu Alemany, concluded that Dembélé didn’t want to stay and should go. “Before 31 January,” Alemany said. That, you might have noticed, is on Monday but Dembélé is still at Barcelona, if not on the pitch, the central figure in both this window and the club’s immediate future. Unless talks with Paris Saint-Germain that started on Sunday reach a positive conclusion, deadline day will almost certainly end with Dembélé at the club. The day after delivering his ultimatum, Xavi followed through on the threat, guided more by the club than his own inclinations, and left Dembélé out – a decision repeated four days later. That morning, Alemany made the club’s position public: Dembélé “is not committed to our future” and must leave. Instead, Dembélé released a statement expressing his determination to resist and revealing he felt mistreated. The players’ union warned that leaving a footballer in the stands in a bid to force a new deal was “illegal”. After “four years” of “endlessly reading things” without defending himself, of “gossip” and “shameful lies…aimed only at hurting me”, Dembélé had had enough. He wouldn’t accept people talking for him or agent Moussa Sissoko, or questioning his commitment. And he certainly wasn’t going to be forced into any decision. “I am not a man who cheats and still less a man in the habit of giving in to blackmail,” he warned. “From today, it’s over.”
His time at Barcelona is over too. If the statement theoretically left a door open by insisting that, contrary to what the club said, “there are negotiations”, words like blackmail are not easy to retreat from. The question is when it ends and how. The deadline the club set – midnight on Monday – is one they cannot enforce. Xavi had known that: “Dembélé is the one holding the frying pan by the handle.” That weekend Dembélé didn’t turn up to training, claiming gastroenteritis – the exact reason Xavi once said was the footballer’s go-to excuse. There have been talks between Sissoko and Xavi which hinted at a rapprochement. There has been public theatre too, a certain silliness to it all, not least when Sissoko’s phone rang as he passed TV cameras which caught “Leonardo, PSG” on his screen. Towards the end of his statement, Dembélé declared: “Surely love is a kind of blackmail”. The man who Lionel Messi had said “can’t speak” had not only spoken for the first time, but turned all philosophical on them. Exactly what he meant is unclear, which was oddly appropriate: a lot of this doesn’t make much sense. The club that wanted him to stay has told him to leave. The man who seemingly wants to leave, is determined to stay. The man who assured his manager he intended to continue, isn’t. The club’s decision not to play him hurts them more than the player. Dembélé has never been as important as he is right now, and that’s a strange kind of important. The blunt, uncomfortable, sad conclusion is that he has rarely been important at all; the absurdity of all this is that he doesn’t matter this much, or shouldn’t. Calling him better than Mbappé doesn’t help to convince him to accept a lower salary and when Laporta said it, mostly people just laughed. Dembélé could be the best player in the world, Xavi had said. Could be, not is. This is his fifth season. There have been glimpses of a superior talent but his presence has been fleeting, almost incidental. A transfer fee of €140m, 12 injuries, a third of league games started, 31 goals. Choose a standout moment, and many fans would recall that miss against Liverpool.
There is a cruelty in players like Dembélé standing accused of suffering more injuries than anyone else. But the truth is he never really felt part of things at Barcelona. This year he might have done. He had affection, a manager keen to work with him, and departures made him the differential talent. He had a team that actually needed him. A club that needed him, too – even if it was to leave. And that’s the key. Trapped by his salary and his potential, Dembélé is simultaneously a symbol of the crisis that engulfs Barcelona and their potential way out of it, a problem inherited from their past and a hope for their future, Dembélé has become the player who conditions everything. This is all of their futures, not just his. An agreement on a contract extension would have secured a player the coach called “fundamental” and spread his salary and amortisations over a longer period to allow for other players to arrive too. It didn’t happen, so they gave up on that and tried to make him go, seeking a sale or at least a saving that would permit short-term manoeuvrability, signings lined up in anticipation.
But Dembélé won’t be “blackmailed” into staying or going and now here they are, one day left, still waiting on him. It is a familiar feeling, going back five years now but at least it is coming to a finish. The best-case scenario sees them secure a last-minute exit. If not, he stays and waits until the summer, disappearing from the field, a forgotten man once again. Unless they change their minds once the window actually closes, backing down from a threat no longer of any value and choosing to use an asset they could do with, Ousmane Dembélé will never play for them again, his total stopped at 129 often forgettable games. Instead, he will sit there, alone, watching them play without him, his Barcelona career sadly ending much the way it went.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/everyone-a-loser-messy-saga-ousmane-dembele-barcelona;sports
190;190;190;190;193;193;‘I had the perfect life – then both my husbands died’: singer Labi Siffre on love, loss – and happiness;2022-01-31;['Tim Jonze'];['Soul', 'Music', 'Culture', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'World news'];"Before meeting Labi Siffre, I am intrigued by the varied reactions I get when mentioning his name. Many people I speak to have never heard of him. Some remember his 80s anthem Something Inside So Strong. Others are dimly aware of a solo career before that. And then there are those whose eyes light up – those who, like me, regard him as one of the key figures in British pop history, and wonder why he’s not celebrated as such. “Labi Siffre’s fingerprints have been on popular music for many decades now,” wrote the electronic musician Matthew Herbert in 2012. “But his actual voice is rarely heard.” Why is that? During the first half of the 1970s, Siffre released six solo albums, operating effortlessly across folk, soul, reggae and funk, while poetically addressing the political (his songs have tackled war veterans, homelessness and religion) and the personal (if there is a more perfect articulation of domestic bliss than his 75-second song Till Forever, I have yet to hear it). It’s not like his career went under the radar – Siffre scored three Top 40 hits, with Crying Laughing Loving Lying reaching No 11. And it’s not like he’s had no cultural impact since: Madness did the definitive cover of his song It Must Be Love, while artists including Kanye West, Jay-Z and Primal Scream have sampled his music. The inordinately catchy riff used on Eminem’s My Name Is was his. Rod Stewart and Kelis are among those who have recorded his music. Yet his name still registers lightly. Some of his songs don’t even have their lyrics available to view online. In the decade since I discovered Siffre’s 70s catalogue, I’ve read stories about how being an openly gay, black folk singer held him back, and how he was dropped for refusing to stay in the closet. Being wary of the press, Siffre tends to avoid interviews. So I was thrilled to be granted an audience at his home and studio in north-east Spain, via Zoom, so I could get the full story.
Bespectacled and looking remarkably youthful for a 76-year-old – Siffre could easily be mistaken for an academic rather than a musician – his words are chosen carefully, and his answers extend occasionally into emphatic monologues. But he has a poet’s way with language. “I was remarkably naive,” says Siffre when I ask what the music industry was like in the late 60s. “I went in believing that the music business would be run by – who else? – musicians. But you don’t blame a rattlesnake for biting you. A rattlesnake is a rattlesnake, and you’re stupid to wander around in sandals and no socks in a rattlesnake-infested area.” Born in 1945 to a Nigerian father and mixed-race mother who refused to “pass” as white, Claudius Afolabi Siffre was raised in west London. He says he had already worked out his life plans at an early age. By 11 he knew he had to “find someone and make them love me for the rest of our lives”; by 13 he had resolved, thanks to one of his four brothers’ impressive record collection, to become a musician. Both of these things were under way before he was 20. Siffre wrote his first song aged 18 and, a year later in 1964, met Peter John Carver Lloyd; they remained together for 48 years, entering a civil partnership in 2005, until Lloyd’s death in 2013. After playing jazz guitar for several years, Siffre brought his self-titled debut album out in 1970. By his third album – Crying Laughing Loving Lying – Siffre’s lyrics were no longer written as if for the opposite sex. “It occurred to me that I couldn’t do that any more,” he says. His songs are not soapboxes. Yet often they express romantic contentment in such a simple and relatable way – shared jumpers, waiting for telephone calls – that just having a black, gay singer perform them must have felt like a political statement. “The most important thing in your life is what happens at home,” says Siffre. “Many people don’t understand this. It is head and shoulders above everything else. And from the moment Peter and I met, I never took [that love] for granted.” Siffre found the music industry stifling. He trusted his management, but he says their attitude was often: “Can you bring me something that I’ve already heard, that has already been a hit?” Unsurprisingly, that meant a muted reaction to the album he’s most proud of, For the Children, which tackled mankind’s predilection for self-destruction. “My manager at the time said: ‘Every word on the album is true, but people don’t want to hear that.’ I thought to myself, I should leave these people – they don’t understand what I’m doing. But I knew I could trust them, so I stayed. And they did at least try and understand what I was doing, they did make an effort. Because I’m not easy … I’m not easy, even for myself!” Songs on that album such as Prayer and Let’s Pretend had a strident atheist message. Was it brave to question religion at that time? “I don’t think I was being brave at all,” he says. “I’m not a brave person. Pissed off? Yes! I’ve never taken kindly to being bullied.”
Listening to For the Children again in recent years, Siffre says he cried, not just for himself but also for humanity. “It occurred to me: ‘I wish I hadn’t been right’,” he says. The album was not a commercial success, but Siffre says it’s nonsense that he was dropped because of his sexuality. “Nobody would have dared say that to me.” It is perhaps surprising that Siffre was so comfortable being out. His father was “born in 1900, an upper-middle-class Nigerian man with patriarchal views. He’d warned me about homosexuals in graphic terms when I was 12 and I remember thinking: ‘You’re eight years too late!’” But then Siffre introduced Lloyd to his family. “And it was my father who just accepted it without a blink. There’s this rubbish about homosexuality being un-African. Bullshit!” Siffre’s prolific spell ended with 1975’s Happy. But there was to be a renaissance. Siffre remembers the night in 1984 he left a pub and headed to his music room. He had recently watched a documentary on apartheid in South Africa, where white soldiers fired at black civilians, but the song he was about to write had a more personal meaning too. “I sat down, played a C chord, threw my head back and sang the first two lines of Something Inside So Strong. I realised I was writing about my life as a gay man and I found myself crying.” That song reached No 4 in the charts when it was finally released in 1987, and was subsequently covered by Kenny Rogers (and, let’s not forget, Barry from EastEnders during the 2014 World Indoor Bowls Championship). It became an anti-apartheid anthem. Siffre performed it in Trafalgar Square for Nelson Mandela’s birthday – after being told that he was not the kind of artist who would “fit in” at the bigger Wembley concert. “My manager was outraged. Incandescent with rage. And I was on the sofa finding it hysterically funny. That didn’t surprise me at all.” There was also a 90s/00s revival for Siffre. He didn’t know much about sampling when Eminem’s people got in touch to request the riff from I Got The … (Beck had been planning to use it for his post-Odelay comeback single before Eminem beat him to it). At first he turned them down. “I got pissed off with the ‘faggots’ and ‘hoes’ [in Eminem’s lyrics]. Because it’s just lazy, cowardly writing. It wasn’t the language that bothered me. I pointed out that my first poetry collection was called Nigger. What I cared about was attacking the oppressed rather than the culprits. Now, some will say, in the context of that song, that’s not exactly what was happening. However, that was my first reaction to it.”
Siffre signed off on the sample when they sent him a censored “clean” version, not realising that he was also allowing its use on the alternative versions. But having grown up with modern jazz and the Great American Songbook, he is at least content with his songs being reinterpreted. “That’s what musicians are supposed to do,” he says. Besides, he was never in doubt of his music’s longevity. “I was brought up to have low self-esteem,” he says. “I grew up being told by society that as a homosexual I was a bad, wicked, evil person. However, at the same time, I’m someone who is very much aware of my own genius.” He bursts out laughing at this. “That’s a joke! It’s a joke! But by my first album I knew I was writing good-quality work. And when things have not been as popular as I thought they should have been, I always felt that, eventually, they would be recognised as a good song. Because a good song never dies.” Given his music’s lifespan, does he not feel that his artistic reputation should be stronger?
“I would say I’m not very good at selling myself,” he admits. “I grew up believing that real men, whatever real men are, don’t boast. Nowadays, everybody boasts. People will actually come up to you and tell you that they’re compassionate! But I don’t look at it like I was held back or that I should have been a superstar. Although it’s difficult for people to believe, being rich and famous never occurred to me in my plan. I realised by the time of my first album that I was not in the mainstream. So all I actually wanted was for my work to be useful. And For the Children made me realise that, well, the reason why you’re on the outside is because you’re actually trying to be useful.” Perhaps one reason Siffre seems content with his standing is that music always came second to the great love of his life, which is love itself: not just Peter but also a “third husband”, Rudolf “Ruud” Cornelis Arnoldus van Baardwijk, who joined the pair in the mid-90s. The three of them shared an idyllic-sounding life – for some time – in a house halfway up a mountain in south Wales. “I went looking for love,” he says. “But it was only when I met Ruud and we became three that I stopped looking entirely. For nearly 16 years the three of us lived together in a menage a trois. And I realised I’d made the family that I’d been trying to make for the whole of my life.”
He continues: “I had the perfect life. And then, in the space of two years, six months and 28 days, they both died.” The exactness of this number is striking. “I’ve always taken love very seriously,” he says softly. “Not just what it is, but how disastrous it would be to be without it.” Siffre spent a long time as Peter’s carer before he died. A stroke in 1998 had left him paralysed down the left side of his body. “I was a little annoyed to find that some people expected me to continue with my ‘brilliant’ career,” says Siffre. “I couldn’t understand how they could possibly think that that’s what I would do. Not out of any noble feelings. We had to be together. Simple as that. And that’s what it was for 14 years. Nothing noble about it at all.” To have two partners die in such a short space of time must have been a horrendous amount of grief to deal with, I say. He pauses. “That’s something I’m still …” Then he trails off. “That’s something that I’m still ... I don’t know what the word is.” Processing? “No, it’s not a matter of processing. Suffering from? I can only say it quite inadequately. Yes, it is very difficult.” I wonder if today’s world is better positioned to appreciate Labi Siffre, both as a masterly musician and a trailblazer for black and gay people. Last year, when Pride was cancelled due to the pandemic, he quietly released a reworked version of his song (Love Is Love Is Love) Why Isn’t Love Enough? An hour-long BBC documentary about his life is expected to air in early 2022 and there are even rumours of a new album too, although he’s a little coy about that. “I am working on … yes, a project … that’s true,” he smiles. It would be a splendid thing indeed if, in the future, more eyes would start to light up at the mention of this magnificent songwriter’s name. imagine … Labi Siffre: This Is My Song will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Monday 14 February, 10.35pm";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/i-had-the-perfect-life-then-both-my-husbands-died-singer-labi-siffre-on-love-loss-and-happiness;entertainment and culture
191;191;191;191;194;194;1,000 days between rape offence and case completion in UK, data shows;2022-01-31;['Jessica Murray'];['Rape and sexual assault', 'Crime', 'Law', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Emily Thornberry', 'Politics'];The typical delay between an offence of rape and the completion of the resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021 for the first time, figures have revealed. The Ministry of Justice said the median time between offence and completion in rape cases was 1,020 days, or over two and a half years, in the first nine months of 2021, up by more than a quarter from the previous year. The data, published in response to parliamentary questions from the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, also showed that 576 rape cases had been waiting for more than a year to come to court as of the end of September 2021, well over double the average of the previous five years. It come just days after Home Office data revealed sharp drops in prosecution and conviction rates for rape, with only 1.3% of cases now being prosecuted. Thornberry said the delays were “sickening and unacceptable”. “These figures show that waits of more than 1,000 days have become the norm for survivors of rape. Every day of delay puts trials at risk, threatening to rob survivors of the justice they deserve, and prolonging the trauma they are made to endure,” she said. “Any government with an ounce of compassion would set about fixing these record delays as a priority, not letting them grow worse by the year.” Extreme delays in a number of rape cases made the overall average delay even longer, with the mean time between offence and completion standing at 2,767 days in the first nine months of 2021 – more than seven and a half years – close to the record of 2,910 reached in 2019. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “Five years or more for a complainant to finally see a trial conclude is rapidly becoming the norm not the exception as these serious cases go to the back of a queue in a system starved of criminal barristers. “The painful irony for rape victims is last year half the number of rape complaints were prosecuted than seven years ago, but they took on average twice as long to conclude.” Criminal Bar Association analysis showed there were over 6,400 outstanding sexual offence trials as of 30 September 2021, a 125% rise in three years. “Rape trials are only going to get longer unless government puts the resources in place to ensure we have enough prosecutors and defenders to tackle the backlogs,” Sidhu said. In October, Boris Johnson said there were “delays taking place at every stage in the process” in cases such as rape and domestic violence, and cited complexities in gathering evidence as one of the reasons. Admitting that rape victims in Britain were being badly served, he promised to “stop at nothing to make sure we get more rapists behind bars”. Labour has said it would end delays by increasing the number of rape and serious sexual assault offence (Rasso) units in the Crown Prosecution Service and rolling out new Nightingale courts to guarantee an additional 33,000 sitting days. A government spokesperson said: “We are overhauling our entire response to rape and boosting funding for support services to £185m. We are also recruiting 20,000 police officers, introducing new justice scorecards and increasing court capacity so victims get the justice they deserve quicker.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/1000-days-between-offence-and-case-completion-in-uk-data-shows;politics
211;211;211;211;214;214;‘Brothers and sisters getting their groove on’: Melvin Van Peebles’ house-party musical ;2022-01-31;['Chris Wiegand'];['Theatre', 'Musicals', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Film', 'Broadway'];"When Melvin Van Peebles died last autumn, he was rightly remembered as a firebrand film-maker and the godfather of blaxploitation and independent cinema. His stage career as a theatre director, playwright, composer and lyricist is less well documented – mind you, so are his other lives as a novelist, painter and Wall Street trader. In 1971, in the wake of his explosively successful low-budget film Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, Van Peebles made his Broadway debut with a “ghetto-life” musical, Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death. He wrote its music, book and lyrics and the following year, ever the multi-hyphenate, he did the same for a second Broadway musical, Don’t Play Us Cheap. But this time he also produced and directed. The two shows ran concurrently in the summer of 1972, and that year he released a film version of Don’t Play Us Cheap starring the original Broadway cast. It’s now available in a Blu-ray Van Peebles box set from Criterion. Anyone who only knows Van Peebles for the brutal and bleak Sweetback may be surprised by the abundant warmth of Don’t Play Us Cheap, and also by its sheer goofiness. This is a musical with a prologue told by actors dressed up as a rat and a cockroach and a plot that finds two “devil bats” visiting Harlem and assuming human form to wreck a house party. But against this wacky backdrop, Van Peebles presents a close-knit circle of friends and family: “brothers and sisters getting their groove on” as the intro has it, which brings to mind how the opening sequence for Sweetback listed the main stars as “the black community”.
Sweetback’s tale of a hustler on the run was propelled by a jazz-funk score by Earth, Wind and Fire (released on Stax Records) and by Van Peebles’ own defiant musical refrain: “They bled your momma. They bled your poppa. Won’t bleed me.” Don’t Play Us Cheap has a stirring and more expansive mix of R&B, soul, jazz, doo-wop and blues. These songs are not used to move along plot or fill out characterisation in a traditional sense. Instead they collectively form a portrait of the time and place: a Saturday night in Harlem in the early 70s, where Earnestine (Rhetta Hughes) is celebrating her 20th birthday. Unlike musicals whose characters break seamlessly from book into song, Van Peebles has his characters directly discuss the tunes that form the soundtrack. We even see them selecting and spinning the records we hear – an act that invites us to listen more carefully to the lyrics. The film comes alive when Mrs Washington (played by Joshie Jo Armstead, a former Ikette turned soloist and songwriter) hears the opening bars to You Cut Up the Clothes in the Closet of My Dreams. “Ooh that’s it! That’s my song,” she declares, pouring herself a drink and rising from the sofa to deliver the ballad of heartbreak and recovery. Van Peebles gradually frames her in a tight close-up, the other house guests serving first as her audience and then as her chorus of backing singers. “I’m moving on” is a recurring line in that song and in the film itself, which is a hymn to endurance and going high, and celebrates a carefree night when you put the week’s work behind you, forget your worries and simply savour the next dish coming out of the kitchen. Van Peebles tells this tale of a circle of intergenerational family and friends through styles such as gospel and soul that are equally closely related. And the bonds of music are shown to be unbreakable: literally so when Joe Keyes Jr, as Trinity, sits on a pile of records but they don’t snap.
Trinity is one of the devil bats who flap into this party with the same tricksy visual effects such as distortion and superimposition that Van Peebles used in Sweetback. But Esther Rolle, as the matriarch Miss Maybell, is hardly freaked out to find Trinity – clad in black and red, with cape and jutting lapels – in her apartment. And in a hot minute Earnestine has fallen for him. If there’s little chemistry between Hughes and Keyes Jr, Rolle has loving wisdom to spare and Miss Maybell gives the film its heart. Earthly ills from jealousy and suspicion to snobbery and hypocrisy are denounced while she exudes a generosity of spirit. “Everybody falls sometimes,” she observes. “The trick is to get back up.” Despite the bats’ best efforts to ruin it, the spirit of the party – just like those records – is unbreakable. After the arrival of another suitor along with a second devil bat named David, there’s not much more plot to bother with. Van Peebles’ film has the disjointed feel of a real party – a carousel of distractions and interruptions, snippets of conversation and jokes. It’s punctuated with rollicking piano lines, call-and-response, hand claps and dance routines that are authentic rather than overly choreographed. But if the feel is largely celebratory, and the whole bat plot fantastical, the story is also grounded in social commentary and politics: our rat host asks “are you hip to injustice?” in the prologue, Miss Maybell reflects on the “lying and killing” in the world beyond her triple-locked front door, and on her wall are photos of Malcolm X and of Martin Luther King whose assassinations were still reverberating in early-70s America. The apartment is filled with photos of other African American icons such as Isaac Hayes, on the album cover of Black Moses, and Van Peebles himself, on the cover of his LP As Serious As a Heart-Attack. Don’t Play Us Cheap earned Van Peebles a Tony nomination for best book and also brought actor Avon Long a nomination for his performance as David. The show ran for 164 performances; Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death managed almost double that number. But it would be years until Van Peebles directed or wrote another major film or stage musical. None of his four theatre productions have had a Broadway revival although there are plans to bring back Ain’t Supposed to Die a Natural Death this year, with Van Peebles’ son Mario involved. But Don’t Play Us Cheap, even with the film’s dated visual effects and uneven comedy, is an irresistible soul-saver of a musical. It deserves its own 50th birthday party on stage.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/melvin-van-peebles-dont-play-us-cheap-lost-house-party-musical;entertainment and culture
220;220;220;220;223;223;Surging Canada beat flat USA to take huge step towards 2022 World Cup;2022-01-30;['Joe Callaghan'];['World Cup 2022 qualifiers', 'USA', 'Canada', 'Football', 'US sports', 'Sport'];"There can no longer be a shred of doubt — Canada have come in from the cold as one of the hottest teams in international football. John Herdman’s side, 2021’s most-improved international team, have begun 2022 by making more history as they seek their first men’s World Cup berth since 1986. On a frigid winter afternoon, they scratched their biggest itch and dismissed their noisy neighbours at a raucous Tim Hortons Field, signaling a continental power shift that feels anything but fleeting. Gregg Berhalter and the USA were fitful and frustrated as they found no answer to Cyle Larin’s ferocious seventh-minute strike before defender Sam Adekugbe delivered the dagger in injury time for a famous Canadian victory.
The US now approach Wednesday night’s meeting with Honduras in Minnesota with apprehension, knowing they need to pick things up. For Canada there is only elation. By Wednesday their ticket to Qatar 2022 could well be punched. “We knew we could change a football country forever,” Herdman said as the home fans drifted into the night, barely believing the breakneck momentum the country has built up. “That spirit you see, we all want to get to Qatar. I genuinely believe that these men know they have an opportunity to leave a proper football legacy moving forward.” These really are times without precedent for Canada. In the summer the women’s team won Olympic gold. Sunday marked the first competitive midwinter window on home soil since 1985. Herdman and Canada eschewed the option of playing indoors in Vancouver to keep things interesting outdoors, with logistics also a factor. Conditions weren’t as frigid as feared however, the mid-afternoon slot ensuring the mercury didn’t quite plummet as far as it had last November when Mexico were beaten on the night Edmonton became the Iceteca. Managing the compressed Concacaf schedule has been as challenging as any environmental issues. Herdman’s cycling of his squad has been particularly impressive, coaxing his players through nine unbeaten games before Sunday, when he was without Alphonso Davies. He tinkered again here making four changes to Berhalter’s three. It was one of Canada’s newcomers who set the tone, defender Kamal Miller leaving Christian Pulisic shuddering with a heavy foul four minutes in. The USA star’s abysmal delivery from the resultant free-kick hinted that Miller’s hit had indeed been felt.
Three minutes later, the visitors were really rattled. Matt Turner’s goal kick got caught in the breeze swirling in from Lake Ontario and barely made it to the halfway line. Miller’s header was flicked on by Jonathan Osorio and a neat but simple one-two between Larin and Jonathan David opened a chasm in the heart of the visitors’ defence. Larin lashed a shot across Turner and into the top corner and stood alone as his country’s record goalscorer. Canadian lungs emptied into the afternoon air. In an arena the locals call The Donut Box there was a bad joke to be made about the hole in the US defence but Berhalter was unlikely to find the humour in it. Slow starts have been a bugbear in this campaign for Berhalter, who had watched the US draw a first-half blank in seven of their nine games before Sunday. They’d make it eight here in spite of controlling much of the possession. Pulisic continually cut a frustrated figure as, behind him, Weston McKennie struggled to impose himself in the middle. Referee César Arturo Ramos was letting the game flow but the Americans could find little fluidity of their own: Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson were both blunted when they attempted to go forward. Steven Vitoria blocked bravely from Brenden Aaronson before the half hour. More set-piece opportunities came and went with Canada content to sit, soak and frustrate. Pulisic wasted a free-kick in a particularly dangerous position before finally, two minutes before the break, getting a corner right. His delivery was met with plenty of power by McKennie but Canada captain, Milan Borjan, back in his hometown, clawed it on to the bar and to safety and then bellowed into the crowd in delight. Berhalter once again had to scrabble to find answers at the interval. The manager’s matchday footwear won rave reviews on social media but Berhalter was in danger of wearing out his Air Jordans on the synthetic surface as he paced the technical area. It was a lot of the same early in the second half with Canada’s pace on the break looking more threatening than most of what the Americans could muster. When it opened up for Aaronson on the hour mark he snatched at the ball and shot straight at Borjan. Change finally came on 69 minutes when USA skipper Tyler Adams was forced off through injury and Berhalter used the break to bring in Kellyn Acosta, Ricardo Pepi and Jordan Morris. But still the best chances were Canadian. Turner spilled a David shot from range and Larin almost poked in his second. Evening’s shadow began creeping in and the cold came with it. When Adekugbe misjudged a cross on 79 minutes, there was a brief flick of light for the US but Pepi blazed wildly over.
The seconds ticked down and Adekugbe blocked heroically from substitute Paul Arriola who then flashed the ball acrobatically wide. Canada’s left-back somehow had the legs to break forward soon after and almost seal the win. The Americans were given five more minutes but mustered nothing. Instead it was Adekugbe who scorched clear and delivered the exclamation mark. Doubts? Not a single one. Canada have arrived. Berhalter, for his part, punctuated the post-match debate with a jarringly upbeat analysis. “The result hurts. The performance doesn’t hurt,” he insisted. “It was an entire team effort that was outstanding. We asked them to be dominant, we asked them to embrace the conditions, embrace the physicality ... I think we did that and it’s hard for me to remember a performance away from home this dominant without getting a result.” There were signs of dominance Sunday. In spite of Berhalter’s insistence, that dominance now looks to be coming from the north.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/canada-usa-world-cup-qualifier-match-report;sports
229;229;229;229;235;235;US Senate panel close to approving ‘mother of all sanctions’ against Russia;2022-01-30;['Richard Luscombe'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'US foreign policy', 'US national security', 'US military', 'Biden administration', 'US news', 'US politics', 'US Congress', 'US Senate', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Vladimir Putin', 'World news'];"The leaders of the Senate foreign relations committee said on Sunday they were on the verge of approving “the mother of all sanctions” against Vladimir Putin, warning there would be no appeasement as the Russian president contemplates an invasion of Ukraine.
“We cannot have a Munich moment again,” the panel’s Democratic chair, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, told CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the 1938 agreement by which allies ceded parts of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, believing it would stave off war. “Putin will not stop if he believes the west will not respond,” Menendez said. “We saw what he did in 2008 in Georgia, we saw what he did in 2014 in pursuit of Crimea. He will not stop.” Menendez said he believed bipartisan negotiations for severe sanctions were “on the one-yard line”, despite disagreements with Republicans over whether measures should be imposed before or after any Russian invasion. The UK government promised to ramp up sanctions against Putin and his associates. The negotiations come ahead of an expected UN security council meeting on Monday, at the request of the US, to give Russia the opportunity to explain its actions. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said: “We’re going to go into the council prepared to listen to Russia’s security concerns, but we’re not going to be distracted by their propaganda.” On Sunday, Kyiv urged Moscow to pull back its troops from Ukraine’s border and continue dialogue with the west if it was “serious” about de-escalating tensions that have soared amid fears of a Russian invasion. Canada moved its Ukraine-based military units westward on Sunday and announced the temporary withdrawal of all non-essential employees from its Kyiv embassy, citing ongoing Russian threats along the border. “We will continue to take all precautions necessary to keep our Canadian Armed Forces safe and secure,” said Canada’s defense minister, Anita Anand, at a press conference in Kyiv. Canada has 900 military members supporting the Nato mission in Ukraine via “land, air and sea”, she said. Meanwhile, Jens Stoltenberg, the head of Nato, said Europe needed to diversify its energy supplies, saying the situation “demonstrates the vulnerability of being too dependent on one supplier of natural gas”. Tensions on the Ukraine border have continued to escalate, with Reuters reporting the Russian military buildup included supplies of blood in anticipation of casualties. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told Fox News Sunday: “Putin has a lot of options available to him if he wants to further invade Ukraine, and he can execute some of those options imminently. It could happen really, honestly, at any time.” Seeking to show bipartisan resolve, Menendez gave CNN a joint interview with his committee’s ranking Republican, James Risch of Idaho. Menendez said: “There is an incredible bipartisan resolve for support of Ukraine, and an incredibly strong bipartisan resolve to have severe consequences for Russia if it invades, and in some cases for what it has already done. “We are building on the legislation that both Senator Risch wrote independently, and I wrote, which I called the mother of all sanctions. It’s to include a variety of elements, massive sanctions against the most significant Russian banks, crippling to their economy, Russia sovereign debt. These are sanctions beyond any that we have ever levied before.” Risch said talks had been a “24 hour-a-day effort for the last several days” in an attempt to reach agreement over sanctions timing and content, and that he was optimistic. “That’s a work in progress,” Risch said, when pressed over discussions about pre-emptive sanctions or measures to be taken in the event of an invasion. “[But] I’m more than cautiously optimistic that when we get back to DC tomorrow that we’re going to be moving forward.” Menendez said he believed western allies did not have to wait to start penalising Putin. “There are some sanctions that could take place up front because of what Russia has already done, cyber-attacks on Ukraine, false flag operations, the efforts to undermine the Ukrainian government internally,” he said. “But then the devastating sanctions that ultimately would crush Russia’s economy, and the continuing lethal aid that we are going to send, means Putin has to decide how many body bags of Russian sons are going to return to Russia. “The sanctions we’re talking about would come later on if he invades, some sanctions would come up front for what has been done already, but the lethal aid will travel no matter what.” Risch criticized the stance of several far-right figures, including the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie, who have questioned why the US is backing Ukraine and opposing Russia. Carlson said “it makes sense” that Putin “just wants to keep his western border secure” by opposing moves by Ukraine to join Nato. “We side always with countries that are democracies, and certainly there isn’t going to be a truce committed in that regard,” Risch said.
“But the people who were saying that we shouldn’t be engaged in this at all are going to be singing a very different tune when they go to fill up their car with gas, if indeed there is an invasion. There are going to be sanctions that are going to be crippling to Russia, it is going to cripple their oil production. And as we all know, Russia is simply a gas station that is thinly disguised masquerading as a country. It is going to have a devastating effect on the economy around the world.”
On NBC’s Meet the Press, Dick Durbin, co-chair of the Senate Ukraine caucus, addressed concerns aired by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday that growing rhetoric over the crisis was causing panic and destabilising his country’s economy. His comments followed a call with Joe Biden that Ukraine officials said “did not go well”. “Any decision about the future of Ukraine will be made by Ukraine,” said Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. “It won’t be made in Moscow or in Washington, in the European Union or in Belarus. It’s their future and their fate and their decision as far as that is concerned.” The caucus co-chair, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, who is also on the foreign relations committee, told NBC he believed Putin had underestimated the unity of Nato and others. “One thing Vladimir Putin has done successfully is he has strengthened the transatlantic alliance and countries around the world who are looking at this and saying, ‘We cannot let this stand, we cannot let this happen,’” Portman said. “For the first time in nearly 80 years we could have a major and very bloody conflict in Europe unless we stand up together and push back, and so far so good.” • This article was amended on 1 February 2022.

238;238;238;238;244;244;Up to 10,000 pupils in England missed whole autumn term last year, analysis finds;2022-01-30;['Richard Adams'];['Schools', 'School admissions', 'Children', 'Home schooling', 'Pupil behaviour', 'Education policy', 'England', 'UK news', 'Education'];"Up to 10,000 pupils missed an entire term of school last autumn, according to new analysis that estimates 128,000 children were withdrawn from state education in England in the year up to the January 2021 lockdown. The figures, based on data from schools collated by the education research group FFT Education Datalab, comes as the government wants new measures to boost attendance, while Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, has vowed to track down missing children. But FFT found that the number of children being taken off school rolls was no different from years prior to the pandemic, with most being home-schooled, moving to private schools or to other parts of the UK or overseas, soothing fears that the pandemic had caused a surge in children being permanently taken out of school.
FFT looked at attendance data from the rolls of more than 5,200 primary schools and 2,600 secondary schools – a third of the total state schools in England – and found that about 0.2% of children enrolled at the same school throughout last term did not attend a single session between September and the end of 2021. “These sorts of proportions would suggest something in the order of 10,000 pupils on the roll of schools who did not attend at all in the autumn term,” the analysis, by the FFT’s Dave Thompson, states. In total, 86,000 children who were on school rolls for at least a month in the autumn term were classed as “severely absent” after missing at least half of their time in school, including those absent because of illness. Those most likely to be counted as severely absent were pupils with special educational needs. Children with an educational health and care plan (EHCP) were many times more likely to have missed half of school in autumn compared with other pupils across all age groups. While politicians and de Souza have expressed alarm at the numbers of pupils withdrawn from school rolls during the pandemic, the data suggests that the overall numbers are similar to previous years. The FFT figures show that more than 128,000 children out of the nearly seven million of compulsory school age had been withdrawn from state school rolls in the year to January 2021 – slightly below the 129,000 withdrawn in the year to January 2020, before the start of the pandemic, and the same proportion as withdrew in the year to January 2019. Of the 128,000, 57,000 are estimated to now be home-educated, according to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, while a further 10,000 to 20,000 will have moved from the state sector to independent or private schools. The remaining 50,000 children may have rejoined schools in other parts of the UK, most likely Scotland or Wales, or moved overseas with their families. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said he wants to “end the postcode lottery of how attendance is managed in different schools and parts of the country”, with a new duty for schools to publish their plans to improve attendance. Schools are also being asked to join a new data collection trial that will share daily attendance status for each pupil with the Department for Education. The DfE also said it “remains committed to a registration system for children not in school” and plans to publish a formal response shortly.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/30/up-to-10000-pupils-in-england-missed-whole-autumn-term-last-year-analysis-finds;business and economy
239;239;239;239;245;245;Liverpool sign Luis Díaz for initial €40m and target Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho;2022-01-30;['Andy Hunter', 'Fabrizio Romano'];['Liverpool', 'Transfer window', 'Porto', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Juventus', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Jürgen Klopp said he “could not be happier” after Liverpool completed the signing of Luis Díaz from Porto in a deal that could rise to €60m (£49.9m). The club are also in talks with Fulham over the potential £5m purchase of the attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho. Díaz has signed a contract to 2027 and will wear the No 23 shirt for Klopp’s team. The Colombia international underwent a medical in Argentina, where he is preparing for a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday, Liverpool having sent medical staff after agreeing terms with Porto and the player on Thursday.
Díaz will cost an initial €40m with another €20m payable in add-ons. In total, that will make the 25-year-old the fourth most expensive signing in Liverpool’s history after Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and Naby Keïta. Klopp has been a long-time admirer of the gifted winger, who has scored 14 goals in 18 league games for Porto this season, and had planned to move for the player this summer. Once the Portuguese club accepted a similar deal from Tottenham, however, Liverpool brought forward their plans with outgoing sporting director Michael Edwards and his assistant, and eventual successor, Julian Ward securing the transfer. “I could not be happier that we’ve been able to get this deal done and bring Luis to Liverpool,” said Klopp. “We believe he has everything needed to fit into our way and adapt to the Premier League, both physically and mentally. He is a player who is hungry for success and knows you have to fight to get what you want. He is a fighter, no doubt. He’s a skilful team player who has always the goal in mind. This team deserved to add quality and when we played against Luis earlier this season, we saw what a danger he is, how fast he is and how his mentality was to help his team. “We know Porto is an outstanding club who nurture players in the best possible way and provide a brilliant football education. They are a class club and, I have to say, have been tough negotiators. I also must make clear my appreciation to our ownership and football operations team for how they have managed to act so decisively to get this done.”
Díaz still requires a work permit to enter the UK and is therefore unlikely to join up with his new club until the end of the week at the earliest. He scored 41 goals in 125 appearances for Porto in total and had also been of interest to Manchester United. Everton also tried to sign the winger last summer but were unable to agree a deal that included James Rodríguez returning to his former club. Carvalho, a 19-year-old England youth international born in Portugal, has been in outstanding form and is regarded by Liverpool as a player of huge potential. He is out of contract in the summer and Liverpool are seeing whether agreement can be reached on a deal that would see him remain at Fulham for the remainder of the season and move to Anfield in the summer. The failure to complete a deal for Díaz is the latest blow to Spurs, who also missed out on Adama Traoré to Barcelona, but they have deals in place to sign the midfielders Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Kulusevski is due to join on an 18-month loan with a mandatory purchase for about €40m, plus add-ons, if Antonio Conte’s side qualify for the Champions League and the Sweden international has made a specified number of appearances. Tottenham have agreed to pay a loan fee of about €5m for Kulusevski, and that amount would be subtracted from the total payable to make the deal permanent. The 21-year-old can play on the wing or as a No 10 and has been more in than out of the starting XI this season. He cost Juventus €35m from Atalanta in January 2020.
Spurs also had offer accepted for Bentancur which would guarantee Juventus €19m, with up to €6m in add-ons to follow. That comes days after Aston Villa had a similar offer for the Uruguay international rejected by the Italian club, who have Denis Zakaria lined up to join from Borussia Mönchengladbach as Bentancur’s replacement. The Tottenham managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, spent 11 years at Juventus. Paratici is also working to move players out. A deal to take Bryan Gil on loan to Valencia has been done and Paratici is also hopeful that solutions can be found for Tanguy Ndombele and Dele Alli. Lyon are in such advanced talks for Ndombele that the player flew to the French city on Sunday in anticipation of returning on loan to his former club with an option for a permanent transfer. Villarreal are interested in taking Giovani Lo Celso on loan and Ajax have not given up hope of signing Steven Bergwijn.
As Liverpool prepare to say hello to two players, they could be temporarily saying goodbye to another with 20-year-old defender Neco Williams wanted by Bournemouth on loan until the end of the season. The Wales international could be open to joining the Championship club as he looks to secure more regular football ahead of the World Cup later this year. Williams has featured for only 387 minutes across eight appearances for Liverpool who also have Northern Ireland international Conor Bradley to provide cover for Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/liverpool-luis-diaz-tottenham-kulusevski-bentancur-transfer-news;sports

The Swedish investment firm has built up holdings in Vodafone in recent months, according to sources quoted by Bloomberg, privately piling pressure on the firm to improve its performance. Shares in the British multinational have almost halved in value since 2018, with investor sentiment apparently declining through a series of acquisitions and sell-offs, amid belief that Vodafone overpaid for assets such as the German cable business it acquired in an €18bn deal that year. Cevian, which says it is a constructive investor in “overlooked, misunderstood or out-of-favour” firms, has gained prominence in the City after building up a 5% holding in the insurance firm Aviva, and has also owns a significant stake in education publisher Pearson, as well as Swedish telecoms business Ericsson. Nick Read, the chief executive since late 2018, will be under renewed pressure to reshape the business. Read accepted cuts to his earnings package soon after arrival to head off an investors’ revolt in 2019, after Vodafone said it could not pay a dividend after incurring huge losses in buying up 5G spectrum in European auctions.
Supporters say he has made the firm focus more tightly on Europe and Africa, and took decisive action to write off entirely the value of Vodafone’s unhappy investment in the Indian market. Analysts have speculated that Vodafone, a £34bn plc headquartered in Berkshire, may be pushed by Cevian to shore up its UK position – possibly acquiring other telecoms firms to take on BT and Virgin Media, or sell down its remaining stake in the mobile masts business it spun off in 2019. Cevian and Vodafone did not comment. British phone rival BT is also facing boardroom pressure from the interest of an activist investor, with French billionaire Patrick Drahi’s Altice building up a shareholding of 18% last month. Drahi said he was “supportive of BT’s strategy” despite signs that he may be manoeuvring towards a takeover – although the UK government could block any such move.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/swedish-activist-investor-targets-vodafone-over-weak-performance;business and economy

The MP for Canterbury is understood to be meeting senior party officials for discussions about her future after a party member accused her of moving 200 miles away from her constituency to be with her partner, a documentary-maker, in Wrexham. Duffield, who was elected in 2017 and has held the only Labour seat in Kent, has faced a backlash from some within the party over her views on gender issues. The MP has a record of expressing gender-critical views and was called transphobic after liking a tweet saying women were people with cervixes. She said she felt unable to attend last year’s Labour conference because of the controversy generated by her remarks. Duffield has denied being transphobic. She has said she is “completely supportive of trans rights”. Her partner, James Routh, is understood to have been previously working on a documentary about Wrexham AFC, the non-league football club bought by the Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds and TV star Rob McElhenney. In a series of tweets, Duffield described the new allegations – made in a blogpost – about her living arrangements in Wrexham as “personal, libellous, nasty and fictional crap” written by members of her own party. She said she has not moved to Wrexham. She said she was seriously considering whether to quit Labour because she did not feel supported by the party. “It is obsessive harassment. Neither the Labour party or either the former or current Leader or the Whips’ Office have done anything at all to stop it, to offer me any support, help or legal assistance. I am financially unable to pursue a libel action,” she tweeted on Sunday. “Kent police, parliamentary Security team and the Speaker’s Office have been helpful but it is the Labour party that have offered me no support at all since I unexpectedly became an MP 5 years ago. I am today considering my future in the Party very carefully.” Labour has recently asked its MPs to indicate whether they intend to stand again as part of preparations for a general election. Current MPs will be expected to go through a reselection process, though changes brought in by Keir Starmer make it more difficult for members to deselect MPs. A number of long-serving MPs, including Harriet Harman and Margaret Hodge, have indicated they will not stand again at the next election.

273;273;273;273;279;279;Derby fans stage march before Bielik heroics seal draw with Birmingham;2022-01-30;['Peter Lansley'];['Championship', 'Derby County', 'Birmingham City', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Derby County clearly have no intention of giving up. Their hopes of finding new owners remain up in the air which is where substitute Krystian Bielik, making his first appearance for a year after an ACL injury, found himself six minutes into added time, with his back to goal, to score the equaliser with a brilliant scissor kick. “As a team, we’ve been writing our own scripts this season,” Wayne Rooney said. Bielik’s goal was one overhead the club’s administrators won’t mind. Rooney’s team gave their fans every reason to chant “We’re Derby County, we fight till the end” on a day when thousands marched from the city centre to the game to mark their support for the club.
Now the Derby manager, having declined the invitation to be interviewed for the Everton job, just needs the club to be saved. The season’s biggest Championship crowd, of 32,211, gave a sense of just how important this club is to its community. Rooney was not happy with the quality of his team’s performance on the field, however. Birmingham deservedly led through goals from Lyle Taylor and Scott Hogan before Luke Plange pulled one back in the 87th minute, but the sheer sense of occasion spoke volumes. “With no Premier League this weekend, with this game being live on Sky and across the world, it’s a reminder this is a massive club, with a massive fanbase,” Rooney said, “and it’s got a future. The administrators are working hard but Middlesbrough, Wycombe and the EFL [among Derby’s creditors] have to be sensible. It’s people’s livelihoods at stake.” Such matters are beyond Rooney’s control although he confirmed there will be no more player departures before tonight’s transfer deadline. What is in his remit is his team’s performance although with so many academy graduates having to play week in, week out, it is not surprising they are showing signs of fatigue.
Taylor, seven minutes into his Birmingham debut on loan from Derby’s fiercest rivals Nottingham Forest, sent the ball back where it had come from inside the far side-netting after Onel Hernández prodded the ball wide. Birmingham have taken five points out of nine this week to alleviate their own relegation fears but it is more than the prospect of a mere demotion which made this such an emotional occasion for Derby. Club poet Jamie Thrasivoulou gave a stirring pre-match address to the sellout crowd, although the prospect of this being Derby’s last game before liquidation was allayed after Quantuma, the administrators, and the EFL had jointly announced a month’s stay of execution on Thursday.
Derby were chasing shadows for the first hour as Birmingham controlled the game, with debutant Juninho Bacuna impressive. It was no surprise when Hogan volleyed in Ryan Woods’s cross from the right 11 minutes into the second half. The only surprise was that Birmingham were not further clear, Hogan allowing Ryan Allsop to save when clean through two minutes before half-time. Lee Bowyer was furious with his team for not winning, and particularly with his 10-goal striker. “That game should have been finished, done,” the Birmingham manager said. “Scott Hogan should have scored at least three goals today. How he hasn’t got a hat-trick today I don’t know.” Derby improved after Bielik came on but it remained a chaotic match. At one point Richard Stearman was the only defender back against three Birmingham attackers as Rooney let even Curtis Davies off the leash. Plange, one of five academy graduates appearing for Derby, halved the deficit after he cut back inside on to his right foot and finished powerfully.
Rooney said he told the players at half-time they would be scoring in stoppage time and, sure enough, when Stearman headed Tom Lawrence’s free-kick back across the penalty area, Bielik took off to extend the sense that, hope against hope, Derby know how to pull off the most unlikely of comebacks. That the midfielder damaged his shoulder as he hit the ground did not dampen the manic celebrations that ensued.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/derby-birmingham-championship-match-report;sports
289;289;289;289;295;295;‘It’s upset a lot of people’: outrage after tidy-up of Scottish sacred well;2022-01-30;['Libby Brooks'];['Scotland', 'Heritage', 'UK news', 'Culture'];"At the end of a steep woodland trail, surrounded by sturdy beech and ash trees, a freshwater spring bubbles into a basic stone well, rippling in the low winter sunlight. On nearby branches and around the mouth of the well colourful cloth rags – or cloots – have been hung by visitors, as an offering to a water spirit or local saint and an entreaty to be healed. The clootie well near Munlochy, a village on the Black Isle peninsula across the Beauly Firth from Inverness, is a place of traditional pilgrimage and modern curiosity. It is also now a cause of community consternation, after a well-meaning stranger cleared away many of the offerings.
“I’m sure the person who cleared up thought they were doing something good,” says Claire Mackay, a herbalist who lives on the Black Isle, “but the fact they took it upon themselves, weren’t a local and did it without the permission of Forestry and Land Scotland [which manages the site] has upset a lot of people.” Some neighbours have fulminated on the community Facebook page – even suggesting the individual may henceforth be cursed for “desecrating” the sacred site – while others acknowledge the site was already in need of attention before the offerings were swiped last weekend.
The well had gathered an accumulation of eccentric offerings during lockdown, including bras, pants and a hi-vis jacket. The damage wrought by Storm Arwen in late November also blew down many of the cloot-covered branches.
Verity Walker, a local author and heritage consultant, can remember the “clootie trees” being trimmed or cleared when she passed the well as a child. It is an ancient tradition that now coexists alongside modern faiths, she says. “When my daughter injured her foot, I hung a sock – it has to be biodegradable and related to the part of the body that you want to recover.” Mackay is optimistic that the initial outrage can be channelled into a more organised approach to maintaining the site. “The clean-up should have been a community decision,” she says. “But now we can treat it as a clean slate and hope it has planted that seed about the need for people to leave more natural things.” Paul Hibberd, a regional visitor services manager for Forestry and Land Scotland, points out that there is already signage asking people to leave “only small, biodegradable offerings” at the well. Local rangers visit regularly to tidy and “remove the most inappropriate items”, he adds, but staff are aware this is a site that “people feel a very strong connection with”. The build-up of debris “also highlights how much plastic is in modern clothes”, Hibberd adds. “That’s part of the problem with items not breaking down.”
Clootie wells, which are also found in Cornwall and Ireland, date far back into pre-Christian times and the practice of leaving votives and offerings for spirits in wells and springs. The healing well at Munlochy has been linked to Saint Boniface, who worked as a missionary in Scotland around AD620, and is probably an example of early Christianity absorbing more ancient Celtic traditions. Pilgrims performed a ceremony that involved circling the well three times before splashing some of its water on the ground and saying a prayer. They would then tie a piece of cloth that had been in contact with the ill person to a nearby tree and, as the rag rotted away, so that person would be healed. There are plans for a community group to care for the area on a regular basis, with more than a hundred local people already expressing an interest. Mackay has plans for storytelling at the well and input from local historians, as well as outreach into schools to explain to children how to leave votives and cloots without harming the environment. “It’s a symbolic act,” says Walker, “an act of meditation and connection, an act of faith even if you’re not sure what you have faith in, and that’s only to be encouraged.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/30/upset-a-lot-of-people-outrage-tidy-up-of-scottish-sacred-well-clootie-offerings;environment

309;309;309;309;315;315;Failure to help struggling households will cost Tories dear | Larry Elliott;2022-01-30;['Larry Elliott'];['Energy industry', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Interest rates', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Energy bills', 'National insurance', 'Bank of England', 'Household bills', 'Money'];"Governments underestimate the power of celebrity at their peril. First it was Marcus Rashford and his campaign for hungry children. Now it is Jack Monroe pointing out how the official inflation figure bears no relation to the real cost of living increases facing the neediest households. The footballer and the chef have performed an important public service by highlighting, in a way that official statistics and thinktank reports can’t, just how tough life is on or close to the breadline. It is often said Britain is a wealthy country, which indeed it is. But if you rely on food banks it doesn’t really matter if house prices are going up and the stock market is booming. The poorest 10% of households in the UK have negative net wealth, because their debts are higher than the assets they own.
Monroe’s point about inflation is well made. The official measure of the cost of living does not reflect the lived experience of people across Britain and was never intended to. The consumer prices index doesn’t show whether those on low incomes are being affected by supermarkets cutting back on value ranges. Nor does it reflect the fact that richer households have savings to draw upon when times get tough. What’s more, as the Resolution Foundation has pointed out, soaring energy prices act as a form of deeply regressive tax, with the poorest households hit hardest. This is the background to the deepening cost of living crisis and what the government should do about it. One thing is already obvious: a toxic brew of rising housing costs, dearer energy and higher taxes means ministers have to come up with something. Doing nothing is only an option if they are prepared to risk oblivion at the next election. Certain things are set in stone. Next week, the regulator Ofgem will raise its price cap in response to the sharp rise in the global wholesale price of gas. Energy suppliers will be able to adjust their tariffs from April and the indications are the average household will be paying £600 a year more unless the government steps in to help.
Higher interest rates from the Bank of England are also inevitable and it would be a surprise if interest rates did not go up by 0.25 points to 0.5% this week. There is the likelihood of further increases as the year wears on. Despite the opposition of many Tory MPs, the planned increase in national insurance contributions – the £12bn health and social care levy – also appears to be done and dusted. Rishi Sunak could use the better than expected public borrowing figures to delay the increase by a year or abandon it altogether. Indeed, there is an argument that the Treasury would do better to allow the economy to get up a head of steam after the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic rather than putting the squeeze on too quickly. That was what George Osborne did after the financial crisis, with the result that the economy slowed and deficit-reduction targets were missed. Neither option appeals to the chancellor. Delaying the national insurance increase until 2023 would bring its introduction a year closer to the next election, and Sunak would prefer to be cutting not raising taxes by then. Scrapping the increase altogether would represent the sort of fiscal laxity the Treasury has traditionally loathed: governments spending money but reluctant to impose the tax increases needed to pay for them. Sunak is definitely not a fan of the idea that the only real constraint on government spending is inflation, and that the Bank of England can always print more money to pay the state’s bills.
Boris Johnson sometimes gives the impression he is a fan of modern monetary theory and, in any case, has a different time horizon to that of the chancellor. But this weekend’s joint article by the prime minister and the chancellor in the Sunday Times saying the national insurance increase “must go ahead” puts the issue to bed. Sunak will have his way – but at a cost.
It will not be easy for the government to dig itself out of a deep hole but the priority should be to help those on low and middle incomes cope with rising energy bills. There is money available to do this because the scarring from the pandemic has been a lot less severe than originally feared. On some estimates, Sunak has £50bn to play with, easily enough to counter the energy crisis. Labour has proposed making the warm home discount more generous and expanding the number of people eligible to receive it. This makes sense, as does the idea of cutting VAT on energy bills, a move that would help all households. Although Sunak will get his national insurance increase, it is bad economics as well as bad politics. The levy is a tax on jobs and inflationary, because businesses will either employ fewer workers or try to pass on higher costs to their customers. Income inequality is high in the UK but wealth inequality is even higher, and it gets harder to make the case that capital gains should be taxed more lightly than income when those paid modest sums are being asked to pay more national insurance or are having their personal allowance frozen. The cost of living crisis is happening and if the government is too timid in response, the economy will struggle to cope with rising energy bills, higher taxes and falling real incomes. There is a risk demand will slow from the spring onwards once the short-term boost from easing Covid-19 restrictions has played out. Concerns about higher debt interest payments that come from rising inflation may then be the least of the chancellor’s worries.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/failure-to-help-struggling-households-will-cost-tories-dear;politics
325;325;325;325;331;331;Out with Towie as Essex tries to shed its brash image;2022-01-30;['Tim Burrows'];['Essex', 'Gentrification', 'The Only Way is Essex', 'UK news', 'Society'];"What is it with Essex and makeovers? It was reported that the county council is to invest more than £300,000 to put its best face on and “challenge people’s preconceived ideas of how they see Essex on TV”. Council bosses wanted to banish thoughts of The Only Way Is Essex, fake tan and fast cars synonymous with the south of the county, replacing them with the Constable-country vistas, windmills and nice thatched cottages of north Essex. We’ve been here before. The council’s drive to combat the Essex stereotype is almost as old as the stereotype itself. In 1997, moves to improve the county’s image were reported in the national press. “Difficulties arise when overseas investors come to the UK, go to competitor locations, and hear jokes about Essex girls having more shoes than books,” said the head of the Essex Economic Partnership, Terry Conder. The council said it often received letters from residents about Essex’s reputation. As the new millennium arrived, Essex asked the government for permission to spend council tax payers’ money on improving its image and the council started its “Real Essex” tourism campaign. It spent £100,000 on a drive that claimed Essex was, borrowing from the old Mars bar adverts, the place to “work, play and rest”. Like today, they wanted to draw attention to Constable and quaint villages.
As with most disquieting elements of British discourse, Essex’s reputation was partly a creation of the rightwing press. Essex man was invented in 1990 via an anonymously published Sunday Telegraph editorial by Simon Heffer. The High Tory columnist grew up watching a new town, South Woodham Ferrers, being built on the edge of marshland downhill from his village. It soon filled up with Cockney emigres. West Ham United usurped the local passion for cricket. After a chance encounter with a loutish, Essex-based City worker on a train into Liverpool Street, he exacted revenge through a gross caricature depicting vomiting at the station. Heffer and other Conservatives didn’t hate Essex man, however. After all, he was the future of the party, and typified the age of upward mobility. His invention was useful for the Tories as it claimed working-class social mobility exclusively for Thatcherism, rather than it being part of a longer process you could trace back to the rise of Keir Hardie and Labour in metropolitan Essex in the late 19th century. The editorial freely admitted, too, that Essex was more an ideal than a location bound by geography: “For spiritual purposes, Essex is to be found all over the newly affluent parts of the outer London suburbs.” Essex man’s less industrious and more materialistic counterpart, Essex girl, soon formed part of the repertoire, rubber-stamped when the Ilford-born Sun journalist Richard Littlejohn ghost-wrote a grim little tome of misogynistic jokes, largely about the promiscuity of women half his age. The power of the Essex girl gave journalists the licence to pry into the sex lives of very young, even underage, girls.
So, does the council have a point? Essex, after all, was the fifth least popular English county, according to a YouGov poll in 2018. Kent, our neighbour just over the estuary from where I live in Southend, is frequently near the top of most-visited lists, Essex languishes nearer the bottom. Yet, in making this all about image, the council is ignoring other factors. Essex is still agricultural and, despite the excellent walks along its many public footpaths, much of its countryside is earmarked for private use. Thanks to its proximity to London, much of south Essex is either residential land or green belt. People still flock to Southend and Clacton on bank holidays but, more than tourism, Essex is a success story about the idea of making a home, from the postwar plotland dreamers building in former farmers’ fields to the influx of Eastenders to new towns such as Harlow and Basildon. Essex was inundated by the North Sea flood of 1953, with scores of casualties, and today great concrete sea walls keep the tide at bay in places such as Canvey Island. It is as if the council is following suit, building bigger and bigger defences to keep out the tide of representations. In truth, the stereotype is being eroded by the passage of time. The term Essex girl was taken out of the Oxford Dictionary in 2020. Essex man, so characterised by his daily commute to the City, has had to diversify into home working since the pandemic started. There is no “Real Essex” to be unearthed if we can just crack through the veneer of the mediated, overdone, “fake” Essex of TV lore. Because – and can I just shock you – I have seen Botox fillers in Constable country, too.

329;329;329;329;335;335;There’s a new picture on our kitchen corkboard…;2022-01-30;['Séamas O’Reilly'];['Parents and parenting', 'Family', 'Life and style'];"I’ve pinned the ultrasound images of the coming baby to the corkboard in our kitchen. It’s the first thing we’ve pinned there for a while. We got it shortly after we moved in, thinking it would be a place for us to keep lists, or vouchers or important notices. Once it got filled up, we just stopped using it because we are deeply unserious people masquerading as adults and, in fairness, when our son was born we surrendered to chaos a little more freely than before. Now it stands as a fossilised relic of the concerns and appointments we were faced with between April and September, 2018.
There are inscrutable notes, written with great haste about important things, now indecipherable. There is the EKG printout from that time I called 111 about my bad back and they managed to convince me I was having a heart attack and sent some rather unimpressed paramedics to our house. There is a gift voucher, itself three years out of date, for a Spanish restaurant that went out of business during the first lockdown. Looking at all these things now provokes the same melancholy tinge of those site photos from Pompeii; whole streets excavated to find people locked in an arbitrary moment in time, buried under volcanic ash, but still sitting upright at desks, or churning butter, or inspecting the use-by date on their tapas vouchers. Beneath that is the ultrasound we got for our son, four years ago. It has decayed over those years, blown out by exposure to the kitchen window, so that his tiny, spongy form, once clear, is now scribbled and scratched beyond all recognition. Its edges have curled up like a Cornetto wrapper, as if melted by creeping lava. Beside them, the ultrasounds of his sister, which are sharp and clean and brand new, seem like they are from a future age. It’s a stark, slightly bittersweet marker of how much time has passed. At a glance, it looks as if we ordered our first baby on VHS, but switched to Blu-ray for the next. And just to the left of that there is an even more striking artefact. A single sheet of notepaper marked GRAB LIST, which details everything we were supposed to bring to the hospital four years ago. On it I’ve written READY, as if this list is in its final, perfect form and proves our preparedness for everything that came after. It is a touchingly naive document of the moment just before our son was born, since its contents speak to a more innocent idea of what those few days in hospital would be like. I clearly presumed listening to music would be a big concern, as I’ve written speakers twice. This time we have no grab list, and the Bluetooth speakers will likely stay at home. We know that the volcano is coming, at least. We just no longer pretend to be ready. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

330;330;330;330;336;336;"The week in TV: The Responder; Trigger Point; The Gilded Age; Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust";2022-01-30;['Barbara Ellen'];['Drama', 'Martin Freeman', 'Vicky McClure', 'Adrian Lester', 'Julian Fellowes', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];"The Responder (BBC One) | iPlayer Trigger Point (ITV) | ITV Hub The Gilded Age (Sky Atlantic) Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust (BBC Two) | IPlayer I was rather taken aback by BBC One’s The Responder: by how good it is, how unsettling and vivid. It looks like a bog-standard “edgy” five-part police drama (all episodes are on iPlayer), this time set in Liverpool: the fraught “corrupt” cop with the marriage on the rocks; the seedy underworld; drug deals going wrong; threats; eruptions of violence … The Responder has all of this, but much more besides. It is television police drama refashioned as a long, dark night of the soul. Martin Freeman plays the titular “responder” (officer who responds to 999 calls), who feels he’s “disappearing”. At first, hearing his Liverpudlian accent, you think: is this a Stephen Graham impersonation – how long before it turns into a tongue-chewing mess? But it doesn’t, and the effect is transformative – Freeman is a different actor almost – but that’s not all. He gives a first-rate performance: whether being pulled into the criminality, working nights dealing with society’s outcasts or offloading to his inevitable counsellor (practically TV law since The Sopranos), he’s believable all the way, exposing layer after layer of melancholy, humour, fortitude, weakness, existential dread and pain. Directed by Philip Barantini (Boiling Point), who also appears as an abusive boyfriend, and Tim Mielants (The Terror), The Responder is the first TV series written by author Tony Schumacher, who himself worked in Liverpool as a responder. This enriches the drama: there’s a realistic, often humorous bounce to the dialogue, a sense of “speaking human”. There are also fantastic performances: Ian Hart (sporting a truly terrible Harry Enfield-style “scousers” wig) is alternately menacing and mischievous as a drug dealer; Rita Tushingham is heartbreaking as a dying mother; Adelayo Adedayo burns through scenes as an initially judgmental rookie cop; Emily Fairn (well, hello, Juno Temple meets Andrea Riseborough) portrays a drug addict who – hallelujah! – isn’t just plonked there to be stereotypically doomed and pathetic.
Negatives? The Responder is overlong and at times repetitive, the ending is mangled, and some of the night-time filming is so murky, it feels like being slowly lowered into a well. For all that, this is a defiantly anti-formulaic poem to redemption: original and unmissable. As for formulaic, there was the first episode of ITV’s new six-part bomb disposal series, Trigger Point. Created by Daniel Brierley, directed by Gilles Bannier, it’s from the same production stable as Line of Duty, and – slap me to my senses – I’d really been looking forward to it as a 21st-century answer to the late-70s toff-officers-and-bombs classic Danger UXB. It stars Vicky McClure as Lana, an explosives disposal (Expo) officer working alongside Joel, played by Adrian Lester, though (cue doomy spoiler hashtag!) #NotForLong. As soon as Joel starts fondly speaking of getting back with his ex, the clock is ticking on his chances of survival. He’s too lovely. Lana likes him so much. Also, Lester is a big name: sorry, mate, you’re toast.
McClure and Lester are both excellent actors who could breathe naturalistic majesty into the instructions for a microwave meal. But even they struggled leading a soapy opener that was a tad heavy on jargon (trigger phones, jammers, “lucky” pairs of “snips”) and light on plot, characterisation and, for that matter, reality. Entering a council estate flat that is considered a “bomb factory”, would Lana, a seasoned professional, really have reached straight for the light switch? Spying an unattended van, would Joel, another expert, have nonchalantly strolled towards it? On the plus side, there was a visceral scene involving a suicide jacket, and an explosion was rendered as a beautifully macabre symphony of ash, fire and pebbles. I hope there’s more of this and less of the sense of an issue-box-ticking “school play”. Over to Sky Atlantic’s nine-part The Gilded Age to see Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes’s narrative logic (“I mean, everybody enjoys olden days posh people sneering at commoners, right?”) applied to late-19th-century New York. Left penniless by her father’s death, Marian (Louisa Jacobson) arrives in New York circa 1882 to live with her aunts: Christine Baranski in the Maggie Smith-patented ultra-snob role (“You belong to old New York”), and Cynthia Nixon, who does little more than simper lethargically and sew samplers. Elsewhere, a black (“coloured”) character (Denée Benton) yearns to be a writer, and an arriviste railway tycoon couple, the Russells (Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector), are viciously humiliated as they try to enter elite New York circles.
The first episode is a clunker, though perhaps I was just imagining FOB (Fear of Bridgerton) ominously haunting every scene like an oversexed ratings-busting Netflix spectre. Peeking ahead, The Gilded Age, directed by Michael Engler, manages to be simultaneously too Downton (there’s an unsuitable lawyer love interest again) and not Downton enough: the usually magnificent Baranski is too limp to be the American Violet Crawley, and the servants are so underdrawn that, a few episodes in, I was wondering whether I should ring a little bell to find out who they were. Keep watching, though: the Russells, far from being victims, turn out to be new money brutalists who don’t take the snubs lying down. On BBC Two, the gently paced but fiercely moving documentary Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust, directed by Suniti Somaiya, focused on the 2020 project, commissioned by the Prince of Wales, in which seven artists painted seven Holocaust survivors for an exhibition in the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, ultimately destined for the Royal Collection.
The artists, including Clara Drummond and Jenny Saville, were clearly moved to be involved, but it was the survivors, all children at the time, and their testimonies that compelled. Anita Lasker-Wallfisch went to Auschwitz fully expecting to be gassed – she survived by playing the cello in the women’s orchestra there – while Zigi Shipper initially thought the chimneys signified bakeries. Shipper and another sitter, Manfred Goldberg, knew each other from the camps, and took pleasure in their lifelong friendship. Together, they noted that even they, child survivors, were now dwindling in number. In keeping with the art project, this documentary came to be about bearing witness, remembrance, the solemn magnitude of it all. What else I’m watching And Just Like That … (Sky Comedy) The Sex and the City follow-up has vastly improved since the series premiere disaster-fest, where panicked uber-wokeness sucked all hope into a black hole of cringe. Now, themes (love, grief, ageing) are dealt with much more sagely.

331;331;331;331;337;337;Ghosts of Germany’s past rise as Olaf Scholz seeks strategy for Ukraine;2022-01-30;['Philip Oltermann'];['Olaf Scholz', 'Germany', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Europe', 'World news'];"When Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shook hands on a coalition deal with his liberal-green partners last month, they energetically vowed to “risk more progress”. Less than two months on, however, Berlin’s allies in Kyiv, Washington and neighbouring European capitals worry the country remains stuck in passive old ways. As tension mounts on the border between Russia and Ukraine, they fear Scholz is falling back on foreign policy instincts honed by his most recent centre-left predecessor, the ex-chancellor-turned-lobbyist Gerhard Schröder. A restrictive attitude to exporting weapons is one source of frustration. In spite of being one of the world’s top five biggest exporters of arms, Germany says it cannot send lethal weapons into conflict zones for historic reasons, instead supplying Ukraine with 5,000 military helmets, a gesture that Kyiv’s mayor described as “a joke”. It has still not signed paperwork allowing Estonia to give Ukraine nine D-30 howitzers, which Germany has to authorise because the Soviet-made long-range weapons were once stationed in East Germany. For Germany’s critics, however, nothing symbolises its ambiguity towards the brewing conflict more than Nord Stream 2. The recently completed but still unapproved gas pipeline between Ust-Luga in Russia to Lubmin in north-east Germany, they say, shows how the country’s energy needs have made it vulnerable to blackmail by Putin. Scholz insists that “all options are on the table” when it comes to potential sanctions in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, but his government has been slow to go into specifics, even arguing it is strategically wiser to remain vague. “We must not rule anything out when it comes to sanctions, including Swift [the global banking payments system] and Nord Stream 2,” said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesperson of Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD). “If push comes to shove, then Nord Stream 2 will probably be unsustainable,” Schmid told the Observer. “It’s crucial that Putin cannot calculate in advance what the consequences of his actions will be.”
The logic of this stance is not just questioned abroad but also domestically. “Threatening sanctions does not work if the other side can tell you are afraid to spell out what they are,” said Norbert Röttgen, a member of the Bundestag’s foreign policy committee for the conservative Christian Democratic Union. “It has to be clear that authorising Nord Stream 2 is out of the question if there is a war. “We are on the cusp of the most dramatic situation since the end of the second world war: a war in Europe that would change the geopolitical balance on our continent,” Röttgen told the Observer. “Chancellor Scholz needs to make it clear he understands the historic significance of this moment, or he risks gambling away Germany’s reputation as a reliable partner of the west.” As Scholz’s Social Democrats convene on Monday for an internal debate on its stance on Russia, Röttgen urged the party to take a stand against those who use German history as a cover “for personal financial gain and an appeasement policy that turns aggressors into victims”. The belief that Germany, whose military forays in the Nazi era cost millions of Russian lives, cannot act as aggressively towards the Kremlin as other European nations is not a minority view. It runs across the German party spectrum and is widely shared among the population. However, the SPD’s Schmid says: “You have to take into consideration that Germany, alongside France, has the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Normandy format [the four-way contact group set up after the conflict in Donbas]. We cannot supply weapons to one of the two parties we are mediating between.” Even the Green party, heralded by some as human rights hawks who would radically reposition Germany’s stance on China and Russia after claiming the foreign ministry under the new government, reaffirms this position. “The German government has not provided any arms shipments to Ukraine for almost a decade,” said Agnieszka Brugger, a Green member of the parliament’s defence committee. “A change in policy would not make any significant short-term military difference on the ground but may be a big risk for the very difficult ongoing diplomatic talks,” Brugger said. “European and Nato unity in our support for Ukraine is crucial to demonstrate a strong stance towards Russia, and we should not let the different ways we show our support for our allies get in between us.”
No party in the Bundestag has used Germany’s historic crimes as a cover for expanding ties with Russia as much as Scholz’s, however. As Germany’s oldest party, the SPD has a tendency to reach back into the history books, and few of the party’s politicians talk about Russia without citing Ostpolitik, the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states pursued by its former chancellor Willy Brandt. Yet the SPD’s attitude to Russia doesn’t necessarily run as deep as it likes to convince itself. In an essay for the Frankfurter Allgemeine last week, the historian Gerd Koenen argued that a foreign policy of “latent equidistance between Washington and Moscow” was rooted in the centre-left’s experience at the start of the millennium, when an SPD-led German government refused to join America’s war in Iraq. That stint in power resulted in the SPD splitting over domestic policy, with Chancellor Schröder pursuing a New Labourite third way while finance minister Oskar Lafontaine peeled off to co-found the leftwing Die Linke (The Left). But in their pro-Russian sympathies the two camp leaders remain united. Schröder, who on Friday insisted that Russia had no intention to invade Ukraine and accused Kyiv of “sabre rattling”, joined the state-controlled Russian giant Gazprom’s North European Gas Pipeline company, later renamed Nord Stream AG, as chairman within months of losing the 2005 election. The Baltic Sea pipeline between Russia and north-east Germany, which bypasses Baltic and east central Europe, was green-lit in the interim period before Angela Merkel took office, but continued under her tenure. At Nord Stream AG, Schröder’s chief executive is Matthias Warnig, a former high-ranking Stasi officer who once spied on West German industry for East Germany’s secret police under the aliases “Ökonom” (“Economist”) and “Arthur” and ascended to Putin’s inner circle after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
While revelations about Stasi links can still curtail political careers in Germany – one Berlin state secretary from the same paramilitary regiment as Warnig was made to resign in 2017 – the past of Nord Stream’s boss is rarely mentioned in the debate around the project. “I am sometimes surprised this doesn’t play a more prominent role,” said an SPD politician who asked not to be named. Schröder’s networking still links the SPD and Russian gas. A German subsidiary of Nord Stream 2 called Gas for Europe, founded last week in an apparent attempt to complete the controversial pipeline’s certification process, has registered as its supervisory board chairman Dietrich Walter Haller, who worked at the chancellory under Schröder from 2003 to 2005. On Thursday night, the German foreign office announced it would seek to ban Haller from the role, since it was in conflict with his recent activity as a top diplomat. Lars Klingbeil, the Social Democrats’ co-chair, used to work in the Hanover constituency office of Schröder, whom he declined to desribe as a “lobbyist” when pressed in an interview with Der Spiegel last week. Klingbeil is also a trustee of “German-Russia – The new generation”, a networking association founded in 2011 by the Russian ambassador to Berlin. Scholz, who was SPD general secretary under Schröder, has brushed against these networks. But his rise to power is not of their making, and it remains possible that he can detach himself from them.
If the Schröder generation’s approach to Russia was shaped by Brandt, Scholz has cited as his political idol Brandt’s successor, Helmut Schmidt, who prodded Nato in 1979 to adopt its so-called dual-track resolution: a strategy of military armament and threat coupled with an openness to dialogue. Schmidt’s confrontational course made him enemies within his own party, but in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung last week, Scholz seemed to signal that he favoured this strand of his party’s foreign policy tradition: “If you cite Brandt and Schmidt, then territorial integrity and states’ right to self-determination is an inextricable part of that,” he said. Schmid said: “Both Brandt and Schmidt were committed transatlanticists: that’s something that’s misremembered by some people in Germany, including some in my own party. Scholz will act in Schmidt’s vein: he has no nostalgic illusions when it comes to Russia. He won’t bat an eyelid when it comes to sanctions.” • This article was amended on 31 January 2022.

334;334;334;334;340;340;‘I grew up with Branagh in Belfast: our childhoods haunt his new film’;2022-01-30;['Henry McDonald'];['Kenneth Branagh', 'Belfast', 'Film', 'Belfast', 'Northern Ireland', 'Culture', 'UK news'];"There is one man with very personal reasons for finding the scenes of sectarian intimidation in Sir Kenneth Branagh’s film homage to his home city particularly haunting – his first cousin, Martin Hamilton. Hamilton, who grew up with Branagh and his family in inner-city north Belfast, says the images of Catholic families being forced out of the mainly Protestant district brought back painful memories of his own fractured friendships that were lost in the Troubles. Branagh’s movie Belfast – hotly tipped for an Oscar – is a memoirish tale of how the Northern Ireland conflict that erupted in 1969 forced his family to escape the gathering sectarian storm.
Watching the darker moments of Belfast when Catholics are driven from their homes, Hamilton recalled how a fiercely close boyhood friendship was broken up. “Those parts of the film really resonated with me when I first saw Ken’s film,” he said. “I was living across from Ken and his family, in flats on Skegoneil Avenue in 1969. My best friend growing up was a lad from a Catholic family. We played football together, we got into fights together – although never about religion – and we made up frequently after them. We were inseparable as boys. “When the Troubles broke out, people from outside our area, some of whom were Protestants moving out of mainly Catholic districts, started to stir things up in the flats. “They started asking why Catholics were still living among us and the atmosphere they created was so hostile that these Catholic families, including my friend’s, felt too insecure to stay.
“They moved out just like the people forced from their homes by the mob in Ken’s film. Ken captured this tragic turn of events so well in the movie. It was so very true to what was sadly happening back then,” he said. Hamilton, who will be 70 this year, described Branagh and his older brother Bill as “more like my other brothers rather than cousins”. He said: “Because my dad was working in the shipyard and my mum managed a local Co-op store, I used to go to my aunt Frances and uncle Billy’s house after school. I knocked around more with his brother Bill as we were about the same age. I remember Ken at the time was quiet, shy.” As in the movie, Branagh and his family leave strife-torn Belfast for a new life in England. But when Branagh returned to his native city in the late 1970s to star in a series of critically acclaimed TV dramas written by Graham Reid – the Billy plays – his extended family were there to protect him. Hamilton told the Observer he was deployed to ensure his actor-cousin with the English accent wouldn’t be mistaken for a British soldier. “Ken stayed with my mum and dad as Aunt Frances was worried about him. She was concerned that with his accent someone might think he was a soldier, which was a very dangerous thing to be in Belfast in the 1970s. “I was tasked with driving him over from the north of the city to the filming in the east. Many years later when he became famous, he spoke about those wet and windy nights in Belfast when his cousin drove him about. He never ever forgot about his roots or his family.”
Branagh’s film recreates the working-class Victorian terraced streets and alleyways of the Mountcollyer Street/York Road area at the end of the 1960s. Today the district is depopulated, with row upon row of bricked up houses, while Mountcollyer Street where the Branagh clan lived is hardly a street at all any more, but rather a cul de sac. Those who grew up nearby in the Tigers Bay area, such as Karen Clarkin, said the set of Belfast with its corner shops, street lamps and yards with outside toilets is faithful to the time and place that Branagh’s direction captures. “My granny was friends with Ken’s grandmother Frances who lived across from her. His granny was always talking about her grandson who she insisted was always going to be a great actor. “But it was the scenes in the film of his grandfather (played by fellow Northern Ireland actor Ciarán Hinds) that really got to me. Him sitting on the outside toilet drinking his mug of tea, all his tools and his knick-knacks reminded me of my own grandad in Tigers Bay. I loved the film because it brought home what this part of Belfast really was like,” Clarkin said. Then she pointed to a nearby structure in a green space Branagh would once have played in during the late 1960s – Alexandra Park.
During the Troubles the park was often a nightly battleground for rival rioting Protestant and Catholic youths. The violence became so bad that locals living on either side of what was once an invisible sectarian dividing line demanded a permanent barrier to keep the mobs apart. A giant steel “peace” structure was built, and its foundations were laid on 1 September 1994, the first day of the historic IRA ceasefire. Although it can be opened during the day, this 3-metre reinforced corrugated iron barrier remains a near-permanent “border” creating separate Protestant and Catholic zones in the park. While the film contains joyous moments and is a love letter to a city Branagh clearly adores, Belfast ends with captions that commemorate the things lost during 35 years of conflict. The director remembers those who had to leave, those who remained and endured, and finally those that were lost for ever in the violence.
The film has struck a chord with the generations who lived through the Troubles. After a screening at the art deco Strand cinema in east Belfast last Tuesday several elderly and middle-aged viewers had tears in their eyes as they left the movie house. That sentiment of loss and futility is felt too by Hamilton, who has watched his famous cousin’s award-winning movie twice. “I can still remember the name of every family in our flats that had to get out. They had good neighbours, but it was the bad ones that forced them to go. I suppose if Ken’s film has any message for me personally it is that Northern Ireland can be a great place if they’d just leave us alone.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/30/belfast-ken-branaghs-love-letter-to-torn-city-that-taught-him-so-much;entertainment and culture
338;338;338;338;344;344;On Bloody Sunday by Julieann Campbell review – first-hand stories of a shameful day;2022-01-30;['Sean O’Hagan'];['History books', 'Books', 'Bloody Sunday', 'Northern Ireland', 'Culture'];"“As children,” Julieann Campbell writes in her introduction to this intricately woven oral history of Bloody Sunday and its long aftermath, “we were told stories about my uncle, Jackie Duddy – a teenage boxing champion – who went on a civil rights march and was shot by British soldiers.” Jackie Duddy, aged 17, was the first fatality on the afternoon of 30 January 1972. A photograph of his limp body being carried by local men, while a priest walks uncertainly ahead of them waving a white handkerchief, has since become the single most memorable image of the day’s horror. For his close family, it is also a constant and painful reminder of the casual brutality of his passing. “We knew Jackie’s face from family photographs, book covers and the Bogside mural,” she elaborates, describing the discomfort she felt as a child “seeing mum subjected to her brother’s dying moments again and again” each time footage of Bloody Sunday aired on the news. For Campbell, then, this book is a deeply personal, as well as meticulously journalistic, undertaking. (Her previous book, Setting the Truth Free: The Inside Story of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial prize.) Drawing on new and historical interviews with around 110 people, mainly survivors, relatives and eyewitnesses, On Bloody Sunday possesses a veracity and cumulative power that sets it apart from previous accounts. “As a relative,” writes Campbell, “I felt the need to keep asking and keep recording these accounts, knowing just how precious they were.” On the page, one testimony inexorably following another, it is the sense of utter disbelief felt by those caught up in the terror that is most palpable. It is Father Daly, the priest with the white handkerchief, who would later become Bishop of Derry, who captures it most vividly in his description of the frantic moments that followed the first killing. “The paras were still firing, and we decided to make a dash for it to try and get young Jackie away. We were terrified. This seemed like it was in our imagination, like this was film we were seeing. It was hard to believe it was reality.”
Fifty years on, that remains the case. Though Campbell provides much-needed context for the massacre, and reprises the families’ long campaign for justice, it is the details of the day that resonate. One local man mistook the sound of the bullets cutting through the air around him for the buzzing of wasps and remembers thinking, “How could there be wasps in January?” A woman who was badly injured by a bullet in the leg remembers looking into the face of the soldier who shot her from just 20 feet away. More chilling is the testimony of a local doctor, Raymond McClean, who came upon two young boys trying to resuscitate a man who was lying on the steps of a square. He was 35-year-old Gerard McKinney, who was already dead. Dr McClean was immediately called to a house nearby, where he found 17-year-old Michael Kelly lying next to Jim Wray, aged 22. “Michael was already dead when I examined him,” he states matter-of-factly. “Jim was also dead... I told the young first-aiders to continue their efforts at resuscitation. I did this mainly to keep them occupied and in the hope that if they were kept busy, they would be less likely to panic.” On the streets nearby, panic spread as people fled the scenes or crouched behind walls, while others lay dead or injured. Seventeen-year-old Hugh Gilmour was shot while running towards his home in Rossville Flats. He died below the window of his parents’ flat. Alexander Nash saw his son William lying by a makeshift rubble barricade on Rossville Street alongside two others, and ran frantically to the spot with his hand raised “to signal that the shooting should stop”. He was hit twice, falling beside the bodies. “I put my hand on my son’s back and said: ‘Willie!’ His eyes were wide open, but I knew straight away that he was dead and that the other two men were dead too.” Amid all this, people risked their lives to tend to the fallen, often crawling to where they lay.
For those who witnessed the carnage, and for the families and friends of those killed, the trauma of Bloody Sunday was exacerbated by all that followed: the portrayal of the victims as gunmen and nail bombers by the British army and an acquiescent rightwing media, an initial inquiry-cum-whitewash that exonerated the guilty, and the long cover-up by the military and political establishment. In 2010, a heroically dogged justice campaign by the families culminated with the publication of the 12-year-long Saville inquiry, which found that soldiers from Britain’s 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment fired on marchers, none of whom were armed or posed a threat, and that many of the soldiers “knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing”. Why the regiment was deployed in the first place, being spectacularly unsuited to the task of controlling civilian protest during such a tense and tumultuous time, is a question that also resounds through this book. Campbell devotes a chapter to the Ballymurphy massacre that happened five months before Bloody Sunday, the paras shooting dead 10 unarmed civilians, including a priest and a mother of eight, in nationalist Ballymurphy in Belfast over three nights. She also includes a memo, written in the wake of that horror, and just weeks before the killings in Derry, by General Ford, commander of land forces for the British army, whose decision it was to deploy the Paras. It reads: “I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders amongst the DYH (Derry young hooligans), after clear warnings have been issued.” Before the terror was unleashed, it was normalised from on high. The findings of the Saville inquiry led to an apology – “on behalf of the government, indeed on behalf of the country” – from prime minister David Cameron. Last year, the director of public prosecutions made the decision to discontinue the case against the single ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, who was set to face trial for the murder of two of the victims and the attempted murder of four others. The families have appealed against the decision and their long campaign persists. For the families of those killed, the survivors and the nationalist population of Derry, the events of Bloody Sunday, which shaped the course of the Troubles like no other single incident, remain, as Campbell puts it, “present, debated and unresolved”. Reading her intricately structured account of the day and its long shadow, it is not hard to see why. • On Bloody Sunday: A New History of the Day and Its Aftermath By the People Who Were There by Julieann Campbell is published by Octopus (£25).

352;352;352;352;358;358;‘I’ve moved on, and then some’: singer George Ezra on fame, friendship and finding new inspiration;2022-01-30;['Laura Snapes'];['George Ezra', 'Music', 'Culture'];"George Ezra walks into the Old Barge, the Hertford pub that’s been his lifelong local, and within three minutes his song, Budapest is on the stereo. “They’re so supportive here,” he says, with shy gratitude, as he stoops under a curtain into a back room. Ezra first came here after school, searching for a loo. At 16, he started working behind the bar. When friends come home for Christmas, this is where they meet, “and where we would have always met”. It still smells the same. (Currently: of yesterday’s log fire, a comforting contrast to the January damp.) Over the next few hours, locals stick their heads in to wave hello to their friendly neighbourhood pop star, drinking lime cordial and soda in crisp double denim, and he greets them all back by name. This is the approachable figure Ezra, who is 28, cuts in most settings, whether playing a radiant set at Glastonbury or warmly chatting about mental health on his podcast. A music college dropout born George Ezra Barnett, he emerged in 2014 as part of a cohort of middle-class British boys with acoustic guitars. Unlike most of them, he wasn’t lachrymose or ambition-crazed. Instead he had a good-weird sense of humour and a big voice, cultivated after this ardent blues fan became obsessed with the US blues singer Lead Belly. Ezra’s label sent him Interrailing to inspire his first album, Wanted on Voyage, and he famously saw much of Europe except Budapest, the name of his breakthrough single. That song set the George Ezra template: primary-coloured bonhomie, a yearning for escape, an awed insistence that he’d give up anything for a girl. For album two, Staying at Tamara’s, he Airbnb’d in Barcelona and came back with the rabidly catchy singles Shotgun and Paradise. Both of his albums hit No 1 and spent 336 weeks in the charts (and counting) between them: rare numbers that put you in the Sheeran leagues.
Having always used trips as creative inspiration, Ezra intended to write album three as he walked from Land’s End to John o’Groats in the spring of 2020. Instead, he spent five weeks of lockdown alone in London before family and friends convinced him to move back to Hertfordshire. For two months, during that mood-spiking heatwave, he lived in a van on a friend’s farm. “It was dogs that needed walking and fields that needed mowing,” he remembers dreamily. He soon bought his own place. Being back has done him the world of good. He loves community: “When you can walk out your front door and the whole town feels like an extension of a back garden.” And though he knows this might seem weird – regressive or stuck – “I feel comfortable in the fact that I’ve moved on, and then some.” Ezra says change is beautiful, and it suits him. His strong features sit more comfortably on a man’s face. When his hair grew out during lockdown, he swept it back and realised this was his look. (He has laughably nice skin, another recent change: “I started washing! I said to my sister, ‘Washing your skin really makes a difference doesn’t it?’ She was like, ‘Fuck off, yes.’”) On his first two albums, he often sang about escaping and giving it all up; the transformations on his lovely third album, Gold Rush Kid, are less about tearing up the script than recognising a moment as it’s happening, and discovering contentment within it. It’s a steadier album, he says. The first time around, he relied on his travels for something to write about. Second time, he had seen the world – played New Year’s Eve in Tasmania – “and so then writing about crocodiles and dreaming becomes quite realistic”. This time, he says, it felt “honest and cool” to write about the everyday substance of his life: assignations in hotel rooms and bars, surrendering to a lover’s beauty on the dancefloor. On the big-chorused title track, he sings of “robbing the bank / Making a run for it and learning to dance” – winging it, basically. He had been thinking about the opportunists who rushed west in the 1850s and “understood it as people deciding: over there is something worth pursuing and it’s finite, so go and get it”. Ezra writes to reinforce the things he needs to hear and he has realised that this is the attitude he wants to cultivate towards his career and his life: “Remember: enjoy this.” It is odd to hear that George Ezra – who wrote the lyric “bikini bottoms, lager tops, I could get used to this”, and sang it with a giddy whoop – needed that nudge. But his earlier, bright exterior concealed a bleak mindset. “In the past, when I’ve been the most intimidated and the most scared, it was really easy to tip over into nihilism and go, ‘Fuck it, it’s all going to end anyway, so what does it matter?’” he says bitterly. Perhaps that outlook has benefits, he considers. “But I don’t think I ever got there in a good way.”
He is a surprisingly careful conversationalist, taking long pauses to risk-assess any admission. I press him for examples of how he would self-sabotage, but he says it wouldn’t do him any good to go into detail. But he admits he almost let this mentality total his career. In 2020, Ezra insisted that he wanted to quit music, telling his manager: “I don’t identify with it, I don’t understand it, I find it really hard to get my head around why I would pursue what I associate with being quite stressful – because the last album was unenjoyable at times, by my own doing.” Ezra had become “the kid who just says yes,” he says – a punishing identity that gave him a perverse kind of validation. “The diary would be bursting – you could almost see it pulsating. And I lost control, and therefore I started to try to control the things that didn’t need controlling.” He gives the example of spending three hours packing hand luggage: “Dude, you could throw some underwear in that bag, a few T-shirts and a toothbrush and you would be fine.” (As we chat, he often gives himself a second-person talking-to.) “ But this thing could be on display at a museum.” He also has Pure O, a form of OCD that involves intrusive thoughts without the physical compulsions. He used to lose weeks to them. During the first lockdown, he found a therapist and practised transcendental meditation, which helped. Now the thoughts might loop for just 30 minutes. He has stopped trying to stop them, “because that’s where I used to wind myself up,” he says. When life opened up again, Ezra got back to writing with his long-term collaborator Joel Pott (formerly of 2000s indie band Athlete), and rediscovered the pleasures of music that his yes-man persona had trampled. “The reason you do this is because you love it,” he tells himself. “And maybe that’s the payoff, that you get to pursue something you love – but as a result, you’re gonna feel it acutely and care too much at times.” (Pott praises the “good people” around Ezra, who told him he didn’t owe anyone anything.) Given Ezra’s renewed joy, it may seem counterintuitive that death looms over Gold Rush Kid. He cavorts with her on Green Green Grass, another insatiable earworm. On the twinkly closer Sun Went Down, he repeats, with real warmth, “I could die now.” It’s not the old nihilism but a sense of peace that comes from knowing he is giving life his best shot, of accepting himself in this moment. While Ezra likes his first two albums, he loves this one. “It doesn’t sound like anything but myself,” he says. The first five tracks are classic Ezra – as bright and buoyant as a new pool inflatable. But then it takes a ruminative shift – the album’s most striking song, I Went Hunting, beautifully addresses his past self-sabotage. It’s not a prelude to him becoming a tortured artist, he says – Ezra disdains artists longing to shed their pop fans and get serious – but the result of “a lot of self-reflection”. He’s chuffed when I single out his favourite line from lead single Anyone for You: “Remember me the way I am, not the way I was.” (Once a month, he prints selected photos from his phone and deletes the rest. “I feel like I’m dragging something along with me,” he says.) He struggles to identify those changes, partly because they’re ineffable, partly because he enjoys privacy. But he gives it a go. He’s discovered that contentment is different from happiness. On this album, he’s telling himself: “You’re all right. You’re not a villain.” Ezra still walked from Land’s End to John o’Groats with two friends for an upcoming documentary series, ultimately relieved he didn’t have to write an album at the same time. Walking 20 to 30 miles a day gave him the same feeling of peace as transcendental meditation, one that’s stuck around. There was another experience as well: he won’t discuss the specifics on record because he says he hasn’t figured out how to communicate it, but it showed him that the love in his life was inescapable. “I have these people around me, family and friends, that are there. The lesson was: what you don’t get, George, is that they just love you because of who you are. And don’t try to make sense of that because you won’t be able to. But accept it.” He thinks about it all the time. “It felt seismic, but really calm. I think that’s true of a lot of the last few years – these huge changes that actually just took one tiptoe to the left.” He has learned to look after himself – phone off at 9pm, light the fire, read – and found work-life balance. “I can actually plan meaningful interactions with friends around work,” he says, “which is the thing I’ve always envied in other people.” And no more yes-man. He told management: “Put things in front of me if you think they’re important, and only fight for them if you think they’re really important.” Still, he wants to give Gold Rush Kid a “fighting chance”, especially as he anticipates turning 30 and thinks about “drawing a line in the sand” at some point. “It’s the saddest thing I see in pop music when people just cling on to something,” he says. He isn’t retiring prematurely: he might release music more regularly, but cease touring. “I get a lot from it, positive and negative,” he says. “It’s an insane amount of adrenaline to experience and then to carry that with you.”
Ezra is not the sort of pop star who gameplans their career five years in advance – the opposite, in fact. He definitively does not want to break the US. “It’s too big a place to consider mirroring what my work looks like in Europe and Australia,” he says. “To try to recreate that would kill me. I don’t need it.” He also wants children, which feels incompatible with a career at his level. “There are home videos of me as a child saying I want to be a dad,” he says. “I have to question people that are very famous and pursue that after having kids. It’s lost on me. It sounds selfish.” The most he will look to his future career is to suggest that being adored by the nation’s children means his songs will ultimately become “throwback party classics”. Any kids that didn’t already know him soon did if they followed Joe Wicks’s lockdown PE lessons. Ezra’s mum, a primary school teacher, told him Wicks said he couldn’t play music on the videos because of copyright. She suggested that Ezra let Wicks use his songs for free. So he did, then donated the royalties to the NHS. “It was just a good thing to be able to do,” he says. What does it say that pop stars are having to donate to the NHS during a pandemic? He pauses. “There’s a lot I don’t understand,” he says, sadly. “The amount that I don’t understand intimidates me to the point where it probably doesn’t serve me to speak about it because I don’t know where to start. But then I’m like, is that the point? Are you made to feel like you don’t understand when really you do? “And that’s the thing I found hard about the last few years,” he says, with a sudden ragged breath, “is actually feeling… helpless in some way.” He says the last part in the smallest voice, and we’re both surprised to find he is crying, his grey-blue eyes now red. “Sorry!” he says quickly, and regroups. “There’s a lot of confusing stuff going on in the world. It’s sad, you’re right, why are fucking pop stars donating to the NHS?”
Ezra says he hasn’t generally made political statements because he doesn’t feel qualified – although he recalls his parents, Labour party members, taking him on marches – and not because his fanbase is so broad. He casts aspersions as he gestures around the Old Barge. “I love this pub. It is empty of an evening and it shouldn’t be,” he says emphatically, referencing the fear over Omicron. “Not that it should be busy, but they’re not helped. If people shouldn’t be going out, tell them to close the doors and help them through that time.” He laments that “making the world an intimidating and confusing place is a really convenient way of pitting people against one another”. It runs counter to his worldview. He comes back to the walk, on which they regularly met “two types of farmer: people that live hand to mouth, up at 4am on Christmas, and they were lovely, pointing us in the right direction. We also met men who wear gold rings on their little fingers and live in big houses on the farms, and they were lovely, and told us which direction to go. It’s why he loved Gogglebox so much, he says, “because it’s good to be reminded you’re all the same in many ways.” Ezra’s music has always expressed his faith in collective goodness: we’re all right together, we’re just human; as he sings on the song Gold Rush Kid. “You’re just like everyone, you’re holding on.” Has that belief been shaken in the past two years, when it’s often seemed as though we aren’t all in this together? “I don’t think so,” he says. “Getting out and walking the country and meeting people – it just isn’t true. I get terrified that everyone’s out to get each other. For the most part, they are – until you step out your front door.” The single Anyone For You is out now; the album Gold Rush Kid follows on 10 June on Columbia Records If you’d like to hear this piece narrated, listen on Saturday to The Guardian’s brand new podcast, Weekend.

358;358;358;358;364;364;What can we all learn from watching couples in therapy? | Eva Wiseman;2022-01-30;['Eva Wiseman'];['Relationships', 'Television', 'Life and style', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Counselling and therapy'];"Every night my boyfriend and I have been sitting on the sofa and hungrily watching strangers break up. Couples Therapy is a docu-series filmed in the New York office of elegant psychoanalyst Dr Orna Guralnik as she deftly sieves the lumps out of four relationships. Once you have got over the bogglement at the idea that these couples have agreed to be so vulnerable in front of this many cameras, knowing every eye-roll and revelation will be seen by millions (including their dads, bosses and exes), you can relax into the radical entertainment. And some time after that, perhaps in bed, or when flossing your teeth, questions might appear. Questions like, “Do I interrupt like she does?” and, “Could that guy not perhaps take his awful denim cap off inside?” and, “How can any of us hope to understand each other when we can’t even understand ourselves?” The structure of a couple is one I am familiar with and fascinated by. Why (I ask myself fondly, 18 years into a relationship that could not be more traditional if it wore a blazer and drank real ale) do we choose this partnership, generation after generation, morning after morning? Two strangers leaning against each other like two cards trying to make a shelter. I think often of the tree that grew around a bike, evolving into something monsterish and beautiful that would never ride again. When the bike was left chained there in 1914, the tree treated it like a wound, scarring and scabbing itself around the frame – now the bike is more than 7ft from the ground, and the tree a living metaphor for every long-term relationship on this bended, burning earth. I like it, I suppose. Is that enough? As some people are beginning to question the benefits of monogamous coupledom (and happier to discuss their mental health) it’s becoming more common for young people to visit couples counsellors, previously assumed a sort of hospice for those in the death throes of a cooling marriage. One 2017 survey put the number of millennials who had attended couples counselling at 51%, and in 2018 counselling charity Relate reported a 30% increase in UK clients under 40 in four years. Part of this shift is due, surely, to the way shows such as Couples Therapy (and Esther Perel’s podcast Where Should We Begin? which similarly invites an audience into real-life therapy sessions) have pulled back a curtain on the previously shadowed practice of therapy, one still stained by ideas of shame and failure.
And how we lap them up! How we love to watch! What joy is greater, in the first winter of 2022, than wild swimming in the frosty depths of another couple’s disappointments? Is there anything better than watching a marriage transform into a white ball of blood and fur from the comfort of your living room? There is the therapist, there is the couple, there is the relationship, and there is me, drinking Lady Grey with a raw sort of glee. Was the husband or was he not (and here I’ll quote directly from episode one, featuring linen-shirted antihero Mau) entitled to “zero responsibility” for the birthday orgy his wife of 23 years had planned for him, and as much “spectacular, enthusiastic and genuine” sex as he wanted, without putting in “any work on his part”? When Dr Guralnik earnestly said it was “hard to meet him” I shrieked into my biscuit. But the questions each show left me with kept reverberating. How can a person manage the psychological bruises left by historical trauma in order to maintain a trusting relationship? How important are feelings when they knock against facts? The biggest thing I’ve taken away from being a voyeur to other people’s therapy sessions, though, is the knowledge that listening is difficult, and successfully communicating feelings we can’t even articulate to ourselves almost impossible. Not everyone can or should have therapy, but what I’m left with after a rich but exhausting binge-watch of Guralnik being wise and fabulous, is the realisation that we should all be taught how to listen. How could life be, if talking was not the only communicative skill applauded and prized? Rather than simply being a mirror, hearing as a passive state, I would relish the chance to learn how to listen in a way that allowed me to hear the subconscious whirrings, understand my own lingering soundtrack, hear what somebody is really trying to say. You glimpse, in soft moments, a world where we could understand ourselves enough to show real empathy for others, or one where we can really try to know the people we say we love. It’s funny – though the cameras initially seem horribly invasive, after a while their focus reminds the viewer how important it is to pay attention to the person who isn’t speaking. How what’s being said is affecting them, and how they might misunderstand it; what memories, politics, judgments are also playing in their ears. Beneath that horrifying denim cap.

367;367;367;367;373;373;Grilled by ‘girly swots’: what poetic justice for a man as misogynistic as Boris Johnson | Catherine Bennett;2022-01-30;['Catherine Bennett'];['Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Metropolitan police', 'Conservatives'];"“Just pat her on the bottom and send her on her way.” When, as rarely happens, Boris Johnson is forced to cooperate with women in authority, it may help that, as he’s occasionally mentioned, he possesses a fair few insights into female behaviour and woman-management, some of them perhaps gleaned from his father. Though it must be painful, given his attitude to women in the workforce, to be forced to deal with them at all. He once depicted female employment as “an ever-growing proportion of British women [who] have been ‘incentivised’ or socially gestapoed into the workplace”. When can he stop acting as if Sue Gray is his equal? Isn’t it humiliation enough that Johnson, Big Dog, a man who publicly identifies as the Incredible Hulk, should already have been thwarted by Lady Hale, then denied revenge on another female adversary, Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards? Just last week Stone was again acting as if Hulk could be defeated by a woman, saying it is “bonkers” she can’t investigate the funding of his dodgy refurb. “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,” Johnson once warned fellow leaders. But the Hulk never had to deal with a police investigation, albeit heavily compromised, by three female officers. True, one is Cressida Dick, but add deputy assistant commissioner Jane Connors and commander Catherine Roper and that’s still an entire troika of nightmare “girly swots” (as Johnson describes conscientious people of either sex). DAC Connors, who expressed sadness about people “flagrantly” ignoring Covid rules, is certainly a contender for Johnson’s signature insult. Not long after declaring his proroguing of parliament illegal, Lady Hale pointedly applied it to herself. Which is the kind of thing that happens when the professions fail to learn from Johnson’s example that the correct approach to hiring women, allowing for occasional lapses, is not to do it in the first place. Even the young, blond, cheatworthy ones will end up old, like the “sweaty old peeresses”, “old bag” and “kind of woman who owns fifteen cats” referred to in Johnson’s novel Seventy Two Virgins, a fast-moving catalogue of sexist and racist slurs, set in Westminster. Like David Cameron, Johnson likes to boast about the female prime ministers who outwitted men like himself, while ensuring his own administration is modelled, thus ruling out further such anomalies, on admission arrangements at his old school. Any Tory female visibility in the Commons and cabinet should not, as became clear in reports about No 10’s lockdown lifestyle, be interpreted as evidence of progress. The most arresting aspect of the covertly photographed drinks/meeting at No 10 is, for example, less the refreshments than the quaint sex ratio, apparently 16 to three. Two of the women being the girlfriends of Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson.
The latter’s insistence that these garden drinks were “people at work” conveys his confidence that an appearance of institutionalised sex discrimination will always be less shameful than booze-related rule-breaking. Written accounts of the No 10 work/booze timetable also depict a sex monoculture you’d probably blame on the prep school culture that created Johnson if that hadn’t, in comparison, been thrillingly diverse. The narrator of King Solomon’s Mines, published in 1885, at least acknowledges to his schoolboy readers that “there is not a petticoat in the whole history”. That is, except for a female fiend and “she was a hundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don’t count her”. It’s still one more petticoat than you get in a Johnsonian “quad”. Questioned about the non-existent female membership of his inner cabals, with their idiot nicknames and boxing-glove accessories, Johnson has protested, like Cameron before him, that he is doing his best, helpless to correct the shortage of female candidates as accomplished as Gavin Williamson, as trustworthy as Hancock, as authoritative as Dominic Raab. After elected women were sidelined in the national Covid response, including almost entirely from public briefings, a sniggering Johnson told the parliamentary liaison committee: “It’s certainly true that I would have liked to have had more female representation in the press conferences so far.” Though not enough to do anything about it. “And, erm, you know, er, what can I say?” Keen Johnson students would have heard the echoes, here, of the Spectator column where, along with the bum-patting tip, he offered this to future editors: “You will receive threatening letters from female journalists, urging you to have more female bylines, starting with their own, and I would not dream of advising you there.” For Johnson, the persistence of women who are neither flattering nor shaggable has never stopped being hilarious. But his long-diagnosed “woman problem”, as this common-or-garden prejudice is usually euphemised, has recently taken on, thanks to difficulties entirely of Johnson’s own making, a delightful new meaning. If it’s too much, judging by last week’s evasions, to hope for poetic justice, in the shape of his subjugation by the sex he has patronised for half a century, the mortification alone is joy. While Johnson was either snogging female colleagues or declaring them unpromotable, other professional women prevailed. Now the Hulk has to answer their questions. Probably his misogyny runs too deep to allow Johnson some reflection on the possible benefits if he hadn’t presided over a frat house from which unwanted women could be summarily ejected. But if so, it will have made any impertinence on the part of middle-aged women (who may even own cats) all the more personally agonising. How agonising? Hard to say, but he once compared the horror of being overtaken by a female driver to “being treated as though you were an old woman by a young woman”. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/grilled-by-girly-swots-poetic-justice-for-man-as-misogynistic-as-boris-johnson;politics

390;390;390;390;397;397;Anthony Albanese accuses Morrison government of leaving business behind during Omicron wave;2022-01-30;['Daniel Hurst'];['Australian economy', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Australia news', 'Barnaby Joyce', 'Australian politics', 'Business', 'Coalition', 'Labor party', 'Coronavirus', 'Josh Frydenberg', 'Health', 'Aged care'];"Anthony Albanese has accused the federal government of failing to understand how badly small businesses are hurting during the Omicron wave, as the Coalition resists calls to provide extra economic support. The Labor leader said businesses were suffering from a “void of national leadership” after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, declared the government could not say yes “every time someone turns up and says I want money”. The New South Wales Coalition government announced on Sunday it would roll out a $1bn economic support package to help small- and medium-size businesses, but the payment will be capped at half of what was offered during the Delta wave.
The state treasurer, Matt Kean, said he was “very disappointed” that the federal government had declined to pour in funding. “In their absence we’re having to step up to the plate and do our bit to preserve those businesses and help our national economy,” Kean told the Nine Network on Sunday. Joyce said the federal government had “paid billions and billions and billions of dollars out” for pandemic-related programs including jobseeker, jobkeeper, stimulus to the airline industry and “it goes on and on and on”. “So I don’t think it’s penny pinching,” Joyce told Sky News on Sunday. The deputy prime minister argued the government could not “keep putting things on the credit card” and had to make “hard decisions”. But Albanese said the federal government was leaving business behind. “One of the things you notice around any shopping centre in the country is the number of empty shopfronts and business is really doing it tough,” Albanese told the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday. “You’ve had consumer confidence in decline. You’ve had people essentially imposing their own restrictions on their activity and that’s really hurting small business.”
Pressed on whether businesses should be getting more federal support now, Albanese said: “I would like to see, where the conditions are there that were the same for giving support before, why is it that this support has been completely withdrawn?” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued on Friday Australia was “transitioning to a new phase of our pandemic response” and “we’ve actually seen credit card spending in aggregate terms, 19% higher right now through January than what we saw during the Delta period”. But Albanese dismissed that argument, saying that is “because people are buying things online”. “It says it all about the treasurer and how out of touch he is, the fact that he doesn’t seem to understand how tough small business is do doing at the moment,” Albanese said. Albanese said Labor’s pledge to provide free rapid antigen tests would be subject to “limits based upon the health advice”. That could include a cap on the number of tests a person could receive each month, in order to “control supply”. “What you’ve had from this government is a ‘let it rip’ approach when it comes to the market delivering and the market hasn’t delivered.” The Labor party released a new policy on Sunday to increase Australia’s sovereign manufacturing capacity in medical essentials including testing equipment, masks, personal protective equipment and ventilators. The party is pledging to “give first priority to Australian-made medical technology for government purchases in consumables and equipment”. It also says it would instruct Labor’s promised $15bn National Reconstruction Fund “to make medical technology a top priority and work with the A Future Made in Australia Office to develop a national investment plan for healthcare essentials”. Albanese said Australia needed immediate supply “so some of that will obviously need to be overseas purchase”. “But the truth is that there’s one company in Brisbane that’s currently exporting 100,000 tests a day to the United States,” he said, referring to Ellume. “And they wanted to establish a manufacturing facility, they wanted to ramp it up here. They approached the federal government and the federal government wasn’t interested but the US government was.” When the Insiders host David Speers pointed to the fact that certain batches of Ellume’s Covid-19 home test kits had been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration in the US because of “higher-than-acceptable false positive test results”, Albanese said it was important to respect regulatory processes. “But the point here is, David, we need to manufacture rapid antigen tests here. One of the lessons of this pandemic is that we need to be more self-reliant.” The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, accused the Labor party of failing to do its “homework” before announcing “thought bubble” policies. Birmingham said the Coalition would act on advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration. “We saw today that Mr Albanese was spruiking a provider who has not yet received that TGA approval and who has faced a significant recall of products in the US,” Birmingham told reporters in Adelaide. “Now, of course, we urge that provider to continue to engage with the TGA, and if its case stacks up, it will receive approval.” The government also issued a statement claiming that Albanese’s comments about monthly limits on free free rapid tests represented a “backflip”. The health minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Angus Taylor, said Albanese’s “vague, sound-good pledge has collapsed”. Earlier, Albanese also indicated a Labor government would increase funding for aged care, without committing to specific amounts. Albanese pointed to the ongoing wage case before the Fair Work Commission, in which aged care providers and unions have quietly reached consensus on the increased complexity and value of aged care work. “The federal government should be making a submission to the commission supporting an increase in wages,” Albanese said. The Health Services Union – which is seeking a 25% wage increase for aged care – welcomed Albanese’s “hugely significant” comments. “In the short term it will lift the spirits of aged care workers,” the HSU national president, Gerard Hayes, said. “But in the longer term we need to lift wages to allow more workers to stay in the industry and stem the short staffing crisis.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/anthony-albanese-accuses-morrison-government-of-leaving-business-behind-during-omicron-wave;business and economy
404;404;404;404;411;411;Conservatives accused of ‘levelling up’ stunt to save Boris Johnson’s job;2022-01-29;['Toby Helm', 'Mark Townsend'];['Boris Johnson', 'Michael Gove', 'Lisa Nandy', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Spending review 2021', 'Gray report'];"The government has been accused of trying to manipulate announcements on extra funding for poorer parts of the UK in a desperate attempt to save Boris Johnson’s premiership. An extraordinary row blew up after Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities released a press statement – before publication of a levelling up white paper this week – saying 20 towns and cities would benefit from a “new £1.5bn brownfield fund”. The release, which named only Sheffield and Wolverhampton as recipients, said the 20 areas “will benefit from developments combining housing, leisure and business in sustainable, walkable beautiful new neighbourhoods”. Gove added that the “radical new regeneration programme” would prove transformational and deliver on the government’s flagship policy to create a more equal country. “This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.” But after the Observer contacted senior sources at the Treasury to ask if its ministers had signed off on the promised £1.5bn, Gove’s department backtracked and confessed that the “new” fund was not new money at all but would be made up of levelling-up funds that had been announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his spending review last autumn. The confusion was seized upon by Labour and other opposition parties as evidence of the lengths Johnson and his ministers are prepared to go in order to persuade Conservative MPs in so-called “red wall” seats to stick by the prime minister before the imminent publication of a report into the “partygate” scandal this week by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. If at least 54 Tory MPs write to Sir Graham Brady saying they want Johnson to go, it would trigger a vote of confidence in the prime minister. If he were to lose the vote of Conservative MPs it would mark the end of his premiership.
Shadow levelling-up secretary Lisa Nandy said the Tories had been caught out trying to spin that extra money had been found for poorer areas when the white paper actually contained nothing they did not already know about. “I don’t think Tory MPs are going to find it very reassuring when the supposed new pot of gold contains not a penny of new money,” Nandy said. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, added: “Not only is the government trying to take the public for fools, they are also trying to take their own MPs for fools. It shows the lengths they are prepared to go to keep Boris Johnson in power. It is beyond contempt.” The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the episode showed the government was not “remotely serious about levelling up this country.” Johnson has spent much of the past fortnight calling and meeting his MPs to persuade them to stick with him as the row about lockdown-busting parties has grown. One former minister told the Observer last week he had been reassured by the PM personally that his area would receive help for local industries – which had persuaded him to stay loyal. In spite of the government’s troubles, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows Labour’s lead over the Tories has shrunk to 5pts, with Keir Starmer’s party on 39% (down 2pts compared with a fortnight ago) while the Tories are up 2pts on 34%. But while the Labour bounce over partygate appears to have peaked, and gone into reverse, the party is now favoured by more voters to do a better job than the Tories on 10 out of 14 policy issues, including tackling crime and handling immigration. Both are subjects on which the Tories have traditionally been strong. On crime, Labour is now 3pts ahead of the Conservatives and on immigration it is 4pts ahead.
On Saturday night, Gray – who on Friday was asked by the Metropolitan police to make “minimal” references in her report to serious matters to do with the gatherings that the Met is investigating – was understood to have still not yet submitted her report to No 10. Sources indicated she would only do so on a day when parliament is sitting, so Johnson would be obliged to go straight to parliament to make a statement, rather than giving him a weekend to spin its conclusions to the media. One Whitehall source said he expected the report to make “uncomfortable reading for all concerned”. Another said: “Sue Gray is very clear how she wants this handled. She will hand it over on a day parliament is sitting because she believes strongly in the propriety of the process.” Meanwhile there were calls on Saturday night for the Met to be discharged from its investigation because of a “conflict of interest”. The demands came from officials tasked with monitoring the force who claim it cannot be trusted to deliver on such a politically sensitive case. Unmesh Desai, whose questioning at the London Assembly last Tuesday led to the Met commissioner Cressida Dick announcing the investigation, said an outside police force needed to take over the inquiry. Desai, Labour’s London Assembly policing and crime spokesperson, said he was writing to the commissioner this week raising his concerns that Dick’s boss is, in effect, the home secretary, Priti Patel, who in turn owes her position to Johnson. “It’s a clear conflict of interest. Wouldn’t it be better for an outside force to investigate?” said Desai, a member of the police and crime committee which scrutinises policing in London. Speaking on behalf of a number of committee members, Desai added: “You could even call in a retired chief constable to oversee it, the evidence is all there.” Johnson controversially backed Patel after she was found to have bullied staff in an internal inquiry in 2020. The home secretary has recently thrown her full support behind the prime minister over the lockdown parties. Patel had prompted further controversy last year after handing Dick a two-year extension as Met commissioner despite a series of scandals that have embroiled the country’s most senior police officer. Desai will also urge the commissioner to make sure Met officers are investigated for potential breaches of Covid regulations while deployed at Downing Street. He will ask the commissioner to “review” the Met’s diplomatic protection group, which is tasked with monitoring premises such as 10 Downing Street, amid concern they may have colluded by allowing the parties to take place.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/conservatives-accused-of-levelling-up-stunt-to-save-boris-johnsons-job;politics
425;425;425;425;432;432;‘Stranded’: horror month for Australian homelessness services as Omicron ravages sector;2022-01-29;['Luke Henriques-Gomes'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Homelessness'];"Stephanie Oatley recalls a day in late December when she needed to get a whole unit of young people experiencing homelessness tested for Covid. “We had a young person who started showing symptoms, and a second young person got an itchy throat,” says Oatley. “In the van they hopped. There was only one place open … They got there at 9am, and waited for nine hours.” Oatley is the chief executive of Platform Youth Services, which provides crisis accommodation to people as young as 12 in Sydney’s west, Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury regions. Like most sectors of the east coast economy, homelessness services have been ravaged by Omicron, leaving them without enough staff, forcing them to reduce services and to lock down their crisis accommodation. Some have been scrambling to find – and then fork out thousands of dollars on – rapid tests.
“Services feel that they have been stranded,” says Katherine McKernan, the chief executive of Homelessness New South Wales. She notes the government had acted quickly to provide hotel accommodation for the homeless during previous outbreaks. But the Omicron response has been lacking. “The processes in place for the previous lockdown have not been able to be implemented due the high number of cases and the overwhelmed health system,” she says, “and none of the arrangements for hotel accommodation provided to rough sleepers has been reinstated this time around.” In Platform’s case the situation has been particularly complex. Those staying in its crisis accommodation are aged between 12 and 17. As a result, Oatley says Covid-positive clients couldn’t move to a health hotel. Due to severe staff shortages, some employees were essentially forced to move into the crisis units during outbreaks “just to get us through”. “The big thing is staff shortages,” says Oatley. “We’d have one staff member that would come down with Covid and then nine staff would get Covid from that one case. The clients would have Covid. We’re a small service of 45 staff, we’ve had 16 key staff get Covid. “One of our houses has just been constant for three weeks,” she adds. Guardian Australia this week reported the findings of a Productivity Commission report that found that, pre-Omicron, nearly half of all people who seek help with homelessness in NSW were unable to get it.
McKernan says the “unprecedented number of cases in services” meant some services have been forced to “make really difficult decisions around reducing intake, reducing the number of clients in accommodation in order to enable clients to isolate”. She notes it’s already “unfortunately already a hugely busy time for homelessness services”. In Melbourne, Launch Housing, which runs four crisis accommodation services across the city, has been forced to twice lock down its facilities due to an Omicron outbreak.
“What that effectively means is that every time we have a Covid outbreak on site we don’t take new referrals,” says Andrew Hollows, a general manager at Launch Housing. In simple terms, an outbreak means for a short period some people who need crisis accommodation will not be able to receive it. These are, as McKernan says, “really difficult decisions”. Hollows says in these lockdown periods, Launch has been able to assist clients in other ways. “Even if they couldn’t go to crisis accommodation, they would still go to other accommodation options, or help them with financial assistance,” he says. “It wasn’t like we weren’t providing any response.” Peter Valpiani, chief executive of The Haymarket Foundation, which provides crisis accommodation and drug and alcohol services in Sydney, has done overnight shifts at its crisis accommodation as a result of the staff shortages. He says the Omicron crisis has flow-on effects for people the service assists.
“We had a gentleman that was a close contact because he lived in the same house as somebody who tested positive, and he had just gotten a job,” says Valpiani. “You can imagine someone who is putting their life together, just returned to employment, and as a close contact you can’t work.” Valpiani says the man had tested positive via a rapid test and was therefore denied access to the Centrelink pandemic payment, which at the time required a PCR test result. “He was in this position where he needed the money in order to pay his rent, to not become homeless again,” he says, adding that Haymarket offered the man financial support. Then there has been the RAT race. McKernan says Homelessness NSW and the sector had first requested access to and use of RATs as a way of supporting clients in August 2021. The NSW government is now in the process of providing services with free access to rapid tests and has indicated it will reimburse them for past purchases. But the past month has been tough, even more so for clients. Another challenge is that for some people experiencing homelessness, seven days of isolation can bring back trauma. “You’ve got people with, say, an incarceration history, so as soon as you say ‘hey, you’re locked up and you can’t leave’, that can cause sort of emotional triggers with people,” says Valpiani. “We have to do it in a really trauma-informed, sensitive way and look at ways in which we can provide bits of entertainment for people. Just to kind of get their mind off things, or to reduce anxiety.”
Importantly, all homelessness services Guardian Australia spoke to say that while they have battled outbreaks in crisis accommodation, no clients have become seriously ill or required hospitalisation. But Oatley says several rounds of isolation due to cases in the services have been tough on the young people who rely on her organisation. “Young people don’t like being contained in a bedroom,” she says. “We were lucky we had access to … Netflix, Xboxes, and we got a big donation of really good art supplies.” Oatley acknowledges that Omicron was always bound to cause havoc. But she insists the chaos that was wrought on homelessness services could have been avoided. “I think the government was just really irresponsible when they opened everything back up without the resources,” says Oatley. “That’s the sort of stuff that I got a bit frustrated with. The government has made all these decisions but without the resources to implement them.” Asked if, things have improved after a horror month, Oatley replies: “No, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. “School’s coming back. Our staff is coming back to work. We’ve got RAT tests. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. So can our young people.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/stranded-horror-month-for-australian-homelessness-services-as-omicron-ravages-sector;environment
461;461;461;461;468;468;The metaverse is dystopian – but to big tech it’s a business opportunity;2022-01-29;['John Naughton'];['Mark Zuckerberg', 'Facebook', 'Meta', 'Media', 'Social networking', 'Technology', 'Virtual reality', 'Internet', 'Social media', 'Digital media', 'Culture'];"Once upon a time, a very long time ago – until Thursday 28 October 2021, to be precise – the term “metaverse” was known only to lexicographers and science fiction enthusiasts. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. How come? Simply this: Mark Zuckerberg, the supreme leader of Facebook, pissed off by seeing nothing but bad news about his company in the media, announced that he was changing its name to Meta and would henceforth be devoting all his efforts – plus $10bn (£7bn) and thousands of engineers – to building a parallel universe called the metaverse. And then, because the tech industry and the media that chronicle its doings are basically herds of mimetic sheep, the metaverse was suddenly the newest new thing. This was news to Neal Stephenson, the writer who actually invented the term in his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. “Since there seems to be growing confusion on this,” he tweeted, “I have nothing to do with anything that FB is up to involving the metaverse, other than the obvious fact that they’re using a term I coined in Snow Crash. There has been zero communication between me and FB & no biz relationship.” In a 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Stephenson modestly said of Snow Crash that he was “just making shit up”. If so, some shit. The book is not just a great read, but eerily prescient. It’s set in a US where the government has more or less disintegrated and where everything is run by corporations that function like principalities in medieval Europe. The CIA has merged with the Library of Congress to become the CIC, a for-profit outfit that knows everything (Palantir, anyone?) The novel opens with an unforgettable car chase in which the main character, Hiro Protagonist, who works for the mafia’s pizza delivery conglomerate, races desperately to deliver a pizza on time (Deliveroo?). Failure to deliver within 30 minutes of an order being placed earns you a death sentence. So the chase is a life-and-death struggle as Hiro races his GPS-enabled electric car through the streets of Los Angeles before he runs out the clock and faces the anger of the mob. And this was written in the early 1990s.
But the really intriguing thing about the new obsession with metaverse(s) is that it seems to have missed the point that the future envisaged in Stephenson’s novel is a deeply, deeply dystopian one. His metaverse is a vision of how a virtual-reality-based internet, resembling a massively multiplayer online game, might evolve. Like many multiplayer games, it’s populated by user-controlled avatars, as well as system demons. And status in this virtual world is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one’s avatar. The irony of this metaphor being solemnly valorised by the boss of a powerful tech corporation seems to be lost on the industry. The original video in which Zuckerberg shows himself in the metaverse defies parody. “Imagine,” he burbles, “you put on your glasses or headset and you’re instantly in your home space [sic]. There’s part of your physical home recreated virtually. It has things that are only possible virtually and it has an incredibly inspiring view of whatever you find most beautiful.” It goes on like this for 11 minutes. Do keep a sick bag handy in case you decide to have a look. If it were a spoof, you’d give it full marks, but apparently it’s intended to be serious. And because Zuck is surrounded by the reality-distortion field created by vast wealth, other apparently rational tech moguls are scrambling to pay homage to his fantasy. The other day, for example, Microsoft, hitherto a serious computer company, laid out nearly $70bn of shareholders’ money to buy computer gaming company Activision Blizzard. Various rationalisations have been proposed for this splurge. The logical one is that computer gaming is a huge industry in which Microsoft already has a significant presence. Owning Activision, which makes some of the most popular titles, including Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga, would make it an even bigger player. QED. But there is another, more intriguing interpretation, which is that Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has caught the metaverse bug. For one thing, metaverses are, by Stephenson’s definition, basically immersive virtual-reality environments and the games industry specialises in creating just such environments. For another, Nadella has been heard burbling about his desire to create an “enterprise metaverse”. At which prospect, fevered visions loom – of avatars of tech moguls in pinstripe suits and chinos stalking one another in virtual boardrooms, doing battle with lightsabers. And then one realises that such folk have no need of a parallel universe, meta or otherwise. They already live in one.

478;478;478;478;485;485;Kojey Radical review – on the brink of rap greatness;2022-01-29;['Kitty Empire'];['Kojey Radical', 'Rap', 'Hip-hop', 'Music', 'Culture'];"Last year, hosannas flocked to Little Simz’s album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert like iron filings to a magnet. It was a nuanced document of black British excellence, hard-hitting and beautiful by turns. All those plaudits could serve as crib notes on the forthcoming project by yet another versatile and resonant London MC, Kojey Radical. To be clear: Simz and Radical are very different creatives with distinct voices and life paths. But in their late 20s, both have brought artistic evolution and sumptuous musicality to bear on career-defining narratives. Simz is up for four big Brit awards: artist of the year, best new artist, album of the year and best hip-hop/rap/grime act; we’ll know the results on 8 February. Fast-forward a few months and Radical’s nominations should flow. Almost a decade in the game, Radical is due to release what is officially his debut album, Reason to Smile, in March. This gig is a bijou 600-capacity warmup for all that is to come, a bridge between past and future. (He plays London’s 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy in April.) Backed by a full band, Radical has come dressed in brightly coloured shades and a hyperreal, landscape-pattern suit that echoes the big sky of his forthcoming album cover. There are fluffy clouds across his chest and a waterfall down one leg. The bass guitar is flesh-pink, an electric guitar glitters gold.
His choice of songs reflects tonight’s interim nature, with baton passing from era to era. Water, an electrifying old single from 2018, segues into War Outside, a new album track released last September. Both feature the complex lived experience of blackness, nagging choruses and signature eerie whistling. “I’m too scared to speak to God, there’s shooters in the churches now,” Radical raps on Water. War Outside finds him “sippin’ holy water while I listen to hypocrisy”. Nothing is ever straightforward in a Radical lyric, which is why he hasn’t been marketed as a more conventional grime MC. He can go as hard, verbally, as the road rappers or the drillers. But the Radical goal is advancement and healing. His body of work takes in spoken word and the African diaspora as much as it does grime and funk. And his grandstanding is not just scattershot testosterone, but reasoned argument. A few months ago, Radical put out a standalone freestyle on Link Up TV, a portal for UK hip-hop. Tonight, as then, he lays waste nimbly to the opposition. “Anything they say they done did, I done did it twice,” he glowers. “And if I didn’t do it here, I did it in another life.” In case anyone was wondering where he ranks in the pantheon of UK wordplay, Radical can call witnesses: Stormzy, Kano, Wretch 32 and Ghetts. “Stormz said I’m nice, Kane said I’m nice, Wretch said it next, Ghetts said it twice,” he seethes. “I’ve got flesh wounds bigger than you!” he barks on If Only, best known from the TV series Top Boy. Before the pandemic, Radical released Cashmere Tears, an album-length EP full of sex, sorrow and tunefulness. 2020 was supposed to be the year the man born Kwadwo Amponsah finally arrived. Covid dumped ice on that momentum and everything else. Things are so bad in the night-time economy that the National Lottery, in association with the Music Venues Trust, has funded a series of gigs – the Revive Live Tour, of which this gig is a part – to aid ailing concert halls.
Hearing many of the highlights of Cashmere Tears again tonight, Hours stands out as a Prince-level funk jam where Radical breaks out his falsetto. “Can we switch positions baby, I got something I wanna show you,” he croons. Reason to Smile follows confidently on from that era. The album title nods to mental health challenges, something Radical says tonight is “not a buzzword, not a moment, not a month” but “continuous work”. Two more of its new songs slap hard. The production on Payback is taut, all thwack and bounce, with Radical rapping about money. So far, so hip-hop, but, as ever, there are subtle points about justice being made here. “Until we multiply black wealth, fuck a statue,” he seethes. Gangsta, the final song, finds Radical sitting down on the edge of the stage. Subverting expectation once again, the song makes the case for his mother being hard as nails and worthy of respect. Again, it finds him welding a singalong chorus to some intensive work on his conscience. Despite an undercurrent of troubled righteousness, this is a rapper who examines himself as much as he eloquently critiques the systems that hold his people back.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/kojey-radical-review-live-lafayette-london-reasons-to-smile-tour;entertainment and culture
483;483;483;483;490;490;Splits in left are set to boost far-right TV pundit in Portugal’s snap election;2022-01-29;['Beatriz Ramalho da Silva', 'Sam Jones'];['Portugal', 'Socialism', 'The far right', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'World news'];"Between greeting regulars at the busy Lisbon bakery where she has worked for two decades – and reaching instinctively for their orders as soon as they cross the threshold – Susana Santos offers her thoughts on an imminent, and altogether less welcome, encounter. Like many of her compatriots, she does not relish the idea of Sunday’s snap general election, which arrives amid a stubbornly lingering pandemic and during a time of economic upheaval and political uncertainty. “They should have left things as they were. That would have been best,” says Santos, 48. “I’m exhausted. I’m tired of all this. What they’re doing is a joke.” The early election was triggered last December after the fragile, but improbably durable, deal between Prime Minister António Costa’s minority Socialist government and its allies in the Portuguese Communist party and the Left Bloc broke down during negotiations to pass the 2022 budget.
After weeks of tense negotiations, the Communists and Left Bloc eventually joined rightwing parties in rejecting the budget bill. Not only did the surprise rupture end the alliance known as the geringonça – or improvised solution – which had made Portugal a rare beacon of European social democracy, it also yielded an election that could see the far-right Chega party become the third biggest group in parliament. For Santos and for many others, the timing could not be worse. The early election will delay the approval of a new spending programme, just as the government was poised to jump-start the economy after the pandemic with €45bn (£38bn) in EU recovery funds. Since 2015, Costa’s administration has led an economic turnaround, reversing unpopular austerity measures, such as the cuts to public sector wages and pensions introduced during the European financial crisis. Last year, the government received praise for spearheading one of the most successful vaccination programmes in Europe and bringing unemployment to pre-pandemic levels. The Socialists’ track record is likely to ensure loyalty from voters such as Santos. “I’ll vote for the Socialists because I don’t earn much,” she says. “They didn’t take our subsidies or anything, so it wasn’t bad – but it hasn’t been easy.”
Others are more despondent. Armando Mendes, a 68-year-old retired teacher who now works as a private tutor, is disappointed that the election has come two years early, and pessimistic about the chances of an effective government. “I’ve never failed to vote, but I think this is a clown-show,” he says. “They’re playing games – nothing justifies this.” For Mendes, the main priorities of the next government should be strengthening the national health service – which is still reeling from the pandemic – and investing in improving the school system. He is not enthused by the prospect of another geringonça: “I don’t think any government elected without a majority will manage to get anything done.” Although the polls have shown a close race for first place between Costa’s Socialists and the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), the latter appears to be pulling ahead. A poll released on Tuesday put support for the PSD on 34.4% – up from 28.5% a week earlier – and backing for the Socialists at 33.8%, down from 38.1%. The PSD, which is led by the economist Rui Rio, has pledged to cut taxes on corporate profits and personal income, should it emerge victorious. “We have to reinforce the competitiveness of our economy,” Rio said at the beginning of January. “We have to turn our economic policy towards companies because they are the ones that create better wages and better jobs.” Costa, meanwhile, has denounced his former allies in the Left Bloc and Communist party as “irresponsible” for torpedoing his budget, and is urging voters to give him an outright majority so the Socialists can govern alone. However, neither the Socialists nor the PSD look to be on course for an overall majority, meaning that deals will have to be struck and alliances forged by whichever party wins the most votes. The same poll that gave the PSD the lead also suggested that the far-right Chega could leapfrog the Left Bloc to become the third largest force in parliament. Chega, which is led by the belligerent former TV football pundit, André Ventura, won a seat in the 2019 general election, taking 1.3% of the vote.
But when Ventura – an ally of Marine Le Pen of France and Italy’s Matteo Salvini who has repeatedly sought to demonise Portugal’s Roma community – ran in the 2021 presidential election, he attracted 11.9% of the vote. Pedro Magalhães, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, says Chega will almost certainly consolidate its presence in parliament and could even win 10 seats, thanks to a populist strategy complete with some familiar enemies. “They’ve plugged into attitudes that are either deep-seated in Portugal – prejudice against Gypsies, the perception that the entire political class is totally corrupt – or that, although they may not be widespread, are nevertheless prevalent enough to make a difference: the notions that social transfers go to the ones who least deserve it or that immigration is a threat.
“They have a solid presence in social media, good mobilisation, and the beginnings of a true party structure,” he says. “Having said that, whether they can form a parliamentary group of MPs with minimal quality and effectiveness is going to be a major test of their growth as a party.” While Rio has ruled out including Chega in any coalition, the far-right party could still play a big role in shaping and propping up a PSD government. Across the border in Spain, the far-right Vox party has proved crucial to the formation of three rightwing regional governments and is the third biggest party in the national parliament. For many voters, the idea of a powerful far right in a country that is fiercely proud of reinventing itself after the end of the Salazar dictatorship is deeply troubling. Miguel Ameixas, a mechanical engineering student in Lisbon, is still weighing up his vote. “What scares me the most is the prospect of a rightwing majority, with the far right included,” he says.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/splits-in-left-are-set-to-boost-far-right-tv-pundit-in-portugals-snap-election;politics
513;513;513;513;520;520;Labour’s Bridget Phillipson: ‘Life should not come down to luck’ ;2022-01-29;['Sally Weale'];['Schools', 'Education', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Education policy', 'Coronavirus', 'Society', 'Social exclusion'];"When we meet in the chill of Westminster Hall, Bridget Phillipson is fresh from a morning round of media interviews about Sue Gray’s much anticipated report and “partygate”. A rowdy session of prime minister’s questions has just finished and the latest government scandal involving the emergency evacuation of animals from Afghanistan is starting to take off. She has taken over the role of shadow education secretary at a time of huge political turbulence, but Phillipson’s focus on her brief is laser-sharp and heartfelt, thanks perhaps to her own experiences growing up, raised by a single mother in a council house in Washington, Tyne and Wear. “Education is my real passion,” she says, “because the great education I had at local state schools just completely transformed my life.” She excelled in her exams, went to Oxford University, where she studied modern history, and in 2010 was elected as Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South. She wants every child to have the same opportunity to thrive – whatever their background – and believes education is the great enabler. Life was sometimes tough for Phillipson when she was growing up. It has previously been reported how a neighbour, having seen seven-year-old Bridget playing outside in a jumper in mid-winter, pushed an envelope of money through the letterbox marked, “For Bridget’s coat”. Her mother, who helped found a local domestic abuse charity, was a member of the Labour party and her daughter would play under the table when she took her to meetings. “My mam brought me up on her own, so life was often quite hard for her as a single parent. We didn’t always have it easy but I was from a family where I was supported to read, where education was valued and encouraged and I look back now and feel how fortunate I’ve been. But I don’t believe life should come down to luck. And that’s where government should come in. “I saw the constraining impact of poverty and how so many children and families were let down by a government that just wasn’t interested in their lives. Many of the people I grew up with didn’t have the same opportunities that I was able to enjoy. But all too often children are held back by virtue of where they’re born, their circumstances and family background, and my priority as secretary of state would be to see that change.” When Phillipson was in primary school, the Conservatives were in power. “That was the point at which in the 80s and early 90s school resources were under immense pressure, when buildings were in disrepair, and where child poverty and unemployment locally were incredibly high, and life was really tough for a lot of families.”
She went on to St Robert of Newminster Catholic school (other former pupils include the England men’s football team’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Hairy Biker Si King). When she was in year 8, Labour took office. A member of the Labour party from the age of 15, Phillipson says she began to see changes take effect as Tony Blair’s mantra of “education, education, education” started to make itself felt in schools across the country. “It was a really wonderful school,” she says. “We were really encouraged to aim high and we were valued as people, and I think that ethos of the school has always stayed with me. “I was one of those young people who received education maintenance allowance (EMA), which just made it so much easier to stay on and study. My mother would have killed me if hadn’t stayed on anyway, but for many young people I was at sixth form with it made all the difference. “It meant they were able to get to school, they could cover travel costs, they could afford equipment and to be able to go on trips. It made a massive difference.” EMA was scrapped by the coalition government in 2010. “But also the investment that started to filter through into our schools,” says Phillipson, “the resources, the support that was given to teachers, the priority that Labour attached in government to making sure that teachers were well supported, with chances to take on new skills and develop throughout their working lives.” Phillipson, who has two children of her own, aged 10 and six, wants education to be at the heart of Labour’s offer once again, and never has it been more urgent after two years of disrupted learning because of Covid, which has put the poorest children at even greater disadvantage. “Like all parents, trying to combine working and home schooling [during lockdown] was a bit of a juggle, but I’m fortunate in that we had access to technology and I was able to help. “But I know from my community that lots of families didn’t have access to devices, didn’t have access to broadband, and the government’s plans around that were far too slow and meant that [children’s] learning, particularly in those early months, wasn’t as it should have been.” The government says it has invested £5bn in education recovery, including the launch of the national tutoring programme. Labour, Phillipson says, has set out a far more ambitious plan for children’s recovery – a £14.7bn catchup strategy, including breakfast clubs for every child, mental health support, and more small-group tutoring for pupils who need it. For the Conservatives, she says, children have been little more than an afterthought during the pandemic. “If I’d been secretary of state on the day that schools closed to most children, I would have been completely focused on making sure we had a plan for what came next. And yet here we are almost two years on and parents tell me they don’t even know that there is any kind of catchup plan for their children and the tutoring programme is reaching a dismal number of children.” It has far-reaching implications, she says. “What is often overlooked in the discussion around children’s catchup is that it matters for individual children and families but it also matters for all of us as a country. The evidence is very clear about the longer-term damage that will be caused to our economy, to wider society, to the earning potential of young people, to their opportunities and life chances, if we don’t invest now and get this right, which is why we’ve said we will make this a priority.
“The government, however, have vacated the field. They seem completely lacking in any real interest in putting in place that kind of plan. They point to gimmicks and headlines, but that’s not a proper plan for our children.” Phillipson says her priorities as education secretary would be to address the widening attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their wealthier peers, to tackle child poverty and the growing cost of living crisis for families, and ensure that every parent can send their child to a great local school. She is currently travelling around England, visiting schools and colleges to find out what is working and what is not – the day after our interview she is off to Blackburn. She is not keen to talk about selection and grammar schools, or interested in discussing school structures. On academies, she is concerned about accountability and transparency in multi-academy trusts, but is not in the business of causing upheaval where parents are happy with their child’s education, she says. She is committed to Labour’s promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but unwilling to go beyond that. “All parents want the best for their children so I’m not going to criticise individual parents for the decisions that they make.” On school inspection, she would like it to be more collaborative than punitive. “Ofsted has an important role in driving up standards for all of our children but I think we need to look at getting the balance right.” And she is worried about schools having to step in to provide food parcels and wash children’s clothes as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. “It’s wonderful that they do that, but that is not a core function of our schools and I want teachers and staff to be able to focus on delivering that brilliant education that they came into teaching to deliver. “We’re going to see hundreds of thousands of young people leaving school this year having had next to no additional support provided by the government. Schools have stepped in. They are doing all they can to make up for as much time as possible, but they don’t feel the government’s got their back.” She says Labour would be different. “We recognise the value of education. We know how important it is to the success of our country and we will always make sure that our schools and the wider sector are recognised, valued and supported.”";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/29/labour-bridget-phillipson-shadow-education-secretary-school-child-poverty;politics
520;520;520;520;527;527;‘It is desperate’: how Environment Agency staff were silenced as pollution worsened;2022-01-29;['Sandra Laville', 'Rachel Salvidge'];['Environment Agency', 'Rivers', 'Pollution', 'Environment', 'UK news'];"The internal email dropped into staff inboxes at a time when public outrage about pollution in English rivers was in full cry, generating parliamentary debates, demonstrations and mass petitions. But within the agency responsible for protecting and enhancing the environment the focus was on gagging staff with the threat of dismissal if they discussed its work both inside and outside the organisation. Chief executive James Bevan, a former Foreign Office mandarin who was appointed in 2015 to run the regulator, issued a draconian warning silencing staff after a wave of criticism about its performance protecting rivers. Staff should not, he said, “openly criticise or discredit the organisation in the media or on social media” or “disclose any confidential information in connection with the Environment Agency to anyone who is not authorised to received it”.
All breaches could lead to disciplinary action or, in serious cases, dismissal. Comments made “inside or outside work”, including derogatory statements about the organisation, managers, colleagues, stakeholders, customers or contractors, and anything that brought the agency into disrepute, or reflected on its performance, were all subject to sanction. Although pressures on the agency and its staff have grown each year as its government grant has been incrementally slashed by nearly two-thirds, this threat from Bevan marked a nadir. “It is desperate,” said Nick Measham of Salmon and Trout Conservation. “It shows a lack of confidence and suggests a very unhappy workplace.” Why Bevan felt compelled to issue his message when he did can perhaps be traced back to a few weeks before in November last year, when staff were given formal instructions to shut down and stop investigating low level pollution events, so-called level 3 and 4 incidents. The memo, seen by the Guardian, clearly laid out the dire state of the organisation’s investigative and enforcement capabilities. “We do not have sufficient funding to continue to provide our current level of environment management incident response and have made it clear to government that you get the environment you pay for,” it read. “As a result, we have decided to reduce our response to unfunded low and no impact environmental incidents.” The memo admitted this would not be popular with the public, many of whom work as volunteers to plug gaps in Environment Agency monitoring of rivers to track pollution. “This is not an easy transition and our officers and advisers are facing criticism from our customers for the reduction in our service,” it read. The axing of core pollution detection work was something environmental charities suspected had been in play for a while. Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust said: “Anecdotally we had heard for some time that they just won’t come out to a pollution incident unless there are dead fish, for example, or unless there are the right number of dead fish. But the fact that they are now formally making that policy is shocking.” For frontline staff, the individuals whose task is to go out and investigate pollution, identify polluters and make them accountable, it was, insiders said, another example that their work was not a priority in the EA. Multiple and repeated complaints to managers had been made internally about the move away from frontline responses for some time, the Guardian has been told. Some staff have carried on doing the work, only to face reprimands from managers. Insiders point out that attending level 3 and 4 pollution incidents can prevent higher risk pollution incidents in future. A staff survey carried out in October and November reflected the dismay, revealing increasing levels of workplace stress and low morale, with staff struggling with their mental health. After 26 years as a statutory regulator the agency has moved in the last two decades away from its frontline enforcement and monitoring role. In 2009 it changed its policy to allow water companies to self monitor their own discharge and report breaches, rather than their own staff visiting and taking their own independent samples. The conviction of Southern Water last year for deliberately discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea, and covering up its actions by very significant under-reporting of the pollution, has not led to a change in this policy. As government funding for its environmental protection work continues to decline; from about £170m in 2009-10 to £94m last year the gaps are increasingly being filled by charges to the industries and businesses the agency regulates, including water companies and waste firms – £330m in 2021/2. Whistleblowers speaking to the Guardian say the money within the agency has shifted as a result from the officers investigating and monitoring pollution to middle managers dealing with the businesses being regulated who increasingly provide the funding for its work. Between 2013 and 2018, monitoring of water quality in freshwater environments was halved from 10,797 sites to 4,656, according to data collated by Salmon and Trout Conservation and a farmer can only expect a visit from an EA officer once every 263 years, by the agency’s own admission. “These management teams now appear to be directly funded by businesses we regulate, at the expense of the teams that are tasked to carry out the investigation and enforcement,” said one insider. “The overall feeling is that this has not happened by accident but that water quality is no longer a priority and the environment in most cases is expendable,” another source told the Guardian. “There appears to be a direction aimed at working alongside water companies, industry and agriculture, rather than regulating them. The EA is as far removed from the polluter pays principle as it has ever been, and what is most concerning is that this appears to be by design.” Prosecutions by the agency in the decade to 2020 have fallen dramatically. Civil sanctions, known as enforcement undertakings, have increasingly been used since 2010; they are a voluntary legally binding agreement that avoids anyone being held criminally responsible and instead requires an offender to pay a financial contribution towards the environment.
“We have a situation where court actions for water offences brought by the EA fell from 235 in 2002 to 20 in 2019 to three in 2020,” said Caroline Lucas, the Green MP and member of the parliamentary environmental audit committee. “Something is clearly going wrong and there is a clear conflict of interest when the agency is left so dependent on income from the permits paid for by the very companies that it’s meant to be regulating.” Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental consultancy E3G, said the shift in policy was the result of a deliberate political plan to weaken environmental regulation by stealth. “The agency is set up in statute so any effort to close it would require primary legislation, which would run into a hurricane of opposition,” he said. “By taking away its budgets and independence you get a nice label for the gutless business service organisation we see today.” Increasingly, however, the response of the public seems to chime with the apparent frustrations and discontent of frontline staff. From residents who live near polluted landfill sites to river users pushing for cleaner waterways to coastal communities setting up their own groups to monitor the regular discharges of raw sewage by water companies, the view is the agency is not doing enough to stop pollution, bring polluters to account and protect the environment. As Amy Slack of Surfers Against Sewage told MPs recently: “We have never seen greater awareness and appetite for change as we are now … people do not want to be swimming and playing in polluted water and are generally shocked when they find out the extent of the problem.” An EA spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency delivers a massive amount for the country – like the rest of the public sector we operate within a tight budget and must prioritise to ensure we are doing the best we can, with the money we have, for the people and places we serve.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/it-is-desperate-how-environment-agency-staff-were-silenced-as-pollution-worsened;environment
566;566;566;566;574;574;John Terry: captain, leader, legend … and head coach of Ape Kids Club FC | Barney Ronay;2022-01-28;['Barney Ronay'];['John Terry', 'Football', 'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)', 'Jack Wilshere', 'Sport'];"As the transfer window enters its endgame there has been a familiar sub-plot over the last few days, another chapter in the ballad of Ousmane Dembélé. This is the strangest of sporting lives. Dembélé is only 24. He joined Barcelona for £96m as long ago as August 2017, one of several deals that were steroid-fed by the state of Qatar’s inflationary lust for Neymar. In the years since Dembélé has essentially become a prisoner of money. Barcelona can’t afford to keep him. Nobody else wants him on those ruinous terms. His career has dissolved into a kind of gilded stasis, a thing that only really comes alive as the biannual sub-industry of failing to sell Ousmane Dembélé cranks into gear.
At the end of which he is no longer primarily a footballer, more a kind of sub-prime bond, a human debt-vehicle, too hot to hold, too hot to pass on. Dembélé has become non-fungible: an asset whose value is circumscribed and non-transferable; and also a symbol, a token of Barcelona’s wild financial hubris. That journey inside the machine is complete. Here is a footballer who has literally become a non-fungible token. And yes this is a roundabout way of getting on to John Terry and the strange affair of the Ape Kids Club, an entity that manages the amazing feat of being even weirder than it sounds on paper. Things kicked off on 19 January when Terry tweeted “Hi Guys Sorry to keep you all waiting but very excited to announce my signing with the AKFC!”. OK then! Except, Terry isn’t actually a signing. He’s listed as “co-founder” of this enterprise, which is basically a website that leverages football to sell generic computer drawings of cartoon primates to children.
Ape Kids Club currently has 112,000 Twitter followers plus a tonally strange, slightly stay-away-from-the-weird-man website. It seems to be styled on the slightly more established Bored Ape Yacht Club, which sells adult ape pictures (do keep up), and which Reece James has separately endorsed. The idea here is to create a buzz, a sense of something exciting and must-have, craved by celebrities. Willian is on board. Ashley Cole is “glad to be a part of it”. The tall, self-important man off Dragons Den could barely contain himself at the thought of cartoon digital ape pictures marketed at children: “Love the project! I’m IN.” Best of all perhaps, most poignant, most telling, were the words of Jack Wilshere: “Thanks JT, buzzing to see this incredible journey bringing football to the blockchain”. Ah yes. The blockchain. And if you’ve got this far, by now some annoying questions will be nagging away at you, no doubt. How do you actually “sell” online pictures of apes when the internet is an open digital field? Why would anyone actually want one? And how much of a child-centred celebrity pyramid scheme is it? This is where non-fungible tokens come in. NFTs are an interesting concept, a way of making a piece of online data into an actual thing: unique, robust and stored in an online safe called the blockchain. These tokens – for example, an ape picture that John Terry says is good – can be treated as tradeable possessions because everyone agrees that despite being basically lights on a screen they have a unique existence.
It raises a metaphysical conundrum. Can an object with no relationship to the physical plane have intrinsic economic worth? After all money itself is just numbers on a screen. But money is fungible, it converts into things. The numbers are networked and finite. Whereas NFTs ask you to make a larger mental leap into the conspiracy of abstract value, based in the ghost world of electronic objects, screen life, the digi-verse. At the end of which John Terry is selling your kids a picture of a monkey in a football kit. In fact, not even a picture, a link to a picture, and something, somewhere is just starting to feel a bit, well. Is this OK? John? Can you get Jack on about the blockchain again? One key point about NFTs is that these are often a skilled piece of work by a well known digital artist. People want to buy them as originals. This feels like a convincing version of the future. By contrast the ape kid drawings are generic. Their value lies in Terry and other footballers feigning excitement and lending their names. Fair enough. The shops are full of trinkets and crazes. Why should we care about this one? First because it is a volatile, unregulated product, a pyramid of assumed value that could simply collapse at any moment. Do you even own the copyright to your image? And while we’re at it the football authorities are at the door asking about their imagery and intellectual property.
Plus of course there is the issue of personal interests. NFTs are sold in part as a chance to speculate. Here is an investment that rich and influential footballers are enthusing over. But why are they doing that? Terry is not a fellow purchaser-investor. He’s the owner. He’s the salesman, weaponising the persuasive powers, the deep loyalties of football to sell a speculative semi-product that only really seems like a good idea if it can afford to throw a little money against the wall. Otherwise the risk, well, the risk is all yours, kids. And beyond that there is something a little sad about all this. What is John Terry doing here? What part of him saw the words “In a magical world where apes ruled the metaverse, a magical thousand-year-old tree sprouted cute baby apes” and thought: yes, that’s me. That’s what I want to hitch my club legend status to. Terry has taken his Uefa pro licence, has spoken of building a body of work as a manager. Right now his social media profile avatar identifies him as the Head Coach of Ape Kids Club FC.
Perhaps it was inevitable football would be drawn into this. Players are always being sold stuff. They exist in a world of deals and haggles and niche investments, a place where the moment must be wrung out, where value is mutable and tantalisingly uncertain. Look up from your bespoke on-screen token and, who knows, you might even catch a glimpse of Ousmane Dembélé, floating in his tin can, prestigiously static, gaining value, losing value, still sealed within his own faraway magical land.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/28/john-terry-chelsea-ape-kids-club-nfts;sports
574;574;574;574;582;582;Prime minister, as a refugee I have done everything Australia has asked. Nine years on, why am I still in detention? | Mehdi;2022-01-28;['N/A'];['Australian immigration and asylum', 'Scott Morrison', 'Refugees', 'Australia news', 'Nauru', 'Human rights', 'Australian politics'];"Last week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about whether it was appropriate some refugees had been held in Melbourne’s Park Hotel for eight years after he had earlier claimed not everyone detained there is a refugee. In his response he referenced Mehdi, a member of the persecuted Ahwazi Arab minority in his homeland Iran, who had been speaking out about the conditions after Novak Djokovic was briefly detained in the same hotel.
I didn’t make the statement that every single person was who was in that place was not a refugee. I said that was, to my understanding, the case with some people who were there. There are a number of people who were at that facility who have not been found to be owed protection. … I’m aware of one particular individual who has been the comment of this focus of a lot of attention, who is on such a pathway, and I would be encouraging them to take up that permanent option that is available to them in the United States. We provided it, we secured it, we got it in place. And so if they wished they could go to the United States along that pathway. And that’s what we are encouraging them to do. This is Mehdi’s response: Mr prime minister, I have some questions I’d like to ask you. I came by boat as an unaccompanied minor to Christmas Island on 22 July 2013. Nine months later, when I was sixteen years old, you sent me to Nauru. You were my legal guardian. I experienced many hardships and difficulties in Nauru, and in 2019 I was evacuated to mainland Australia for medical treatment under the Medevac laws. I was hospitalised and diagnosed with PTSD. Now, I have been held on Nauru and in detention in Australia since 2013. I have marked nine birthdays detained by your government. I am currently in Melbourne’s Park Hotel. How does keeping me in detention help to heal the trauma that I have because of detention itself? In a recent interview, you were encouraging us to take up the permanent resettlement option in the US that you had secured for us. I respected your advice on this a long time ago when I took that option and applied. I was approved, and I had done everything required of me.
Now I wait, but why must I wait in detention? If I’m about to go to a third country as a refugee who has never committed a crime, don’t you think it would be easier for both of us if I waited in the community on a bridging visa, as most people who came by boat are? You say we came to this country illegally, but Mr prime minister, I don’t understand the harmony between “illegal” and “immigrant”. I am a refugee, and I’ve been given refugee status. But let’s talk hypothetically, as if I did come here illegally and was not a refugee. Don’t you think, for a “crime” I committed as a fifteen-year-old, that by now I would have served my time? Mr prime minister, the residents of this building are desperately in need of freedom. Some of them think about committing suicide every night before they go to sleep. The residents of this building wake up cold, sweating and scared from nightmares and after a sigh their horror turns to pain because they find themselves in a real-life nightmare. The air in this cage is too heavy to breathe and my lungs for a long time haven’t had the chance to smell the air as a free man. From what I am aware of about Christianity, I believe it is based on mercy and forgiveness. Does this beautiful religion accept the humiliation of an innocent human by insulting their values and dignity and imprisonment for 3,104 days for no crime? I am drowning in my dark thoughts, in a room where everything is repetitive, and as you know, repetition when placed next to despair, leaves nothing of human desire for life. The worst part of each day is trying to sleep and get rid of another day of life.
I have never felt this close to liberty of life. There’s just a piece of glass between me and freedom. By my window there is a life and all I’m asking is to have that life as a free man with self-determination. Mr prime minster, I have been detained by Australia since 2013. I was a child who experienced a lot of difficult times and was deprived of my legal and natural rights. I ask you now to open the door of this cage and let me enjoy walking in the streets without Serco guards on all sides and handcuffs around my wrists. I ask you for freedom and justice. Mr prime minister, I am a simple young refugee with simple questions. I have never had any answers for them in all the time I have lost in detention. These most formative years of my life were supposed to be spent choosing a pathway for my future. Instead, my life was wasted in detention. My youth is being lost in detention. As you are aware, I have been speaking out about my story and what I have been through. I am not doing this to create some kind of change. I am doing this because I am desperate. I ask you now to consider my questions and finally set me free. Let me take a walk in the streets and breathe the air of freedom. Nine years is too long for a child who came here in pain and asked this country for help.

597;597;597;597;605;605;Investment in adult literacy could play a major role in ‘levelling up’ | Letters;2022-01-28;['N/A'];['Literacy', 'Education', 'Children', 'Teaching', 'Secondary schools', 'Poverty', 'Schools', 'Society', 'Inequality', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"In her review of the TV programme Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51, Lucy Mangan notes that there are 8 million adults in the UK who struggle with reading. Also, as about 25% of state school pupils do not meet the expected reading standards by the age of 11, it seems that things aren’t going to improve any day soon. In 1999, Sir Claus Moser was commissioned by the government to produce a report on adult literacy and numeracy (known as the Moser report). In this he concluded that 23% of adults in this country had low literacy skills and recommended a national strategy to improve the situation. However, despite successive governments having spent billions of pounds on a variety of programmes to rectify this, in almost 25 years there has been little or no improvement. If we really do wish to “level up”, surely this is the one area where resources should be directed. One thing the investment in these various literacy projects has thrown up over the years is a huge amount of practical evidence, which can point the way to how future programmes could be successful. With 22% of the population living in poverty, it is surely the time to recognise the old adage and not just “give a man a fish” but to teach him to fish so that he may feed himself and his family for life. Improving adult literacy (and numeracy) is the starting point. Sue Hunter Brockenhurst, Hampshire • Like Lucy Mangan, I was moved by Jay Blades’ account of his struggle to read. I too weep at the numbers who fail, but I would take issue with the educational psychologist who stops short of explaining this failure by simply quoting the correlation between poverty/free school meals and illiteracy. It is not poverty or lack of parental support that causes a child in school to fail to read. In my experience as a special educational needs teacher, it was those factors which prevented many children from breaking through the far more damaging pressure of being forced to learn to read and write too young. No other language culture in Europe expects children to code and decode written language before they are six or seven years old. Our children have their confidence destroyed by being required at the age of four or five to read and write a language they have barely mastered speaking; that and the doctrinaire and narrow teaching method of synthetic phonics.

No further details have been disclosed, with the club requesting that McCall’s privacy be respected. The former Ireland international has been in charge at Saracens for over a decade, guiding the club to five league titles and three European Champions Cups. They currently sit second in the Premiership, eight points behind leaders Leicester ahead of Sunday’s visit to Wasps, and could yet qualify for the knockout stage of the European Challenge Cup.
The 54-year-old also steered Saracens through their season in the Championship in 2020-21 following their relegation for breaching salary cap regulations. Under his stewardship the club clinched the European and domestic double in both 2015-16 and 2018-19. McCall is understood to have been at Saracens’ training ground this week but, for now, overall control of first-team affairs will pass to head coach Joe Shaw and assistants Dan Vickers, Kevin Sorrell, Ian Peel and Adam Powell.
“People will always come first at our club and Mark will be given all of the support and time he needs,” read the Saracens’ statement. “Mark is obviously more than confident in the coaching team he has worked with for many years to temporarily take the reins.” McCall has repeatedly made clear that Saracens believe in collective leadership. “We were very determined when this began years ago that the club would never be reliant on one person,” he said last year. “It would be a very poor organisation, a very average organisation, which does that.” Saracens also have the benefit of being able to select Mako and Billy Vunipola this weekend alongside fellow England internationals Ben Earl, Alex Lozowski and Alex Goode. None of the quintet have been included in Eddie Jones’s squad for the forthcoming Six Nations.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/saracens-director-of-rugby-mark-mccall-taking-short-break-for-medical-reasons;sports
613;613;613;613;621;621;Tony Heath obituary;2022-01-28;['N/A'];['Newspapers', 'Magazines'];My father, Tony Heath, who has died aged 96, was a journalist, local politician and campaigner for justice. Over more than 30 years he wrote for newspapers and journals including the Guardian, Independent, Observer, New Statesman, New Society and Private Eye. Writing for Tribune magazine in August 1973 as its education correspondent, he was the first person to use the term “Thatcherism”, signposting its shortcomings as a political philosophy. He wrote: “It will be argued that teachers are members of a profession which must not be influenced by political considerations. With the blight of Thatcherism spreading across the land that is a luxury that only the complacent can afford.” One of two sons of Jimmy Heath, a pit foreman at the Tredegar colliery, and Kathleen (nee Harding), Tony was born in Tredegar, south Wales, and went to the local school. He was called up for second world war service, and took part in the D-day landings. On 25 April 1945, he was serving with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars Armoured Corps on the outskirts of Bremen when the Sherman tank he was in took a direct hit from a German tank. Tony managed to bail out but saw his best mate, Eddie Moulding, trapped and burned to death. Tony’s hearing was permanently damaged and for the rest of his life he suffered nightmares about what he had witnessed. After the war Tony took part in the clearing-up process, including escorting trains from one sector in Berlin to another to exchange supplies. On his return to Britain he worked for PR companies in London. His last PR job was for the American-owned advertising agency Foote, Cone and Belding in Baker Street. His departure followed his decision to take a day’s leave and hand out leaflets at the FCB entrance calling for the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam. In London he met Dorothea Smither (nee Hill), a widow with two sons, who was then working as a fashion model. They married in 1954 and settled in Reigate, Surrey. In the 1960s Tony was elected a member of Surrey county council for the Labour party. He gave vociferous support to staff from the Guildford School of Art who in 1968 were sacked by the council for having supported a student sit-in. In 1974 my parents upped sticks to Blaenau Ffestiniog, north Wales, where Tony resumed his career as a journalist. In the 1980s, reporting for the Guardian on the second homes bombing campaign and the Sons of Glendower nationalist movement, he was tipped off that a cache of arms from Ireland would be landed at Black Rock sands in Gwynedd in the small hours. As he hid in the dunes and waited for the boat, his watch was interrupted by armed Security Service personnel who wanted to know what he was doing there. Possibly alerted by their bright lights, the boat never arrived. My father never formally retired and his byline continued to appear in various publications when he was into his 80s. Dorothea died in 2012, and Tony spent the last nine years of his life in a residential home in Hay-on-Wye. Tony’s brother, Peter, predeceased him. He is survived by me.;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/tony-heath-obituary;entertainment and culture
649;649;649;649;657;657;All of Us Are Dead: Netflix’s Korean zombie show will blow you away;2022-01-28;['Stuart Heritage'];['Television', 'Horror (TV)', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Zombies', 'South Korea'];You’d think we’d be absolutely dripping in zombies by now, wouldn’t you? It feels a fairly obvious genre for TV shows to get into at the moment. After all, look where we are. We’re in the third year of a once-a-century pandemic that has ripped its way across the entire planet without pause, killing millions and devastating families. Sound familiar? Honestly, swap out a dry cough for a ceaseless undead thirst for human flesh and Covid is a zombie analogue. It’s not as if we’ve been reluctant to use them in the past. The original Haitian archetype used zombies as a metaphor for the dehumanisation of enslaved people under French colonial rule. Over the years, Hollywood has dusted them off to symbolise everything from consumerism to McCarthyism to immigration to globalisation to emotional stuntedness. Maybe in time more producers will use zombies to make sense of the Covid era. But for now we’re going to have to make do with All of Us Are Dead, Netflix’s new South Korean zombie drama. Which isn’t such a bad thing, because it’s great. Set in and around a Korean secondary school, All of Us Are Dead is your classic zombie outbreak story. A girl gets bitten by a lab rat, and then she, in turn, bites a classmate, and, before you know it, the whole city is overrun by mutilated, gargling zombies. What keeps it fresh, though, is the setting. Having high school students as the main characters is a very clever move. Flung about by their hormones, the students’ oversized reactions to the situation heightens the mood of the show. And the fact that they’re always preoccupied with their own stuff, no matter how apocalyptic things get, means that the story can tick along nicely independently of the zombie horde. Watching All of Us Are Dead, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was designed as a Covid metaphor or whether, just like every other vaguely disaster-themed film and show of the last two years, it was simply a case of bad timing. My feeling is that, even if it was the latter, it went to great pains to reverse-engineer itself to our times. Here, the zombies are created by a virus and – by dint of the fact that it’s set in a school – we get plenty of GCSE-level infection talk. Most pressingly, however (and I need to be coy for fear of spoiling it), this is a virus that behaves like Covid in one key way. That’s as much as I can get into, but it’s the masterstroke of the series. God, South Korea is good at this sort of thing. This is the third Korean Netflix original in just a few months to blow me away. And while it won’t repeat the planet-crushing success of Squid Game – nothing will, not even Squid Game season two – it still reverberates with the same winningly doomy existentialism of Hellbound. Of course, they were going to crush at zombies too. Anyone who has seen Train to Busan will know that South Korea are world beaters when it comes to telling stories about the undead. That said, I still have to confess to being on the fence about long-form zombie stories. As much as everyone liked The Walking Dead, I still prefer my zombie stories to be told in the form of a finite movie. The very best zombie movies – and Train to Busan is a perfect example – gets the premise out of the way neatly and quickly, before breathlessly shoving its characters through a series of obstacles before (if we’re lucky) extinguishing all hope of survival just before the credits roll. Meanwhile, All of Us Are Dead is about 12 hours long. There are only so many things that you can do with a zombie story, and this show doesn’t invent any new moves, so we do spend a lot of time repeating the same basic scene set-up. The biting. The sneaking. The saying goodbye to the newly infected before their humanity evaporates. It’s a testament to the power of the characters, here, that this carousel of secondhand tropes never quite manages to slip into tedium. You can even forgive All of Us Are Dead for hedging its bets at the end, too. As I’ve said, my favourite zombie stories are the ones where all of humanity gets swamped and there is no escape. All of Us Are Dead seems to have been written with a second season in mind, so things don’t end in an especially satisfying way. But, hey, if that means there’ll be more of this, bring it on. We have to take our zombie stories where we can find them these days.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/all-of-us-are-dead-netflixs-korean-zombie-show-will-blow-you-away;entertainment and culture
663;663;663;663;671;671;What wines to drink with Chinese food | Fiona Beckett on drinks;2022-01-28;['Fiona Beckett'];['Wine', 'Food', 'Chinese food and drink', 'French food and drink', 'British food and drink', 'Lunar new year', 'Life and style'];"With lunar New Year being celebrated next week, there’s a chance you might be having a Chinese meal over the next few days, but I wonder what you’re planning to drink with it. Wine-wise, at least, the same suspects – usually off-dry whites such as riesling and gewürztraminer – tend to get trotted out all the time, so I was particularly interested that this week’s guest contributor Amy Poon and her husband, Michael, who happens to work in the wine business, suggested some different options to go with her recipes. With the wok-roasted char siu, they went for a Saint-Estèphe, suggesting Château Capbern (Laithwaites, 15%), Château Meyney (Majestic, 13.5%) “to balance the rich, smoky flavours of the pork” (though, at £28 and £35.99, respectively, neither is what you’d call cheap), or a traditional Loire red such as a chinon or bourgeuil. And for her father’s classic zha jiang noodles, they recommend a rosé champagne or an English sparkling wine such as the Woodchester Valley in today’s pick. It depends, of course, on the type of Chinese food you’re eating. Supermarkets are still relatively conservative with their ready meals, so if you’re having sweet-and-sour chicken or chow mein, riesling might well be the answer, after all. But there are many dishes with which you could drink a red – the Chinese themselves are particularly keen on bordeaux, and in recent years have invested heavily in the region. Given that a range of dishes may be on the table at the same time, I find it most helpful to look at the overall style of the food, rather than individual dishes. If you’re having dim sum or delicate seafood dishes, for example, crisp, dry whites such as pouilly-fumé or sparkling wines tend to work best. Fizz is also good with anything deep-fried such as spring rolls and prawn toast. With more savoury, umami-rich dishes such as duck or braised meats, on the other hand, I’d definitely be inclined to drink a red. As well as bordeaux, I like a good pinot noir, although with the likes of beef in black bean sauce, I’d go for a bolder red such as a grenache. Meanwhile, with spicy dishes – mapo tofu or a chilli-spiked hotpot, say – I’d be more likely to drink the very forgiving grüner veltliner below , or a lager. And if you’re on the last couple of days of dry January, the 0.5% Lucky Saint would hit the spot. Another good alcohol-free option is sparkling tea, which I’ve mentioned before. I’ve just come across a delicious limited-edition one from Saicho called Eight Treasures. At £32.99 a bottle, it’s definitely not cheap, but it is made from a rare oolong and is beautifully packaged, so it’s ideal for a New Year gift.
Three wines to see in the new year
Woodchester Valley Brut Rosé 2018 £28.95 Woodchester Valley, 12.5%. Deliciously fruity, with a heady aroma of freshly picked strawberries and raspberries (so a good choice for Valentine’s Day, too).
Château Jouanin Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux 2019 £9 larger Co-ops, 13.5%. An appealingly soft, fruity bordeaux that would work really well with crispy duck pancakes.
Rainer Wess Grüner Veltliner Kremstal 2020 £9.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%. Austria’s grüner veltliner is a really versatile white that could take you through a whole range of dishes.

Beijing has spent seven years preparing to become the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games, after it narrowly beat Almaty in Kazakhstan in a two-horse bidding process in 2015. There are 15 sports to enjoy and 109 gold medals to be won, from the thrills and spills of alpine skiing to the endurance races of biathlon and cross-country. There’s the artistic beauty of ice skating, the high-tempo discipline and risk of speed-skating, and the aggression of ice hockey to look forward to. Plus the quadrennial rediscovery that they really do use brooms in curling. And our daily briefing will be there with you every step of the way, bringing you up-to-date results, a preview of what is to come in the 24 hours ahead, and the best of the writing from our team on the ground in China.
If you are receiving this via email and weren’t expecting it, it will be because you previously signed up for our Tokyo 2020 daily briefing for coverage of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics last year. I hope you’ll want to stick with it and join me for our Winter Olympics coverage too, but we appreciate you maybe aren’t interested. If so, it is easy to unsubscribe from the footer of the email, and hopefully we’ll see you back again for Paris 2024. Here’s a selection of some of the preview pieces and Beijing news for the Games we’ve been running over recent days: 15 Winter Olympians from around the world to watch Ellia Smeding named as 50th and final Team GB athlete Charlotte Bankes leads medal hopes of GB snowsport squad Fifteen Team USA athletes to watch at the Beijing Games Protesting athletes ‘face punishment’, suggests Beijing official
China says it is ready for a Winter Games demonstrating the Olympic movement’s newly-enhanced motto “Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together”, but the ongoing threat of the Covid pandemic and the diplomatic boycotts and expected protests over the host nation’s human rights record are sure to feature in the story of these Games. And once again Russian athletes will be competing under the neutral banner of “Russian Olympic Committee” rather than as a nation – as a result of the Wada ban for state-sponsored doping offences.
What to look out for next Like the summer Olympics, some of the sporting action actually gets going before the opening ceremony. Here’s what you can enjoy on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday next week. Times in the Beijing briefing are all going to be local. For Sydney add 3 hours, for London subtract 8 hours. If you are in the US then for New York it is -13 hours and San Francisco is -16 hours. Wednesday 2 February 8.05pm Curling – the very first session sees four mixed doubles, round-robin matches, including Sweden v Great Britain and the US v Australia 🥌 Thursday 3 February 9.05am and 2.05pm and 8.05pm Curling – there are more mixed doubles match-ups across three sessions 🥌 6pm and 7.45pm Freestyle skiing – first the women’s and then the men’s moguls qualification 1 takes place ⛷ 12.10pm and 4.40pm and 9.10pm – the women’s ice hockey preliminary round pool matches begin – the US play Finland in the day’s final game 🏒 Friday 4 February 8.35am and 1.35pm Curling – Australia face Great Britain in the afternoon session as the mixed doubles, round-robin match-ups continue 🥌 10.02am and 11.41am and 13.22pm Figure skating – there are three sessions of figure skating, starting with the team event – men’s single skating, short program, followed by the ice dance, rhythm dance and pair skating short program, also in the team event ⛸ 12.10pm Ice Hockey – two more matches from the women’s pool stage – including Denmark v the hosts 🏒 8pm Opening Ceremony – Beijing’s National Stadium – known as the Bird’s Nest – will once again stage an Olympic opening ceremony, which is sure to be spectacular ✨✨✨

703;703;703;703;712;712;Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness review – the most zany teacher you could wish for;2022-01-28;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];"What is television? After watching Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness (Netflix), I don’t think I know any more. This series is a spin-off from the Queer Eye star’s podcast of the same name, in which Van Ness quite literally gets curious about a topic, then speaks to various guests about it. The podcast is long-running, well-established and very charming, but the question of whether it needed to become a more visual experience is yet to be answered. Van Ness is clearly a star. The former hairdresser made their name with the extremely funny Gay of Thrones online recaps, and went on to become part of the new Fab Five on the updated, much improved Queer Eye makeover series, which is always good for a cathartic cry and a renewed sense of faith in humanity. Van Ness is the one participants often open up to, usually while having their hair spritzed. Amiable, warm and an impressive interviewer, they give the impression of someone who genuinely wants to listen and learn. They are also excitable. All of this sets them up well to host an all-sorts, magazine show. The first episode, Are Bugs Gorgeous or Gross? (we’ve all wondered), makes it seem as if the whole thing will play out like a high camp, low-budget take on The Green Planet. It sees Van Ness speak to a range of experts and entomologists about the importance of insects; if you can maintain a sturdy stomach while watching a termite queen do her thing you have more resilience than me. “That’s really cool,” coos Van Ness, though I’m not sure I believe them. It’s a high-octane mix of facts, footage and parody. Van Ness regularly pops up dressed as an angel or a devil, to declare that a bug is “Gorgeous!” or “Gross!” At one point, Drag Race star Monét X Change appears to co-host a spoof red carpet event, shouting about the “realness” of the bugs who are walking it. It is busy and discombobulating, but finds its voice pretty quickly. For all the fun snippets about insects and Van Ness’s willingness to get stuck in (they actually do get stuck in, when a chef serves them insects), it eventually swerves into a more nuanced zone – if you can call a choreographed dance routine about the cultural history of hairstyles featuring Angela Davis and Elizabeth I nuanced. The rest of the episodes are more suited to Van Ness’s open-hearted and zany approach to learning, with frank discussions on, officially, hair, snacks, the gender binary, skyscrapers and figure-skating. Below the surface, though, these end up as empathic explorations of identity. The episode about gender – Van Ness identifies as non-binary – features that rare thing, an onscreen discussion about non-binary people, between non-binary people, that is not adversarial. “Literally can’t talk,” Van Ness manages to say, clearly moved by the experience. There is much to recommend. Academics with unusual specialisms are great value on television, and seeing people’s unbridled dedication to wigs or spiders or 18th-century paintings is always entertaining. Van Ness is a delight to watch, so easy in conversation with strangers, and their wide-eyed enthusiasm is infectious. Their conversation with the congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, about Pressley’s relationship with her hair as a Black woman, and her experiences with alopecia, is unusually intimate for an interview with a politician. Perhaps a guest spot on Newsnight would not be a terrible idea. What’s curious, though, is that as a podcast, this format is fantastic, and if Van Ness released this show on YouTube, I would fully accept its giddy, scattergun energy. I watch Netflix on the same browser, and the same screen, but something about it here feels like a less easy fit. Does that mean this is television or not? I still don’t know. Maybe Van Ness can answer that one in another series.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-review-the-most-zany-teacher-you-could-wish-for;entertainment and culture
714;714;714;714;723;723;Gove requests review of spiralling insurance for flats with unsafe cladding;2022-01-28;['Ben Quinn'];['Insurance industry', 'Construction industry', 'Business', 'Grenfell Tower fire', 'Michael Gove', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Housing', 'Society', 'Financial Conduct Authority'];"A review of the “crippling” insurance costs faced by residents in some buildings with unsafe cladding is to be undertaken by a watchdog, at the request of the government. Michael Gove, the communities minister, has asked the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to establish within six months why insurance premiums have shot up for many customers while work started after the Grenfell tragedy to remove cladding from many sites. Despite investment and work to identify and tackle cladding safety defects in existing blocks, and a continuing decrease in the instances of fire in multiple-occupancy buildings, he said building insurance premiums had increased dramatically for almost all leaseholders in blocks of flats. “I am also concerned to hear that many insurers seem unwilling to offer new policies, forcing people to shop in a more limited marketplace with more restrictive terms or less coverage; in many cases, trapping people with their current provider,” Gove wrote in a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The minister said he shared the view of many policyholders who, “understandably”, do not view the market as offering accessibly priced, widely available insurance. “The market lacks transparency and there is not currently useful data to explain the rationale behind the increasing premiums charged by insurers and the conditions associated with the cover. The role and remuneration of brokers, managing agents and freeholders is also unclear.” The FCA said it had issued two letters on Friday, one to the CEOs of all the insurance firms and the other to insurance intermediaries. “Although insurance premiums are just one aspect of the rising costs faced by residential leaseholders in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy, we want to ensure products provide fair value and premiums fairly and accurately reflect risk,” the FCA said in a statement. It said that its letters outlined the work it was doing, which included examining firms’ approaches to pricing for multi-occupancy buildings and whether elements unrelated to risk, such as commissions, were increasing costs. Firms were also reminded of their obligations under FCA rules, including to consider the costs borne by leaseholders, when determining whether a product was fair value. It added: “We are asking firms to consider what actions they can take to help leaseholders, whether individually or by identifying collective solutions as an industry.” A government review into building regulations after the Grenfell Tower fire – which killed 72 people and injured more than 70 – concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, with cost prioritised over safety. A national ban was introduced on using combustible cladding on new buildings, and sprinklers became mandatory on new builds of more than 11 metres.
The full cost of fire safety work on all affected blocks has been estimated at about £15bn. By June last year the government had committed an estimated £5bn through the Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings. But under the leasehold system in England and Wales the cost is often borne by individual flat owners, some of whom have been struggling with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and high fees for 24-hour “waking watch” fire patrols. Last week, Gove threatened a UK trading ban on manufacturers of combustible cladding and insulation unless they paid to fix dangerous housing, giving companies a March deadline to agree a settlement. In a letter to the industry, he highlighted more than £700m in profits made over the past four years by the three firms most closely associated with the Grenfell disaster – likely to mean Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan, which made the combustible cladding panels and insulation foam on Grenfell Tower. Earlier this year, Britain’s biggest housebuilding companies told the government they must not be the only ones to pay the potential £4bn cost of fixing fire safety problems in blocks of flats. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said its members recognised and sympathised with challenges faced by leaseholders and welcomed Gove’s request to the FCA. James Dalton, director of general insurance policy at the ABI, said: “The cost of buildings insurance reflects the significant fire risks associated with many multiple-occupancy residential buildings, which go beyond cladding under a building control system that has been found to be ‘not fit for purpose’.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/gove-requests-review-of-high-insurance-costs-for-flats-with-unsafe-cladding;business and economy
723;723;723;723;732;732;The Glow review – myth and history collide in a sci-fi spine-tingler;2022-01-28;['Kate Wyver'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Alistair McDowall', 'Royal Court theatre', 'Vicky Featherstone'];"With a slowly unravelled mystery at its centre, Alistair McDowall’s uncanny new play delights in alien time fractures, the chaos of humanity and the unifying feeling of intense loneliness. This is, essentially, a rag-tag episode of Doctor Who. We start with a Victorian medium (an elegantly cruel Rakie Ayola) attempting to contact the dead. When the woman she’s using in her experiments (a chained-up, mud-splattered stranger stolen in the night, played by Ria Zmitrowicz) appears to become possessed, the medium takes it as confirmation of her powers. But she has simply lucked out with her victim, choosing a woman whose being is connected to death and a world in-between time.
The short first half of The Glow is acutely strange. It is equal parts spooky and funny, with blunt dialogue and dreamy lighting. Vicky Featherstone’s production has great control in the way it slowly feeds us information, toying with the confusion it creates as myth and history collide. As we gradually learn more about the woman, Merle Hensel’s brutalist set shifts: the walls close in, time contorts, and the characters begin to glitch and overlap. “Like static,” a character played by the wonderfully comic Fisayo Akinade says, talking about the spirit world. “We’re wrapped around them.” As well being unnerving, The Glow is, for a long time, unmoving. The projected landscapes with dates in bold type, spanning from the end of the 20th century back to 500,000BC, are impressive but synthetic and cold. The temperature changes when Ayola returns as retired nurse Ellen in the 1990s, her character bursting with warmth towards the strange woman on her doorstep. Suddenly the play swells, and McDowall lets love seep in. Not everything works: a knight’s underdeveloped quest slows the action, although his presence allows an entertaining scene where a baffled Ellen patches him up after a sword fight, trying not to ask too many questions. Sci-fi is too rarely done on stage but here McDowall has chosen the perfect medium. How better to tell a story about the perils of immortality and the fear of carrying on alone than through an art form built for impermanence, with stories that can live longer than we do?

727;727;727;727;736;736;The Afterparty review – Tiffany Haddish murder mystery doesn’t quite kill it;2022-01-28;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];"The Afterparty (Apple TV+) is one of those “oh, it’s them from that thing” shows, packed to the gills with comedy stars who have appeared in better series or films. Originally conceived as a film about a high school reunion by Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street creators Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, it has been transformed into an eight-part murder mystery, with each episode adopting a different genre depending on the character we are following. Tiffany Haddish plays Danner, the detective who puts herself in charge of investigating the crime. Smart and starry? What could go wrong? Not much, as it turns out, but its fundamental decent-ness is to its detriment. A group of old classmates are getting together for their 15-year reunion, and in among the archetypes is Xavier, formerly known as Eugene, now a famous rock star and actor whose sole purpose seems to be to mess with the heads of the people with whom he went to school. (Dave Franco plays him with ample slime and ooze). But Xavier ends up falling to his death from the balcony of his beach-side mansion, where the reunion’s afterparty has been taking place. Cue the arrival of Danner and her sidekick Culp (Search Party’s John Early, underused in the early episodes), there to grill the attendees and work out whodunnit. The partygoers’ testimonies offer up a cinematic kaleidoscope of stories. Like Stephen Merchant’s The Outlaws, this plays on the idea of each character being a well-known type. It opens with an extended episode on “adorkable loveboy” Aniq (Veep’s Sam Richardson), who designs escape rooms for a living. He is there to win back his mid-divorce high-school crush, “uptight artist girl” Zoë (Zoë Chao), who gets her own animated episode later. His episode is mostly rom-com, with a brief diversion into arthouse fare. But given that it has to establish the plot and style of the series, it has a lot of heavy lifting to do. It is busy with fun ideas and good performances, but lacking in pace. Even at 48 minutes, the opener feels far too long. It lacks the comedic punch to be truly funny and tries too hard to be funny to have dramatic heft. It cautiously puts one foot forward, then whips it back again.
It was a wise move to launch this show with three episodes (the rest will follow weekly). Once it has set the scene, the instalments fall back to a more manageable and more flattering half-hour or so. Brett, Zoë’s ex-husband (Mindy Project alumnus Ike Barinholtz) gets his own action movie, which you could have guessed from the neckline on his leather jacket and his Matt Damon hair. The more bombastic scenes – car chases, handbrake turns, punchups with bouncers – are interspersed with his efforts to be a good dad, and it works surprisingly well. A literal pissing contest between him and Xavier hints at a surreal, slightly gross, very silly comedy that only appears sporadically. It could have benefited from more like this. The third episode stretches the show’s muscles again, giving Yasper (Parks and Rec’s Ben Schwartz) a musical in which he sings his feelings and gently mocks Hamilton’s My Shot with a song called Two Shots. It is all classy to a fault, but for all of its smart ideas, it doesn’t quite ignite. Each episode is an impressive achievement, in that it looks like a lot of work went into it, but I was left admiring that work, rather than immersed in the story. With all those stars, and the ability to borrow from every genre, it should zip along. Instead, it chooses to meander. Still, it is watchable, not least because we won’t find out who the culprit is until the final episode, and there’s a lot of fun to be had in guessing which genre each character will find themselves embroiled in. Stath Lets Flats’ Jamie Demetriou has a small role as running gag Walt, whom nobody can remember, and Broad City’s Ilana Glazer is Chelsea, the former queen bee who had “a total breakdown” and is acting erratically. This is enjoyable, steady, perfectly fine. But it is also classic prestige streaming service television, in that it is a little overdone, a little overlong and lacking the touch of ruthlessness that would have made it excellent.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/the-afterparty-review-apple-tv-tiffany-haddish;entertainment and culture

Daniel Kokotajlo’s devastating debut feature is drawn from his own experiences growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness. Ivanna (a performance of quiet desperation from Siobhan Finneran) and her daughters Luisa (Sacha Parkinson) and Alex (Molly Wright), who has a serious blood condition, are dutiful members of a religious group in Oldham. But when Luisa falls pregnant by her non-believer boyfriend, she is “disfellowshipped” – cut off from her family and community. This act, and a subsequent tragedy, pick away at Ivanna’s life of unquestioning devotion, as the rigid rules of the faith stymie her love for her child and sense of humanity.

Before the Big Brother house and WandaVision’s Westview there was Seahaven, a pretty US coastal town where Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) and his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) live – watched 24 hours a day by 5,000 cameras. In Peter Weir’s prescient 1998 satirical drama, Truman is the unwitting star of a hit TV reality show (and has been since birth), his every move tracked and manipulated for our viewing pleasure. But reality comes crashing in, and Truman has to choose between the perils of the unknown and comfortable picket-fence conformity. Saturday 29 January, 6.55pm, Great! Movies *** Dead of Night
This 1945 portmanteau film is one of the greats of British horror, if only for the chilling final segment of its five tales-with-a-tale. The brilliant Michael Redgrave plays a tormented ventriloquist whose dummy starts to get ideas of its own about their partnership. The other stories – directed by the likes of Robert Hamer and Alberto Cavalcanti – feature a haunted mirror, premonitions of death and child ghosts in country houses, plus the bonus of Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne basically reprising their Charters and Caldicott double act from The Lady Vanishes.

Norman Jewison’s 1967 crime drama is the late Sidney Poitier’s finest film – a fiery denunciation of racism wrapped up in a gripping murder mystery and decorated with a superb jazz-blues soundtrack from Quincy Jones. Poitier is Virgil “They call me Mister” Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective passing through rural Mississippi who is roped in to helping bigoted sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger) investigate the death of a white industrialist. Poitier is magnetic and permanently on the boil, while Steiger nails the difficult shift from resentment of Tibbs to respect. Sunday 30 January, 10pm, BBC Two *** Lady Macbeth
Florence Pugh first showed what a major talent she is in William Oldroyd’s dark 2016 drama, set in the north-east of England in the 19th century. She stars as the wilful young Katherine, married off to the son of a mine owner, whose feelings of neglect and humiliation push her into an affair with groomsman Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) – which nothing will stop her from enjoying. Interesting racial subtexts (a Black maid is rendered literally voiceless) add depth to a passionate, potent work. Monday 31 January, 11.50pm, BBC Two *** Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?

Justin Kurzel’s impressionistic period adventure takes on Peter Carey’s Booker prize-winning novel about Australia’s near-mythical antihero Ned Kelly, and makes a good fist of the attempt. George MacKay plays Ned, whose hardscrabble upbringing in a poor Irish immigrant family leads him inexorably into criminality – events he writes down in an effort to keep control of his own narrative. Essie Davis is a fierce presence as Ned’s mother Ellen, while Russell Crowe has a nice cameo as Harry Power, Ned’s mentor in the ways of the bushranger.

737;737;737;737;746;746;You be the judge: should my wife stop nabbing all the best biscuits?;2022-01-28;['Georgina Lawton'];['Relationships', 'Biscuits', 'Diets and dieting', 'Life and style', 'Food', 'Family', 'Baking'];"The prosecution: Hans Alicia eats the chocolate biscuits too fast. My upbringing means I want them to last longer We get sent a package of around 50 homemade shortbread biscuits by my mum and dad each year. Some are covered in cornflakes, others are made with marzipan and syrup, but some are covered with chocolate. They are the most delicious and our favourites, but my wife, Alicia, always eats them too fast. If I have something delicious, I want to enjoy it for the longest time possible. I like to evenly distribute my joy – I don’t eat all the best biscuits first. So I’ll take a chocolate one, then next time I’ll choose one with cornflakes or marzipan and syrup. It prolongs the joy of returning to a chocolate biscuit – you can save them for bad times.
But Alicia has a completely different attitude. She wants all the good stuff now before it’s gone. The result is that we usually run out of the best biscuits too quickly. I will say each year, “Leave me some of those chocolate ones, I haven’t had many yet” and her response is, “Well, as long as they are still there, they are up for grabs.” But I don’t want to eat the best ones on her schedule; I simply want them to last longer. It makes sense to distribute them properly, but in our home if I don’t eat them quickly, I don’t get any. To keep up with her I would have to force myself to eat them more quickly, but that’s no fun. Sometimes I’ll ask her not to eat them as fast, but it doesn’t resonate. Also, the biscuits come from my family, so really I should get the most say. I grew up making these biscuits with my parents when I was a boy, so they are special to me. I was raised in a disciplined household and I’m used to being methodical. As a child I would eat my sweets a lot slower than my siblings. I just like to maximise my joy. I don’t want to speed up my biscuit-eating habits: why can’t Alicia try slowing hers down?
The defence: Alicia Hans thinks you should save the best ones for later – but I am just not that restrained I think Hans likes having the biscuits there for the sake of it. The box is full for the first couple of weeks, so he has ample opportunity to go for what he wants. Sometimes I say, “If you want a chocolate one, eat a chocolate one.” But weirdly, he will go to the box and take another, normal biscuit. He says he doesn’t want to be forced to eat the good ones when I say so. I find it strange because Hans complains about not having access to the chocolate ones, but then when I encourage him to take one, he doesn’t want to. Perhaps he enjoys torturing me – or is he trying to teach me a lesson in self-discipline? Recently, we got down to the last two chocolate biscuits in the box. I’d had mine and I was waiting for Hans to have his since he’d complained that I’d eaten too many good ones. But it took him a whole eight days to take his chocolate biscuit! Every time I went to the box, it was there, staring back at me, tempting me. Last year the tension was heightened because my family came to our house to visit and we offered them some biscuits. The best ones disappeared more quickly because everyone likes the chocolate ones the most. It’s normal human behaviour to go for the best option first. It’s like with the chocolate selection boxes at Christmas – you just expect the nicest ones to be eaten first, you’re always left with the bad ones by the end. Hans has grown up thinking that you should save some good stuff for bad times ahead, whereas I’m not that restrained.
I don’t have a huge sweet tooth, but when chocolate is in the house I do eat it quickly. If Hans wants some, I have to leave his bit in his study because if I see it in front of me, I will eat it. I think it’s silly to count out all the biscuits each year. Hans needs to stop rationing the biscuits. If they are there, just go for it. The jury of Guardian readers Should Alicia show some restraint with the chocolate biscuits? I understand Hans wanting to savour the chocolate biscuits and not gorge on them immediately. But leaving one for eight days is an extreme test of self-control, a legacy of his disciplined childhood. Why not ask his parents to send only chocolate biscuits and sack off the marzipan and cornflake ones? Vic, 54 Alicia is aware Hans grew up in a strict household and should let him eat the biscuits as he pleases. He is gracious to share them, albeit painstakingly. Though, Hans, I have to say, “Life is short, enjoy the simple pleasures, tomorrow isn’t guaranteed!” Kate, 30 Hans wants these biscuits to be eaten in precisely the way he thinks is correct. While they have some emotional importance to him, this feels rigid and uncompromising. It’s not as if Alicia is wolfing them down as soon as they arrive. He should try to relax a little. Peter, 52 I am sympathetic to Hans’s methods, but it’s not on Alicia to help maintain his discipline. I suggest he sets some biscuits aside to enjoy at his pace, or attempt a more challenging self-discipline: helping Alicia maximise her joy while he’s maximising his own. Ehab, 26 Alicia is not guilty. She doesn’t eat all the best biscuits– she encourages Hans to eat them, but he doesn’t. If Hans wants to save his share of the best ones, he could put them into a separate tin, then eat them at his leisure.

744;744;744;744;753;753;Knight rides to England’s rescue with day two century in Women’s Ashes Test;2022-01-28;['Geoff Lemon'];"[""Women's Ashes"", ""Australia women's cricket team"", ""England women's cricket team"", 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', ""Women's cricket"", 'Sport', 'Australia news']";"When Australia resumed batting at 327 for seven on the second morning of the Canberra Test match, Plan A was to push on towards 400. With Jess Jonassen and Annabel Sutherland batting in positions far below their ability, this was realistic. But as England swung the ball and took wickets under heavy cloud, things changed with a hasty declaration. Plan B was to make the most of those same bowling conditions. With England 38 for two at lunch and 120 for six at tea, only Heather Knight’s outstanding innings of 127 not out stopped it working like a charm.
Australia added only 10 runs in 7.1 overs to the overnight score, declaring at 337 for nine rather than sending 18-year-old fast bowler Darcie Brown out to join debutant leg-spinner Alana King with the bat. Sutherland was bowled for eight by a Katherine Brunt special that swung past a defensive shot to hit the top of off-stump, before Jonassen edged behind on two. That gave Brunt figures of five for 60 and Amy Jones a sixth catch, equalling the record in a women’s Test innings set by England keeper Lisa Nye in 1992. As much as Australia’s bowlers produced a concerted performance, sloppy batting from England played its part. Lauren Winfield-Hill scored one boundary through the cordon before throwing a bottom-handed slice at width from Brown, edging to Beth Mooney at second slip. Tammy Beaumont’s high backlift, honed for attack in white-ball formats, left her looking vulnerable in defence, and so it proved as Ellyse Perry decked a ball in to hit her on the back thigh before the bat could intercede. With Beaumont gone for five, a score of 23 for two was still better than Australia’s first-innings start of four for two. But where the Australians had combined restraint with counterattack from that point to keep the score moving, England ground to a halt. Perry bowled seven overs straight off the top of the innings, giving little away, but fellow seamers Brown, Sutherland and Tahlia McGrath all offered short wide balls on occasion that were rarely put away.
Nat Sciver made 15 from 42 before one of Sutherland’s mediums jagged back off the seam, taking the inside edge to the wicketkeeper as Sciver tried to protect her stumps. Sophia Dunkley started slowly before hitting three boundaries but was also out for 15, hanging out her bat to Perry and chopping on to her stumps from the last ball before drinks in the middle session. Amy Jones made a slow 13, eventually trying to pull a Sutherland delivery that was not short enough, top-edging wide of mid-on where Brown made up ground to take an excellent diving catch. In the meantime, England’s captain was left to do the job on her own. After a couple of early sliced drives, Knight looked impeccable. She worked singles from the pace of Brown, drove stylishly to the on side when King overpitched, and played the pull shot and cover drive well against seam. By the time the fifth wicket fell, Knight had 56 of England’s 118 runs. The follow-on mark of 188 now looked distant, and more so when Brunt, batting too high at No 7, was lbw playing back to the leg-spinner. That meant that King, Sutherland and Brown had each taken their first Test wicket in the innings. But Knight was not giving up, even as Charlie Dean and Anya Shrubsole popped up cheap catches from spin. The captain was on 92 when Sophie Ecclestone joined her at 169 for eight, and the left-arm spinner kept her company until Knight was viciously swishing her bat through the air in celebration of her second Test century. With that done, the pair sailed past the follow-on, then past 200, in an unbroken partnership of 66.
It made for an extraordinary scorecard: when Ecclestone drove a boundary down the ground with 10 minutes to go in the day, Knight was on 121 and Ecclestone had become the first of her teammates in the innings to go past 15. There will be much more work for the pair to do on the third day, with Ecclestone on 27, and England 102 runs behind at 235 for eight. But given how the day had gone until that stand, things could have been much worse. There are still two days to see who can plot a road to victory from here.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/heather-knight-hits-century-to-rescue-england-on-day-two-of-womens-ashes-test;sports
758;758;758;758;767;767;The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window review – a bewilderingly bad spoof;2022-01-28;['Chitra Ramaswamy'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Drama'];Let’s get the title out of the way first because it’s a silly one. Intentionally silly, though, which makes it OK. The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window (Netflix) – and don’t expect me to type that out in full again if you want any actual review in this review – is a mashup of psychological thrillers such as The Woman in the Window and The Girl on the Train. This is not a genre often parodied, and for good reason it turns out. Anyway, you don’t need to be a 2010s thriller fan to guess the softly lampooned cliches that lie within. The woman on the edge who looks like she has never been within 10ft of any actual edge, the sexy suspenseful vibes, and the hot guy who may or may not be a murderer. What’s really creepy about this “darkly comedic”, “built to be binged” limited series is that its title is the only spoofy thing about it. Otherwise, TWITHATSFTGITW, starring and executive-produced by the usually funny Kristen Bell playing it bewilderingly straight, is not funny at all. Nor is it serious. It doesn’t seem to know what it is. A meta-spoof spoofing a stab at a spoof, perhaps? Ultimately – and I’ve watched all eight episodes – this tonal confusion makes it ludicrous at best and at worst disturbing. And not in the way creators Rachel Ramras, Hugh Davidson and Larry Dorf intended. The first minute and 20 seconds are satirically quite promising. Anna (Bell), A Woman in a Dressing Gown (signpost: depressed but still sexy), is thwacking raw chicken breasts with a tenderiser to an eerie refrain of Rain, Rain, Go Away. Opening a can of Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup. Making the most unappetising dinner seen in a psychological thriller since the bunny got boiled in Fatal Attraction. Which took decades of simmering before it was collectively digested as a misogynistic trope. Now that is disturbing. “My husband used to tell me that I have an overactive imagination,” Anna says in a hammy English accent, crowbarring the unreliable narrator trope in nice and early. She drinks too much. Never wears a jacket then complains of the cold. Speaks in a British accent even though she’s not British. Then she switches to her actual American accent. I’m afraid this is as funny as it gets. There are more jokes in Rear Window. The rest of the opener is a scene-by-scene precis of all that it aims to send up. Anna is falling apart. She drinks bottle after bottle of red wine, without ever appearing to be anything other than sober, bright-eyed and white-toothed. She’s addicted to pills. She hears bumps in the attic and spends most of her time obsessing over the handsome stranger and his nine-year-old daughter who have moved into the house across the street. It’s all so tonally flat that intentionally awful lines such as “There’s so many layers to casseroles. Just like there are so many layers to a person”, end up just being awful. The reason for Anna’s breakdown? Her daughter died three years ago in what we discover were the most horrific circumstances imaginable. Oh, and the neighbour is grieving his dead wife, too. This, to me, is not solid spoof subject matter unless you really, really know what you’re doing (and even then …). Since her daughter’s death, Anna’s marriage has broken down and her career as a promising artist is over. Although, having seen her work, which covers the walls of her fifty-shades-of-turquoise home, this is no tragedy. (Even this confused me: is Anna’s awful art part of the satire? Or is it actually supposed to be good?) What we’re not meant to do is wholly trust her. Anna pitches up at the school gate in her dressing gown and slippers, despite no longer having a child to drop off. And she has visions. She sees her dead daughter playing in her bedroom, even asks her for a kiss, which her daughter declines: “Because I’m dead.” “How do I keep forgetting that?” Anna sighs. It’s supposed to be darkly comedic, but it doesn’t land because it’s true. We do keep forgetting people we love are dead after they die. It’s part of the distressing but also magical landscape of grief. Is there a way of making a genuinely suspenseful “darkly comedic” psychological thriller based on characters propelled by bereavement? This is the niche and slightly ridiculous question I found myself asking after watching TWITHATSFTGITW. Maybe Simon Pegg and Nick Frost could have pulled it off in the 00s, but it hasn’t happened here.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/the-woman-in-the-house-across-the-street-from-the-girl-in-the-window-review-a-bewilderingly-bad-spoof;entertainment and culture
777;777;777;777;786;786;USA inch closer to Qatar after workmanlike win over El Salvador;2022-01-28;['N/A'];['World Cup 2022 qualifiers', 'USA', 'Football', 'US sports', 'Sport'];Antonee Robinson broke through a freeze in the air and the US offense, scoring a big goal in the 52nd minute that lifted the Americans over El Salvador 1-0 on Thursday night and kept them on track for a return to the World Cup. The narrow victory on a 29F night that tied the record low temperature for a home American qualifier boosted the US to 18 points with five games left. The US have two more chilly matchups in the next week and can move to the verge of a berth with victories on Sunday against Canada in Hamilton, Ontario, and Wednesday against Honduras at St Paul, Minnesota. The final three qualifiers are in March. Canada remained top with 19 points after their 2-0 win over Honduras on Thursday night, Mexico have 17 points after beating Jamaica 2-1, and Panama have 14 followed by Costa Rica with nine. El Salvador are left with six and have virtually no chance to reach this year’s tournament in Qatar. The top three nations qualify, and the fourth-place team advances to a playoff against the Oceania champion, likely New Zealand. Winning home games is a key, and the Americans have won four of five matches on US soil, stumbling only in a draw against Canada in September. Robinson scored after Weston McKennie played a long ball down the right flank to Tim Weah, who let it bounce three times as he ran past Roberto Domínguez and Eduardo Vigil. Goalkeeper Mario González made a sliding block, and the ball rebounded to Jesús Ferreira. He headed it across the goalmouth and Christian Pulisic let the ball bounce past him to Robinson, who kicked it in with his left foot from eight yards for his second international goal. Robinson did a forward flip and a backflip to celebrate, adding to the backflip he performed after scoring the tying goal in the 4-1 win at Honduras in September. Matt Turner took over in goal from Zack Steffen, who remained in England because of a bad back, and didn’t have to make a save. Turner played following reports he will move next summer from New England to Arsenal. The US Soccer Federation scheduled the match in a cold climate to minimize travel and put the chill on El Salvador, which went to a sporting goods store to purchase additional winter gear. The Americans’ 15th straight home win over El Salvador since 1989 didn’t come easily. They outshot El Salvador 8-3 in the first half but put none on target. But the offense followed its pattern: The US have scored 11 of its 13 goals in the second half. González leaped to parry Yunus Musah’s goal-bound shot three minutes after Robinson’s goal. He also stopped a 12-yard shot by Robinson in the 65th. El Gráfico, a Salvadoran sports newspaper, headlined the match “En una hielera”. Translation: “In a freezer”. Snow flurries fell during warmups and the temperature was the same as for the “Guerra Fria” win over Mexico at old Columbus Crew Stadium in February 2001 and the Snow Clasico victory over Costa Rica at Commerce City, Colorado, in March 2013. US players had electric heated cushions on the bench and refreshments of chicken broth and cider. The locker room temperature was set unusually low to acclimatize the team. Defenders Walker Zimmerman and Chris Richards were the only starters for either team to wear short sleeves. About 12 minutes in, El Salvador’s Enrico Hernández went to the bench and took off his thermal underwear. Pulisic, McKennie and Tyler Adams started together for just the second time, the first time since a March 2019 exhibition against Ecuador. Ferreira was a surprise pick at forward over Ricardo Pepi, scoreless in 12 matches for club and country since 7 October. Ferreira was high with an angled 10-yard shot with his left foot in the 16th minute. The best US chance of the first half came three minutes later, when Adams, Musah, Sergiño Dest and Weah combined on a quick attack that left Ferreira open in front of González only to misfire over the crossbar with his right-foot flick.;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/usa-el-salvador-canada-honduras-world-cup;sports
788;788;788;788;798;798;AEC preparing to combat Trump-style misinformation in 2022 Australian election;2022-01-27;['Paul Karp'];['Australian election 2022', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news', 'Social media', 'Facebook'];"Social media companies should commit to taking down unauthorised political material in agreed timeframes to combat misinformation in elections, according to the Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers. At a briefing on the 2022 election on Thursday, Rogers said the Australian Electoral Commission still relies on social media companies to “do the right thing” but would push for a “detailed agreement” in future. Rogers also warned that any misinformation about the result of the election “would be not only be disappointing [but] outrageous”, suggesting the AEC will take a hard line in the event of any baseless Trump-style claims of a stolen election.
The AEC is preparing its biggest and most complex election yet, a $400m exercise that will employ more than 100,000 workers to help 17 million enrolled Australians to vote during a global pandemic. Rogers told reporters in Canberra that voters would face “larger wait times” at polling places due to Covid health measures including check-in QR codes and social distancing. The AEC is making vaccination a condition of employment for its temporary workers, but has no power to mandate vaccination for others, including party workers or volunteers who scrutinise the counting of ballots. The experience of mid-pandemic byelections in Eden Monaro and Groom suggests a huge growth in postal voting at the 2022 election, while prepoll voting has been trimmed from three to two weeks by legislative changes made before the pandemic. Depending on how close the election is, more postal votes could mean the AEC has to wait for the full 13-day period for ballots to be returned before declaring the result in more seats. Asked what would happen if sections of the community questioned the result, as occurred in the 2020 US presidential election, Rogers replied that Australia has one of the most transparent and fair election processes in the world. “If we see some of the stuff we’ve seen in overseas jurisdictions … that would be not only disappointing but frankly outrageous. “If there is that sort of outrageous misinformation … We’ll certainly defend the process and [we have] very broad powers to advise the public, parliament and the government on everything to do with the ballot.” Rogers said the AEC had no role “censoring anyone” and Australians have a “right to believe and say” things including “the Earth is flat”. Although it has no role in assessing the truth of political material, misleading voters about the process of voting is an offence, and the commission also takes a “fairly assertive stance on social media” by countering misleading claims, he said.
AEC officials said that social media companies swiftly take down material that lacks a political authorisation declaring its source, but material that allegedly breaches social media companies’ policy can take longer to remove. Rogers said that the Electoral Council of Australia and New Zealand is working on a protocol with Digi, an industry group representing major search and social media companies, to include standards on take-down times. “In the long term we’ve got to get that in place … On the broader point about is there a detailed agreement, in the long term, my own view is there has to be, including very, very clear and timely standards for take-down,” he said. Labor has criticised Facebook for refusing to take down fake news about the “death tax” claims made against it in the 2019 election campaign.

Despite a push from crossbench and independents for “truth in political advertising” laws, the government has not considered new laws to ban false claims.

794;794;794;794;804;804;Wales set to lift most Covid restrictions after passing Omicron peak;2022-01-27;['Steven Morris'];['Wales', 'Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'Mark Drakeford', 'Welsh politics', 'Health', 'UK news'];"Many more Covid restrictions are being lifted on Friday in Wales, allowing nightclubs to reopen and some rules on social distancing to be scrapped. But people will still be obliged to wear masks in most indoor places and on public transport while Covid passes will be needed for larger indoor events and gatherings. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said Wales was moving fully into alert level zero because the country had passed the peak of the Omicron wave. He said: “There are encouraging signs that cases of coronavirus may be starting to stabilise. But we all need to continue taking steps to stay safe – unfortunately the pandemic is not over yet. “We are moving to alert level zero and we will retain some important protections, such as face coverings in most indoor public places. Under the new regime: • Nightclubs can reopen. • The general requirement of 2m social distancing in all premises open to the public and workplaces will be removed. • The rule of six will no longer apply to gatherings in regulated premises, such as hospitality, cinemas and theatres. • Licensed premises will no longer need to only provide table service and collect contact details. The Covid pass will continue to be required to enter larger indoor events, nightclubs, cinemas, theatres and concert halls. • Working from home will “remain important” but it will no longer be a legal requirement. • Businesses, employers and other organisations must continue to undertake a specific coronavirus risk assessment and take reasonable measures to minimise the spread of coronavirus, which may include 2m social distancing or controlled entry. • Face-covering rules, which apply on public transport and in most public indoor places will remain in force, with the exception of hospitality settings such as restaurants, pubs, cafes and nightclubs. • Everyone must also continue to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus but the Welsh government has reduced the self-isolation period from seven to five full days. The Tories said it was positive there will be more freedoms, calling the restrictions that have been in place since Boxing Day “cruel and clinically unnecessary”. The shadow health minister Russell George said: “However, this does not mean the pain ends for all those who lost out due to the recent overzealous restrictions. Welsh hospitality traded a third down compared to England since Boxing Day.
“The Labour administration in Cardiff Bay must tell the public when there will be no more alert levels in Wales as with normality in touching distance, we need dates on when we can learn to live with the virus with no further threats of lockdowns to deal with hypothetical variants. “This means removing harmful business restrictions, making face masks a matter of choice and self-responsibility, and scrapping coercive, ineffective, and pointless vaccine passports that still have no proof that they work. “While we are moving closer to freedom, we cannot forget that while restrictions such as vaccine passports remain in Wales, we are being limited by a Labour government in a way that stifles economic growth and creates social resentment.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/wales-set-to-lift-most-covid-restrictions-after-passing-omicron-peak;health
802;802;802;802;813;813;Dragan’s den: meeting Southampton’s new billionaire owner;2022-01-27;['Shaun Walker'];['Southampton', 'Serbia', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Two days after Southampton held Manchester City to a 1-1 draw at St Mary’s last weekend, the club’s new majority owner, Dragan Šolak, looks extremely pleased with his purchase. It was “an absolutely supreme performance playing against probably the best team in the world”, says Šolak, visibly excited by memories of watching his new team end City’s 12-match winning streak. Born in Serbia and based in Switzerland, Šolak met the Guardian in a suite of offices tucked away in an elegant apartment block in central Milan, one of many places he spends time, he says. He plans to attend as many Southampton games as his travel schedule allows.
Before the Southampton purchase, Šolak almost never gave interviews and shunned the public eye. “I really like being a private person, and hopefully I’ll go back to that soon,” he says, speaking fluent English in a booming voice, accompanied by expressive hand gestures. Šolak’s estimated £1.4bn wealth is mainly derived from the 33% stake he retains in United Group, a Netherlands-based company he built from scratch that controls media assets across the Balkans. He agreed to answer questions about Southampton, but what he really wanted to talk about was the political situation in his home country, where Aleksandar Vučić, now the president, has continually tightened his grip on the media since he first became prime minister in 2014. “My focus is really to put the light on the media freedom situation in Serbia,” says Šolak, whose news channel N1 is now in Vučić’s crosshairs. “I think Vučić is making a case of how a dictator can, by playing nice and polite, get really far in Europe,” he says, railing at those in the EU who back Vučić. The Premier League is a player in this story too, with Šolak’s cable network losing out on the rights in a bidding war last year, after state-controlled Telekom Serbia put in an enormous bid. The logic, Šolak believes, is to use football to draw people away from his cable packages, and thus his critical news channels. Šolak insists his decision to buy Southampton was unconnected to losing the Premier League rights, noting he had wanted to get involved in elite sport for some time, but the timing is certainly intriguing.
He is the lead investor in Sport Republic, which bought 80% of the shares in Southampton from the Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng for about £100m. Sport Republic was set up by Rasmus Ankersen, Brentford’s former co-director of football, and Henrik Kraft, formerly a partner at the private equity firm KKR. Kraft told Šolak about the project and its plans to obtain stakes in football clubs, and Šolak came on board almost immediately. When they then told Šolak about plans to make an offer for Southampton, he was even more excited, he recalls. The whole process took less than two months. “It would be difficult for me to think of a better fit of a club,” he says. “It’s a club that likes to develop players, it’s a club that’s engaged, it has a great fanbase, a very family oriented club and a nice location.” They also play in red and white, the same colours as Red Star Belgrade, the team Šolak grew up supporting. Šolak is coy about exactly how much more money Southampton might now have to play with, but he is clear that the previous situation, where any acquisitions had to be funded from player sales, was no longer the case. “We will really try to give the club support to have really proper planning, management and development of talent. I can’t tell you how much money that would cost or not, but definitely we’ll give adequate support to the team,” he said. He has met Ralph Hasenhüttl and the pair struck up an immediate rapport. “After spending some time with him, I can say I really like him and he’s really smart,” Šolak says. “He loves players, he loves spending time with players and loves developing players.
“Hopefully, with the increasing support that we would like to give him and the team, he should be able to develop it into really a top‑10 team.” Šolak will not be involved in the day-to-day of running the club (Ankersen will be the chief executive and Kraft the chairman, he says), but he hopes to have an input into strategy. Born in the town of Kragujevac in 1964, Šolak moved to Belgrade to study electronics at university. He dropped out to focus on business opportunities, which were burgeoning as Yugoslavia’s communist regime was tottering in the late 1980s, and in 1990 he started one of the first production businesses in the country. When Yugoslavia disintegrated and the war in Bosnia began in 1992, he moved away. “I knew I was Serbian but I was raised more as a Yugoslav, so I didn’t really feel that war was something I could understand and I left the country in 1992,” he says. Šolak spent nearly a decade abroad, in Prague, London and Ljubljana, where he mainly worked in intellectual property and copyright. In 2000, he set up a small local cable television network back in his home town, and with international funding was able to grow it rapidly.
Over the years, the business expanded both geographically and in terms of content. In 2014, it became United Group, and KKR became its new owner, which is how Šolak met Kraft. In 2019 they sold it to another private equity firm but Šolak retained his 33% stake. Serbia accounts for only 10% of the group’s revenues but it is clear the situation in his home country is infuriating for Šolak, who no longer travels there because of security concerns. When news of the Southampton deal became public, Serbia’s prime minister, Ana Brnabić, attacked Šolak on Twitter, claiming he was part of an “oligarchy” close to the previous government. Pro-government tabloids frequently spew abuse about Šolak, and claim he represents shady forces or foreign influence. “Few people have been as much attacked in the media as he has,” says Florian Bieber, of the University of Graz. “He’s pretty much public enemy number one”. Šolak insists he has no political agenda beyond wanting fair elections, and no links to political parties. “My top priorities are my family and golf, and then I would say business. Politics is nowhere in the top 100. I don’t care about politics. I became a political figure only because I wouldn’t allow them to change the way we operate our news channels.”
Šolak says United Group has come under pressure in numerous ways. In large parts of Serbia, it has been pushed out of distribution networks, meaning many people cannot sign up. And then there are the Premier League rights. Previously, United Group was paying €11m a year. When the contract came up for renewal last year, it offered €35m a year for the next six years, but this was dwarfed by Telekom Serbia’s offer, thought to be €100m a year. The state-controlled company has also won European football rights, leaving United with just the Bundesliga. “I can’t calculate how Telekom Serbia would make a profit with the prices they paid for the Premier League, for Uefa league,” says Šolak. He believes there is an ulterior, political motive. Telekom Serbia has denied any political motivations, but others are sceptical. “I was disappointed, but … at the end of the day, it’s a commercial entity wanting to make the best possible return for its members,” Šolak said of the Premier League’s decision to accept the bid. It will become clear when next season starts how much effect losing the football will have on the size of the subscriber base, he says. Although Šolak is proud and fiercely defensive of N1’s editorial independence, it is clear that for him, television news is more about good returns than freedom of speech. Getting into the news industry was purely a business decision: “The whole idea came while visiting friends from Fox in the States, and they told me the most profitable part of Fox was Fox News. And I thought: ‘Wow.’”
If the right offer came in for United Group, he says, he would have no qualms about recommending a sale to his partners. When it comes to Southampton, Šolak says he does not plan to squeeze the club for profit, and would prefer to build it and increase the value. The buzz of the battling draw with City may have given him a taste for some of the non-financial rewards of owning a football club. “My family said they haven’t seen me so happy and excited about a business venture for a long time, so I guess it must be a good investment,” he says, with a laugh.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/dragan-solak-southamptons-new-owner-serbia;sports
808;808;808;808;819;819;UK defence secretary asked to explain denial of Kabul animal airlift;2022-01-27;['Dan Sabbagh'];['Ben Wallace', 'Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Animals', 'Zac Goldsmith', 'Foreign policy', 'Afghanistan'];"Labour has called on the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, to explain how he can reconcile Foreign Office emails saying Boris Johnson authorised a controversial airlift of animals from Kabul in August with his own assertion to MPs earlier this week that this was not the case. A letter sent by John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, pressed Wallace for an explanation hours after peers had demanded a similar explanation from the Foreign Office minister Zac Goldsmith, who also denied that Johnson had approved the rescue in a statement he made to the Lords in December. In the correspondence, Healey asked Wallace: “How do you square” the Foreign Office emails released earlier this week with “the evidence you gave to the foreign affairs select committee”, and he asked again if Johnson had “authorised the evacuation” of animals from Pen Farthing’s Nowzad charity. The defence secretary has repeatedly denied that he was ordered by No 10 to allow Farthing’s evacuation flight to proceed. On Tuesday he told MPs on the select committee that “at no stage, at any stage, did the prime minister ask me to make a way for those pets. Not at all. Never.” A Foreign Office email released on Wednesday showed that an official working for Lord Goldsmith had written to a colleague on 25 August to say “the PM has just authorised” the staff and animals of the Nowzad welfare charity to be cleared for evacuation. The questions to Wallace came after the Labour peer Ray Collins in the Lords asked Goldsmith to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the August email and a statement made by the junior minister to the house on 7 December. Goldsmith had said rebuttals made by Johnson that same day about his own involvement in authorising the rescue of Nowzad animals were “from my own experience … entirely accurate”. But on Thursday, in light of the email disclosures, Lord Collins asked Goldsmith, who was not present in the Lords, “to return as a matter of urgency to make a statement to the house” to clear up the apparent discrepancy between the email sent from his private office on 25 August and remarks he made months later. The government minister Nicholas True said Goldsmith had tweeted a statement on Wednesday, in which he said: “I did not authorise and do not support anything that would have put animals’ lives ahead of people’s … I never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM.” Later, Lord True added: “Allegations do not constitute evidence.” Boris Johnson, Downing Street and other ministers have repeatedly denied the prime minister gave his personal permission for a privately funded rescue flight to land in Kabul at the end of August. However, an animal rights campaigner linked to Nowzad, Dominic Dyer, said he believed the prime minister did sanction the rescue. On Thursday, Johnson said “this whole thing is total rhubarb”, and that he was proud of the military’s role in rescuing thousands of people stranded in Kabul after the Taliban’s seizure of Afghanistan’s capital.
A day earlier, Labour accused Johnson of lying, after the initial disclosure of the Foreign Office email from Goldsmith’s private office. A second email, sent later on 25 August by another Foreign Office official involved with the Kabul airlift, repeated the point. It said: “In light of the PM’s decision earlier today to evacuate the staff of the Nowzad animal charity … ” Controversy about the rescue of Farthing, a former royal marine, and his charity’s cats and dogs, and the involvement of the prime minister, has lingered for months after Wallace, who previously appeared to not support their evacuation, unexpectedly announced he would allow it in a tweet sent at 1.33am. There was support from some quarters for allowing the animals to be evacuated, but others said that creating a landing slot for the plane when thousands of Afghans were still desperate to be evacuated amounted to a prioritisation of “pets over people”. Supporters of Nowzad engaged in an intense lobbying effort that Dyer said involved Goldsmith. Dyer also said he sent regular updates to the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, as the crisis unfolded. Farthing and more than 150 cats and dogs were eventually rescued in one of the last flights out of Kabul on a charter plane, but last-minute delays at the airport meant more than 60 Nowzad staff and their dependents had to cross the border to Pakistan before they could be transported to the UK.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/lords-call-for-zac-goldsmith-to-explain-kabul-animal-airlift-email;politics
812;812;812;812;823;823;‘Time for the truth’: MPs call on Boris Johnson to publish ‘partygate’ report;2022-01-27;['Vikram Dodd', 'Aubrey Allegretti'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'Civil service', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Boris Johnson has been told it is “time for the truth to be released” as he faced more calls to publish a long-awaited report into “partygate” in full and not “suppress crucial details”. Officials in the Cabinet Office are still wrangling over the final version of Sue Gray’s findings on a string of alleged Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street and other parts of government. Despite anticipation reaching fever pitch earlier this week that the report on which the prime minister’s premiership could hang was close to completion, its publication was delayed when Scotland Yard opened its own investigation. Sources said on Thursday night that the senior civil servant’s findings had still not been sent to No 10, with government lawyers studying the document amid concerns that publishing some information could prejudice the new investigation. Gray is said to want to send it in a state that can then be published by Downing Street in full, without the need for any further redactions. Some Tories believe the report will not be released until early next week, given they think Gray will be mindful of criticism it is being sneaked out if publication came on Friday or the weekend, when most MPs will be back in their constituencies. Government insiders have rejected accusations they are responsible for the delay, and suggested instead it is because of the Metropolitan police’s discussions with the Cabinet Office. But Scotland Yard has not formally objected to full publication of the Gray report, sources said. Gray’s findings were sufficiently clear cut in their detailing of rule breaches to trigger a criminal investigation, according to the explanation about why police were acting, from the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick.
Johnson claimed he had “absolutely not” been involved in delaying the report, stressing people should wait for the independent inquiries. He said “of course” it would be published in full, but Downing Street has made clear that is only the intention of No 10, as it is not yet aware what the format will be and whether any sensitive personal or security information would need to be redacted. “We are in no way seeking to block the report,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said. “It remains our intention to publish the report as it is received from the investigation.” But one Tory critic feared Johnson would “wriggle out of the scrutiny he deserves once again”. Another senior backbencher, Mark Harper, said: “The report must be published in full. Any attempt to conceal or suppress crucial details would be wrong.” Opposition parties also raised concerns over the handling of the report’s publication. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said in a letter to Johnson it “would be unconscionable that after the public has sacrificed so much in our collective effort against this pandemic, you would allow any obstruction of the truth or any unnecessary delay to the publication of this report”. She said it was time for the truth to be released, and pressed the prime minister for a commitment to publish the report in full along with any evidence also submitted to him, with any redactions accompanied with a full explanation. Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said photos, emails and messages should be released too. He said “any attempt to whitewash this matter or spike this report or to start to hide again” would provoke even more public anger.
Davey said: “It would be a bitter insult to the public, especially to the bereaved, if the report was not now published in full.” Some Tory MPs are waiting to read the Gray report before deciding whether to submit a letter calling on Johnson to stand down. If 54 are sent, a vote of no confidence will be held. Allies of the prime minister believe the longer-than-expected wait for the official civil service investigation is proving helpful for him, because it is letting anger in the party ebb. Nevertheless, even some ministers who are being loyal in public admit they are preparing to reevaluate their support for Johnson in private once they have seen the full extent of Gray’s report. Even if Johnson manages to avoid or win a vote of no confidence, his restive backbenchers are concerned about the growing cost-of-living crisis, coupled with the planned national insurance hike due to come into effect in April, just when the energy price cap is also dramatically raised. • This article was amended on 28 January 2022 because an earlier version referred to April, when the energy cap is “ is also dramatically reduced”. That should have said “dramatically raised”.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/mps-call-on-boris-johnson-publish-partygate-report-sue-gray;politics
834;834;834;834;845;845;West plans to tie Afghan teacher aid to girls’ education pledge;2022-01-27;['Patrick Wintour'];['Afghanistan', 'Aid', 'Taliban', 'Global development', 'Society', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Gender', 'Human rights', 'Education'];"The west is planning to incentivise the Taliban to abide by their promise to allow girls to be educated by providing funding for teachers’ salaries only in provinces in which the pledge is met. The Taliban claimed this week the group would allow girls of secondary school age to be educated from March, the start of the next school term. Sceptical diplomats said they would need more than verbal assurances, with physical and budgetary evidence of preparations being required. If no credible nationwide pledge was made or implemented, western diplomats said a plan to fund teachers’ salaries would go ahead only in those provinces where girls were allowed to attend school. Some provinces have been less repressive about the rights of women.
The salary funds would come from the World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), the single largest source of aid to Afghanistan before the Taliban took over in August. Worth £1.5bn, the fund has been frozen since then. Next month, the World Bank executive board is likely to discuss how more cash can be released from the fund, not just to help with humanitarian work but, for the first time since August, with the payment of key workers in health and education. As reports of dire humanitarian need mounted in December, £280m was released but it was mainly sent to the World Food Program and Unicef, and was not spent on salaries. Accused of letting Afghanistan fall apart, diplomats say there is a growing consensus that the west needs to go beyond conventional humanitarian aid and to fund teachers’ salaries, but only if girls are not being excluded from education. London and other capitals have been pushing for a larger tranche of ARTF funding to be released, but are waiting on a World Bank board paper, which will map out how cash could be released for salaries in education, health and agricultural production without reaching the Taliban. The west refuses to recognise the group, and the US has imposed sanctions on many of their leaders. The key proposal is for UN agencies, such as Unicef, or the International Red Cross to produce lists of frontline health and education workers so payments can be sent to their bank accounts directly. One source stressed the plan was for the medium term, adding that the Taliban were “slowly realising that this is the only way this will work”. The cash for key workers is only one aspect of how the humanitarian crisis is worsened by sanctions. On Thursday, the Norwegian Refugee Council became the latest aid agency to say it is nearly impossible to channel money into Afghanistan due to the state of the banks and fears among western financial institutions that transactions will fall foul of US Treasury sanctions. Before Christmas the UN security council passed a resolution aiming to protect bank transactions for humanitarian purposes from the sanctions regime. Since then the US Treasury has issued six general licences to allow such payments to go ahead, and is in discussion with Citibank, the main bank that handled Afghan transactions, to reassure its officials it will not be sanctioned if it returns to the market. The UK is also bringing the UN’s humanitarian exemption into UK sanctions law, and is providing £280m to Afghanistan this year. US officials are talking to the Afghan Central Bank to discuss how it can be made more independent and credible. Western officials say it is a misunderstanding to regard theACB’S £8bn in frozen reserves as a potential source of humanitarian funding since it is seed capital for the bank, and if handed back to the Taliban would amount to diplomatic recognition of the group.

838;838;838;838;849;849;DUP gives Liz Truss February deadline to fix Brexit protocol row;2022-01-27;"[""Lisa O'Carroll""]";['Northern Ireland', 'Brexit', 'Democratic Unionist party (DUP)', 'Liz Truss', 'European Union', 'Foreign policy', 'Europe', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'World news', 'Sinn Féin'];"The Democratic Unionist party has set 21 February as a fresh deadline for the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to find a solution to the dispute over the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. In her first visit to Northern Ireland, Truss, who inherited Brexit negotiations from Lord Frost at Christmas, met the DUP’s Paul Givan and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, first minister and deputy first minister respectively. Givan said the government must take unilateral action if an agreed position cannot be reached with the EU by the fourth week of February. But Sinn Féin has said any attempt to trigger article 16 of the protocol would cause more uncertainty in Northern Ireland. Truss said she wants to strike a deal on the protocol that works for everyone in the region. “We are making progress. We’re having constructive talks. I want to make significant progress by February. That’s important but it’s important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community.” Sources close to the foreign secretary said she was in “listening mode” and told party leaders of her “commitment to securing changes to the protocol that defend peace and stability, protect sovereignty of decision-making for all, and ensure free flow of GB-NI goods”. They added that she believed a deal could be done and she was looking for “durable, practical solutions”. Earlier this week Truss and the European Commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, said they hoped a deal could be done by the end of February before the electioneering for the May Stormont elections. Speaking after the meeting, Givan said there has to be progress made “imminently” in negotiations. He said: “Liz Truss has indicated that she is making progress with the European Union and obviously 21 February is a very significant date in terms of what progress will have been made or not made.” A meeting of the joint working committee on the withdrawal agreement takes place on that date.
He added: “I pressed the foreign secretary about the need to take action in the absence of there being progress and an agreed outcome with the European Union. The foreign secretary indicated that the UK government does stand ready to take action, she mentioned the use of article 16, but she prefers to get an agreed position with the European Union.” He added: “I have emphasised the absolute critical nature of that progress being made, because the protocol is causing instability to these institutions, it is damaging our economy and this is having a real impact on Northern Ireland. “So, we need to see that progress, we need to see that imminently, and we also need to see action taken by the UK government if there isn’t an agreed outcome.” The meeting came a day after the DUP’s leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said he could not guarantee Givan would still be in position next week. It also came just hours after the SDLP criticised the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for “playing politics” with the Northern Ireland protocol in an official video on the negotiations.
In the video, the FCDO said: “The Northern Ireland protocol was designed to protect the peace process and respect all communities in Northern Ireland. It is doing the opposite.” Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP, said it was a Trumpian strategy while her colleague Nichola Mallon, deputy party leader, said it was “reckless”.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/dup-gives-liz-truss-february-deadline-to-fix-brexit-protocol-row;politics
839;839;839;839;850;850;Melania Trump’s auction of NFT, hat and painting fall short of $250,000 opening bid;2022-01-27;['Maya Yang'];['Melania Trump', 'US news', 'US politics'];What do Melania Trump’s wide-brimmed white hat, a painting of her wearing the hat and an NFT of an animated version of the hat have in common? They were all put up for auction by the former first lady – and as of early Wednesday, failed to rake in the target price of a $250,000 opening bid. Trump announced earlier this month that she would auction off the autographed hat, which she wore to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife during an official state visit in 2018. The auction also included a watercolor painting of herself wearing the hat and a non-fungible token, or NFT, of the painting. She insisted that all bids be made in Solana tokens, a cryptocurrency. When the auction concluded on Wednesday there were only five bids on the items, each around the minimum requirement of 1,800 Solana tokens. Although the minimum number of tokens was met, a steep dive in the crypto market over the last two weeks resulted in the final bid being approximately $170,000 – about $80,000 short of the opening bid threshold. “The auction winner will receive a personalized letter from Mrs. Trump, accompanying the hat and watercolor on paper and certifying authenticity. The NFT will be minted on the Solana Blockchain,” said a statement released earlier this month from the Office of Melania Trump. It said a “portion” of the proceeds derived from the auction would be given to provide people “who have been in the foster care community with access to computer science and technology education”. The auction collection, named “Head of State”, marks Trump’s second high-profile venture into NFTs and cryptocurrency. In December, she put up for sale an NFT titled Melania’s Vision: a watercolor painting of her eyes.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/melania-trump-auction-nft-hat-painting;business and economy
887;887;887;887;898;898;Fight Club author praises Chinese cut of film: ‘Super wonderful!’;2022-01-27;['Catherine Shoard'];['Film', 'Fight Club', 'Chuck Palahniuk', 'David Fincher', 'Books', 'Culture', 'China', 'Censorship'];"The author of Fight Club has praised the “happy ending” afforded to David Fincher’s film of his book for a new Chinese cut of the movie. Chuck Palahniuk described the change, in which the police successfully foil an anarchist plot and the heroes are incarcerated, as “SUPER wonderful”. Palahniuk told TMZ: “The irony is that … they’ve aligned the ending almost exactly with the ending of the book, as opposed to Fincher’s ending, which was the more spectacular visual ending. So in a way, the Chinese brought the movie back to the book a little bit.” The conclusion of the 1999 film in its original cut sees Ed Norton’s narrator realise that the character played by Brad Pitt is in fact a projection of his own mind. He then stands on top of a tower block and witnesses the plan overseen by his alter ego to destroy consumerism begin to take effect, as the skyscrapers around him explode. The Chinese version distributed by streaming service Tencent Video instead ends with a caption telling viewers that police uncovered the plot in time and arrested all criminals. The character played by Pitt was put on trial, according to the new edit, before being “sent to a lunatic asylum, receiving psychological treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in 2012.” Palahniuk initially responded to reports detailing the change by saying: “This is SUPER wonderful! Everyone gets a happy ending in China!” He consolidated his thoughts on Substack, calling the incarceration of Pitt’s character: “Amazing. I’d no idea! Justice always wins. Nothing ever exploded. Fini.” He added: “My guess is they also omit the flash of penis at the end. And that they pixelate the dildo in Marla’s room. Crime does not pay!” The news on Wednesday of the re-edit was met with outrage on social media, but Palahniuk said he was already used to his books being changed in some countries, and even banned in some parts of America.
“The strange flip side is that in many foreign markets the publisher rewrote the novel so it would end like the film,” he wrote. “Without permission, I might add.” Palahniuk added to TMZ: “What I find really interesting is that my books are heavily banned throughout the US. The Texas prison system refuses to carry my books in their libraries. A lot of public schools and most private schools refuse to carry my books. But it’s only an issue once China changes the end of a movie? I’ve been putting up with book-banning for a long time.”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/fight-club-author-chuck-palahniuk-praises-chinese-cut-super-wonderful;entertainment and culture
891;891;891;891;902;902;Boris Johnson must resign now, says Starmer – but does he mean it?;2022-01-27;['Jessica Elgot'];['Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Liz Truss', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Sajid Javid', 'Keir Starmer', 'Labour'];"Boris Johnson has decided that one of his key routes to survival is to convince his backbenchers that Labour want him gone. But if Labour MPs had a vote in the secret ballot in the vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, there are some who might pause with their pencil. The overwhelming emotion among them is relief – mainly not to be the ones in the spotlight whose party is riven with internal division. Had things taken a different course since September, it is not difficult to imagine Labour being the ones considering their leader’s future. But there is disagreement as Labour MPs chew over the possible worlds that could emerge in the coming weeks. Labour has raced ahead in the polls as partygate dominates the headlines and MPs’ inboxes fill with angry complaints from voters. Much of that is at the feet of Johnson himself, and his possible successors – Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Sajid Javid – are not yet tainted. Many pondering the data in Labour HQ say it is too early to fully understand the public mood. Keir Starmer’s own ratings have been rising, as well as metrics that party chiefs watch closely, including how Labour is trusted on the economy. But there is also a sense that the Conservatives’ previous lead was vastly inflated by a vaccine bounce and that the polls are likely to even out within the next few months and settle into a more predictable pattern that might be expected at this point for a government mid-term. Some of those advising Starmer quietly say there might be some electoral merit to a wounded prime minister limping on, especially one who narrowly wins a no-confidence vote. Preoccupied by restive and rebellious backbenchers, neutered by his chancellor in terms of domestic policies and with no political capital to make major changes, Johnson could quickly become a lame duck prime minister in the eyes of the public. Plus, they argue, the longer Johnson goes on, the more the Conservative brand is tarnished, his MPs making laughable statements of support about cake ambushes. Starmer, they argue, is the perfect counterweight to Johnson – with a serious, slightly boring demeanour, and a lifetime of public service. One shadow minister, mulling over what timing would suit them, said a departure after the local elections might be the most beneficial to the party. “Not only do they lose seats, but then the Tories look even more self-serving, they only ditched him not for moral reasons but for poor results. And then there is the wider good that the country gets rid of him too.”
Starmer himself would never suggest it was better for Johnson to continue. His team decided it was inconceivable they could not call for Johnson’s resignation two weeks ago at PMQs. Any more calls for inquiries, explanations, apologies would obviously not wash. “There’s always an argument that once you’ve gone that far, there’s nowhere to go, it’s sixth gear,” one of them said. “But the email [from Martin Reynolds inviting staff to a party] meant we took that choice. Anything less would look pathetic.” But ask any of the party’s northern MPs with experience of fighting battles in the red wall and many will say Labour’s chances are enhanced with Johnson gone.
It is the message Johnson is drilling into his backbenchers. “Of course he wants me out of the way,” he told PMQs. “He does, and – I will not deny it – for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way, but the reason he wants me out of the way is that he knows that this government can be trusted to deliver, and we did.” Some will privately agree with that, having observed Johnson take selfies on the streets in a way few others could. “I think in the long run we don’t want to take the chance he can recover,” one said. Another said Sunak or Truss would be far less likely to keep lots of the seats that Johnson had taken – or may yet win. “I don’t know if that’s what the polls say or not, but my instinct is he still has some personal appeal and my voters just don’t know who Liz Truss is.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/boris-johnson-must-resign-now-says-starmer-but-does-he-mean-it-labour;politics
904;904;904;904;915;915;Dr Semmelweis review – Mark Rylance’s riveting tale of medical hygiene pioneer;2022-01-27;['Arifa Akbar'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Mark Rylance', 'Bristol Old Vic', 'Hygiene', 'Health', 'Society'];"A few months ahead of bringing “Rooster” Byron’s band of outsiders back to the stage in a revival of Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, Mark Rylance breathes life into a very different kind of anti-establishment figure: Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, a pioneer too ahead of his own time. Based on an original idea by Rylance and written with Stephen Brown, this play explores the life of the Hungarian doctor who worked in 19th-century Vienna’s maternity wards. Semmelweis’s groundbreaking practices in antiseptic procedure saved thousands of lives – particularly those of impoverished mothers – and might have saved more had his findings been recognised by the medical community. But he was doubted and disbelieved, and died in an asylum without due recognition and, in a final twist of bad fate, of sepsis, from which he had battled to save his patients. His story becomes a tragedy of almost Shakespearean proportions in the hands of Rylance, who appears plaintive, hollow-eyed, by turns diffident and absolute in his unbending sense of right. But the cast around him keep up, from Thalissa Teixeira as his wife Maria to, as Semmelweis’s medical allies, Jackie Clune, Sandy Grierson, Felix Hayes and Enyi Okoronkwo among others, each as good as the next. Under the direction of Tom Morris, the production is almost as much a dance as it is a play, with expressionist movement (choreography by Antonia Franceschi) and music (by Adrian Sutton) that take us inside Semmelweis’s mind, from his bursts of anger to his final unravelling. A chorus of ghostly dancers – the women he has been unable to save – enact anguish while violins and the cello weep. These elements together run the risk of an overwrought atmosphere but the production steers clear of that. Instead there is intensity, and the drama feels drawn out in its pain.
It paints a picture of a thwarted life but also, more obliquely, explores why some people are lauded as pioneers, their theories welcomed and their genius immortalised, while others are cast as outsiders. Semmelweis made breakthroughs long before Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur’s work in germ theory. But in his exacting nature, his single-minded zeal to save lives and his gruff manner, he reveals medical science to be governed by – of course – its own politics of personality when it comes to toppling old paradigms for new. Two time frames are navigated with magnificent fluidity on Ti Green’s set (spare yet dramatic, an oculus above, a revolve below and an almost eerie blackness from which characters emerge). In these switches of time, we get a keen sense of Semmelweis’s inner fracturing: he seems involuntarily pulled into the past, which is enacted on stage, with his present world simultaneously observing it. Richard Howell’s lighting works within this duality – warm and sepia-tinted in the domestic present but a starkly spotlit past which throngs with shadows in the backdrop.
Death is all around the maternity ward at which Semmelweis works and every loss has an emotional impact, even when it happens in passing. Meanwhile there is a visceral edge to the scenes of autopsies and childbirths, which are gestured in dance or mimed. Although this is its own specific story, and emphatically a period piece, there is a relevance to the themes of new science and distrust that chimes in our Covid era. The play was conceived before the pandemic but Semmelweis’s pleas for fellow doctors to “wash your hands” makes it feel, uncannily, as if the past is haunting our present too. Dr Semmelweis is at Bristol Old Vic until 12 February";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/27/dr-semmelweis-review-mark-rylance-bristol-old-vic;entertainment and culture
906;906;906;906;917;917;Why is Sue Gray report on No 10 parties taking so long?;2022-01-27;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Gray report'];"A long-awaited report on the extent of Covid rule-breaking at parties in Downing Street and across government was expected to be published this week. Boris Johnson’s premiership could hang on its findings; Tory MPs have said they want to see what evidence of wrongdoing is dug up by Sue Gray – a senior civil servant known as a ruthless Whitehall enforcer – before deciding whether to call for him to quit. But despite speculation reaching fever pitch on Tuesday that the report would be released imminently, its contents remain shrouded in mystery. Has Sue Gray finished her report? Government sources have indicated Gray has finished the report, but pushed back on the suggestion there has been a “delay” because, they say, there was no previously announced date for its publication. Undoubtedly, the handling of the report’s release has been thrown into chaos by the announcement – also on Tuesday – that Scotland Yard was opening its own investigation into the party allegations. It would make sense to assume that the timing is not coincidental; Gray is unlikely to have shared her findings with the Metropolitan police unless she was nearing the end of her own investigation.
Because Gray is working with the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team, No 10 has been unable to provide any updates on the report’s status besides confirming it has not yet been sent the final version. What are the roadblocks preventing publication? Little is known about why there seems to be so much wrangling over the report, but it is thought that lawyers and human resources officials are inspecting its contents and deciding what can and cannot be published. If there is a risk of prejudicing the Met’s own investigation, then it is possible parts of Gray’s report may have to be redacted or held back. However, that would probably prompt accusations of a cover-up. The Met has reportedly been briefing that it is not asking for Gray’s report to be held back. Unions are also apparently pushing for junior civil servants to have their names redacted before the document is released. A former No 10 adviser, who has been involved in publishing similar reports, said that when such sought-after documents are officially submitted to No 10 it is very difficult to avoid leaks. “Informally agreeing when it is sent is best practice,” they said, noting that “as close to the weekend as possible is always a good idea” for decreasing the level of attention paid to the report. What might eventually emerge? Johnson’s spokesperson has committed to publishing the “findings” of Gray’s report. This has prompted concern that only the conclusions will be made public rather than the full report. However, No 10 has said this is because they do not know what format Gray’s report will take, and are adamant “it remains our intention to publish it as received”. What will happen when the report is released? Gray expects that when her final version is delivered to Downing Street it will be published within a matter of hours. Johnson has previously promised to place a copy in the House of Commons library for all MPs to see, and to answer questions in parliament at the earliest opportunity. But even if the report is published this week, the chance of it getting much scrutiny by MPs is diminishing. Most MPs are already back home in their constituencies for the weekend, and No 10 does not want to rile Tory backbenchers further by being seen to publish the report while they are away from Westminster, meaning Johnson may not have to face questions in parliament until next week. When the report is finally released, MPs will pore over it closely; dozens have said they will consider submitting a letter expressing no confidence in Johnson if there is any evidence he misled the Commons, or if there is evidence of criminality. MPs could also decide that even if Johnson is found not to have done anything wrong, the political pain of a prime minister not being able to control the office where workers broke the very Covid rules they wrote is enough to push Johnson out. What would happen in a vote of no confidence – triggered if 54 Tory MPs submit letters calling for one – is even less certain. Some ministers could vote against him, but Johnson’s supporters have been running a shadow whipping operation to prepare for such an eventuality and are confident he would convincingly win such a ballot. It is also possible the pressure on Johnson recedes. His allies are known to be planning to give assurances he will overhaul his Downing Street team and other key parts of the government machine. That may be enough to win MPs over, and let Johnson escape a vote of no confidence through the eye of a needle. • This article was amended on 27 January 2022 to remove an incorrect statement that the House of Commons was not sitting on Friday.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/why-sue-gray-report-boris-johnson-no-10-parties-taking-so-long;politics
947;947;947;947;958;958;Dividends and bonuses: the firms paying out while taking in state Covid funds;2022-01-27;['Kalyeena Makortoff'];['Executive pay and bonuses', 'WH Smith', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'JD Sports Fashion', 'John Lewis', 'Corporate governance', 'UK news', 'Ireland', 'Coronavirus', 'UK job furlough scheme'];Greencore, the sandwich supplier to grocers including M&S, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, is the latest company to face criticism for offering bonuses to bosses while failing to repay government Covid support. We take a look at some of the other UK firms that have handed bonuses to executives or payouts to shareholders despite refusing to refund taxpayers for support, including business rates relief and the furlough job retention scheme. WH Smith The retailer was a big beneficiary of taxpayer funds throughout the pandemic, having taken £40m in business rates relief and £11m in payments from furlough schemes in the UK and elsewhere in the year to September 2021. That was on top of £20m in business rates relief in 2020. The move prompted a shareholder rebellion earlier this month, with more than half its investors failing to back a £550,000 bonus payment for the retailer’s chief executive, Carl Cowling, as a result. Homebase Restructuring group Hilco took a £25m dividend payment from the DIY chain Homebase in 2020, despite receiving business rates relief for the chain, which it bought for £1 in 2018. It also accepted at least £10.6m in government aid through furlough payments and grants for its Bathstore chain, which was forced to close for many weeks under government high street lockdowns. JD Sports The retailer JD Sports restarted dividend payments to shareholders in April 2021, after profits were shored up by bumper lockdown demand for trainers and hoodies. However, JD said it was not going to return either furlough money or business rates relief, which was worth £38m to company according to property advisers Altus Group. Vertu Motors Vertu Motors, the Gateshead-based car dealership group, relaunched its interim dividend in October despite receiving significant government support, including £22.8m from the furlough scheme and £4.3m in business rates during the first half of 2020. It has claimed a further £5.2m in business rates relief and £400,000 in job support payments since. The company defended the move, saying it had held off from offering shareholder payouts over the past two financial years “in acknowledgement of the level of government support received”. John Lewis The John Lewis Partnership has been criticised for failing to repay more than £190m in business rates relief and furlough support. While the company has not offered bonuses or dividends, it has faced criticism for the fact its Waitrose supermarket chain took at least £85m of that relief at a time when grocers were still able to stay open and serve customers even during Covid lockdowns. Chair Dame Sharon White said the group would hold on to the government cash, which had “helped to keep us running and avoid more severe restructuring”. Greencore Ireland-based Greencore tapped the UK’s state furlough programme for £21.3m in 2020, and a further £8.7m in 2021. While none of that taxpayer-funded cash has been repaid, Greencore paid €343,000 (£286,000) in share-based bonuses to its chief financial officer, Emma Hynes, for 2021, bringing her total pay to £895,000. The company, which is billed as the world’s largest sandwich maker, has defended its use of government funding, noting the severe drop in profits it suffered at the height of the pandemic, when lockdown orders hit food-to-go sales at some of its biggest customers, including the supermarkets M&S, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op. Greencore swung to a £10.8m loss in 2020, from a £56.4m profit a year earlier.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/dividends-and-bonuses-the-firms-paying-out-while-taking-in-state-covid-funds;business and economy
951;951;951;951;962;962;One in five UK councils have no climate action plan, campaigners say;2022-01-27;['Anna Bawden'];['Local government', 'Green politics', 'Climate crisis', 'Local politics', 'Environment', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news'];"More than one in five of all councils in the UK have no climate action plan, research shows. In 2019, Theresa May’s government committed the UK to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Since then, hundreds of local authorities have published plans to show how they intend to become carbon neutral. But analysis by the not-for-profit campaigning organisation Climate Emergency UK, shared exclusively with the Guardian, found that of the 409 local authorities across the UK, 84 still did not have climate action plans, while 139 had not committed to reach net zero emissions by a specific date. Climate Emergency UK scored 325 plans according to 28 questions grouped into nine categories, including how well councils’ plans would mitigate the impact of climate change locally, whether climate and ecological emergency was integrated into existing policies, community engagement, climate education, scale of emissions targets and commitments to tackle the ecological emergency.
This first year’s scoring was intended to establish a baseline of councils’ plans and scale of ambition. Next year’s will assess to what extent local authorities are on track to reach net zero emissions. Although most local authorities have published climate plans, 38 district councils, three county councils, and 43 other councils in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have none. They include Norfolk county council, Gloucester city council and the London borough of Hackney. Annie Pickering, a campaigns and policy officer at Climate Emergency UK, said: “It’s been three years since the first councils declared climate emergencies and our scorecards show that many councils are still not making action on the climate and ecological emergency a priority. Councils can have a real influence on creating low-carbon communities, and with the warmest new year on record in the UK, we need to see action fast.” Somerset West and Taunton district council topped the league with a score of 91% (see below). Other high-scoring councils included West Midlands Combined Authority (89%), Staffordshire Moorlands (87%) and Solihull (85%). The average score across all UK local authorities was 46%. The analysis revealed significant regional variations, with the average score for Scottish authorities 50%, compared with 46% for England and 45% for Wales. Scotland scored particularly well on measuring and setting emissions targets. Scotland’s public bodies have been legally required since 2011 to reduce emissions and, since 2019, to report on progress. Edinburgh was the highest rated Scottish council, on 83%, and the joint fifth highest-scoring UK local authority. The city’s £1.3bn redevelopment of Granton Waterfront will create a 11 hectare coastal park to protect biodiversity, create up to 3,500 new net zero carbon homes, use lower-emitting offsite construction methods and improve public transport links. Edinburgh has allocated £2.8bn over 10 years to build 10,000 new sustainable and affordable homes by 2027, and to retrofit its 20,000 council houses to make them more energy efficient. And from 2025, all new school and early years buildings will be built to Passivhaus standard. The council has also upgraded all street lighting across the city to energy-efficient LED lights. In contrast, only four of Northern Ireland’s 11 councils had a climate action plan at all, with all four scoring 31% or lower. In Wales, just under a quarter of local authorities have no plan. The highest-scoring authority in Wales was Cardiff (70%), while in Northern Ireland it was Ards and North Down council (31%). “Some councils are clearly taking a strong lead on climate action, but others have much more to do,” said Cara Jenkinson, the cities manager at the sustainable energy charity Ashden. She said cutting emissions and nature restoration must be a priority for every council department “if they are to be carbon neutral by 2050, let alone 2030.” Nottingham is arguably the furthest ahead. The city has reduced its overall CO2 emissions per capita by 52.3% since 2005 and is on track to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has planted nearly 22,000 trees and installed more than 130 public electric vehicle charging points. Just under a third of council vehicles and nearly half of Hackney carriage taxis are ultra low emission vehicles, and the city has one of the UK’s largest fleets of electric buses. A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates about £8m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes. In 2014, Telford and Wrekin council became only the second local authority in the UK to build a publicly owned solar farm. To date it has saved more than 13,000 tonnes of CO2 emissionsand generated £1.3m for the council. Since 2020 the council has cut its carbon emissions by more than 57%. But English planning laws can make it harder to ensure that new developments are zero carbon or carbon neutral. From 2006, authorities were able to insist that houses were built to the highest energy standards, but this regulation was scrapped in 2015. The government’s new future homes standard aims to ensure new homes built from 2025 will produce 75-80% less carbon emissions than those built under current regulations. But councils’ energy efficiency plans remain subject to viability assessments from developers. If a developer can provide a sound viability assessment that proves a policy would make a scheme unaffordable, there is little local authorities can do to counter that. David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the Local Government Association’s environment and planning spokesperson, said: “Local government has a fundamental role to play in tackling climate change, but net zero can only be achieved if councils are empowered.” The LGA is calling for stronger powers and longterm funding to tackle the climate emergency. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome this research, which shows four in five councils are supporting our ambitions to deliver net zero by setting out climate action plans, with more expected to follow. Councils have an integral part to play and we will continue to work very closely with local partners to meet our climate change commitments.” How Somerset turned green Somerset West and Taunton was the only council to score above 90% and was one of only 21 to get top marks for its plans to improve biodiversity and combat the ecological emergency. It has declared its area a fracking-free zone, pledged to manage council services, buildings and land in a biodiversity-friendly manner, embed ecological initiatives alongside climate action in all work areas, and ensure that addressing both emergencies are strategic priorities for planning policies and design guides for new development. It has developed a climate-positive planning policy and is building zero-carbon council houses, as well as retrofitting existing housing stock. The council’s entire pool car fleet will be electric by the end of 2022. Dixie Darch, the executive member for climate change at Somerset West and Taunton council, said local authorities should lead by example. “We are committed to putting the climate emergency and environmental responsibility at the heart of what we do. The challenge has never been greater for local councils: it is essential we rise to that challenge,” she said. In addition to its own plan to make the district net zero by 2030, Somerset West has joined with the county council and three other district councils to create a climate emergency strategy for the whole county.

955;955;955;955;966;966;Tom Harrison can’t even talk a good game any more, so why is he still in charge? | Andy Bull;2022-01-27;['Andy Bull'];['Cricket', 'ECB', 'Sport', 'Sport politics'];"And it all started so well. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, began his appearance in front of the DCMS select committee with earnest thanks, to the MPs for the opportunity, and to Azeem Rafiq for his testimony, then eased into a well-rehearsed spiel about everything the ECB has been doing. He spoke about Inspiring Generations, the South-Asian Action Plan, the transformed women and girls pathway, his 12-point plan, £25m of new investment, how he had matched funding with broadcast partners, built a burgeoning link with Kick It Out, launched a new anti-discrimination unit, a dressing-room culture review, a game-wide census, and sweeping governance reform.
Harrison has a dashboard, a set of KPIs, and five different pillars. “On the talent pathways we want to get at least 30% of young boys and girls from ethnically diverse backgrounds,” Harrison said. “Among boys, in 2018, it was 11%, and now, thanks to our South-Asian Action Plan, it has moved to 28% …” And this was where the committee chair, Julian Knight, interrupted. “28%?” Knight asked, “but your target is 30%?” Harrison hummed. Knight continued. “To be clear, you’ve not just set yourself a target you’ve already reached?” Harrison hawed. Knight continued. “Your target is 30% by the end of this year, and you’re at 28% at the start of the year?” He did some quick sums. “You’ve done 17% in three years, that’s five-and-half per cent a year, you should really be at 35% shouldn’t you?” Knight wasn’t drilling down into Harrison’s plan here, he was only picking at it with his fingernail, and it was starting to crumble. “What we aim to do is to make sure we have a flood of talent coming through,” Harrison explained, the 30% target was going to be country-wide, right across the game by the end of the year, and maybe even through to the England dressing rooms, he said, by 2025 now. “We want to report on over-delivery against those KPIs and not an under-delivery.” Yes, Knight agreed, “because you’ve set yourself such a low target. Our dispute would be that these are targets that you are set up to achieve.” Harrison tried to pick himself up and pull himself together. “That’s the best stat I have to give you,” he said, “but I also want to mention that we have 2,000 South Asian female activators.”
Female activators? There might be a good answer to all this, but Harrison didn’t manage to get it out. Knight likes cricket. He has played the club game all his adult life, opened the batting for the Lords and Commons team, and even wrote a book on it, Cricket For Dummies, before he became an MP. My guess is he understands the frustration so many English cricket fans feel towards the ECB because he shares it himself. You could hear it in his tone, which was impatient, and almost scornful, as if, after a lifetime following the game, he’s had about as much as he can stomach of the board’s executive bullshit. Harrison sometimes seems taken aback by this hostility. He shouldn’t be, it’s exactly how a lot of people who love the game feel. Listen to me talk about development, Harrison says, just don’t ask me why the ECB recently sacked 19 development staff. Listen to me talk about funding, he says, just don’t ask me why the ECB spends more on salaries than it does on grassroots cricket. We’ve lost the public’s trust, he says, I want to restore it, he says, but I also want my share of the £2.1m the ECB is paying out in executive bonuses. And no, you can’t ask him about that either “because it’s not appropriate for us to be discussing employment contracts”. After the year English cricket has had, how on earth is he still in his job?
It’s hard to listen to the hearings without feeling like we’ve already heard enough from most of the people doing the talking, Harrison, ECB chair Barry O’Brien, Hampshire chair Rod Bransgrove, Middlesex chair Mike O’Farrell, members of an executive class who are desperately unrepresentative of the sport and, in many cases, hopelessly ill-equipped to tackle the problems it is facing. It’s often said that the biggest obstacle to the “sweeping governance reform” Harrison mentioned is that it would require the turkeys to vote for Christmas. Listening to O’Farrell felt like listening to the bird try to explain how to turn on the oven. Presumably O’Farrell could talk eloquently about the problems facing Kodak, where he spent 36 years of his career, or the British Acupuncture Council, which he used to run, or the church in Great Missenden, where he works as a warden, but it felt like an act of satire to put him up in front of a parliamentary committee as the man who’s going to explain how to fix structural racism in the grassroots of English cricket.
If you want a proper answer ask the people who work at the Ace Programme. Ask the people who work at Chance to Shine. Ask the people who work at the MCC Foundation. Ask anyone but the men who are actually in charge. There was one ray of hope. The new Yorkshire chair, Kamlesh Patel, was as impressive as he has been right through this process. Patel is plain-talking, has a clear idea of what’s wrong and how to begin to fix it. Which isn’t to say he’s always right, just that he doesn’t talk like he thinks he is. He spoke proudly of the blind-hiring process Yorkshire used to find their new coach, Ottis Gibson. Through that blind process, Patel said: “We’ve gone from people who have been in the club a long, long time who were reasonable, to having one of the best coaches in the world as head coach.” Imagine what the sport would look like if it picked its chief executives and chairs in the same way.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/27/tom-harrison-cant-talk-good-game-why-is-he-still-in-charge-ecb-cricket;sports
966;966;966;966;977;977;Parallel Mothers review | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week;2022-01-27;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Film', 'Drama films', 'Pedro Almodóvar', 'Penélope Cruz', 'World cinema', 'Spain', 'Culture'];"Not parallel actually: that would mean they don’t touch. Here we have convergent mothers; intersecting mothers whose lives come together with a spark that ignites this moving melodrama, which audaciously draws a line between love, sex, the passionate courage of single mothers, the meaning of Lorca’s Doña Rosita the Spinster and the unhealed wound of Spain’s fascist past. Pedro Almodóvar’s new movie has the warmth and the grandiloquent flair of a picture from Hollywood’s golden age (something starring Bette Davis and Joan Fontaine maybe, with music by Max Steiner) and the whiplash twists and addictive sugar rush bumps of daytime soap. As ever with Almodóvar, there are gorgeously designed interiors with fierce, thick blocks of Mondrian colour, huge closeups of the female leads and overhead shots of food preparation. It’s impossible to watch this film without just feeling grateful that its director is still so fluent, so creative, still making us a gift of these films. There is a lot going on here, and perhaps the emotions and thoughts spill over the edges of its narrative form. But it would be obtuse not to let yourself travel downstream on this film’s emotional surge. One mother is Janis, played by Penélope Cruz, a stylish photographer in her late 30s whose agent is the worldly Elena (Almodóvar’s totemic regular Rossy de Palma). The other mother is Ana (Milena Smit), a serious-looking teenager whose family background is troubled. These heavily pregnant women share a hospital room and bond over their decision to go it alone. The father of Janis’s child is Arturo (Israel Elejalde), an anthropologist working with the historical unit formed under Spain’s historical memory law, tracing people murdered by Francoists during the civil war and buried in unmarked mass graves; Janis believes that her great-grandfather was one such victim. The two women’s newborns are whisked away for observational reasons at the same time. But when Janis gets her baby home, events conspire to plant a seed of doubt in her mind: she orders a DNA test online, which means a swab test weirdly similar to the one Arturo carries out on the recovered bodies at the gravesite. The disquieting results mean that Janis has to get back in touch with Ana and re-establish their remarkable relationship.
The facts of the narrative make it sound contrived and implausible. Yet the sheer poetic conviction means that there is no problem believing that the personal is the political and that history, the future and the present are as one. Baby-swap dramas are nothing new: there was Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Like Father, Like Son from 2013, and the famous case from the 1930s of a British woman, Margaret Wheeler, who famously appealed to George Bernard Shaw for help when she suspected her baby had been muddled up with someone else’s at the hospital. But Parallel Mothers is superior to any of them in the way it springs tragedy on audiences expecting comedy. And the film allows you to ponder not just the mother-child bond – strong enough to confront fascism – but the way everyone has to let their children be influenced by strangers; the unintended upbringing of being out in the world. What an emotional experience. • Parallel Mothers is released on 28 January in cinemas.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/parallel-mothers-review-pedro-almodovar;entertainment and culture

985;985;985;985;997;997;Woodside Petroleum to pull out of Myanmar one year on from military coup;2022-01-27;['Ben Butler', 'Ben Doherty'];['Myanmar', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Australia news', 'Myanmar coup', 'Rohingya', 'Human rights', 'Chevron', 'Energy industry', 'South and central Asia'];"Australia’s Woodside Petroleum has announced it is following multinational energy groups Chevron and Total in exiting Myanmar, saying it is unable to work in the country following the military coup nearly one year ago and the regime’s continuing human rights abuses and violence against civilians. The moves follow pressure from human rights groups, who have called on companies to stop doing business in Myanmar and cut off the flow of money from projects to the junta. February marks a year since the military re-took control of Myanmar in a coup. Last week Woodside revealed it had terminated a production-sharing contract with the state-owned oil and gas enterprise MOGE in November, and on Thursday the company said it would abandon the remainder of its licences in the country.
The contract termination covers an offshore block known as A-7, where Woodside owns 45% and Shell owns 45%, and comes into force on 30 September “with the formal relinquishment process ongoing”, Woodside said. Shell has also given up its licence and “has no licences in Myanmar” after relinquishing them all, a spokesperson said. On Thursday Woodside said it was also withdrawing from two other offshore fields where it holds exploration licenses, AD-1 and AD-8, as well as a second contract with MOGE covering a third block, A-6. The withdrawal will cost a total of US$209m, Woodside told the Australian Stock Exchange. “Given the ongoing situation in Myanmar we can no longer contemplate Woodside’s participation in the development of the A-6 gas resources, nor other future activities in-country,” the company’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill, said. Woodside has not conducted any activities in Myanmar since shortly after the coup and has paid no permit fees to the government in the past year, a spokesperson said. Myanmar’s military seized control of the country in a coup in February 2021 and has since killed more than 1,200 civilians in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests.
Known as the Tatmadaw, the military has faced international condemnation over its 2017 “clearance operations” – executed with “genocidal intent”, according to UN investigators – against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state, which included mass killings, including of children, gang rapes, arson and torture. More than 25,000 Rohingya were killed, and 700,000 driven over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar, welcomed the withdrawals as “a major step in cutting off funds to the illegal military junta”. “It is essential that the companies exit responsibly, mitigating negative impacts and ensuring the junta does not benefit financially from their withdrawal.” Yadanar Maung said it was “shameful the Australian government had failed to take any meaningful action to stop revenue flows to the junta, not even sanctioning the war criminal and commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing even though nearly a year has passed since the attempted coup”. “Australia is now even lagging behind big oil when it comes to action on Myanmar.” Clancy Moore, the Australian director of anti-corruption coalition Publish What You Pay, welcomed Woodside’s action but said other Australian companies should also pull out and the government should take action against the regime by sanctioning its generals. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
“Governments including Australia must still introduce sanctions to stop revenue flow from gas, oil and mining funding the military … to wage war against the people of Myanmar.” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said the departure of Woodside following Total and Chevron underscored the need for coordinated and targeted sanctions from the US, EU, Australia, UK, Japan and other concerned governments on Myanmar’s natural gas revenues. “Myanmar’s military will continue to collect massive revenues from natural gas and other extractive sectors unless new targeted sanctions block foreign currency payments, because other companies will take over their operations. Sanctions are urgently needed now on MOGE and other military-controlled entities.” Pearson said the departure of energy companies from Myanmar would be only gestures so long as the junta kept making money. “The US, EU, Australia and others need to impose measures that will have real economic impact on the junta, if there is to be any progress on human rights.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/woodside-petroleum-to-pull-out-of-myanmar-one-year-on-from-military-coup;business and economy
1003;1003;1003;1003;1015;1015;Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station;2022-01-27;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Nuclear power', 'UK news', 'EDF Energy', 'Suffolk', 'Business', 'Energy', 'Environment', 'Sizewell C'];Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station;business and economy
1006;1006;1006;1006;1018;1018;UK car production slumps to lowest level since 1956;2022-01-27;['Jasper Jolly'];['Automotive industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'Nissan', 'Jaguar Land Rover'];"The lowest number of cars rolled out of British factories last year since 1956, as the industry warned that rising energy costs and further shortages of computer chips will plague its recovery. Car production slumped across the UK and the world in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the globe, but many in the industry had expected a rapid improvement. Instead, the disruption triggered a global shortage of semiconductor chips, leading to an even worse 2021. Total UK car production fell by 6.7% to just under 860,000, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry lobby group. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, described it as “a dismal year”, with output down by more than a third on 2019.
Jaguar Land Rover’s output for the year fell by a 10th compared with the year before, but the carmaker managed to regain its title as the UK’s largest manufacturer, after briefly losing out to Nissan in 2020. Hawes said the industry had managed to cope with the extra costs of Brexit, although he added that executives were watching recent delays at the Dover Channel crossing. However, Hawes warned that energy price increases that have also hit households were set to add further to UK carmakers’ difficulties. He said the industry urgently needed “measures to mitigate the escalating energy costs which are threatening viability,” and warned that higher costs could feed through to higher prices. Factories are braced for price increases of up to 70% when old contracts expire. Energy is generally carmakers’ third-highest cost, after materials and labour, but the sector is lobbying to be designated as an energy-intensive industry in order to qualify for extra government support. Nevertheless, Hawes said the industry was approaching 2022 with “a lot more optimism”, particularly as the supply of semiconductors rises to meet demand after earlier investments by chip manufacturers. He said he expected the industry to return to 1m cars produced annually on a consistent basis – although he added that a return to the more than 1.7m cars built in 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum, was unlikely without new manufacturers choosing the UK. The SMMT did highlight £4.9bn in investment announced during the year by the automotive industry – although that included the speculative announcement of £2.5bn by Coventry council in a battery factory project that is yet to attract a lead investor. The number of battery electric cars with zero exhaust carbon emissions produced in the UK rose by 72% during 2021, but it remains only a 12th of overall UK output. The UK’s van industry performed considerably better than passenger car makers, with production up 24% on 2020 and up 3% compared with 2019. Hawes said the online shopping delivery boom had contributed to “extraordinarily high demand” for vans.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/uk-car-production-slumps-to-lowest-level-since-1956;business and economy
1013;1013;1013;1013;1025;1025;‘Sitting ducks’: Collingwood defends England after Ashes bubble fatigue;2022-01-26;['Simon Burnton'];['England cricket team', 'Paul Collingwood', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Paul Collingwood has launched a remarkable defence of England’s players who were thrashed by Australia in the Ashes, saying their preparation for the series and the gruelling effect of two years in biosecure bubbles meant they went into it as “sitting ducks”. The assistant coach also believes that the tourists never had a chance of succeeding, that despite their poor performances they “deserve medals not criticism”, and that the series “was one step too far”. The manner of England’s defeat led Joe Root to call for a reset of a county system that he says is failing the national team, the England captain saying that “anyone that’s coming into the Test team is doing it in spite of county cricket, not because of it”. But Collingwood, three times an Ashes winner as a player, suggested the main cause of the team’s failure lies elsewhere.
He said: “I reckon if you had given us the best England cricketers from the last 100 years and put them in the same environment that those boys have lived in over the past two years with the preparation that we had going into this Ashes, even then they wouldn’t have had a chance.” Collingwood had particular sympathy for those who came to Australia straight from the T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates: “It’s the equivalent of the England football team being asked to go to a World Cup, then from that bubble into the Euros. Would you expect a performance from that scenario? It’s ludicrous.” He believes that for all the talk about the impact of bubbles on cricketers it remains significantly underplayed. “You can’t even explain what it’s like until you experience it,” he said. “In 2020 we went into the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford, and they don’t bring back nice memories. I’ve been scarred by what we had to go through in those places. You are living in the ground. You wake up, look out the window and there is the pitch. You cannot get away from it, can’t get out … If you’re a batsman, imagine if you nick off. All you want to do is get away, see the family, see friends that don’t talk about cricket. But you just can’t get away from it. “We kept cricket going for those two years. We had to do it for financial reasons. Players have had to sacrifice things, as have their families. You don’t see families when you are in the bubbles, or if they do come in it’s an awful environment for them to be in. It’s going to be impossible to measure the effect that had. “Australia is the hardest place to go to when you’ve got your best team in form and everyone’s playing consistently, never mind during a period of mental fatigue. “Hopefully bubbles are starting to move out of cricket now, because we have to protect the mental health of the players and management. What I have seen over the last two years is that we’ve kept the show on the road, and we saved a lot of jobs doing that. The Ashes was one step too far.”
Collingwood’s concern is that the gruelling impact of the pandemic on international cricketers will cause some to suffer serious long-term psychological issues and others simply to give up on the game, pointing to the South African Quinton de Kock’s decision to announce his Test retirement at the age of 29, and his compatriot Chris Morris retiring from all forms of cricket at 34, both within the last month. “Take someone like Chris Woakes, the most lovable and down-to-earth guy. I have seen him in some serious mental states,” Collingwood added. “We have seen Ben Stokes, someone we consider to be the most mentally tough cricketer in the world, being hit by this. I just hope there are no ramifications. These are things that might come out down the line. That’s what scares me.” Collingwood left the Ashes squad midway through the series to spend some time at home before travelling to Barbados, where he is acting as head coach for the T20 series against West Indies while Chris Silverwood, who has been the subject of intense criticism because of England’s Test performances, takes a break from the game. “To come away during the second Test was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done,” Collingwood said. “I was watching it thinking: ‘I just want to be out there.’ But I had to come home because I needed to see my daughters. “Going into the Ashes series off the back of a tough, tough bubble in Dubai I think was a step too far. I sympathise 100% with Spoons [Silverwood]. He has been criticised for rest and rotation. You understand when you are inside the bubbles that you have to get people out of there. He is one person who has really looked after his players and management. Him more than anyone else has been in those bubbles and tried to fight it through. I have 100% sympathy with Spoons, but I don’t think people really understand it unless they’ve been there.”
Collingwood said that a five-Test Ashes series, coming immediately after the T20 World Cup and which would inflict such strain on the players involved and their families, should never have been attempted. “Yes, we made mistakes, 100% we made selection mistakes, we made toss mistakes, but the fact we actually turned up and agreed a five-match Ashes series, the guys should be given medals for that,” he said. “It would’ve been much better if we’d done two matches and then three next year. That would’ve been a great compromise. But no, Australia were not bothered that they were going to receive an England team who were mentally fatigued, they just wanted to get the product out there. They just wanted the Ashes. We were sitting ducks.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/26/paul-collingwood-defends-sitting-ducks-england-and-blames-ashes-bubble-fatigue;sports
1014;1014;1014;1014;1026;1026;Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51 review – a fascinating and unusually honest look at illiteracy;2022-01-26;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Literacy', 'Education'];There was a programme, many years ago, about a specialist teacher and a class of mature learners who fell short of full literacy. It was extraordinary to watch as the teacher applied different teaching methods to help his students. The majority just needed reteaching in the standard way now they had matured and left childhood restlessness – or miseries – behind. Others needed more specialist help, which gradually winnowed the students down until there was just one left. She was desperate to be able to read, and convinced she never would. Her brain resisted all attempts to unlock the mystery for her, until the teacher realised the student was a kinaesthetic learner and had wooden letters made for her. She ran her hands over them and understood immediately what teachers had been trying to tell her for 40 years. There was no moment of such high drama in Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51 (BBC One), but the punchy directness of the Repair Shop presenter and furniture restorer kept things lively. For people like him, Blades explained – one of the 8 million adults in the UK who struggle with reading – the process is “like giving yourself a headache … Pure pain.” He has never read a book (including his autobiography – he told his life story to a ghostwriter) and once took a letter he knew was urgent from the hospital out on to the street to ask for help from a passerby because he had no one at home to help. On The Repair Shop, the production team brief him verbally before each scene rather than provide written notes. Like an estimated 10% of the UK population, Blades is dyslexic. But he was only diagnosed – after much prompting to make an appointment by his now ex-wife – at the age of 31. Words squiggle around on the page and his brain tries to guess what they are as they slip away from him. This is his first attempt at mastering the elusive skill since school. We follow him through six months of online lessons with Emma, a volunteer trained in the phonics method. We see enough of their interactions to demonstrate the size of the task before them and his difficulties with it, without lingering unnecessarily. He is provided with coloured filters to lay over the page, which stop the words swimming around. It is fascinating, for those of us lucky enough to have been successfully taught at a young age, to see the learning process anew. And perhaps even more fascinating to feel the innate points of connection that persist between the trained and untrained brain. You feel that, were you coming to it cold as he is, you too would find “muh” for “mouth” easier to understand than “eh” for “egg”. Nothing makes it clearer that the difference between literacy and illiteracy is not one of intelligence or ability – it is only education, and Blades’s childhood illustrates the contingency of that. “Did my mum ever read anything to me? Nah, that never happened,” he says in response to his fiancee’s question. “Did yours?” Yes, she says. “Really?” Blade’s mum was, he says, a busy, working single parent of two who came to the UK from Barbados at 13 and had got pregnant very young (“The man who contributed to my birth was nowhere to be seen.”) Blades grew up on a Hackney estate in the 70s – not a great place to be then, he says – and went unsupported at school, leaving without any qualifications. He dabbled in drug dealing, but got himself out and into a mature student university place. After a mental breakdown from which he was rescued by people he now calls his chosen family, he went on to the furniture restoration and television career he has now. “They took me in and saved my life,” he says, as he sits down to lunch with them. “If you don’t have support, what can you achieve?” “Well,” says his chosen mum, patting his hand, “you’re here now.” It’s a fine, tightly focused look at the many interdependent causes of illiteracy, and its effects, with unusually honest appraisals of them from Blades (who seems constitutionally incapable of flannel) and contributors. The educational psychologist Jackie Murray lays the problem out especially clearly. About 25% of state school pupils don’t meet expected reading standards by the age of 11. With dyslexia affecting about 10%, the statistical links between receipt of free school meals and attainment suggest that poverty and the lack of resources to combat it account for almost all the rest.

1038;1038;1038;1038;1052;1052;Kurdish forces retake prison from Islamic State after six-day siege;2022-01-26;['Martin Chulov'];['Syria', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news', 'Kurds', 'Iraq', 'Islamic State'];"Up to 2,000 Islamic State inmates who had overrun a Syrian prison have surrendered to their Kurdish captors, ending a six-day siege that marked the terror group’s most dramatic stand since the collapse of its so-called caliphate nearly three years ago. The peaceful finale to the standoff on Wednesday was at odds with its bloody beginnings when up to 100 extremists tried to storm the facility in the northern city of Hasakah and free those jailed inside. The raid on Thursday night, which was led by two suicide bombers, led to days of intense clashes, which claimed the lives of close to 40 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces and about 30 jihadists, and forced more than 50,000 civilians to flee. It also drew attention to the fate of up to 700 boys and youths, who had been kept in a wing of the prison. Their condition was not initially clear, but there were no reports of further violence or deaths after alarm was raised for their safety on Monday after several US airstrikes and intensive gunfire.
Ahead of the surrender, global concern had continued to mount. “These children should never have been held in military detention in the first place,” said the Unicef executive director, Henrietta Fore. “The violence they are subjected to may amount to war crimes.” The UN said most of the children in the prison were Syrian and Iraqis, many of them orphans. However, the rest were made up of 20 other nationalities and their continued incarceration once again raised demands that they be repatriated. “None of them has been charged with any crime under national or international law,” said Fore. “The children of foreign nationals have received little to no support from their home countries.” After the surrender, the SDF posted photographs of rows of men standing outside the walls of the prison, many dressed in the distinctive orange overalls worn by alleged terrorists in prisons on both sides of the Euphrates. In Hasakah, there was widespread relief among locals who had initially feared that the storming of the prison had freed hundreds of extremists “Now they are saying that it’s over, we hope this is the end so we can start our normal life again,” said Fawaz al Aswad, 35, from the Azizia area. “During this past week we were not afraid of gunfire but we were afraid of Isis sleeper cells. No one got hurt from my family, but one of my neighbours died. He was an SDF fighter.”
“We could hear gunfire all the time,” said Hala Muhammed, 31. “We were very afraid. If all countries have taken their Isis fighter(s) back now this would not happen. But it seems they want Isis to remain here for the time being.” Meanwhile, in north-western Syria a disturbance of a different kind – a savage winter storm – continues to cause disruption, with heavy snow and strong winds damaging thousands of tents used by the more than 1.5 million refugees in the province. NGOs have stepped up campaigns for funding for blankets and heating as the storm that brought deep snow to Istanbul and plunging temperatures from northern Iraq to Gaza continued to rage. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said that at least 545 tents have been reported destroyed and 9,125 tents damaged by snowfall, floods and winds. “The snow, freezing rain, and sub-zero temperatures are especially harmful to children, the elderly, and people with disabilities living in flimsy tents without insulation, adequate winter clothing, and heat,” it said in a statement. One group of aid workers, the Molham Team, recently raised more than $1m in less than two days to rehouse 250 families in Syria’s north-west from tents into houses. The appeal, with the Twitter hashtag #untilthelasttent, initially aimed to raise $500,000 and help 100 families, but double that amount was donated, and the group was able to rehouse the entire camp.

Since the draconian national security law was imposed in 2020, Beijing’s interference in Hong Kong has been increasingly flagrant. As shocking as the attack on the rule of law in Hong Kong is, we should also be asking why British judges are still propping up a broken system. British judges have sat in Hong Kong’s court of final appeal since the territory was returned in 1997. But the deterioration of the city’s legal system means they are now lending a false veneer of respectability to Beijing’s campaign against human rights and political freedom. The authorities in Hong Kong are no longer pretending to be on the side of democracy and justice. If British judges won’t stand themselves down in Hong Kong, then the president of the supreme court and the foreign secretary must remove British judges from Hong Kong immediately.

1085;1085;1085;1085;1099;1099;Fish growth slowed by high temperatures and plastic chemical BPA, research finds;2022-01-26;['Donna Lu'];['Fish', 'Australia news', 'Climate crisis', 'Plastics', 'Pollution', 'Wildlife', 'Environment'];"Fish grow slower when exposed to higher temperatures and a common chemical in plastic, according to new research. It suggests that a combination of plastic pollution and global heating could have a concerning impact on marine populations. Scientists at the University of Sydney have found that fish exposed to the industrial chemical bisphenol A – commonly known as BPA – require more energy to grow in high-temperature waters. BPA is a common chemical used in plastics manufacturing and is known to disrupt hormone signalling, with impacts in marine animals on metabolism and growth. In humans, it has also been linked to reproductive and developmental dysfunction. Millions of tonnes of the compound are produced globally each year.
The researchers exposed zebrafish to a level of BPA commonly found in waterways. They discovered that the chemical decreased the amount of energy the fish needed to grow at 24C, but hampered growth for those in 30C water – a temperature the animals would be likely to experience more often in their natural habitat under global heating. The study’s corresponding author, Frank Seebacher, a professor of biology at the University of Sydney, said the finding urgently highlighted the need for both climate change mitigation and plastic waste reduction. “The combination of high temperatures and BPA increases the energetic cost of growth – how much food animals have to eat to produce a given amount of biomass,” he said, adding the problem would be more pronounced for larger fish and predator species. “Because there’s a trophic cascade … [higher up the food chain] you’d expect to find fewer and smaller animals,” he said. “There’s a potential problem for sustainability in catch rates, if that combination [of warming and BPA] results in reduced stock.” Seebacher said BPA was released into the marine environment from manufacturing effluent as well as from plastics breaking down. “Wherever you have lots of manufacturing plants, lots of plastic pollution, you will find reasonably high levels of BPA,” he said, estimating such concentrations to be four to five times higher than the level used in their study. The researchers also modelled the risk of warming and plastic pollution in coastal areas in combination with current fishing intensity. Their analysis predicted that south-east Asia had the highest risk of decreased fish biomass as a result of warming and pollution. “Southern North America and northern South America [are also] going to be really affected,” Seebacher said.

One limitation of their findings is that the team conducted the study in zebrafish, a small freshwater species commonly used as a model organism in scientific research. Seebacher said he expected the findings to be similar in other fish species, although more research would be needed to determine this for certain. “All the endocrine systems … are highly conserved amongst vertebrates, so it’s unlikely that you’d have a massive divergence among vertebrates in how they respond [to BPA], but the possibility exists and has to be verified,” he said. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/fish-growth-slowed-by-high-temperatures-and-plastic-chemical-bpa-research-shows;environment
1099;1099;1099;1099;1113;1113;Are humans on the verge of ‘peace talks’ with the non-human world? | Barbara Ehrenreich;2022-01-26;['Barbara Ehrenreich'];['Animals', 'Coronavirus', 'Science', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'World news'];"Coronavirus has stopped us in our tracks and forced us to rethink our position as the rulers of the world. You could say it has done us a favour. An invisible enemy has challenged our treatment of the non-human world and the planet we share. For about 2,000 years most humans have imagined themselves to be the Earth’s “apex predators” – smarter, faster and more deadly than any other creature with which we share the planet. An article in a 2018 special issue of Scientific American praised our species for “the richness of our subjective experience” and “better cognitive skills and bigger brains” – although elephants have bigger brains and no one has worked out how to measure the “subjective experience” of non-human animals. Our species has not always been so conceited. If we go back 200,000 years, we would find the earliest Homo sapiens acting more like rabbits than lions – shivering at the sound of rustling in the tall grass and huddling at the sight of a pack of hyenas. How much of our existence as a species was spent battling and dodging more dangerous animals we do not know, but the (usually) men who conquered the marauding beasts were often memorialised in myth. Humans did not rise from their beleaguered status to anything resembling global dominance in a single leap. For many centuries, “civilised” or urban states embraced religions in which humans and non-human animals appeared to be more or less equals. At least in myth, they could speak to and understand each other, mate and quarrel with each other and, most clearly in the case of the Roman and Greek gods, behave like the lead stars in a reality show. Only with the arrival of monotheism, roughly between 1200BC and AD700, did the unique gods of each polity acquire names and something like personalities – Jaweh, Jesus and Allah. As these monotheistic super-gods grew and incorporated the attributes once spread among the many gods of polytheistic religions, they became more abstract and removed from the material world – to the point where that material world began to seem inferior and even disgusting, as illustrated by a bishop who educated his congregation by pulling out every feather, one by one, from a sparrow to punish it for being a “devil”, ie a non-human, a bird. Hinduism was far more tolerant, making no spiritual distinction between human beings and other life forms. The Covid pandemic presents us with a particularly sharp difference between two of the species populating Earth: on the one hand, the complexity of the human species, with its overgrown brain and its mobile limbs; and on the other hand, the simplicity of a microbe or sub-microbial particle such as a virus, which has evolved to prey on creatures larger than itself. In the late 19th century, humans, who had fought megafauna as predators and prey and had gone on to fight each other, confronted for the first time the invisible enemies that frequently attacked them and their children. Leading European scientists, notably Louis Pasteur, proved that diseases could be spread from one vessel to another, while the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck identified infectious agents he called viruses. Over the course of millennia, a pyramid of antagonistic creatures had arisen on our planet, ranging in size from viruses to bacteria to the cells that comprise whole living bodies. Humans have learned to make use of some of these tiny beings, for example in food production and medicine, but now we find ourselves in a less powerful position. We must, belatedly, come to an accommodation. This will involve rethinking the idea of our supremacy. There is hope for a more equitable arrangement between the Earth’s species. In 2012, an international conference in Cambridge, Consciousness in Human and Non-Human Animals, issued a “formal acknowledgment that many non-human animals, including mammals, birds and cephalopods, also possess ‘the neurological substrates that generate consciousness’”. This was, in its own way, a thunderous shift in human consciousness, which had so far given no quarter to the idea that non-human animals are capable of imagination, curiosity and other human-like traits. It raised a multitude of questions about humanity’s position in the world. What did the conference-goers mean by “consciousness”?
And why were scientists only now discovering animal consciousness, after generations of putting animals to work in their laboratories as sources of tissues and cells? What are the ethics of using animals, and who should decide? Perhaps the philosophical questions are the easiest to answer, and they are not easy at all. The practical questions are harder. Can we share the Earth with our fellow earthlings? What happens to the non-human animals incarcerated in feedlots and abattoirs? How will humans subsist if large chunks of the planet are “rewilded” for optimal animal life? We may be on the verge of making peace with our planet-mates, we may finally see the moral as well as practical reasons for doing so, but can we work out how? The burden of initiating “peace talks” between humans and non-humans no doubt lies with us. It is our kind that emptied the once crowded rivers and plains, who silenced the chatter of the forests and ploughed the grassy fields. We have a lot to learn from each other – assuming of course that the non-humans among us are still willing to make contact with creatures as bloody-minded as we have proved to be. And the first thing we humans will have to learn – the foundation of everything else – is humility.

1109;1109;1109;1109;1123;1123;Ukraine tensions: what is the Normandy format and has it achieved anything?;2022-01-26;['Patrick Wintour'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news', 'France', 'Germany', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy'];"What is the Normandy format? The Normandy format is an informal forum that was set up by French, German, Russian and Ukrainian diplomats in 2014, after Russia kickstarted a separatist conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. It takes its name from the Normandy landings in the second world war. The first meeting took place in Normandy on the margins of the ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the allied landings.
What has the format achieved? Not much. The Minsk protocol – a 2014 agreement reached in the Belarusian capital that sought to end the war in Ukraine – was mediated by France and Germany under the Normandy format. But it failed to stop the fighting, and a new package of measures – known as Minsk II – was signed in February 2015, after a fraught 16 hours of negotiations. This also did not end the fighting, though the Normandy format parties agreed that it was the basis for any future resolution to the conflict. Russia’s insistence that it is not a party to the conflict, and therefore is not bound by the terms of the Minsk agreements, has impeded progress. What was the gist of the Minsk protocols? The protocols were seen as complicated and fragile attempts to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, but at their heart they tried to reconcile Ukraine’s demand for full sovereignty over its territory with Russia’s insistence that the Russian-speaking people of eastern Ukraine required autonomy. They called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the battle zone, amnesties on both sides and exchanges of prisoners and hostages. What was done to end the impasse? Two schemes – the Morel plan and the Steinmeier formula – were floated in 2015 and 2016. Both proposed a “special status” law for the Donbas region that would come into force on the day of elections, if they were deemed free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Neither proposal was accepted by Kyiv, since Russian troops would remain during the elections. What happened in 2019?
After a three-year pause, leaders of the Normandy format met in Paris in December 2019. It was the first meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who had been elected as president of Ukraine in a landslide victory in April. Zelenskiy had made ending the war one of his campaign promises. Tentative agreements on prisoner exchanges and a total ceasefire were reached, but there was no political breakthrough to the now five-year-old conflict. The outcome was described as a draw. Why aren’t the UK and US involved? In his autobiography, David Cameron admitted it looked as if the UK had been carved out of the diplomatic effort in 2014, but maintained that he and Barack Obama did not want to grant Putin a large-scale meeting that could overshadow the commemorations of the liberation of France. “I was quite happy for the UK and the US to watch from a distance,” he wrote. Others, including his deputy, Nick Clegg, said it was a big strategic mistake for which the UK has since paid.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/ukraine-russia-tensions-what-is-the-normandy-format-and-has-it-achieved-anything;politics
1152;1152;1152;1152;1166;1166;Gen Z are bringing back ‘indie sleaze’, and I suddenly feel ancient | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett;2022-01-26;['Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett'];['Music', 'Culture', 'Fashion', 'Life and style'];"I saw a man in skinny jeans and winklepickers the other day, and found myself transported back to a time when I cared about men’s shoes. “I used to go wild for men dressed like that,” I told my bemused husband, who is older than me, and so didn’t buy into the early 00s indie scene and has never worn a pair of drainpipes in his life. Later that day I discovered that indie – or rather, the early-millennium indie aesthetic – is back, as popularised by the nostalgic Instagram account @indiesleaze and the TikTok trend. This is being old, I guess. “Are you ready for the return of indie sleaze?” Vogue asks, and the answer is no, I am not, because it was what, five minutes ago? I suppose it comes for all of us eventually, that feeling, which my mother fondly remembers as being encapsulated by the day I appropriated her boots from the 90s, declaring them “vintage”. Friends ponder whether the internet has accelerated trend cycles and, while there is probably something in that, it’s also time for ageing millennials to accept that, like every generation, we will be forced to see our youth subcultures appropriated and sold back to teenagers. “They’re selling Nirvana T-shirts in H&M now,” I remarked a few years back, offering an unwittingly late-capitalist bastardisation of Withnail and I (“They’re selling hippy wigs in Woolworths, man”). I was an indie girl, as the boys called us then, though I was never as much of a scenester as some of my friends. Yes, I drank at the Hawley Arms and the Good Mixer in Camden, went to Trash, saw the Strokes at a tiny secret gig. I wore the skinny jeans and the ballet pumps and the leather jacket, though I was always too Welsh to fully jettison the fake tan and eyelashes. On balance I preferred the way we dressed for the less pretentious nights out at indie clubs in Liverpool and Manchester: Converse-puncturing stilettos, prom dresses, big beehives scaffolded by rollers, but all with that slightly down-at-heel, sordid edge – smudged eyeliner, bra straps showing, big wet pouts – complemented by how our clothes smelled the next day of stale cigarette smoke, sweaty dancefloors, Chance by Chanel, and snakebite (God, snakebite!). Of course there was the music, that was the point of it, though it quickly became so heavily commercialised and marketed that it became known as “landfill indie”, the history of which was memorably narrated in a 2016 Vice article by Johnny Borrell, a man whose hubris rose to such heights that his quip that: “Dylan is making the chips, I’m drinking the champagne” went down in music interview history. (A Guardian review of Razorlight’s 2018 single Olympus Sleeping sniggered: “Hey Dylan, fire up the deep fat fryer, because Razorlight are back baby”.) It still makes me laugh, because that’s what much of that scene boiled down to, really: male egos. A part of me will always love the Libertines, but when they sang “And they all get them out … for the boys in the band”, they basically summed the whole thing up. Though there were some magnificent exceptions, especially on the more dancey, electro-y side of things – Karen O, Beth Ditto, Lovefoxxx, Peaches, Karin Dreijer – the early-00s indie scene was in large part about dirty-haired men with guitars, posturing and preening for the girls watching them. As a friend (not one of those pictured) who was “big in Camden” at the time fondly remembers: “My overriding memories involve starving myself to fit into the required uniform of denim cutoffs, getting ghosted by men a decade older than me in their skintight Topshop jeans … and putting so many drugs up my nose that I still have no feeling in my right nostril. “As a skinny, white, conventionally attractive girl I was welcomed into this hedonistic world where the boys in bands were king and sad girls their courtiers. The girls forgave all their bad behaviour – stealing our money for drugs, serial cheating, rampant misogyny – to avoid being called boring.” This was all pre-Me Too, remember, and we were very young. I liked the feeling of men being attracted to me, that locking of eyes across the dancefloor, the “meet me in the bathroom”-ness of it all, and to the men’s credit, they all danced. But I was less certain what to do with the feeling of being objectified by them, and the way women were photographed and perceived within the scene, as exemplified by Terry Richardson’s lo-fi, pornified aesthetic. By the time the music had descended to the nadir that was Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire and, that same year, druggy footage of Pete Doherty, Amy Winehouse and some baby mice appeared on YouTube, indie had faded. It all started to feel hollow and sad, all court dates and tabloid headlines and ballet pumps filling with blood. Then Amy died and the party truly was over.
So, while Gen Z are welcome to borrow from that time, they should bear in mind that there was always a bit of a dark side to it all (and should also be prepared, should they decide to play the Libertines’ Death on the Stairs, to be joined on the dancefloor by an onslaught of ageing millennial indie kids gesticulating wildly and mortifyingly). My mind boggles somewhat at the feminist strides that have been made even over the past decade when it comes to toxic male behaviour. Progress is a wonderful thing. Perhaps prioritise the style over the substances, is my advice. But what do I know? I’m an old lady now. An old lady who is about to clean up selling my old clobber on Depop.

Gallico, who died in 1976, worked with Fleming as a journalist on the Sunday Times. The James Bond author sent him the initial typescript of Casino Royale to see if it was publishable; Gallico told him it was a “knockout”, adding that Fleming’s torture scene “beats everything I have ever read”, and that the novel “goes in for frankness and detail far beyond any American-type thriller and could have a big sale”. “Get out of that office kid and write,” urged the American author of novels including The Snow Goose and The Poseidon Adventure in a letter included in John Pearson’s biography of Fleming.
While his papers are at Columbia University, Gallico’s private library has remained in his island home on Antibes since his death. It reveals the closeness between the two writers: “To Paul, who spread his wings over my first-born, 1956,” writes Fleming in the first edition of Diamonds Are Forever, which is expected to fetch £12,000-£18,000 at Chiswick Auctions on 27 January. In a first edition of Casino Royale, Fleming writes “To Paul from Balzache 1953” – a play on “balls/ache”, said Chiswick Auctions. Along with personal artefacts including Gallico’s leather Abercrombie & Fitch flying jacket from his time as a war correspondent, and his typewriters, the collection also reveals Gallico’s friendships with luminaries including Noël Coward, who wrote to him: “I was riveted by ‘Poseidon’ from beginning to end [...] I didn’t actually read it hanging upside down from a glass chandelier, but I was certainly hanging from the chandelier for several days after”. Marlene Dietrich writes in a telegram, “Thinking of you. Lonesome down under, Marlene”, while Graham Greene, a neighbour of Gallico’s on Antibes, gave him a first edition of his novel A Burnt-Out Case. The inscription reads: “For Paul Gallico – arrears for gratitudes to Antibes … From Graham Greene, 1961.” “The collection is a tangible reminder of a writer whose presence and works continue to entertain us, inspire us, so many years after his death,” said Clive Moss, head of rare books at Chiswick Auctions, describing Gallico as “a supreme writer and talent with an enduring quality that never fails to entice and capture our attention”.

Restaurants try messages on menus to help diners order less meat;2022-01-26;['Oliver Milman'];['Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'Food', 'Restaurants'];"Simple changes to messages on restaurants’ menus can double the frequency of customers choosing plant-based options instead of meat, research on the impact of food on the climate crisis has found. The production, transportation and consumption of food has become an increasing focus for climate researchers, with a recent study finding the food industry accounts for more than a third of the world’s total annual planet-heating emissions.
Much of the pollution is centered on meat. Raising cattle, chickens and pigs for meat, a process that often involves clearing large tracts of forest, causes about double the emissions of plant-based foods. Meat consumption remains stubbornly high in the US – the average American gobbled down 264lb of meat in 2020 – and is rising quickly in countries such as China. Many people are receptive to the idea of switching to vegetarian options in order to help the environment, however, the research found, with messaging on restaurant menus a potentially significant way of shifting behaviour. A multi-stage experiment by the research non-profit organisation World Resources Institute (WRI) involved about 6,000 people in the US and their reaction to menu descriptions. Researchers tested responses to 10 different sustainability-themed messages when the participants were asked to choose between different options on a menu, such as a bean burrito or beef burrito. Several of the messages produced dramatic results. Diners who read “Each of us can make a positive difference for the planet. Swapping just one meat dish for a plant-based one saves greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to the energy used to charge your phone for two years. Your small change can make a big difference” on their menus chose a vegetarian dish 25% of the time, more than double the rate of diners who were shown no message at all. Another message – “90% of Americans are making the change to eat less meat. Join this growing movement and choose plant-based dishes that have less impact on the climate and are kinder to the planet” – prompted 22% of people to opt for a plant-based dish, again far higher than the standard group. Other messages, about the taste of the food and the need to protect the planet for future generations, also yielded positive results in choosing vegetarian meals, suggesting that consumers’ choices can be significantly shaped by how menus are presented. “We know behavioral science is critical, it really moves the needle,” said Edwina Hughes, head of the “cool food pledge”, an initiative by WRI and the United Nations. “Themes of making a small change for a big impact and also around joining a movement really boosted the plant-based options.” Hughes said Americans were ready for a “nudge” towards vegetarian options, likening such messages to hotels requesting their guests not demand their towels to be replaced every day, as a way to save water needed to wash them. “Using descriptive messages that show the benefits of plant-based food choices can empower people to change their behaviour and choose lower-carbon dishes,” Hughes said. “We can do this because people are primed and ready for this sort of messaging. They are receptive to seeing messages about the climate and are actively seeking out brands and logos that indicate climate-friendly products and services.” WRI researchers said previous attempts to promote vegetarian options had fallen short. Dishes have functionally been named “vegetarian lasagne” or “meat-free sausages”, as compared with more enticing meat nomenclature such as “grass-fed beef” or “butter-fried chicken”.
When dishes are called vegan it “really turns off mainstream audiences. It comes across as preachy, righteous, aggressive,” said Jonathan Wise, a consumer researcher who added that more “inclusive” messages could get people to switch more easily to plant-based meals. “We launched a falafel burger in 2009, we said it is organic and it’s for vegetarians – it never sold well and we shut it down,” said Kaj Torok, chief sustainability officer at Max Burgers, a fast-food company that originated in Sweden. “The main thing we thought was: ‘Let’s not just go for this tiny group.’ It was important to go for the flexitarians [people who can skip eating meat] and those people who want to reduce their impact upon the climate.” Torok said Max Burgers’ focus was now taste, rather than whether what’s being served is meat or not, allowing it to drastically increase the number of plant-based burgers on menus. The company is part of WRI’s Cool Food Meals scheme, which has seen several food producers, including the Panera Bread chain, agree to disclose the carbon footprint of menu choices. Such labeling is far from universal, however, with most people unaware of the climate cost of the things they eat. “The time should be here where we have third-party verification of this,” Torok said.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/plant-based-food-restaurants-climate-menu-messages;environment
1191;1191;1191;1191;1205;1205;Our Country Friends by Gary Shteyngart review – lockdown tragicomedy;2022-01-26;['Sam Leith'];['Fiction', 'Gary Shteyngart', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Gary Shteyngart’s contribution to the burgeoning genre of the lockdown novel is very, very Russian – in the best possible way. The premise is that a group of old friends are to spend a month in the country (well, several months) riding out New York’s pandemic in a little ad hoc colony in the Hudson valley. The cast is a collection of privileged, mournful “lishnii cheloveks” (as the “superfluous men” of 19th-century Russian literature were known) in late middle age, pottering and squabbling in rural exile, wondering what the world is coming to and regretting the past. The host at what comes to be called the “Dacha of Doom” is Sasha Senderovsky, a dishevelled Russian-Jewish-American author who, like Shteyngart, has had considerable success with a series of comic novels about the Russian-Jewish-American experience. Now, though, his career is on the slide and if he can’t get a troubled TV script across the line he faces losing the country estate (well, house with a few bungalows attached) that is his pride and joy. He doesn’t have an actual cherry orchard, but the reader very much gets the drift. Here’s something of a departure – or at least a mellowing – for Shteyngart; the antic international satire of Absurdistan or the science-fictional Super Sad True Love Story is muted, while on his stylistic mixing board the slider marked melancholy has been notched up to 11. Sasha and his wife Masha and adopted daughter Nat (“Sasha, Masha, Natasha. They didn’t even try, these Russians”) are joined by his college friends Karen, Ed and Vinod. The former are distant cousins of Korean descent, the latter is a down-on-his-luck Gujarati American billed in the dramatis personae as a “former adjunct professor and short-order cook” recovering from lung cancer. Ed is from family wealth, single and – as an extraordinarily detailed and delicious-sounding recipe for veal tonnato indicates – a very good cook. Vinod nurtures a shy, unrequited, lifelong love for Karen. Karen is a wealthy tech-sis, over from the west coast, where she made a fortune with an app called Tröö Emotions that, supposedly, causes people to fall in love. The two wild cards in the group are Dee and a film star known only as The Actor (though, weirdly, we discover very late on that he’s called Joel). Dee is a former writing student of Sasha who has had a hit with a pugnacious essay collection about her poor white upbringing called The Grand Book of Self-Compromise and Surrender. She reveres Joan Didion, uses “y’all” judiciously, and likes to wear cowboy boots and a peasant blouse that “bring out a host of Pavlovian reactions in a wide cross-section of educated East Coast men”. The heroically vain and pretentious Actor – there ostensibly to work on that TV script with Sasha – exerts a power of his own: “Like a small damaged atomic reactor he could generate his own array of ‘feelings’, which he released into the air as background gamma. Everyone at the table except Senderovsky, everyone on the planet, in fact, wanted a dose.”
On the first night we find them all on the porch, socially distanced, “seated in their jackets and sweaters at a healthy remove from one another, as if they were organised criminals or dignitaries at the League of Nations”. The effect of the pandemic on writers is drily acknowledged: “Stranded social novelists up and down the river dutifully photographed hard-to-identify flowers and took notes on the appearance of gathering storm fronts and menacing thunderheads. More than one could be found looking up at a slumbering owl or a sunburned meadow beseeching their higher power to help me make something out of all this stillness.” Meanwhile, the dismaying forces of Trumpian America seem to be circling just off stage – white supremacist stickers are posted at the train station, and there are menacing drivebys from pick-up trucks. Soon, Ed and the Actor are both in love with Dee; Masha and Karen are fantasising about the Actor; and K-pop-fan little Nat – who is bright and obsessive – is being semi-adopted by childless Karen. At night, “in accordance with the rules of Russian novels, each thought about another”. One MacGuffin is the manuscript of Vinod’s first novel, which Sasha doesn’t want to admit he’s still hiding in a shoebox in his attic; another is Karen’s app, which is blamed for the Actor chasing Dee. Chekhov’s gun? That would be, I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say, a man with one lung in a Covid epidemic. (The main fault of the book is Vinod’s overlong and slightly repetitious dream/hallucination scenes.) The story is framed by a series of references to Russian literature (near the end, the inhabitants of the colony even stage a production of Uncle Vanya). But this is, being Shteyngart, very far from a solemn tribute to his literary ancestors. Among other things, there’s a pop-cultural parallel as the group become addicted to a Big Brother-style Japanese reality TV show. The real Chekhovianism is the way that Shteyngart’s comic style – the book crackles with good one-liners – is so consistently and to such effect shot through with plangency.
Here’s Karen on a country walk: “She stole a great big lungful of a budding forsythia, and then another, a city girl suddenly grateful. Easter would be coming soon, but her mother was still dead.” Or Karen in her bedroom: “There was a piece of paper resting on her side of the bed, the excerpt of a lesson Karen had been teaching Nat, spelling out in Hangul and English the most important of Korean phrases: ‘My head hurts, eyes hurt, mouth hurts, legs hurt, there is too little, there is too much, I don’t like it.’” A deftly equivocal note of sadness towards the end of the book seems to me to capture the tone particularly well: “They sat there between the ferns and the busy bike lane, passing around plates of food, surrounded by faces that looked like their own.” These characters, with their variously thwarted ambitions for love and fame, are wrangling with the realisation that they are ordinary, mortal, vulnerable, just like everyone else. We are all lishnii cheloveks. • Our Country Friends by Gary Shteyngart is published by Allen & Unwin (£16.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

1203;1203;1203;1203;1217;1217;Wednesday briefing: From party time to crunch time for Johnson;2022-01-26;['N/A'];['Gray report'];"Top story: Culpable or just ‘ambushed with a cake’? Hello, I’m Warren Murray. Make up your own mind, but hear me out first. Boris Johnson is braced for the most perilous 48 hours of his premiership, with Conservative MPs due to see Sue Gray’s report into Downing Street lockdown parties. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has meanwhile announced that her officers are investigating the parties and “I don’t anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is … necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions”. Those found to have breached regulations could be fined. Arch-critics of the prime minister are hopeful that Gray’s findings will be damaging enough to trigger what they believe will be the final trickle of letters needed to get to 54 and force a no confidence vote. A Conservative MP has caused mirth by claiming Johnson was “ambushed with a cake” at his birthday gathering in Downing Street during lockdown. Conor Burns told Channel 4 News on Tuesday evening that the gathering was “not a premeditated, organised party … He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake.” * * * Backup plan if Russia cuts gas – Natural gas supplies from around the world could be diverted to Europe if Vladimir Putin cuts the flow from Russia as part of an invasion of Ukraine. US officials said on Tuesday that they had been negotiating with global suppliers and were confident that Europe would not suffer from a sudden loss of energy for heating in the middle of winter. Joe Biden said on Tuesday if Russia attacked, it would be the “largest invasion since world war two” and would “change the world”. The US president said he would consider imposing personal sanctions on his Russian counterpart. * * * Midweek catch-up > Users of truly self-driving cars should have immunity from a wide range of offences including dangerous driving, speeding and jumping red lights, Britain’s law commissions have jointly recommended. > Almost 300,000 people in the UK have aortic valve stenosis, a potentially deadly condition where the main outflow valve of the heart stiffens and narrows, according to the first major study of its prevalence. > Fans are trying to have the Star Trek actor Nichelle Nichols freed from a conservatorship that was put in place in 2018 because she has dementia.
Nichols played Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in the original TV series and movies. Her supporters, including some “Free Britney” activists, claim she does not need a conservatorship, but merely help to manage her affairs. > A man has been charged with the murder of his 19-year-old daughter after a woman was hit by a car in Norfolk and died of her injuries. Nigel Malt, 44, is due to appear at King’s Lynn magistrates court today accused of the murder of Lauren Malt. > The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a campaign by Swedish alt-milk brand Oatly for misleading consumers. The ASA said Oatly claimed without proper evidence to have less environmental impact than dairy and meat products. * * * More Pegasus revelations – The mobile phones of a senior Human Rights Watch staff member are alleged to have been repeatedly hacked by a client of NSO Group at a time when she was investigating the August 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people in Beirut. The alleged hacking of Lama Fakih, a US-Lebanese citizen and director of crisis and conflict at HRW, marks the latest example of how NSO’s powerful surveillance tool, Pegasus, has been used to target campaigners and journalists. On Tuesday, NSO’s chairman, Asher Levy, said he was stepping down but denied it had any connection to recent developments. * * * ‘Ghost flights’ spew carbon – At least 100,000 “ghost flights” could happen across Europe this winter just so airlines can keep their EU take-off and landing rights, according to Greenpeace. It says the deserted, unnecessary or unprofitable flights could also generate up to 2.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The Lufthansa CEO, Carsten Spohr, said his airline may have to fly 18,000 such flights to meet the rules, and called for exemptions. The European Commission denies causing the problem: “If airline companies decide to keep empty flights, this is a company decision, which is not the result of EU rules.” The Ryanair CEO, Michael O’Leary, said airlines like Lufthansa should sell unfilled seats at cheap prices and be forced to release unused airport slots. * * * Mekong reveals more species – A monkey with ghostly white circles around its eyes is among 224 species newly listed in the World Wildlife Fund’s latest update on the greater Mekong region. The monkey, a new species of Popa langur found on the extinct Mt Popa volcano in Myanmar, was the only new mammal.
There are also dozens of newly identified reptiles, frogs and newts, fish and 155 plant species, including the only known succulent bamboo species, found in Laos. The Mekong region is a biodiversity hotspot, home to tigers, Asian elephants, saola – an extremely rare animal also called the Asian unicorn or spindlehorn – and thousands of other species. Today in Focus podcast: Met finally comes to the party After weeks of damaging allegations of parties and rule-breaking gatherings in Downing Street, the Metropolitan police have now opened an investigation. Could this spell the end for Boris Johnson?
Lunchtime read: If this is fun I’ve had it The author of a new book says having more fun builds resilience and will help get us through the next stage of the pandemic. Can the advice get Elle Hunt out of her funk?
Sport England’s preparations for the Six Nations were hit with yet more upheaval on Tuesday when Joe Marler tested positive for Covid-19 and Eddie Jones’s squad was later forced to evacuate the team hotel because of a fire. Fifa should tighten its proposed rules on intermediaries to limit the money made by super-agents, the influential Council of Europe will be told on Wednesday. Supporters and survivors have spoken of the chaotic scenes that left eight dead after a crush outside the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon, at the host nation’s Africa Cup of Nations tie against Comoros. Roy Hodgson oversaw training at Watford for the first time on Tuesday and has signed a contract initially until the end of the season as the club look to him to preserve their Premier League status. Ash Barty’s rapid march through the draw continued at the Australian Open as she faced her highest ranked opponent so far, the in-form 21st seed, Jessica Pegula, and treated her with the same disdain as all others who have crossed her path here this year. Business Shares have been mixed in Asia during muted trading as investors await indications from a US Federal Reserve meeting on how aggressive it will be in fighting inflation. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.7% in morning trading while South Korea’s Kospi, the Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite rose. Trading is closed in Sydney for Australia Day. The FTSE is about 60 points higher in futures trading ahead of the open. You can have $1.350 or €1.195 for your pound at time of writing. The papers
It’s another “continuing furore” edition of our front page roundup today. Here is the full version, whittled down follows. The Mirror’s headline is “Number’s up, PM” and it reports that “Sue Gray has pics of Johnson with wine bottles at No 10 parties as police launch criminal probe”. Our Guardian front page describes the “PM’s peril: report looms as police step in over parties”. The focus of the Telegraph’s front page is also the Gray report and the “mounting pressure” for Johnson to publish it in full.
The Daily Express wants us to think the Scotland Yard probe has actually been welcomed by Johnson and says “Yes PM, we all want ‘line drawn under’ partygate’”. The Sun has “Cops probe partygate” and says “Ten Downing Street is now a crime scene”. The i newspaper leads with the Metropolitan police investigation and a photo of an anxious-looking PM. The Daily Mail rather incredibly argues we are “A nation that’s lost all sense of proportion”, suggesting partygate should be brushed aside because there are other bad things going on in the world. The Times plays it straight: “Johnson faces police interview over parties”. The Independent follows suits with: “Now police investigate Downing Street parties”. The Financial Times has “Johnson gears up for survival fight”, quoting one Tory MP as saying: “He believes he’ll get out of this. His optimism is more than skin deep.” Sign up

1208;1208;1208;1208;1222;1222;‘I make stars look interesting, not beautiful’: Anton Corbijn on his favourite portraits ;2022-01-26;['Tim Jonze'];['Anton Corbijn', 'Culture', 'Photography', 'Art and design', 'David Bowie', 'Music', 'Naomi Campbell', 'Fashion', 'Damien Hirst', 'Virgil Abloh', 'Miles Davis', 'Photography'];"Anton Corbijn, speaking from his home in Kenya, holds a fried sardine between his fingers and positions it tantalisingly in front of his Zoom camera. “I’m sorry,” he says, “but somebody put these next to me and they smelled so good I had to take a bite.” Fried fish notwithstanding, Corbijn lives a “healthy life” in Africa and the distance to Europe hasn’t interfered with his work. His latest exhibition – which can be seen at his studio in the Hague and online at de-pury.com – positions him as a portrait photographer across a wide range of stars and subjects. Is this because the man behind some of music’s most famous images, from Joy Division to U2, is frustrated at being pigeonholed? “No,” he says. “I’m very proud of what I did in that genre. I just don’t feel that music photography is all I do. I’m a portrait photographer. It’s just that up until 1989, I only photographed musicians. Then I moved to LA, changed camera formats and added more subjects – actors, painters, models, directors – always people who are in the public eye and creative.” Before I let him return to his sardines, we discuss five iconic images from the new show. ‘I blew my cooker money on the flight out to Chicago’ David Bowie, Chicago, 1980
I was working as the main photographer at the NME and had just moved into a squat in east London. The NME’s Angus MacKinnon was going to interview David in Chicago but they wouldn’t allow a photographer. Thankfully, my parents had given me money to buy a cooker so I spent it on a flight and just turned up at the interview. It cost £800, a lot of money for me at the time, but these things pay off if you make life an adventure. Bowie’s assistant said: “What are you doing here? We had a deal – no photography.” Luckily, when David had visited Holland once, I had left my portfolio at his hotel. The next day, I was given it back with a note saying “thank you”. I thought it was just a “piss off” really. But when I told the assistant, she looked in her notebook and realised she’d scribbled down: “Best photographer in Holland – Anton Corbijn.” So I was in with a chance. She told David and he gave me permission. It was very kind, as he wasn’t actually allowed to be photographed in stage costume. The shoot was brief, but the next day we met in a bar to do more. He was an amazing guy, a gentleman, funny, all that stuff, but also extremely good looking and aesthetically aware. I remember there was a jukebox and he put on Frank Sinatra’s That’s What God Looks Like To Me. This is one of my favourite photographs. It’s not just a shot of Bowie, it’s a Christ-like thing. That’s what you hope for when you take photographs: that it transcends all the usual stuff. A lot of the credit has to go to him. It’s a beautiful gaze. What was he thinking? I don’t know. Maybe: “I’d like a beer.” ‘I didn’t know he was ill’ Virgil Abloh, Chicago, 2019
Virgil was preparing for a show of his fashion designs at Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art. This was taken just outside, for Vogue. The museum had windows with coloured material on them and I thought it would be interesting to shoot through that. It’s a playful image. I am a lot more playful than people think, though perhaps that comes out more in my videos. This was taken in the same year Virgil found out about his health [he was diagnosed with a rare cancer in 2019 and died in 2021]. Of course, I did not know anything about that. This image looks like he is in daylight with night encroaching. Sometimes, pictures can take on different meanings afterwards. I did a picture of Joy Division when I moved to England in 1979: Ian Curtis is looking towards the camera and the others look away. It’s as if I knew something but of course I did not. It did affect me when I found out Virgil had died because he was an incredible talent. He wasn’t your normal kind of designer. He was very smart. Far too young to leave. ‘I changed the number to 33 as that’s the age Jesus died’ Damien Hirst, Stroud, 2011
This is more of a concept photograph. The theme, obviously, is death. The eyes and nose were done with makeup as Damien stood in front of the camera. Behind him is one of his works, one that consists of dead insects. His jacket, from the G-star label, had a 3301 logo on it. I took the “01” off in post-production because 33 is the age Jesus died. This image references For the Love of God, the work Damien made of a skull encrusted with 8,601 diamonds. It wasn’t a collaboration: I just asked him if I could do a picture like that and he was OK with it. And it looks like a $50m picture to me! Damien is quite a normal-looking guy but with photography there is always a way to make the image work. I am a fan of his audaciousness. Some of his ideas are beautiful, some challenging, others not. But that’s not so important. He’s an innovator. ‘You’d never ask musicians to take their clothes off’ Naomi Campbell, London, 1994
When I was younger, I had real problems with outer beauty. I focused on what was beautiful on the inside and how to make people look interesting rather than beautiful. With models, I never knew what I could add to the apparent beauty already there. But then I met a few and they became people to me, rather than models. Although I took this in the 1990s, it wasn’t published until 2020 in my book MOØDe. I had been going through my archives and found all these pictures I had forgotten about. That’s what tends to happen: your selection becomes your memory of the entire shoot. You forget what else you have. This was one of the images I rediscovered. I liked it, with the shoe. It was taken in a hotel near Hyde Park. It felt natural to shoot Naomi nude because she was incredibly beautiful and natural looking. She has always been great to me. She knows how to give you something. Yes, I am aware of her fierce reputation but I never had a run in with her. Shooting musicians was nothing like this. Back in the 1970s, music was a very male-dominated field. You wouldn’t ask any of them to take their clothes off! ‘And what’s your name again?’ Miles Davis, Montreal, 1985
Miles was doing an interview with Richard Cook and I was allowed to sit in but not take pictures. He wasn’t particularly nice to Richard. Whenever he answered a question, he would say: “And what’s your name again?” I had a shoot with him the next day, five or six minutes in a hotel room. He gave me a drawing he’d done which was really nice. I still have it. Miles was a beautiful man. His stare here is very intense. I guess that’s how he lived. This was taken later in his life, when he was in a lot of pain. He took injections of goat serum that affected his pupils. That’s what is striking in this picture. His pupils are as large as you’ll ever see.
There’s a famous story of Miles having dinner with Ronald Reagan at the White House. Nancy says: “And what did you do to be invited here?” Miles replies: “I changed the course of music five times. What did you do apart from fuck the president?” I don’t know if it’s true but I like it. We shot near the window because I always use available light. I can’t recall why Miles took this pose but he liked it and wanted to use it for the album Tutu. Sadly, Warner Brothers said it had to be done by a famous photographer and I obviously didn’t qualify at the time. So they asked Irving Penn. I love the image Penn took but you can see where the inspiration comes from. Miles has such a strong, intense face. It’s so beautiful. A lot of photographers who photograph me ask me to do the same pose. I never look half as good. • The headline of this article was amended on 26 January 2022 to correct the spelling of Anton Corbijn’s surname. • de PURY presents: Anton Corbijn is at de-pury.com, 24 January to 28 February, and on show at the photographer’s studio in the Hague by appointment.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/26/anton-corbjin-portraits-interview-david-bowie-naomi-campbell-virgil-abloh;entertainment and culture
1218;1218;1218;1218;1232;1232;Why are Germany and France at odds with the Anglosphere over how to handle Russia?;2022-01-26;['Patrick Wintour'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'France', 'Germany', 'Nato', 'US news', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Foreign policy', 'US foreign policy'];"Can the western alliance against Russia over its buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border hold together? It is a question that politicians and diplomats are increasingly grappling with amid fears that Germany and, to a lesser extent, France are in danger of dividing from the US and the UK, not only over how to respond to any future Russian act of aggression in Ukraine, but also in their assessment of the imminence of the threat. Every effort is being made to minimise the differences within the Nato alliance, including through regular calls such as the one led by Joe Biden on Monday, but they may be impossible to avoid since they reflect not just different short-term assessments on intelligence, but a deep fissure going back decades about what Germany and France, as opposed to the Anglosphere, regard as the best way to handle Russia. France, looking at the same intelligence provided by the CIA, does not see an imminent invasion, or a gathering of forces equipped to invade in the next three weeks – an assessment shared by the best Ukrainian defence analysts. In Britain, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been openly critical of Germany for leaving itself so dependent on Russia for energy, and Berlin’s recent refusal to allow Estonia to send German-manufactured arms to Ukraine. The idea of Germany providing weapons to be used against Russia for the first time since the second world war is anathema. Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, defended the decision, saying it was rooted “in the whole development of the past years and decades”. In Poland, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said in a Facebook post that he remained concerned by the block on Estonia. In the US, the German question is increasingly riling Republicans, leading to commentary in the Wall Street Journal with the headline “Is Germany a Reliable American Ally? Nein.” The tensions reflect two different interpretations of how, even now, Russia can be prevented from becoming a force hostile to the west, interpretations that have dominated politics after the cold war. The differing assessments in Berlin, Washington, Paris and London of how to construct something stable out of the rubble of post-Soviet Russia have always been in flux, with different capitals taking different views at different points. The US under Bill Clinton was as reluctant as anyone to let the four Visegrád countries – the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia – into Nato and made his belief about the risks absolutely clear at the organisation’s summit in January 1994, saying the Atlantic Alliance could not “afford to draw a new line between east and west that would create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation”. Tony Blair also had to be disabused that Britain could lure Putin into the western camp, and was an enthusiastic supporter of Russia joining the G8. Boris Johnson visited Moscow as foreign secretary in 2017 and, despite the Salisbury poisoning, has been extraordinarily lax about Russian money in London. France too has blown hot and cold in the wake of Russia’s occupation of Crimea in March 2014. It was only after sustained American pressure that François Hollande cancelled a £1bn contract signed by his predecessor as French president to sell to Russia mistral-class helicopter gunships bound for the annexed Black Sea ports in Crimea.
Emmanuel Macron invited Putin to Versailles alongside an exhibition about Peter the Great in May 2017. Faced by Trump’s isolationism, Macron, in a major speech in 2019, called for an end to the “frozen conflicts” with Russia. In June last year, in conjunction with Angela Merkel, he blindsided other EU leaders by offering Putin a summit. In Berlin on Tuesday, the French president said he was still planning to talk to the Russian leader this week, but only about de-escalation. However, the central player in Europe’s relations with Russia is Germany, as it has been since unification. Quite why Germany takes such a stubbornly forgiving, or optimistic approach to Putin fills libraries, and the most recent offering titled Germany’s Russia Problem, written by John Lough, details the full extent of the networks – commercial, political, cultural and intellectual – between German and Russian elites. It also explains how Putin plays on German war guilt and refuses to repay German forgiveness. The examples Lough raises include how in the wake of Russia’s intervention in Georgia in the summer of 2008, the then German Social Democrat (SPD) foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, warned Europe against sanctions that he said would shut doors to rooms it wanted to enter later. Although Merkel’s response to the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was firm, Steinmeier, sure that the SPD understood Russia better than Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, went to Moscow and proposed an economic partnership with Russia. At the same time, three former chancellors of Germany – Helmut Schmidt, Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Kohl – all warned Merkel not to isolate Moscow. Within a week of the invasion, the chief executive of Siemens was in Moscow. As the diplomatic situation worsened, a group of senior German former officials and politicians sent an emotional letter calling for a return to the policy of detente. This German-Russian relationship, a recent Chatham House paper argues, has been shaped by two factors. First, Ospolitik, which refers to the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states that was pursued in the 1970s by the Social Democrat chancellor Willy Brandt, and that tried to overcome hard lines by focusing on joint interests. The policy is still considered by many to be the way forward. Second, the mutual dependence deal between the two countries that dates from the 1970s, when the Soviet Union and Germany agreed to exchange natural gas from the USSR for German pipes and steel. It is premised on the belief expressed by Schmidt that “those who trade with each other do not shoot each other”. By 2018 Germany accounted for 37% of Gazprom sales, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had been agreed. German exports to Russia rose fivefold between 2000 and 2011. That remains the dominant thinking inside parts of the SPD. The current economics minister, Robert Habeck, whose ministry is responsible for sanctions, is opposed to cutting off Russian access to the Swift payments system. He told Der Spiegel: “We should think about new areas of business that can help lead both sides out of the confrontational role.” However, in recent weeks the compromises inherent in Ostpolitik have come under challenge from a younger generation. Michael Roth, the SPD chair of the foreign affairs committee, argued his party had to escape the shadow of Brandt, adding “we cannot dream the world to be better than it is”. Other ministers have insisted that energy, including the future of Nord Stream 2, cannot be removed from the list of potential sanctions, as it was in 2014. All this leaves Scholz in a different position with his US interlocutors, none of it made easier by his alliance with a Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who wishes to inject values into German foreign policy. The SPD, to avoid a public split, is now going to have a formal party debate about its approach to Russia. One diplomat pointed to the relevance of a remark by Alexander Solzhenitsyn just as the Soviet Union disintegrated, who warned about how perilous it might prove to manage the breakup of the empire. “The clock of communism has stopped striking. But its concrete building has not yet come crashing down,” he wrote. For that reason, the task ahead was not yet about “freeing ourselves”, but instead “to try to save ourselves from being crushed by its rubble”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/nato-allies-policy-russia-ukraine-analysis;politics

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said successful talks between London and New Delhi had the potential to gain “first-mover” advantage in India and replicate the success of German manufacturing exporters to China. But the report noted there was a risk of Britain’s business services firms – one of the economy’s strongest sectors – being undercut by lower-cost Indian rivals in a repeat of the hollowing out of US manufacturing by Chinese competition. India has traditionally been one of the toughest markets to break into, but is forecast to become the world’s biggest importer by 2050. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, opened talks with India’s minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal, earlier this month. The move is part of a pivot towards trade with Asia following Britain’s departure from the EU and slow progress in talks with Washington. The UK is seeking to become a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) – an 11-nation group that includes Japan, Chile, Australia, Canada and Singapore. Sophie Hale, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While much of the focus has concentrated on becoming the first European country to join the huge CPTPP region, the far bigger potential economic gains and risks lie in more trade with the huge, rapidly growing, but still relatively closed Indian economy. “Trade liberalisation with India is expected to boost UK manufacturing in the short term, but could also benefit business services, where UK firms already enjoy a competitive advantage, and where demand is set to soar.” Hale’s report said UK firms exporting to India currently face far higher tariffs (19%, on average) than they do to the US (2%), providing far more scope for trade liberalisation. Securing a free trade agreement with India could also give UK firms a first-mover competitive advantage over exporting firms in the US and EU, which don’t have preferential access to the Indian economy.
India is forecast to become the world’s third-largest import market by 2050, while its demand for business, telecommunications and computer services – sectors where UK export firms already perform well – is expected to treble over the course of the 2020s. “But India is changing as well as growing, so any trade deal means accepting uncertainty about the competition that will face UK firms, as the price for access to a fast-expanding market,” Hale said. The report noted India had a comparative advantage in the export of business services – especially the high-end business services sector clustered in London and the south-east.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/uk-could-gain-first-mover-advantage-with-india-trade-deal;business and economy
1247;1247;1247;1247;1261;1261;Scott Morrison WeChat: new owner amazed account entrusted to ‘single person’ in China;2022-01-25;['Donna Lu', 'Daniel Hurst'];['Scott Morrison', 'Australia news', 'Anthony Albanese', 'China', 'Asia Pacific', 'Social media', 'Coalition', 'Australian politics'];"The new owner of Scott Morrison’s WeChat account has expressed disbelief that it had been entrusted to an individual in China – and is now considering shutting it down amid a growing political storm. Earlier this month, subscribers to the Australian prime minister’s official WeChat profile were notified the account had been sold to the Fuzhou 985 Information Technology Co Ltd and had been renamed “Australian Chinese New Life”. The account’s new owners have not yet posted any content, despite claims by a News Corp tabloid that it had been “rebranded as a pro-Beijing propaganda outfit”.
Some members of Morrison’s Liberal party are now calling on Australian politicians to boycott WeChat, citing concerns about potential foreign interference. The platform has been used by both major Australian political parties to connect with the Chinese-Australian community. Huang Aipeng, the legal representative for the Fuzhou software development firm, told Guardian Australia he only learned on Monday that the account belonged to Morrison. “When I was first told that this account belonged to Morrison, I didn’t believe it at all,” he said on Tuesday. “How could a big head of state have handed over his WeChat account to a single person to manage?” Huang categorically denied any allegations of foreign interference. “I’ve had absolutely no contact over here with any kind of government-related body,” he said. Huang said he bought the account for his company as a formal business transaction in keeping with Wechat’s platform migration rules. He bought it directly from an acquaintance with the surname Ji, who could not be contacted. Huang said he had bought the account because it had a high number of followers, and had intended to provide Chinese-Australians with “practical lifestyle information”. Huang would not disclose how much he paid for the account, but said the transfer was finalised in January. There have been no posts on Morrison’s former account since 9 July, when the prime minister responded to the NSW lockdown announcement by promoting the $500 Covid disaster payment. Fuzhou 985 Information Technology Co Ltd was founded in 2015. A listed website with a similar name, which describes itself as an “authoritative betting platform” for live sports and gaming, was not associated with the firm, Huang said. “I never imagined this account would have anything to do with the Australian government,” he said. “Now that I understand the situation, I might shut down the account.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The Australian defence minister, Peter Dutton, directly accused the Chinese government of involvement in the takeover of Morrison’s account. “The fact that a leader of a democratic country can’t have an uninterrupted presence on a major media platform, social media platform, I think says a lot about the approach of the Chinese government and it’s unacceptable,” Dutton said on Tuesday. Dutton said Australia wanted a “peaceful, pleasant relationship” with the Chinese government, but added: “I’m not going to ignore the attributes of the Communist regime, which is involved in dissemination of disinformation and ultimately, in this case, interfering with the prime minister’s WeChat account.” The comments came a day after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said: “The accusation of China interference is nothing but unfounded denigration and smear.” WeChat’s owner, the Chinese tech giant Tencent, said there was “no evidence of any hacking or third-party intrusion” of Morrison’s account, and it “appears to be a dispute over account ownership”. “The account in question was originally registered by a PRC [People’s Republic of China] individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company – and it will be handled in accordance with our platform rules,” Tencent said. Analysts say “subscription accounts” on WeChat require registration by a Chinese national. An alternative option is a “service account”, which does not require a Chinese national third-party to register, but it may be less attractive to politicians because it allows fewer “push-notification-enabled articles”, according to Fergus Ryan, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Ryan on Tuesday cited records indicating the WeChat account of the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was also linked to a Chinese national, which could place him “in exactly the same boat that Scott Morrison is in”. “That means that the woman from Jiangsu province who appears to be linked to Anthony Albanese’s WeChat account could at any time be pressured, be persuaded or decide on her own accord to shut down or sell the account, and that situation is untenable,” Ryan said in an interview. “It would be my hope that both the Labor and Liberal parties agree to boycott WeChat.” A Lowy Institute survey of 1,040 adults in Australia who self-identify as of Chinese heritage conducted found two-thirds of those polled used WeChat either “often” or “sometimes” to read Chinese-language news. That research was conducted in November 2020. Ryan said it was in the interests of Australian democracy that, as much as possible, the political discussion with citizens “doesn’t go through that prism of the Chinese censorship apparatus” because that would “skew the discourse”. “WeChat certainly is an important tool for Chinese Australians to stay in contact with family and friends in the PRC, but it is essentially an extension of the Great Firewall outside of China,” Ryan said. “People outside China using WeChat are essentially in a bubble that is highly censored and heavily surveilled.” Guardian Australia asked Morrison’s office whether it had ever tried to secure a WeChat account without a Chinese national being an intermediary. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “That option was not made available to us despite being asked by Tencent for and providing proof in 2020 the account was managed on behalf of the prime minister.” Albanese said on Monday he would be happy to speak directly with Morrison about any potential security concerns. In December 2020, Morrison brushed off a decision by WeChat to censor his post complaining that the dispute over a Chinese official’s “post of a false image of an Australian soldier does not diminish our respect for and appreciation of our Chinese Australian community or indeed our friendship with the people of China”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/scott-morrison-wechat-new-owner-amazed-account-entrusted-to-single-person-in-china;politics

Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his squad before the transfer window shuts next Monday and Díaz has emerged as a key target. Spurs are braced for a busy week and want to move players in and out of the club. They are hopeful of an agreement with Wolves for Adama Traoré, who Conte intends to convert into a right wing-back, but they will have to increase their offer for Díaz.
The Porto winger has a £66m release clause and Spurs have been told their opening bid for the 25-year-old is not enough. Díaz, a Colombia international with 31 caps, is one of the most exciting talents in Europe and has scored 14 goals in 18 league games this season. He has also been linked with Manchester United. Conte has made clear that Spurs, who are seventh, must revamp their squad if they are to challenge at the top of the Premier League. The Italian also wants to strengthen in central midfield. He has looked at Fiorentina’s Sofyan Amrabat, who is his preferred option, and Milan’s Franck Kessié, who is out of contract this summer. Spurs are ready to offload those not in Conte’s plans. Tanguy Ndombele, the club’s record buy, could join Paris Saint-Germain on loan. Dele Alli and Giovani Lo Celso are also available after failing to make the bench in the defeat at Chelsea on Sunday. Newcastle are interested in a loan deal for Alli, who has also been linked with Southampton. Meanwhile Manchester City have struck an agreement to buy the Argentina forward Julián Álvarez from River Plate for €18.5m (£15.5m) plus add-ons. Contracts are being prepared with a view to announcing the deal this week. Álvarez will continue with River until July before moving to England on a five-year contract.

1276;1276;1276;1276;1291;1291;Rights groups call for statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Met;2022-01-25;['Damien Gayle'];['Metropolitan police', 'Gender', 'UK news', 'London', 'Police', 'Violence against women and girls'];"Women’s rights groups have called for a statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Metropolitan police after derogatory comments by officers about an academic while she was strip-searched showed how “deeply embedded” sexism is in the force. In CCTV footage published by the Guardian, police officers made disparaging remarks about Konstancja Duff while she was strip-searched at Stoke Newington police station. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was among the many people to express shock and outrage on Twitter, describing the incident as “disgraceful” and “strongly condemn[ing]” the officers’ behaviour and language.
On Tuesday, women’s rights campaigners said the episode was yet further evidence of institutional misogyny in the force. The Met has faced sexism scandals for decades but particularly in the nine months since Sarah Everard was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Wayne Couzens, an officer in an elite Met firearms unit. Anna Birley of Reclaim These Streets said the actions of the officers who strip-searched Duff, as well as the Met taking eight years to disclose the footage, “means this cannot be written off as yet another bad apple”. “By closing ranks to protect their own, and forcing Konstancja to have to fight so hard to simply get an apology, it’s clear that this is institutional, and as such amounts to nothing less than state-sanctioned sexual assault,” Birley said. “Misogyny in the Met police is systemic and cultural – and this is why we have been calling for the Wayne Couzens inquiry to be widened in scope and made statutory. Without this, we risk the Met yet again closing ranks, prioritising their own reputation over women’s safety and blaming a handful of named officers rather than the culture that created and protected them. “And in the meantime, the Met must urgently confirm that all officers involved will face robust and transparent disciplinary action – without this, how can women ever trust them?” Priti Patel, the home secretary, is facing a legal challenge over proposals for an inquiry into Couzens’ conduct as a police officer, with critics claiming it is too narrow in scope. The Centre for Women’s Justice began judicial review proceedings against her department in December, also calling for the inquiry to be put on a statutory basis. Duff’s case was a prime example of why that needed to happen, Debaleena Dasgupta, a solicitor with CWJ, said. Dasgupta added: “The CCTV footage in Dr Duff’s case shows how deeply embedded, and tolerated, sexism is in the Metropolitan police. A further question arises: why did it take so long for the police to provide that evidence, despite the earlier complaint proceedings? “This case will add to women’s mistrust in policing. It is another example of why, if Priti Patel is serious about restoring faith in the police, that her inquiry must be conducted on a statutory footing so it has the power to compel evidence and must be widened to look at all the relevant issues.” But for some campaigners, yet another inquiry into policing was not enough. Sasha McLean, of the activist group Sisters Uncut, said policing was a job that attracted and created people with “the proclivity for coercion and control”, and solving that required radical change. “We have to move beyond this idea that the police can somehow be reformed or changed internally, that if we just investigate and tinker around the edges we can make it slightly less sexist than it is already, because the issue is fundamental, it’s structural, it’s institutional, it has to do with the fact that police exist to coerce and control urban and working-class populations,” McLean said. “I’m not going to say that we don’t welcome scrutiny, but at the end of the day the investigation’s being conducted by the very people who rely on the police to protect their own power, so this investigation is hardly going to reveal that the police has got an institutional, fundamental problem that perhaps require a complete reworking and abolition of the institution.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/rights-groups-call-for-statutory-inquiry-into-misogyny-in-the-met;environment
1277;1277;1277;1277;1292;1292;Oil firms accused of scare tactics after claiming climate lawsuits ‘a threat to US’;2022-01-25;['Chris McGreal'];['Climate crisis', 'US news', 'World news', 'Environment'];"US oil firms have been accused of using scare tactics after telling a federal court on Tuesday that lawsuits alleging fossil fuel companies lied about the climate crisis could threaten America’s oil supply. At a closely watched appeals court hearing to decide whether a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore should be heard in state or federal court, an attorney for BP, Exxon, Shell and other energy firms painted the case as a threat to America’s energy independence.
Kannon Shanmugam, representing the industry, told the court that if the city were to succeed in state court, and win billions of dollars in compensation, that could kill offshore drilling. “The relief that Baltimore seeks would deter, if not render entirely impractical, any further production on the outer continental shelf,” he said. Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University who specialises in climate litigation, called the claim one of a number of “scare tactics” deployed by the oil industry as it fights to move the Baltimore case and other cases out of state jurisdictions, where consumer protection and other laws favour the plaintiffs, and into federal courts, where the fossil fuel companies believe they have the advantage. “It’s a scare tactic, which is telling the courts to back off, we’re a very powerful industry and we’re essential right now to energy security. If you step into this, you’re going to screw everything up,” she said. Baltimore’s case accuses oil firms of breaching Maryland state consumer protection and other laws by running disinformation campaigns to cover up what they knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels. The outcome of Tuesday’s hearing will influence similar cases within the same federal jurisdiction, including a suit by Charleston, South Carolina. It may also have a bearing on nearly a dozen other lawsuits by states and municipalities in other jurisdictions. A federal appeals court in Hawaii is scheduled to hear a similar case next month. Shanmugam told the court that the case should fall under federal jurisdiction because pollution is regulated by national laws, and the climate crisis is a national and international issue. Shanmugam also accused Baltimore and other municipalities of using the courts to try to change climate policy. “Global climate change is obviously the subject of international agreements, as well as pervasive regulation by the federal government,” he said. Vic Sher, representing Baltimore, said the city’s case was not about the regulation of pollution but the lies told by the fossil fuel industry. “The goal of the complaint, sadly, cannot address global climate change. It’s focused very narrowly on a past pattern of conduct based on deception and failure to warn, and it seeks compensatory damages for injuries that flow from that past conduct,” he said. Sokol said the judges appeared “very sceptical” about the basis of the oil industry’s claim that the Baltimore case belongs in federal court. She said the industry’s legal argument did not address the substance of the city’s claim that big oil ran a disinformation campaign and lied about the harm caused by its part in creating the climate crisis, and instead tried to put the focus on who regulates pollution. Sokol said that if the appeals court decision went against the oil industry, she expected the firms to try to go back to the supreme court as part of a strategy to delay the Baltimore case and others being heard by a jury for as long as possible. “It will continue to fight this thing out in the procedural stage till hell freezes over, before it allows it to get to discovery, much less a trial, because it knows the civil discovery system of state courts is so powerful that it would be forced to disgorge documents that would shed light on the extent of this disinformation campaign even beyond what we already know.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/25/climate-lawsuits-oil-firms-bp-exxon-shell;environment
1296;1296;1296;1296;1311;1311;Patient removed from heart transplant list for refusing Covid-19 vaccine;2022-01-25;['Gloria Oladipo'];['US news', 'Coronavirus', 'Massachusetts'];"A Boston-area hospital said it will not perform a heart transplant on a patient who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccination. DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women’s hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson’s family, according to a report by CBS Boston. “It’s kind of against his basic principles – he doesn’t believe in it,” said David Ferguson, his father. “It’s a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won’t get the shot, they took him off the list [for] a heart transplant.”
Brigham and Women’s explained its reasoning in a statement: “Like many other transplant programs in the United States – the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation.” Other medical experts have declared their support of the hospital’s policy, noting that the immune system is extremely weak after a transplant, making vaccinations all the more important. “Post any transplant, kidney, heart whatever, your immune system is shut off. The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, Covid could kill you,” said Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS Boston. “The organs are scarce: we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.” Ferguson’s family have said they are unsure of what to do next given his refusal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. They have considered transferring him to a different facility but acknowledge he might not survive the trip. “We are aggressively pursuing all options, but we are running out of time,” said David Ferguson. The family said that while had received excellent care at Brigham and Women’s, they do not agree with the policy. “I think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously, and he has integrity and principles he really believes in, and that makes me respect him all the more,” said Ferguson of his son, who is a father of two children with another one on the way. “It’s his body. It’s his choice.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/heart-transplant-patient-refusing-covid-19-vaccine;health
1316;1316;1316;1316;1331;1331;Parents in NSW threatened with court action for keeping children home from school;2022-01-25;['Michael McGowan'];['New South Wales', 'Australian education', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Parents and parenting'];"Parents in New South Wales have been threatened with court action for keeping their children home from school because of concerns about catching Covid-19. Classes in NSW will resume next week after the release of the state government’s return to school plan on Sunday. While the government said the plan – which includes the use of rapid antigen tests and a rollout of about 20,000 air purifiers across the state – means students can go back to classes safely, some parents remain sceptical.
On Monday, the Guardian reported that a group of concerned parents plan to file legal action against the Department of Education over its refusal to grant them permission to keep their children at home because of fears about contracting the virus. Despite premier Dominic Perrottet insisting on Tuesday that it would be “ridiculous” to fine parents who keep children out of school, the Guardian has confirmed that the education department has denied numerous attempts by parents to seek exemptions for their children throughout the pandemic. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, Sterre Siegenbeek van Heukelom, a mother from the Illawarra region of NSW, was last year denied leave to keep her son home from school on the basis that she, not her child, was classified as being vulnerable to the virus. The correspondence – which is similar in tone to other advice given to parents – stated that advice from NSW Health was that there is “limited risk” in students bringing Covid from school into the home. It stated that exemptions would only be granted in cases where a medical practitioner “explicitly advises” the student should not attend classes. Despite later providing medical advice from her doctor, Siegenbeek van Heukelom’s requests for an exemption have continued to be denied. “In summary, your son is not ill, but lives with someone who is at increased risk,” one letter from the department to Siegenbeek van Heukelom stated. “Learning from home for your son can only be supported if clear and explicit medical advice stating that he should not attend school face to face is received.” Siegenbeek van Heukelom, who has health conditions which placed her in the 1b category during the vaccine rollout, said it was ironic that NSW Health advice about avoiding indoor gatherings did not apply to school settings. “With the transmission and rate of the virus going around in the community it doesn’t feel safe for me as someone who is vulnerable to the virus, and NSW agrees with me that enclosed spaces with many people not being able to socially distance and not being able to wear masks is not ideal,” she said.
The government has said that the social, educational and mental health benefits for students attending classes far outweigh the health risks associated with the virus, but the premier has repeatedly said he understands the anxiety facing some parents. Perrottet on Tuesday insisted that parents wouldn’t be punished for keeping children at home during the Omicron wave due to existing health concerns. “When we talk about parents being concerned [and] anxious, particularly in circumstances where their children may have underlying health conditions, we’re certainly not going to be fining parents,” he said. But parents have been threatened with legal action. In a letter sent by a principal to a mother with a pre-existing health condition who kept her child away from school last year, the threat of court action was raised because of “unsatisfactory attendance”. “I am required to make an application to the home school liaison program … for consideration of further action,” the letter stated. “An attendance officer may be allocated to work with you and the school to develop an attendance improvement program. “If you do not meaningfully engage with the attendance improvement program, or there is no improvement in [your son’s] attendance … the Department of Education and Communities may consider further action such as an application to the children’s court for compulsory schooling orders.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
In a statement, the Department of Education did not respond directly to questions about whether parents could be punished for keeping their children at home once term resumes due to a fear of contracting Covid. Instead a spokesperson said regular attendance at school for all students was “essential to learning and wellbeing”, and cases in which parents were concerned about their child’s attendance would be “managed collaboratively in partnership between schools and parents”. “When schools are open, all students should be at school unless they are unwell; or they have a medical certificate which states that they are unable to return to school due to an ongoing medical condition,” a spokesperson said. “These students can be supported to learn from home provided a valid medical certificate is supplied. “There are a range of options available if students are prevented from attending school, including the sick or general leave and exemptions from attendance under Section 25 of the Education Act 1990. We always act reasonably when considering leave explanations and exemption applications and will continue to do so.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/parents-in-nsw-threatened-with-court-action-for-keeping-children-home-from-school;business and economy
1341;1341;1341;1341;1356;1356;‘I wanted to try cocaine, but Jimi was against it’: Janis Ian on her tough, starlit life in music;2022-01-25;['Sarfraz Manzoor'];['Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Folk music', 'Culture'];"‘I learned the truth at 17 / That love was meant for beauty queens / And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles / Who married young and then retired.” Janis Ian’s At Seventeen is an indelible portrait of life from the perspective of a socially awkward unattractive teen, inspired by a newspaper article that the singer-songwriter read about a young woman who thought her life would be perfect. “I learned the truth at 18,” the girl told the journalist. Ian changed her age and spent three months working on the intimate and confessional lyrics. “You couldn’t write a song like that without having gone through it,” Ian says, video-calling from her home in New Jersey. Now 70, her hair is short and white, no longer the dark curls she sported on her album covers during the 60s and 70s. “The first time I sang At Seventeen in public I did it with my eyes closed. I felt like I was naked and I was sure the audience was going to be laughing.” She couldn’t have been more wrong: At Seventeen won a Grammy in 1976, where Ella Fitzgerald led the ovation describing her as “the best young singer in America”. Ian, who sang “to those of us who knew the pain of valentines that never came”, received 461 Valentine’s Day cards the following year.
Ian, who has just released her first album in 15 years – and also her last – has been singing to those outsiders for close to 60 years. Born in New Jersey to leftist parents who were on an FBI watch list, she wrote her first song aged 12, was signed to a recording contract at 13, recorded her first album aged 14 and scored her first hit, Society’s Child, aged 15. The song was about an interracial relationship, inspired by a couple she had seen holding hands on a bus, even as the other occupants moved away from them. Society’s Child was considered so controversial that 22 record labels turned it down. It was released twice but only became a hit when it was publicly championed on television by Leonard Bernstein. Society’s Child gave Ian her first taste of success. But it came with a price. “The song held up a mirror,” she says. “And when you hold up a mirror, people don’t like what they see.” A radio station in Atlanta was burned down for playing the record and journalists were fired for publishing the lyrics in newspapers. “I was dealing with threats all the time,” says Ian. “I wasn’t able to go in the street without somebody spitting on me. I wasn’t able to have anyone open my mail without worrying there would be a bomb in it.” In the face of such extreme reactions – people bought tickets to see her perform in order to scream racist abuse as she sang – Ian’s response was simply not to respond. “I did what every adolescent does when faced with an untenable situation,” she says. “I ignored it.” It seemed, at first, as though the strategy had worked.
The success of Society’s Child, and her debut album of the same name, propelled Ian into a world where her social circle included Nina Simone, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. “I was 16 and would go club-hopping with Jimi,” she says. “In one night you could go see Nina Simone at the Village Gate and then go to the Gaslight to see someone else.” Nine years older, Hendrix was nevertheless a responsible accomplice. “I really wanted to try cocaine, but Jimi was way against it because he was horribly addicted to it.” One night Ian and Hendrix went to see BB King in the Village and he stopped the performance to announce that Martin Luther King had died. It’s an extraordinary anecdote: did she recognise it was extraordinary at the time? “You don’t know you’re hanging out with people who will be legendary,” she says. She recalls one night at a party with Janis Joplin when a heroin dealer was handing out free shots. Before Joplin accepted hers she turned to Ian and said, “Kid, time for you to go home.” Ian was invited by Leonard Cohen and James Brown to work as backing singer on their records. During the session with James Brown he stopped her while she was singing. “He said ‘If I wanted you to sound like a [N-word], I would have hired a [N-word]. Now do it again, but this time sound white’,” Ian recalls. She was feted by her heroes – Odetta and Joan Baez became friends and Salvador Dalí offered to paint her portrait for an album cover – but the starry company only told half the story.
Ian’s later teen years were also defined by self-harm – cutting her arms with razor blades and eating so little that her weight plummeted – which she now says was connected with the pressures of fame and the extreme reactions that Society’s Child provoked. “When you don’t know what else to do, you harm yourself,” she says. “Sooner or later the dark side always gets you.” After releasing five albums in four years, Ian took a three-year break from music in the early 70s. By 1975, her album Between the Lines – which featured At Seventeen – brought her a second burst of success. Soon she was hanging out in the Bottom Line club in New York with Mick Jagger, Charles Mingus and Stevie Wonder, performing on the first ever episode of Saturday Night Live, and going on tour with an up-and-coming comedian named Steve Martin as her opening act. She was also drinking buddies with James Baldwin and Nina Simone – one of the songs on her new album is about her friendship with the singer whose mastery inspired her: “She led the band, wrote the songs, played the instrument, sang, did the arrangements: there was nobody else.” At Seventeen was the last time Ian would have a hit song in the US. Although she continued to have success around the world – Fly Too High, produced by Giorgio Moroder, reached No 1 in several countries – she ultimately walked away from music for more than a decade. Her life outside music was troubled. Ian had known she was attracted to women since her childhood but throughout her teens and 20s had relationships with men. She had married a Portuguese film-maker in 1978, who was violent and threatened with her a gun, she wrote in her 2008 memoir. They divorced in 1983 but the hard times kept coming: she endured serious illness – fatigue syndrome – and lost her life savings due to an unscrupulous business manager. “I couldn’t perform. They [the IRS] took the money every time I did,” she says. “I couldn’t record because nobody was interested. I was terrified I would not have any food, rent or heat. Those were very hard years. Very hard.” Ian re-emerged in 1992 with Breaking Silence, which chronicled her recent coming out. The Village Voice had outed her in 1976. Although the wider media didn’t run with the story, Ian still faced consequences. “When I got outed I lost the ability to play any place that served liquor,” she says. (Venues requiring a liquor license had a “morals clause” and could terminate a contract over actions undertaken in an artist’s private life.) “If the news outlets had picked up on it, it would have been a career killer.” She met Pat Snyder, now her wife, after she moved to Nashville to work as a songwriter. She credits the city with rescuing her, producing a run of six albums. “When I moved to Nashville I became a much better writer,” she says. “I wouldn’t wish the IRS on anyone but the one thing I learned is you can’t take away what I do – nobody can take that.”
The Light at the End of the Line is Ian’s first album of new material since 2006’s Folk Is the New Black. “I didn’t want to make an album for the sake of making an album,” she explains of her break from releasing records. “I wanted to make an album because the songs should be heard.” The new album bookends her career – “to me it’s full circle” – but while Ian says she will continue to tour and write songs she is certain she is finished with releasing albums. “I’m done. I don’t want to be in the music industry,” she says. “It was bad enough when it was a business, but now that it’s an industry? I’m really done with that part of it.” Ian’s final record opens with the song I’m Still Standing, which starts with the line: “See these lines on my face / They’re a map of where I’ve been / And the deeper they are traced the deeper life has settled in.” Now 70, how does she feel about the young woman she was at 17? “The advantage of being that age is you’re coming at everything when it’s brand new,” she says. “It’s easy to lose. I love that part of me. I love that kid.” The Light at the End of the Line is out now on Rude Girl Records. This article was amended on 25 January 2022 to correct the lyrics to At Seventeen. It is “clear-skinned smiles”, not “clear-eyed smiles” as previously stated.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/janis-ian-jimi-hendrix;entertainment and culture

Everybody hates him, he cries from the stage tonight, in a show that takes stock of his life as a partisan political comic who has brown skin. Its case study is a 2019 charity gig (think “millionaires in ballrooms”) where Kumar, anti-Brexit gags blazing, had a bread roll thrown at him before being booed off stage. The incident, much embellished in the press, triggered death threats, which in turn prompted a reckoning for Kumar with his brittle mental health. This may sound like a more sobering show than you’d expect from Kumar. But it isn’t. It’s more personal, perhaps – he’s seldom before spoken about his mental fragility, not least because (as he says here) he was totally in denial about it. But the keynote is still uproarious and self-mocking, as the 36-year-old holds himself up for relentless ridicule: as the comic self-sabotaging in front of his “pre-gout” audience; as the messianic ego fantasising his own tragic assassination; and as the shmuck trying to impress people by pretending to have read Tess of the d’Urbervilles. Save for Kumar’s opening 10 minutes, which leathers the government for its “incompetence, corruption and ideology”, and takes particular aim at the myth of Rishi Sunak’s competence, we’re not in a world of Mash Report-style topical satire. Instead, the show unspools its tale of the gig-gone-wrong and its aftermath by way of “a silly window on to something more serious” – specifically, how non-white people, public figures included, are now being screened for their supposed anti-Britishness. The set has its less effective moments. A routine about the inanity of national anthems is over-illustrated with a surfeit of caterwauling examples. Too many jokes, no matter their subject, reach for knob-gag punchlines. Maybe that stems from an anxiety that his serious concerns might capsize the comedy – which is unwarranted, but understandable. Certainly, Kumar’s chilling argument about our slide towards nativism, and the insights he affords into life on the receiving end of death threats, will linger even after the considerable laughter subsides. • Your Power, Your Control is touring until 17 May.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/25/nish-kumar-your-power-your-control-review-this-time-its-personal;entertainment and culture
1365;1365;1365;1365;1381;1381;Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers ponder futures after rough playoff exits;2022-01-25;['N/A'];['NFL', 'Tom Brady', 'Tampa Bay Buccaneers', 'US sports', 'Sport', 'Green Bay Packers', 'Aaron Rodgers'];"Tom Brady says his family will play a crucial factor in deciding whether he returns to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season. The 44-year-old has an impending decision whether he will retire or return for a 23rd overall and third season with Tampa Bay, whose bid to repeat as Super Bowl champs ended with a 30-27 loss to Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs on Sunday. Brady has one year remaining on his contract and has said in the past he’d like to play until he’s at least 45. “I think as I’ve gotten older, I think the best part is, is football is extremely important in my life, and it means a lot to me, and I care a lot about what we’re trying to accomplish as a team and I care a lot about my teammates,” Brady said on his Let’s Go! podcast with Jim Gray. “The biggest difference now that I’m older is I have kids now, too, you know, and I care about them a lot as well. They’ve been my biggest supporters. My wife is my biggest supporter. It pains her to see me get hit out there. And she deserves what she needs from me as a husband, and my kids deserve what they need from me as a dad.” Tampa head coach Bruce Arians said on Monday that no date has been set for Brady to make his decision, and the quarterback himself said he was in no rush to decide his future.
“Every year I just have to make sure that I have the ability to commit to what the team really needs, and that’s really important to me,” Brady said. “The team doesn’t deserve anything less than my best. And if I feel like I’m not committed to that, or I can’t play at a championship level, then you gotta give someone else a chance to play. And, you know, we’ll see. There’s a long time between now and the start of next football season.” Brady is aware of one important point as he takes time to ponder his future: the Buccaneers roster next season is likely to look a lot different with or without the seven-time Super Bowl winner. Unlike last spring when the Bucs defied the odds by retaining every starter from a star-laden lineup that won the franchise’s second NFL championship, general manager Jason Licht and coach Bruce Arians are not in a position to replicate that. Nearly half the roster is eligible for free agency, including wide receiver Chris Godwin; tights ends Rob Gronkowski and OJ Howard; running backs Leonard Fournette, Ronald Jones and Giovani Bernard; linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul; cornerback Carlton Davis; safety Jordan Whitehead; defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh; offensive linemen Ryan Jenson and Alex Cappa; and defensive lineman William Gholston. Arians said the goal as usual is to “reload” rather than rebuild, with an emphasis on re-signing as many of their own free agents as possible. “We’ll see how many we can get back and then build the team from there. ... Each year is so different and so new,” the coach said. “Last year, to get everybody back was amazing. Doubt we can do it all again this year, but we’re sure going to give it our best.” Meanwhile, an offseason of unknowns has begun at the home of another star quarterback. The Green Bay Packers are unsure of future hall of famer Aaron Rodgers will remain with the team next season, seek another team or retire. As opposed to the controversial offseason of a year ago when a disgruntled Rodgers and his only professional team seemed destined for a split, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur made it very clear on Monday that the team want their 17-year veteran to return for 2022. “Every conversation that I’ve been involved in with Gutey [general manager Brian Gutekunst] and Russ [director of football operations Russ Ball] and Mark [president Mark Murphy], we’re all on the same page there,” LaFleur said on Monday. “There’s no debate.” Speaking to the media on the heels of Green Bay’s 13-10 upset loss Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers, LaFleur said he met with his quarterback on Monday and while a decision was far off, there was no question the Packers organization hopes for a return. “I sat down and talked to Aaron today for quite some time,” LaFleur said. “I think we’re all a little numb to the situation right now and, so, I would say that what we talked about, I’m definitely gonna keep between him and myself, but we’re hopeful that he’ll be back next year, obviously.” The 38-year-old Rodgers did not disappoint this season, tossing up elite numbers (4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdown passes, four interceptions) for what may turn out to be the fourth MVP season of his career. But he admitted after an unspectacular performance on Saturday against the Niners (20-for-29, 225 yards) that while he will not drag out a decision about his future past the start of free agency on 16 March, he also doesn’t plan to stick around if the team decides to start from scratch. “I don’t want to be part of a rebuild if I’m going to keep playing,” Rodgers said of the Packers. The Packers are projected to be $44.8m over the 2022 salary cap. Wide receiver Davante Adams has said publicly he wants to be the NFL’s highest-paid wide receiver and said last year there will be no hometown discount to stay in Green Bay. To keep Rodgers, the Packers would need to sign him to a long-term extension. His cap charge in 2022 is $46m, negotiated intentionally by Rodgers last offseason when his disdain for the front office came to light. The mood has since shifted. If it’s up to his head coach, there is no decision from the Green Bay standpoint as LaFleur said he wants the Packers to do “everything in our power to try to get him back here and making sure he’s comfortable with the direction of our football team.” “There’s no plan for a rebuild,” said LaFleur. “You get this close, obviously win a lot of football games, and we know in order for there not to be that, he’s gotta be a part of this thing. I don’t think that’s anybody’s intention.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/tom-brady-aaron-rodgers-future-retirement-packers-buccaneers-nfl-football;sports
1366;1366;1366;1366;1382;1382;What is going on at Derby and will club survive? Key questions answered;2022-01-25;['Ben Fisher'];['Derby County', 'Championship', 'Football League', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Why are Derby in such financial trouble? Had Derby beaten Aston Villa in the 2019 Championship play-off final, the outlook would surely be different. Mel Morris, a local businessman, bet the ranch and lost in his attempt to return Derby to the Premier League for the first time since 2008. They have spent 125 days in administration and are in a race against time to secure a preferred bidder who can fund the club until the end of the season and complete a takeover. The English Football League’s findings over the former chairman’s valuations of players led to a total 21-point deduction this season. “I’m most unhappy with Mel Morris – he is why we’re in this situation,” the manager, Wayne Rooney, said on Friday. How likely are they to finish the season? Derby do not have cash to cover bills beyond the January payroll and the EFL has asked them to provide proof of funds to fulfil their remaining fixtures by next Tuesday or risk expulsion. The cost of running the club is about £1.5m a month. The ideal solution is for the administrator, Quantuma, to identify a preferred bidder and move to complete a takeover, but it could also secure additional lending or – and this is seen as the last resort – sell players. Rooney has been reassured that no player will leave without his say-so. The captain, Tom Lawrence, and academy graduates Festy Ebosele and Louie Sibley are attracting firm interest. Derby are unable to make signings or offer contract extensions, which led to Phil Jagielka joining Stoke when his deal expired. The 18-year-old scholar Dylan Williams was sold to Chelsea for what is understood to be a six-figure fee. Derby were unable to offer a professional contract.
Are they going to find a buyer? The administrator remains confident of an agreement, with at least three parties still at the table. Last week the Binnie family, founders of the investment firm Carlisle Capital, submitted a bid worth about £28m, which they believe to be the asking price, and that could trigger the former Derby chairman Andrew Appleby or former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley into bidding. Crucially, the club are thought to have had positive conversations with the preferential creditor, HMRC, over an agreement to pay significantly less than the £29.3m they owe. The Binnies are understood to accept any liabilities relating to lawsuits the club face from Middlesbrough and Wycombe, both of whom believe Derby knowingly skirted EFL rules to gain an advantage at their expense, but the bid does not cover Derby’s Pride Park stadium, which is owned by Morris, or training ground, which is leased from the Locko Estate. Under EFL rules, any buyer must pay football creditors – such as Arsenal, whom Derby owe for Krystian Bielik – 100% of what they are owed and unsecured creditors – such as small businesses – at least 25% of what they are owed, or the club would face a 15-point penalty next season. What are the administrators saying? Some fans are concerned at what they perceive to be slow progress but this may be the most complex football administration ever. “We are working tirelessly to achieve a successful outcome and still believe this is possible,” Quantuma said last week. “We understand the frustrations of the supporters.” What is going on with Middlesbrough and Wycombe? The clubs’ claims for compensation have proved a major obstacle, leading to a blame game. Middlesbrough started their claim more than 12 months ago and Wycombe last year after relegation to League One. It is unclear whether the clubs would be deemed football creditors if they succeed in their claims, which Derby consider spurious. Boro, whose owner, Steve Gibson, has branded Derby cheats, are seeking about £45m after being pipped to a Championship play-off place by Derby in 2019, and Wycombe at least £6m because Derby stayed up by a point at their expense after breaking league rules. Last week the Wycombe owner, Rob Couhig, told BBC Radio Derby his club were wrongly painted as “the bad guys”, saying Derby were guilty of “getting their hand caught in the cookie jar”. He added: “We are willing to meet and talk with people and make a reasonable commercial compromise.”
What is the EFL saying? On Monday the EFL said a meeting between league officials, local MPs and councillors was postponed “to allow additional progress to be made by the administrators”. It alluded to “positive developments” last weekend and expects to hold talks with Quantuma on Tuesday to seek clarity regarding a preferred bidder. Last week the league said it “has no vendetta against” the club and wants “to work proactively with the administrators and relevant stakeholders to find a process which will give clarity quickly”.
How has Rooney given them a chance of staying up? Rooney has shown his players a league table minus the points deduction, which has Derby mid-table, to motivate his squad and he has given his number to the supporters’ trust to strengthen the bond with fans. Supporter groups have appealed to fans to buy tickets for Sunday’s home game against Birmingham, expected to attract their biggest crowd of the season, and they discussed selling “virtual tickets” at a meeting with the administrator. The trust has highlighted the human impact on fans, some of who have raised mental health concerns, with many sharing their #MyDerbyStory on social media.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/derby-county-what-is-going-on-and-will-club-survive-key-questions-answered;sports

The CBI warned that higher manufactured goods prices were inevitable after its monthly healthcheck of industry showed labour shortages at their most acute in almost half a century. The survey of 236 firms found orders picking up over the three months to January, but output growth was limited by bottlenecks. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said: “Global supply-chain challenges are continuing to impact UK firms, with our survey showing intense and escalating cost and price pressures.” According to the CBI’s industrial trends survey: Average costs growth accelerated at the fastest pace since April 1980. Average domestic price growth in the quarter to January was similar to October, which was the highest figure since April 1980 and is anticipated to accelerate over the next three months. Average export prices in the quarter to January grew at their quickest pace since April 1980 and price growth is again expected to pick up over the coming quarter. The share of firms citing skilled labour as a factor likely to limit output next quarter rose to its highest since October 1973. The annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index hit its highest level in almost 30 years in December, and is set to climb further from 5.4% to at least 6% over the coming months. Newton-Smith said government action was needed to ease cost pressures from spiralling energy bills and to encourage investment. “It’s good to see firms looking to invest more in training and retraining as labour shortages continue to bite. And planned increases in spending on plant and machinery is a welcome sign of much-needed strengthening in business investment. Further fiscal measures to get more firms investing will be needed to set the UK on a long-term path to sustainable growth. “Meanwhile, against the backdrop of rising energy prices, which are adding to inflationary pressures, short-term action is needed from the UK government to find urgent solutions for firms that are struggling.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/uk-factory-costs-rising-at-fastest-pace-since-1980-cbi-says;business and economy

Joe Biden has said there was “total” unity among western powers after crisis talks with European leaders on how to deter Russia from an attack against Ukraine, as 8,500 US troops are put on high alert. “I had a very, very, very good meeting – total unanimity with all the European leaders,” the president told reporters shortly after a one hour and 20-minute video conference on Monday with allied leaders from Europe and Nato. In London, Boris Johnson’s office also said “the leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility”. The UK prime minister had warned of “unprecedented sanctions” against Moscow should an invasion take place amid growing tensions over Ukraine. Who else was on the call? The leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the EU also took part in the crisis talks. UN data reveals ‘nearly insurmountable’ scale of lost schooling due to Covid
The scale of the number of children who have lost out on their schooling during the pandemic is “nearly insurmountable”, according to UN data. Up to 70% of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries cannot read or understand a simple text, up from 53% pre-Covid, the research suggests. Classroom closures continue to affect more than 635 million children globally, with younger and more marginalised children facing the greatest loss in learning after almost two years of Covid, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef, which called for intensive support to help students recover. Across the world, children have lost basic literacy and numeracy skills and their mental and physical health has suffered. In South Africa, schoolchildren are between 75% and a whole school year behind where they should be. What has the impact been like in the US? Learning losses have been seen in the US, including in California, Colorado, Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Maryland. Can you give an example of this? Yes. In Texas, two-thirds of children in grade 3 (age eight to nine) tested below their grade level in math in 2021, compared with half of children in 2019. Too young to retire but at risk for Covid, older Americans struggle to find work
The unemployment rate has tumbled dramatically since the height of the pandemic but older workers are still struggling to find work despite all the reports of worker shortages. About 5.7 million workers ages 55 or older lost their jobs in the US in March and April 2020, 15% of workers in an age demographic that has also experienced the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths. The unemployment rate for workers aged 65 and older hit a record rate of 7.5% in 2020. A June 2021 analysis by economists at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School found at least 1.7 million more older workers than expected retired due to the pandemic. The analysis encouraged policy solutions such as expanding Medicare eligibility to the age of 50, expanding social security benefits, and creating a department dedicated to older workers at the US Department of Labor. Monique Morrissey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, explained there are differences among affected older workers. She said: “Job losses are concentrated among non-college-educated workers in lower-paid jobs and are disproportionately also jobs that have high contact with the public.” In other news …
Taylor Swift has criticised Damon Albarn, the lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, on Twitter after the British musician told the LA Times she “doesn’t write her own songs”. Swift said she wrote all of her songs and his “hot take is completely false and SO damaging”. Albarn later apologised. Marilyn Manson has denied raping the actor Evan Rachel Wood on the set of the music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).

The stress, anxiety and isolation of the Covid-19 crisis, combined with widespread contamination in the illicit drug market from the synthetic opioid fentanyl, has worsened the overdose epidemic in the US. More than 100,000 Americans died of an accidental overdose in the year ending April 2021, a sharp increase compared with the previous year. The country’s first two sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) opened in New York on 30 November and are already saving lives. … or this: how the US stitched up the Honduras garment industry
By scouring the world for cheap labour, US clothing brands are not merely opportunistic, they are also sometimes actively parasitic. Honduras is a case study: one in which US corporations and the US state department have worked together for decades to bring cheap garments to American consumers, framing job creation as a blessing for the Honduran economy while simultaneously engaging in political interventions that keep citizens poor. Climate check: how plastic pellets ravaged a Sri Lankan paradise
The sinking of the X-Press Pearl cargo ship off Sri Lanka’s west coast last May caused wave upon wave of nurdles, the tiny pellets that are the raw material of the plastics industry, to wash ashore. Millions – or even billions – of them have turned the country’s golden beaches black. A UN report called the incident in May 2021 the “single largest plastic spill” in history, with about 1,680 tonnes of nurdles released into the ocean. Most of them were partly burnt and contaminated with chemicals and debris from the ship spill, posing even more of a threat to marine life – and the local community.

Cameron suspended the whip from Dorries when she appeared on I’m a Celebrity in 2012, after failing to disclose her absence to film the show. The whip was later returned to her in 2013. The tweet spawned a number of imitators, including one who posted a photo of a bookmakers with the image of Cameron in his casual outdoor outfit waiting outside, appearing to naturally fit into the scene.
Another said he looked like he was in the market for some livestock, while one person said he resembled an extra from The Full Monty.
Dorries was not the only person with the same idea. A tweet posted several hours before her used the same image and captioned it: “Big Dave, buying and selling tickets outside Royal Ascot.”
This is not the first time that Dorries has sought to exact revenge for her treatment by Cameron. Speaking to BBC Two’s Daily Politics in 2012, Dorries said: “Unfortunately, I think that not only are Cameron and [chancellor George] Osborne two posh boys who don’t know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime.” • This article was amended shortly after publication on 25 January 2022 to indicate that comments attributed to a “Sir Michael Take” came from the “spoof” Twitter account of a fictional former MP.

1393;1393;1393;1393;1409;1409;The Breakdown | Elusive back-to-back grand slams remain rugby union’s holy grail;2022-01-25;['Robert Kitson'];['Rugby union', 'Six Nations', 'Six Nations 2022', 'England rugby union team', 'Sport'];"Whenever the Six Nations looms out of the wintry murk it is important to give a respectful nod to the gladiators of yesteryear. On Sunday, as it happens, one of the unsung heroes of English rugby celebrated his 80th birthday in deepest Dorset, a suitable milestone for a man who coached his country to a grand slam in 1980, their first championship clean sweep since 1957. Mike Davis has been battling Parkinson’s of late but can still occasionally be found practising a few wedge shots on the playing fields adjoining his home in Sherborne. Even in his coaching days – he also won 16 caps as an England lock – it was never about him, whether he was teaching clumsy kids like us the rudiments of basketball or tutoring the country’s best rugby players. Only the snug purple tracksuit bearing a red rose offered a clue to his ‘other’ sporting life.
That all-conquering 1980 side, captained by Bill Beaumont, was deservedly feted – not least for allowing England to escape with some dignity from the 1970s when, at one point, they collected three wooden spoons in a row. Once again, though, the curtain was to fall with a dull thud. By the start of the 1990s, the 1980 triumph under Davis’s unselfish guidance was still only the second grand slam England had managed since 1928. Which is why, 30 years on, it feels equally appropriate to remember the other great England side of the late 20th century who completed back-to-back grand slams in 1991 and 1992. In between they managed to lose a World Cup final but, in some respects, that adds a further dimension to their achievement. To place it into context, only one other men’s side in the past 98 years – France (1997 and 1998) – have captured the northern hemisphere holy grail twice in succession.
The double grand slam remains a remarkable feat – even the greatest Welsh sides of the seventies never managed it. Not only did England re-enter the winners’ circle in 1992, they did so convincingly. Under Will Carling and Geoff Cooke, they established a record for most tries in the Five Nations (15) and conceded four, having kicked things off by beating Scotland 25-7 at Murrayfield in their opening match. Three decades later – and with Scotland awaiting England on Saturday week – it is that game, rather than the explosive fixture at the Parc des Princes (of which more later) that Simon Halliday chooses as his most satisfying. Part of it was down to his own display – “I had one of those games when everything seemed to go my way” – and partly it was the psychological baggage finally jettisoned. “In 1986 we were thumped by 30 points at Murrayfield, 1988 was a kicking match on and off the field, then there was the grand slam that never was for us in 1990. I had real history with that venue.” Ireland were subsequently thumped 38-9 – Halliday recalls it as “one of the best Twickenham performances I can remember being part of” – and a fortnight later England set out for Paris. On paper they had every physical base covered – a pack consisting of Dean Richards, Peter Winterbottom, Mick Skinner, Wade Dooley, Martin Bayfield, Jeff Probyn, Brian Moore and Jason Leonard was always going to be forthright. Outside the half-back pairing of Dewi Morris and Rob Andrew also lurked more top operators with loads of big-match experience: Carling, Jeremy Guscott, Rory Underwood, the in-form Jonathan Webb and Halliday on the right wing.
As Richards has subsequently recalled in the splendid, recently re-published paperback edition of Behind the Rose, staying cool and gently riling the French was a big part of the plan. “The policy was that if they hit you, you smiled and then gave them a wink to wind them up even more.” Moore had already irritated his hosts by publicly predicting “a boxing match” before kick-off. Sure enough, it all kicked off in earnest in the second half when two of France’s front-row, Grégoire Lascubé and Vincent Moscato, were sent off for stamping and a head-butt, respectively. The home crowd went similarly wild, causing the referee, Stephen Hilditch, to be given a police escort off the field at the end. Halliday was as grateful as anyone to the Irish official following an incident five minutes after Moscato’s departure. “I slightly involuntarily body-checked their left winger and that entire side of the Parc des Princes tried to get me sent off. I remember saying to Hilditch: ‘I haven’t head-butted anyone, I haven’t stamped on anyone’s head, you can’t send me off for that.’” Once the dust had finally settled, though, England had scored four tries in Paris for the first time since the war and won 31-13. The final act, by comparison, was relatively comfortable. Wales were beaten 24-0 at Twickenham, with Carling scoring a try in the opening minute, after which Halliday reverted to his day job as a stockbroker. Carling has since said that his England side “were at the height of their powers” and history would appear to bear him out. Will anyone repeat the feat in this increasingly chien-eat-dog professional era? Maybe one day but England, says Halliday, would currently be better off focusing on more immediate priorities. “This English team are going to have to play out of their socks to beat Scotland. Don’t listen to the people who say ‘It’s just another day at the office’. Scotland have a team that shouldn’t fear anyone.” As Davis, Halliday and every other old warrior can testify, the warm glow of past victories does not indefinitely protect against the chill blast of modern-day reality. • This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email, The Breakdown.

1399;1399;1399;1399;1415;1415;Tennis star and Paralympian Dylan Alcott named Australian of the Year for 2022;2022-01-25;['Stephanie Convery'];['Honours system', 'Australia Day', 'Tennis', 'Australian Open 2022', 'Sport', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news', 'Dylan Alcott'];"Dylan Alcott – the tennis champion, Paralympian and disability advocate – has been named the 2022 Australian of the Year. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, made the announcement at an event in Canberra on Tuesday night after Alcott qualified for the Australian Open final where he’ll try to win his eighth title. It is the first time in the annual awards program’s 62-year history that a person with a visible disability has been named Australian of the Year, according to the award administrators. The Victorian, 31, has won 15 grand slam quad singles titles and another eight in doubles. In 2021 he became the first man in history to achieve a golden slam: all four major singles titles as well as gold at the Paralympics.
A wheelchair user, Alcott has been open about his experiences of bullying and discrimination regarding his disability, particularly in his youth. He was born with a tumour wrapped around his spinal cord, which was successfully removed when he was three weeks old but left him a paraplegic. In 2017, he founded disability and accessibility training start-up, Get Skilled Access. He is also the founder of the Dylan Alcott Foundation, which provides scholarships and grant funding to Australians with a disability. Alongside his sporting achievements, Alcott has a storied media career, having written an autobiography, Able; hosted a show on youth broadcaster Triple J; and appeared in numerous commentator and presenter roles across television, radio and podcasting. In 2009, at the age of 18, Alcott was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia. “Standing ovations are one of the most ironic things in the world, by the way, but I’ll take them, without a doubt,” Alcott said when accepting his award on Tuesday night. In a moving speech, Alcott described how he had known nothing but life with a disability, which racked him with self-loathing until he began to see people like himself in the broader community and learned from the those closest to him “that I was worthy and that I was allowed to be loved”.

He urged non-disabled people to “challenge your unconscious biases, your negative perceptions and lift your expectation of what you think people with disability can do”. Cracking jokes – he said “I also stand on the shoulders of giants, not literally, still can’t stand” – Alcott paid tribute to the disability activists who came before him including Kurt Fearnley and Stella Young. “It’s because of them and everybody in my life that I sit here as a proud man with a disability tonight. I love my disability. It is the best thing that ever happened to me.”
Over the next 12 months, Alcott said he would focus on full NDIS funding and the prioritisation of people with a disability for rapid antigen testing and vaccination, as well as employment opportunities for disabled people. “As we start opening up from this pandemic, which is awesome, we’ve got to think about and prioritise people with disability,” he said. “We’ve got to get them the vaccines and the tests and whatever else they need so they can get out there and start living their life.” Alcott announced last year that he plans to retire from tennis after this year’s Australian Open. The awards for Senior Australian of the Year, Young Australian of the Year, and Australia’s Local Hero were also announced on Tuesday night. The St John Ambulance volunteer Valmai Dempsey, 71, from Canberra, was named Senior Australian of the Year. She has volunteered with St John Ambulance for more than 50 years, including during the black summer bushfires. Young Australian of the Year was awarded to Daniel Nour, 26, from New South Wales, a doctor who founded Street Side Medics, a not-for-profit delivering a free mobile medical service to people experiencing homelessness.
Shanna Whan, 47, from Narrabri in NSW, was named Australia’s Local Hero. Whan is the founder and chief executive of Sober in the Country, a charity that offers peer support for those who are giving up alcohol, as well as education and advocacy around the harms of alcohol, particularly for rural communities. The chair of the National Australia Day Council, Danielle Roche, said Alcott was an “inspirational Australian on and off the tennis court” whose foundation was giving young disadvantaged Australians “the promise of a better future”. “Dylan Alcott is a champion who has risen to the top of the world rankings through sheer grit and determination. His golden slam is an incredible feat, the first for any male tennis player,” Roche said.
Alcott takes the Australian of the Year baton from Grace Tame – a sexual assault survivor, activist, and critic of the Australian government, particularly its handling of the rape allegation made by the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins which is now the subject of criminal proceedings. A meeting between Tame and the prime minister at the Lodge for Australian of the Year celebrations on Tuesday went viral after pictures were captured of Tame looking unimpressed. Alcott also paid tribute to Tame on Tuesday night, saying she’d had “an absolutely incredible year”. “Tame, you are fierce and I love it,” Alcott said. “And you have done so much for your cause and if I could be one-eighth of the Australian of the Year that you were, I think I’ve done my job.” Alcott, who attended the ceremony in Canberra on Tuesday night, will return to Melbourne immediately to continue with his last ever pro tennis match – the Australian Open quad wheelchair singles final on Thursday.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/tennis-star-and-paralympian-dylan-alcott-named-australian-of-the-year-for-2022;sports
1404;1404;1404;1404;1420;1420;Cake and singing on PM’s birthday was not a party, says Grant Shapps;2022-01-25;['Jessica Elgot', 'Jamie Grierson'];['Boris Johnson', 'Grant Shapps', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Gray report'];"Boris Johnson’s gathering with birthday cake in the cabinet room was not a party, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said, denying the prime minister had organised the event. “The prime minister clearly didn’t organise to be given a cake,” Shapps told Sky News after the latest revelations about lockdown breaches in Downing Street. “Some people came forward and thought it would be appropriate for on his birthday.” But he suggested it was “unwise” for the prime minister have been given a cake at the gathering of staff. He told BBC Radio 4 Today that he shares “the sense of unease about all of this”. Asked if, at the time, he would have advised someone at a Downing Street press conference that the gathering as described would be allowed, Shapps said: “I think it’s clearly unwise to do those things…. This is in a workplace with a bunch of people who were working together all of the time, who decide to give the prime minister a birthday cake on his birthday. Unwise, I’m sure, given the circumstances as we know them.” Shapps confirmed that the event on 19 June 2020 would be considered by the official inquiry into the breaches by Sue Gray, saying she was “already aware of this particular incident, so she will be using that in her report and we’ll wait to see what she says”.
He said the gathering revealed by ITV News, which was attended by the prime minister’s wife, Carrie, and interior designer, Lulu Lyttle, was with staff the prime minister had been “working with all day long, and will have been many a time in the same room with them working on the response to coronavirus … They come in, give him a cake, I understand I think it lasted for 10 minutes and that was it.” It came as the former prime minister Gordon Brown said Johnson’s apparent lockdown breaches were a “moral issue”, which resonated because people had not been able to spend time or say goodbye to people they love. “I could not go to the funeral of a very close relative last year at the same time,” he told Good Morning Britain. “I couldn’t visit a dying friend in hospital, and there are thousands and thousands of families who were in that position. “Therefore, this is not a political issue. This is a moral issue about whether the standards you ask people to follow are standards you are prepared to follow yourself.” Shapps said he still had confidence in Johnson, who is facing renewed anger from Tory colleagues and a possible vote of no confidence. He said the prime minister had “achieved remarkable things” but added “no one is perfect”. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, tweeted in support of Johnson on Monday night, saying: “So, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for 10 minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party?” The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the behaviour of staff in Downing Street stood in contrast to how others had spent their birthdays. “Why should the Queen forgo her birthday party?” Lammy told the Today programme. The human rights lawyer Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid regulations, said on Twitter he “can’t see how it could have been lawful” if the reporting was accurate. “It’s obviously not within the rules and nobody from the government at the time would have said for a moment it was,” he said.
Wagner told Sky News: “There are two questions you should ask, two thought experiments, first one is if the police had come across a gathering like this, with cake and food on the tables, and obviously social and arranged before in a particular room in a workplace but no one doing any work – what would they have done? I think the answer is they would have given everyone fixed-penalty notices. “And the other question to ask is if you had asked the PM or Matt Hancock or any of the officials that stood up at those regular briefings, we want to have a birthday gathering, a party, really, let’s call it what it is, in a work room, we’re going to pre-arrange it, we’re going to have cake and food, we’re going to stay there for half an hour, there will be 30 people indoors, at the time they would have said ‘absolutely not, that’s not within the rules’. And they would have been right”.
Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the PM had no “moral authority” to lead the UK. Asked about the latest party allegations, he said: “I have reacted with a combination of despair and disgust really.” Drakeford said the singing had particularly resonated with him. “Amongst the hardest letters I had to read in the whole pandemic were from people telling me they had to attend a funeral where only eight people were able to be there, where it didn’t last 10 minutes, where you weren’t able to sing,” he said. “In Wales, a funeral without being able to sing is a really difficult experience. And yet those people stuck to the rules. It was hard but they did it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/cake-and-singing-boris-johnson-birthday-not-a-party-say-grant-shapps;politics
1412;1412;1412;1412;1428;1428;Keith Earls: ‘Hank started to take over. I got to a stage where I hated rugby’;2022-01-25;['Donald McRae'];['Ireland rugby union team', 'Munster', 'Rugby union', 'Bipolar disorder', 'Sport'];"“Hank has popped up every now and then,” Keith Earls says with a wry smile when I ask if he is still haunted by the dark side of his character. Earls has won 96 caps for Ireland but his fiercest battle as a rugby player has been with bipolar disorder. The 34-year-old, who has played 186 games for Munster since his debut in 2007, calls his destructive alter-ego “Hank”. It echoes the way in which, in Me, Myself & Irene, Jim Carrey played the part of a state trooper who, after a mental breakdown, developed a different personality called Hank. “But I have a lot more good days than bad days,” Earls says at home in Limerick. “A couple of years ago I probably had one good day a month. Bipolar could affect me for weeks but now it’s one or two bad days every few months. But sometimes I get confident and say: ‘Look, I’m better. It’s all OK now.’ I fall into bad habits and all of a sudden your man Hank is back again.
“This season I opened a coffee roaster business in Limerick and I don’t like too much going on in my head. It can create havoc. So, setting that up, I found it tough. Now it’s important because the coffee business helps me relax and I know there’s something for me after rugby. But Hank pops up whenever my mind is cluttered or I’m knocked out of my routine.” Earls is open and brave and he admits that “Hank the bastard is still lurking around, always looking to become a lodger in my head again.” That arresting line comes from his compelling autobiography which paints a vivid picture of all the obstacles Earls has overcome. He grew up in Limerick’s close-knit but sometimes dangerous neighbourhood of Moyross. As a working-class man it has taken him years to adjust to rugby’s privileged world. He felt embarrassed by his ignorance of the shallow niceties of etiquette and by a deeper struggle to read and write. Hank preyed on those insecurities as he turned Earls into a deeply negative, depressed and angry person with no self-esteem. Earls had played only twice for Ireland when Ian McGeechan chose him for the Lions tour of South Africa in 2009. McGeechan was smitten by the then 21-year-old’s skill and pace. But no one understood how psychologically unprepared he was for the Lions. He played five games, and scored two tries, but his performances were so error-strewn it took years to rebuild his shattered confidence. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years later, but did he sense the presence of Hank in South Africa? “Hank was always there but he really came out after that tour. Rugby was my thing to get away from life. But after the Lions, particularly that first game [where he was traumatised by self-doubt], Hank started to take over. I got to a stage where I hated rugby. The one thing I enjoyed now made me feel like shit. That Lions tour is the best and worst thing that ever happened to me.”
Earls still managed to perform for Munster and Ireland but his mental health plummeted. In 2013, feeling desperate, he finally looked for help. “I spoke with the doctor in the Irish camp because my first daughter, Ella May, was born with a rare heart condition. I went down a deep rabbit hole. My head was gone and I had anxiety about everything. “The doctor sent me to a [psychiatrist] in Cork who said: ‘I think you are bipolar so keep an eye on your emotions and come back in a few weeks.’ But I was so fed up I told him I wasn’t leaving his office until he fixed me – or gave me a pill because I was so sick and tired and exhausted. He decided to start me on tablets. I was delighted with the diagnosis and to know it was more common than I had thought.” Earls was still ravaged by worry and class-driven uncertainty. When he first attended post-match banquets with Ireland he had no idea which cutlery to use. He also remembers being mortified when he misheard his teammates requesting horseradish at their five-star hotel. There were howls of laughter when Earls asked for some of that “horse hummus”. In his 30s, and with over 70 caps to his name, he still felt like a misfit. In 2020 Earls opened up to Andy Farrell, Ireland’s coach who had grown up in working-class Wigan playing rugby league. “We were on a camp in Portugal and Andy had one-on-ones with all of us. He asked what I was going to do after rugby. I said: ‘I don’t know. I obviously like the coffee business but I’m embarrassed. I can’t read that well, I can’t spell, I can’t write well.’ He was brilliant. He knows a lot of people, even himself, who aren’t good spellers. He said learn from predictive text and get into good habits. “A couple of weeks later we were in a Six Nations camp. We do things to have a craic and break up meetings so Simon Easterby decided we’d have a spelling competition, backs against forwards. Get three backs up, three forwards up. I was sitting at the front thinking: ‘Oh God, don’t pick me.’ It went to a tie-break and I was called up. In the rugby world you can’t get away with not doing anything. But I said: ‘I’m not getting up.’ It was getting awkward and then Andy just stood up and said: ‘Earlsy doesn’t do spelling competitions.’ He picked someone else and defused the whole situation.
“Simon apologised a few days later. I was like: ‘No. I should have just said I can’t spell.’ I’m not embarrassed now and I’m thinking about getting tested. I think I struggle with dyslexia.” Earls and I had swapped texts before the interview and his spelling had been perfect. Dyslexia has nothing to do with intelligence. “Exactly,” he says. “I keep working on it but it’s tough when your 10-year-old daughter is asking you to spell stuff for homework and I can’t do it. But I’ll keep working on it and, as you said, there are different forms of intelligence. Some of the least educated people can do lots of things and then you have the most intelligent people who don’t get on so well in real life. You need to be comfortable with yourself and not be frightened to ask for help.” He recently won Ireland’s Sports Book of the Year, and, while much is down to the skill of his ghostwriter, Tommy Conlan, Earls’s vision and emotion shaped his autobiography. “I had sleepless nights before the book came out. I exposed a lot but I’m quite a private person. Even though the book has been a success I still sometimes think: ‘Jeez, we shouldn’t tell anyone about this.’ But the response has been unbelievable. It’s reached men, women, kids of all ages in different countries. I’m proud of that.” Earls was concerned most about the reaction of people in Moyross. “It’s been phenomenal,” he says. “My parents are still on that side of the city and so many people have said to them they’re proud of me and Moyross. I wanted to tell the truth that it was a dangerous place and some turn to crime and drugs. But 95% of people there are of fine integrity and have great families.” He and his wife, Edel, have been together for 21 years, since they were 13-year-old schoolkids. “One of the Moyross lads who I used to hang around set myself and Edel up. When you’re young and shy it’s hard to ask a girl for a date so he did that for me and that’s where it all started for me and Edel. When we had Ella May in 2012 we walked out of a restaurant in Limerick and this same lad was sitting outside [begging]. He had gone down one route and I went down another. He’d experimented with heroin and had a rough time. It showed how close the two roads are.”
Earls and his wife talked to their old friend and gave him some money. He says now: “Thankfully, I saw him a few weeks ago and he was strolling along with a kid in a buggy. He looked fresh and so much better. I know he does relapse sometimes as heroin is highly addictive. But he looks in a good position now.” The Munster wing also feels in a good position after he solved a worrying physical problem which meant that, from 2017 to 2020, his lungs operated at only 50% of their usual capacity. “I’d be training, playing matches and going into spasm. I couldn’t breathe. Sometimes, after a 10-second workout, I’d be knackered. It nearly drove me to retirement. In the [2020] Autumn Nations Cup against Wales, I was on the bench but, warming up, I said: ‘For fuck’s sake, I can’t breathe.’ “We played England the following week and Andy picked me to start. I was like: ‘There’s no way I can play.’ But Phil Glasgow, the physio, knew some respiratory specialists in London. We landed in London, got straight into a taxi and went to a hospital to get special MRIs and see a breathing specialist. They came to the conclusion my liver was floating up into my chest cavity and pressing on my diaphragm which was sending everything into spasm. He came up with a simple solution of trying to tape my liver down. I went out two days later and played 80 minutes for the first time in 10 weeks and felt amazing. I haven’t looked back.” Does he tape up his torso before every game? “Yes. It’s like wearing a corset, everything held in place.” This season has been difficult as Covid and postponements mean that Earls has played less than usual. But he started three of Munster’s four European games and only missed Sunday’s victory over Wasps following a late withdrawal owing to a strain. Munster are now in the last 16 of the European Champions Cup and last week he was included in Ireland’s Six Nations squad. Has he allowed himself to imagine winning his 100th cap?
“Yes. It would be great. I’m happy with 96, it’s a big number, but everyone’s saying: ‘You have to get to a hundred.’ If I am fit and well I don’t doubt that 100 caps would come. But if it doesn’t, so be it.” That philosophical approach has calmed Earls. It has taken him many years but, with the help of “behavioural therapy”, writing a journal and talking openly, Earls keeps Hank at bay. He smiles as, in the room next door, his three daughters kick up a happy racket. Hank won’t like it – but Earls looks at peace. “I definitely am getting there. I spent a lot of years not being myself because I was embarrassed. I always thought other people were better than me and I’d try and be like them. But I’ve finally become comfortable with who I am. I understand what I stand for as a person and a rugby player. I definitely have the right balance in my life now.” Fight or Flight by Keith Earls is published by Reach";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/keith-earls-hank-started-to-take-over-i-hated-rugby-union-bipolar-disorder;sports
1414;1414;1414;1414;1430;1430;My husband used to cheat on me and now he wants a threesome;2022-01-25;['Pamela Stephenson Connolly'];['Life and style', 'Sex', 'Relationships'];At the beginning of our relationship my husband was not faithful. He had secret affairs and flirtations that I was suspicious about, but if I brought it up, I was called crazy and accused of sabotaging our relationship. It wasn’t until our first child was born, after four years of marriage, that he felt extreme guilt and remained faithful. Shortly after baby number two was born three years later, he told me that he was polyamorous and has a crush at work. There are times when he emotionally pulls away and this is when I think he desires more than just me. When I told him I was ready to break up, he claimed he would do anything not to lose me. We started dating again but, after two weeks, he asked me to consider having a threesome. I feel I have reached a point where I am ready to settle down and that is why I married him. But it appears to me that he does not feel the same way. I cannot understand why – if he loves me like he says he does – I am not enough? Some people find monogamy impossible. They are just wired that way. In fact, monogamy is difficult for most people. I understand that trust is very important to you, yet right from the beginning you knew your husband was rarely just with you. You have stayed with him and had children, and there is clearly deep love between you so I am wondering why have you now reached a point where his non-monogamous lifestyle is insufferable? In reality, he is not going to change. Your choices are to separate, or stay with him and make the most of what is good between you – despite the torture. You would do well to consider what it is about you that binds you to this constant state of disappointment and longing. After you understand that, you may make the healthier choice.

Is everything it’s offering being done by others anyway so we might as well not bother?’ Colleagues at Sky News think about it all the time. It’s existential.” When Rupert Murdoch sold the wider Sky business to the US media conglomerate Comcast in 2018, the new owners promised to fund the prestigious but lossmaking news service for a decade. Boulton, who left the channel last month after serving as editor-at-large, said Comcast had honoured the deal but the channel’s long-term future was unclear: “People are wondering what’s going to happen when the guaranteed funding under the takeover deal expires … the problem with the takeover arrangement was it put Sky News in aspic with the same funding and the same management.” Boulton, 62, is one of a number of big-name television news presenters who left their jobs at the end of last year, along with the likes of Andrew Marr and Jon Snow. He said there was less appetite for an authoritative “grey haired man that told you the news” and that it was time for baby boomers to hand over to a younger and more diverse set of presenters. However, having spent more than a quarter of a century as Sky News’ political editor, he defended the idea of authoritative “gatekeepers” in the media who can explain and contextualise events in real time. He said: “This is where my disagreement with [Sky News boss] John Ryley is sharpest. I think there is a general questioning of the whole notion of authority … There’s a feeling, which I think is John’s position, which is ‘put stuff out digitally and leave the public to decide what they want’. “John’s answer to that would be if you put the information out there with lots of digital analysis you’re still doing the job. My argument is that you’re not doing it in real time. I think it’s beneficial for society that’s there’s analysis and invigilation – not just post-fact but while things are happening.” An estimated 8 million Britons a month watch Sky News but most only watch briefly, meaning typical viewing figures during the daytime are nearer 100,000 people. It has also built up a substantial audience online. Asked about concerns from some Sky News employees that the channel’s coverage of the climate crisis is tipping over into campaigning, he said it was “basically benevolent” but did raise issues. “We had our chief executive appearing on a platform at Cop26, which we were sponsoring at a corporate level with Boris Johnson and [Joe] Biden and [Narendra] Modi. That made me think, really, how free are we to comment and analyse what they’re saying?” Boulton said he remained a believer in TV news but that the format needed to change, with audiences for traditional news bulletins continuing to fall. He said: “Sky is a fantastic company and should have a very good future. I wouldn’t say anything negative about it but all of us just have to look at changing markets. “This is not a static industry and nothing is for ever. You’ve got to recognise that these are the inevitable changes thrown up by technology.”;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/adam-boulton-sky-news-faces-existential-crisis-as-tv-habits-change;business and economy
1435;1435;1435;1435;1451;1451;‘Man of integrity’: NSW elevates official who had public falling out with Barnaby Joyce;2022-01-25;['Peter Hannam'];['New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Barnaby Joyce', 'New South Wales politics'];"A senior commonwealth official who was sacked by Barnaby Joyce in 2015 has been promoted to become the second most powerful bureaucrat in New South Wales. Paul Grimes is the new state treasury secretary, continuing the revival of his public service career that included stints as a deputy secretary under then federal treasurer Peter Costello and as a senior adviser to Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd during the global financial crisis. Grimes, however, later had a public falling out in 2015 when Joyce was agriculture minister. Joyce sacked Grimes, his agriculture secretary, saying at the time that there was “no realistic prospect” he could have a “relationship of strong mutual confidence”. Joyce had insisted a correction to the Hansard parliamentary record of an incorrect answer he gave regarding drought support loans had been made by his staff, without his knowledge, and that he had asked for the changes to be reversed when he became aware they had been made. Grimes, though, implied there was a different version of events, even requesting an extraordinary Senate committee hearing. After his exit from Canberra, Grimes took up senior positions, including with the Victorian government. Almost two years ago, he was handpicked by Matt Kean, then NSW energy and environment minister, to coordinate his department.
Now the NSW treasurer, Kean announced on Tuesday that Grimes would be the new treasury secretary – starting on Saturday – and praised his attributes as an older style official unafraid to give frank advice. “What a man of integrity he is,” Kean told Guardian Australia. “What a coup this is for NSW.” Grimes, an economist, will succeed two bankers in the top Treasury role, his appointment coming just as the government puts the final touches on a support package to aid the state’s economic recovery from Omicron. NSW accounts for about one-third of the national economy and a recent CBA State of the States report has its performance lagging all but the ACT’s. Kean said Grimes had worked to develop the state’s energy roadmap aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment. The plan aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy and provide lower-cost electricity to households and businesses alike. The new treasury secretary will oversee the next state budget, due by mid-year, which will be the last before elections in March 2023, Kean said. So far, there is little sign of additional economic support from the commonwealth. Grimes’s appointment follows an earlier-than-expected exit by current treasury secretary Mike Pratt, who had indicated he planned to leave by March. Pratt’s tenure had lately been clouded by a dispute between Treasury and the audit office, with the auditor general, Margaret Crawford, initially refusing to sign off on the state’s accounts over the controversial assessment of rail assets. That dispute ended earlier this month although the cost in terms of future accounting changes may tally as much as $4.1bn. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who was treasurer when the rail assets saga began, praised Pratt for his almost decade-long service, including four and a half years as treasury secretary. Pratt played “a vital and leading role in guiding the economy through the greatest economic challenge that NSW has faced since the Great Depression – the Covid-19 pandemic – saving tens of thousands of jobs and businesses,” the premier said. “Mr Pratt’s sound fiscal management and expert advice allowed the NSW government to help people when they needed it most during drought, bushfires, floods and the pandemic, as well ensuring the state will continue to deliver for future generations.” Barnaby Joyce, now deputy prime minister, was approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/man-of-integrity-nsw-elevates-official-who-had-public-falling-out-with-barnaby-joyce;politics
1436;1436;1436;1436;1452;1452;West End’s small shows squeezed out in price-cutting dash for audiences;2022-01-25;['Ben Quinn'];['West End', 'Theatre', 'London', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'UK news', 'Arts funding'];"Critically acclaimed smaller West End shows are being squeezed out of theatre’s post-Omicron recovery as major players use discounted tickets to attract returning audiences. The award-winning theatre producer David Pugh told the Guardian that he feared it could spell the end of plays in the West End. His latest show, the highly rated Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort of), will close next month despite original hopes that it would have an open-ended run. Pugh said his 112 investors had all lost their money, with the production facing expected losses in the region of £750,000 – as much as £25,000 a week. The losses meant a decision was made to end the run in February, he said. “It’s why I’m not sleeping at night,” he said, adding that the rug had suddenly been pulled from underneath what he described as a carefully calibrated economic plan designed to ensure the play was accessible to as many people as possible. By contrast with his show, where tickets have a top price of £59, major West End shows have cut prices to as little as £10 amid competition for members of the public cautiously returning to theatre, and the continuing absence of tourists. Written by Isobel McArthur, who also co-directs and performs in the musical take on the Jane Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice (Sort of) has been playing at London’s Criterion theatre since last year after an initial production in Scotland and a tour. The Guardian’s chief theatre critic, Arifa Akbar, wrote in a review in November: “However inconceivable a production it sounds, with its karaoke numbers and its silliness, it creates something new and joyous from the old.” Pugh, who has won two Tony awards in the US and four Olivier awards in the UK, said it had been a priority to keep ticket prices low when he brought the production to the West End as he believed that theatregoing was too often elitist, with costs prohibitive for many people. “We also didn’t know who had money any more as a result of the pandemic and where the audience would come from, so we deliberately avoided booking fees and went for a simple price structure people could see, which was a top price of £59.50 that went down to £9.50. By contrast, other shows set their prices at what I think were ridiculous highs,” he said. Pugh said he and others behind similar-sized productions simply “couldn’t win” against larger ones that had bigger marketing campaigns, larger capacities and, in some cases, wealthy backers that included hedge funds. Productions of all sizes are only now emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which caused high absence rates among casts and backstage staff. Many theatres have said they will continue to ask audiences to wear masks. Even after almost two years of uncertainty, theatres across the UK are still in the most precarious of positions. The producer Kenny Wax, whose hits include the musical Six and the Goes Wrong series of comedies, told the Guardian last month that there was much greater audience confidence on Broadway where “everyone wears masks in the theatres”.
Sir Nicholas Hytner, the artistic director of the Bridge theatre in London, said it was time to examine support such as short-term finance, loans and reviews of VAT and business rates. This week Pugh said he was highly concerned about the commercial viability of plays in London’s West End in the future. While he had been grateful to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport for providing basic funding at the height of the pandemic that had enabled him and others to cover administrative costs, the threat facing his end of the sector was now acute, he said. “I am not sure that our current culture minister is really aware of how theatre helps other businesses’ going. I’m thinking of all the restaurants, cafes, taxis and shops in the West End who need the footfall from theatregoers,” said Pugh. “It would be nice if it was recognised that commercial theatre is integral to the West End. I think our culture minister thinks we rely on our investors, but they can only take so many losses. There’s a fear they may think twice before investing in the theatre in future.” Cheap seats?

1437;1437;1437;1437;1453;1453;Middle-class Britons more likely to be biased about Islam, finds survey;2022-01-25;['Jessica Murray'];['Islam', 'Religion', 'UK news', 'The far right', 'Conservatives', 'Politics'];"The middle and upper classes are more likely to hold prejudiced views about Islam than working-class groups, according to a survey from the University of Birmingham. In one of the most detailed surveys conducted on Islamophobia and other forms of racism in modern Britain, data showed 23.2% of people from upper and lower middle-class social groups harbour prejudiced views about Islamic beliefs compared with 18.4% of people questioned from working-class groups. The survey, carried out in conjunction with YouGov, found the British public is almost three times more likely to hold prejudiced views of Islam than they are of other religions, with 21.1% of British people wrongly believing Islam teaches its followers that the Qur’an must be read “totally literally”. “It’s the people from an upper and middle class background, who presumably are university educated, who feel more confident in their judgments but [are] also more likely to make an incorrect judgment,” said Dr Stephen Jones, the report’s lead author. “It’s almost like because they’re more educated, they’re also more miseducated, because that’s the way Islam is presented in our society.”
The findings, presented in a report entitled The Dinner Table Prejudice: Islamophobia in Contemporary Britain, were based on interviews with a sample of 1,667 people between 20 and 21 July 2021. The survey found more than one in four people, and nearly half of Conservative and Leave voters, hold conspiratorial views about Sharia “no-go areas”, while Muslims are the UK’s second “least liked” group, after Gypsy and Irish Travellers, with 25.9% of the British public feeling negatively towards Muslims. The survey also found 18.1% of people support prohibiting all Muslim migration to the UK, a rate 4-6% higher than the same view for other ethnic and religious groups.
The report suggested a lack of public censure for Islamophobia, citing the example of Conservative MP Nadine Dorries supportively tweeting remarks made by anti-Islam activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (also known as Tommy Robinson), was one reason why prejudice was so widespread. “There’s a lack of criticism that follows Islamophobia, and that seems to correspond to the way in which Islamophobia is dealt with in public life,” said Jones. “The survey shows quite clearly it’s a very widespread prejudice. But it’s just not given the same kind of seriousness as other forms of prejudice. “People who work in public office, whether MPs or councillors, who have got away with saying things about Muslims that they simply would not get away with if they were talking about other kinds of minority. That’s not to say those other issues don’t need to be taken seriously as well, it’s simply to say that this particular form of prejudice doesn’t get due recognition.” Researchers recommended the government and other public figures should publicly acknowledge the lack of criticism of Islamophobia, and how it stands out compared with other forms of racism and prejudice. The report also suggested civil society organisations and equality bodies should recognise how systemic miseducation about Islam is common in British society and is a key element of Islamophobia. Jones said: “No one is calling for laws regulating criticism of religion, but we have to recognise that the British public has been systematically miseducated about Islamic tradition and take steps to remedy this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/middle-class-britons-more-likely-to-be-biased-about-islam-finds-survey;politics

Somewhere in the scrub, a parcel of linnets is unfolding. Earlier in the afternoon they rose from the alders, perhaps a couple of hundred birds, and danced as one over the sedges. Now, the little finches are settling down to roost, filling the bushes with their non-stop twittering. Unseen, but definitely not unheard. I sludge through the boggy top meadow to the mud by the stream. Up ahead, the flame-licked willow tops resound with the noisy tidings of magpies. Most afternoons they congregate here in a pre-roost assembly, up to 30 birds jostling and trading places before diving into the safety of the wet scrub for the night.
A sudden eruption from one of the shallow pools catches my attention. A wisp of snipe rises up. I can just make out four birds zigzagging away, melting into meadow. A few seconds later, they vanish back into the rushes. These are the first snipe I’ve seen here since last February, and their brief emergence is a burst of winter joy. Whistling wings overhead. Looking up, I realise I’m under the flight path of several mallards. They come in dribs and drabs: three, five, then a couple of pairs, flying in haphazard formation, quacking loud and low. Wheeling round in the failing light, each squadron ducks under the overhanging willows and splashes down in the disused watercress beds. No longer airborne, the raucous sord (from the Middle English sorde meaning to soar up in flight) transforms into a silent paddling of mallards. I ford the stream and slip out of the meadow through the kissing gate, full of the sights and sounds of birds gathering in parcels, tidings, wisps and paddlings. I almost expect to see crowds in the pub, busloads of commuters returning from work. But the main road is muted. Pedestrians edge past each other, trying to maintain a polite distance. Four masked passengers sit in the corners of the 98 bus.

In another major blow Jonny May has pulled out of the squad with a knee injury. Jones was expected to name a new captain on Monday and, while England have confirmed that Farrell will miss their opening match against Scotland at the very least – meaning a recall for George Ford – a replacement skipper will not be named until next week. Lawes was the heavy favourite, having stood in successfully during the autumn, but he is now unable to take part in key preparations at England’s training camp in Brighton this week as he undergoes the head injury return-to-play protocols. It is understood Tom Curry will fulfil media duties at the Six Nations launch this week in his role as one of the side’s vice-captains. With Farrell due to discover this week if he will feature at any stage of the tournament, Jones has summoned Ford while Elliot Daly comes into the squad for May and Nick Isiekwe is added to the group in Brighton as injury cover for Lawes, who faces a race against time to prove his fitness for the Scotland match.
May will also miss England’s trip to Murrayfield, and potentially the following match against Italy, with England said to be planning for life without him for the early stages of the tournament. His absence is a setback for Jones given the Gloucester wing has started every England match – barring the two developmental matches against the USA and Canada last summer – since the 2019 World Cup. May’s withdrawal means a recall for Daly, who missed the autumn campaign through injury and was left out of the squad last week. Ford, meanwhile, comes in for Farrell having been dropped last autumn. He has been in exceptional form for Leicester this season but was again omitted from the initial Six Nations squad, only for Farrell’s ankle injury setback to hand him a reprieve. Jones has been impressed by Isiekwe’s form for Saracens this season and he also earns a call-up, having won the last of his three caps in the summer of 2018.
Lawes was left out of the Northampton team to face Racing 92 over the weekend – a fixture that was subsequently cancelled – but Saints were confident that he would be fine for England’s Six Nations campaign. Nonetheless, his inability to train this week is a problem for Jones given Farrell is absent, and it could develop into a crisis for the head coach if Lawes suffers a setback when progressing through the protocols.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/injuries-to-courtney-lawes-and-jonny-may-hit-england-six-nations-plans;sports
1496;1496;1496;1496;1515;1515;Florida: Republican panel advances bill to ban LGBTQ+ discussion in schools;2022-01-24;['Maya Yang'];['Florida', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'World news', 'US news'];A Republican-led committee in the Florida state house has advanced a bill that would ban all discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, a move advocates say will “erase” LGTBQ+ students and history. The Florida house education and employment committee passed the Parental Rights in Education bill, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, last week. The bill requires the implementation of “procedures to reinforce fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing and control of their children”. In addition to allowing parents to launch legal actions against school boards if they believe policies overstep that “fundamental right”, the bill bans teachers from discussing in classrooms LGBTQ+ topics “not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”. “This bill is about defending the most awesome responsibility a person can have: being a parent,” said the state representative Joe Harding, a Republican who introduced the bill. “That job can only be given to you by above.” In response, Jon Harris Maurer, public policy director for Equality Florida, said: “We’re parents, students and teachers. We are your brothers and sisters. Conversations about us aren’t something dangerous that should be banned. “[This bill] is only talking about sexual orientation and gender identity and it’s stigmatizing because of that. Sexual orientation and gender identity is about who we love and who we are.” Chasten Buttigieg, a n LGBTQ+ advocate who is married to the US secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, condemned Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, tweeting: “This will kill kids … You are purposefully making your state a harder place for LGBTQ+ kids to survive in.” Buttigieg cited data from the Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth. According to a national survey, 42% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide last year. Moreover, 94% of LGBTQ+ youth reported that recent politics negatively impacted their mental health. The study also found that LGBTQ+ youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their sexual orientation and gender identity reported lower rates of attempted suicide. In a separate report, the Trevor Project found that LGBTQ+ youth who learned about LGBTQ+ issues or people in classrooms had 23% lower odds of reporting a suicide attempt in the last 12 months. The Trevor Project has condemned the Florida bill, which in a statement last week it said “would effectively erase LGBTQ+ students and history”. Sam Ames, director of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, said: “This bill will erase young LGBTQ+ students across Florida, forcing many back into the closet by policing their identity and silencing important discussions about the issues they face.”;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/florida-republican-committee-dont-say-gay-bill;politics
1498;1498;1498;1498;1517;1517;UK financial watchdog staff edge closer to strike over pay cuts;2022-01-24;['Kalyeena Makortoff'];['Financial Conduct Authority', 'Business', 'Regulators', 'Unite', 'Trade unions', 'UK news', 'Industrial action'];"Staff at the UK’s financial watchdog are edging closer to a strike over pay cuts that unions say will turn the Financial Conduct Authority into a “bargain-basement” regulator. Members of Unite will vote in a ballot over whether to take industrial action against the FCA, after management allegedly refused to negotiate with the workforce on a “programme of severe cost-cutting”. Workers are said to be unhappy about a transformation plan ushered in by the FCA’s new chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, that involves abolishing bonuses widely considered to be part of basic pay, as well as “unfair” changes to the staff appraisal system, plans to cut staff pension rights and lower pay for non-London staff. Unite – which is not formally recognised by the FCA as its staff union – said the plans had already resulted in a plunge in morale and an exodus of experienced staff that could exacerbate problems at the FCA. “Management at the FCA are attempting to implement a programme of pay cuts, which has come after two years in which the staff at the FCA have worked gruelling hours to provide financial protection against Covid for borrowers, investors, small businesses and people with mortgages,” the Unite national officer Dominic Hook said. “Unite has made it clear that if introduced, these cuts will make it even less likely that the FCA will be able to deliver this high standard of public service in the future.”
The watchdog was already under fire for a number of scandals even before Brexit, which has given more powers and responsibilities to UK regulators. A damning report in 2020 slammed the FCA for failing to properly supervise the mini-bond provider London Capital & Finance before its collapse, which wiped out the savings of 11,600 investors. The FCA was also found to have failed in its regulation of the Connaught Income Fund in 2012, and has faced criticism for failing to intervene before Neil Woodford’s £3.1bn Woodford Equity Income Fund collapsed in 2019. “You cannot regulate the British financial system on a bargain-basement basis as the chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, clearly wishes to do,” Hook said. “Management must enter into immediate negotiations with Unite the Union in order to avoid further damage and risk to the FCA.”
Current pay plans will result in the scrapping of bonuses, which Unite says are widely considered part of basic pay, and will result in about 10-12% pay cuts for the majority of its 4,200 staff. However, new pay bands, which include different pay ranges for those based outside London, mean that 800 support and “associate grade” staff, the lowest two tiers, will receive a £3,800 pay rise. The FCA has also offered to increase base salaries by at least 5% for staff below management level who meet performance criteria from April 2022, upping a previous offer for a 2% pay rise. An FCA spokesperson said: “Our pay and reward proposals would ensure the FCA continues to provide one of the best employment packages of any regulator or enforcement agency in the UK. “Our proposals focus on those paid the least, with 800 colleagues below manager-level in line for salary increases of, on average, £3,800. “We are now carefully considering the feedback received during our extensive consultation with colleagues, with the aim of announcing the outcome by March.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/uk-financial-watchdog-staff-edge-closer-to-strike-over-pay-cuts;business and economy
1510;1510;1510;1510;1529;1529;How vulnerable is UK energy system as tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine?;2022-01-24;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Energy industry', 'Business', 'Gas', 'UK news', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'France', 'Energy bills', 'Money'];"The deepening tensions between Russia, Europe’s biggest gas supplier, and Ukraine have reignited fears that the Kremlin may weaponise its gas reserves by restricting exports to Europe in the face of potential sanctions. Russia is western Europe’s largest single supplier of gas, a commodity that is in tight supply globally and has reached record market price highs in recent weeks, threatening to tip the UK into a national energy crisis. Meanwhile, Europe may need to use even more gas to keep the lights on this winter after the French nuclear firm EDF warned that technical trouble at a string of its reactors would cut its electricity generation, meaning gas plants across Europe may need to run more than expected. Gas plants were already in high demand over the past year after slow wind speeds reduced Europe’s renewable energy output in 2021. This played a role in draining Europe’s gas storage facilities to record lows after a long, cold winter last year. Ministers have reportedly been warned that the UK could face further record-breaking prices for gas and at the petrol pumps. So, could Europe’s energy crisis become a catastrophe? How vulnerable are the UK’s gas supplies? The good news is that the UK imports barely any gas from Russia. It meets about half of its gas requirements from the North Sea, while another third is sourced from Norway. The rest is imported by pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. The bad news? The UK’s gas sources could all becoming eye-wateringly expensive if markets in Europe soar. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands would lead to higher prices in Britain.
There is no end in sight to Europe’s gas market woes. The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday: “The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off.” Gas prices are likely to stay twice as high as normal until 2025, it said, and if Europe faces colder than average temperatures in March and February, blackouts could be likely. How vulnerable are Europe’s gas supplies? Very. Russia typically supplies about a third of Europe’s gas via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK.
A major gas supply disruption to Ukraine, last seen in 2008, could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of factories to help conserve gas. Market experts at S&P Global warned that “any conflict impacting gas supplies into Europe could have knock-on impacts on power, carbon and coal prices”. At the same time, Europe may become more dependent on gas to run its gas power plants after EDF warned that it would reduce the electricity it generates from nuclear power by 10% this year because of technical problems at a handful of its reactors. In the UK, lower imports of electricity from France – supplied via two interconnector cables beneath the Channel – could mean more gas power generation, according to Tom Edwards, a senior analyst at Cornwall Insight. This could lead to a rise in prices across the gas and electricity markets. In the meantime, the French government has asked EDF to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill increases to 4% this year. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but it has raised questions over how EDF plans to finance new nuclear projects, including the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C projects in the UK. Does the UK government have a contingency plan? It appears not. If the government is concerned about the impact on UK energy supplies, it hasn’t admitted it. A government spokesperson did not respond directly to the Guardian’s questions over whether there was a contingency plan in place to secure the UK’s energy supplies, or protect against further record market prices as tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border intensify. The spokesperson said that unlike other countries in Europe, “the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas supply” and relied on less than 3% of Russian gas in 2020. “Thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world,” the spokesperson added.
The UK government is under pressure to take action to safeguard households from a cost of living crisis that is expected to deepen in the coming weeks as the energy regulator prepares to raise its cap on bills to close to an average of £2,000 a year on 7 February. The government was reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a “supplier of last resort”. How high could gas prices climb? The weekend tensions caused the price of short-term gas to climb to 205.1p per therm in the UK on Monday morning, up from 188.75p/th on Friday. The price is more than threefold higher than this time last year, and six times higher than typical pre-pandemic levels, according to Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS. The UK’s gas market price climbed to more than 450p/th in the run-up to Christmas as Russian gas supplies slumped in line with temperatures that drove demand for gas heating higher. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,” Marzec-Manser said. For now, there are a few lucky breaks that have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which has allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from the US this month, and it is on track to reach an all-time monthly LNG import high. However, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/how-vulnerable-is-uk-energy-system-as-tensions-rise-between-russia-and-ukraine;business and economy
1517;1517;1517;1517;1536;1536;Victoria Frank obituary;2022-01-24;['N/A'];['Communities', 'West Bromwich'];My mother, Victoria Frank, who has died aged 87, was part of the Windrush generation, settling in the West Midlands in the 1960s, and a community advocate committed to making a difference in society. She was determined to amplify the voices of others, whether that be assisting with rehabilitating ex-offenders, or influencing policy on resources for underrepresented groups. She was a key driver in the discussions that led to the creation of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre in 1985. The fifth child of eight, born in the parish of Longwood, in Clarendon, Jamaica, to Esmie (nee Mitchell) and David Reid, a supervisor at Moneymusk West Indies Sugar Cane Company, Victoria went to Alley school, then worked as a dressmaker before journeying to England in 1960. She settled in West Bromwich, where she had friends, and found work in a factory. By 1962 she had saved enough to send for her fiancé, Herman Frank, who later worked as a supervisor for a steel fabrication factory. They married the same year. In 1974 Victoria moved to the Smith Corona typewriter factory, then from 1986 worked as assistant to the nurse administering medical support at the Konix factory until 1991, when she left to set up a guest house for prison leavers with Herman. She cooked meals for the ex-offenders and assisted them with their rehabilitation and finding employment. In 1996 she began working for Sandwell council as an assistant manager in health and social care, until retirement in 2001. As a founding member of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre, Victoria served as treasurer, then vice chair for many years, and finally a short spell as chair before retirement. Her responsibilities included staff recruitment, funding negotiations and entertainment, and she initiated the creation of the Senior Citizens Luncheon Club, which is still operating. She was key to the centre winning a Pace (Public Award for Community Excellence) in 2004. Victoria was multi-talented, designing and sewing garments to create unique outfits, and making delicious rum cake and Caribbean food. She fought her entire life for more, and to be more. Hers was an inspirational life, leaving a true legacy in all she achieved for others. Herman died in 2010. Victoria is survived by their daughters, Eula, Rose, Bev and me, and three granddaughters, Louise, Samara and Merissa.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/24/victoria-frank-obituary;health

A quick “Kanter” through without racking one’s brain could produce Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Wollstonecraft, Hegel, Diderot, Paine et al. Rees-Mogg’s entire demeanour puts me in mind of a rather more 19th-century precursor – Klemens von Metternich.

European markets tumbled by 3.8% to their lowest levels since October, their biggest one-day fall in more than 18 months, after Nato said it was reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces as a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared increasingly likely. Volatility soared, as investors also feared the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates several times this year, starting in March, after US inflation hit a 40-year high of 7% in December. In the City of London, the FTSE 100 index fell 2.6% to a one-month low, its biggest fall in two months, as Boris Johnson warned that a “lightning war” in Ukraine was possible but not inevitable. The blue-chip index lost 197 points, falling to 7,297. The educational publisher Pearson led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 9%, with the Russian steelmaker Evraz dropping 8%. Miners, energy producers, travel firms and housebuilders also slid. In Frankfurt, the Dax index of leading German companies lost 3.8%, while France’s Cac shed 4%.
The New York stock market saw wild swings. Heavy selling pushed the S&P 500 index down over 3% at one stage, more than 10% below its record high, before a late rally pushed the major US indices higher at the end of the day. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as the US dollar, and also the Swiss franc, which hit a six-year high against the euro. The sell-off in risk assets hit cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low of about $33,000 (£24,500), less than half its all-time high of $69,000 reached last November. The Fed, which will meet this week, could also start to run down its balance sheet this year, removing some of the stimulus introduced since the Covid pandemic began. “Traders continue to be in selling mode as fears mount surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation,” said David Madden, a market analyst at Equiti Capital. “Also playing into the mix are the concerns the Federal Reserve will issue a hawkish update on Wednesday.” The prospect of tighter monetary policy has driven technology stocks lower, with the Nasdaq Composite index dropping into correction territory earlier this month.. “The double-whammy of risk events is proving too much for Wall Street to handle, with the Nasdaq once again leading the charge lower as the tech rout deepens,” said Fiona Cincotta, a senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “Meanwhile, embassy staff are being pulled out of Kyiv amid growing fears that Russia could send troops into Ukraine imminently. Talks last week between the US and Russia failed to pave the way to a solution. Fears of war are driving the risk-off trade with bonds rising.”
There was heavy selling on Moscow’s stock market, with the Moex index of Russian companies tumbling almost 6% to its lowest level since December 2020, taking its losses in 2022 to almost 15%. The rouble hit a one-year low, dropping 2.5% to more than 79 roubles to the US dollar. The Bank of Russia said it was halting purchases of foreign currency in an attempt to ease pressure on the rouble, which has slumped amid tensions over Ukraine. The UK’s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies tumbled by 3.6%, hitting its lowest level since March 2021. The cybersecurity firm Darktrace was down 14.6%, the newspaper publisher Reach fell 11%, while the cinema chain Cineworld and the luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped 8.7%. Gas prices soared, with the wholesale day-ahead price of UK gas jumping 17%, on concerns that Russian supplies of energy to Europe could be disrupted. There were also signs that the Omicron variant had slowed the global recovery. Private sector growth in the UK and eurozone hit its lowest in 11 months, while US business activity grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in January, according to the latest surveys of purchasing managers.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/global-stock-markets-fears-ukraine-conflict-investors-european-us-london;business and economy
1564;1564;1564;1564;1583;1583;Atlético revel in ‘madness’ of wildest win yet – but will it be a turning point? | Sid Lowe;2022-01-24;['Sid Lowe'];['La Liga', 'Atlético Madrid', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"“It’s life itself.” On Friday afternoon Diego Simeone said Atlético Madrid hadn’t been through anything like this in the years he had been there. That’s how bad things had got. The very next day they went through something they hadn’t experienced in the 118 years anyone had been there. That’s how good it got, how much they had needed this. “Madness,” Ángel Correa called it. “Incredible,” José María Giménez offered. It was “unbelievably beautiful,” Matheus Cunha said. It was also a timely reminder of who they are. At least, they hoped so. “What did you feel?” Simeone was asked when it was over, everyone exhausted but alive again, the final whistle coming on 100.51 with Atlético having somehow beaten Valencia 3-2 at the Metropolitano, the club’s anthem belted out like an act of faith. “What did I feel? Pfff. That this place is wonderful where I am. And every time you see it getting away, ah, I want to reach out and grab it even tighter.” They certainly have to hold on to something, and maybe this was it. “There are nights that stay with you; this is one,” Simeone said.
This was “D Day: origin of evil”, AS had claimed on Saturday morning, and it had been set to be a disaster. Three days earlier the same paper declared Atlético had hit “rock bottom” but they hadn’t stopped yet. In a week they had been beaten by Athletic in the Super Cup and deservedly knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Real Sociedad. Beaten four times in December, they had collected four of 18 points and started the weekend 16 behind Real Madrid, their season over. Now, on a night of “barbaric cold,” in Giménez’s words, they were losing again. Atlético were 2-0 down to the team who had most exposed their vulnerability, coming back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 with two goals in added time in November, foreshadowing their fall. Three teams were lined up to take a Champions League place off them and two more could climb to within a point. But it wasn’t just that; it was that, by Simeone’s own admission, they had done “absolutely nothing” they wanted. When Yunus Musah scored the first, it was the 25th league goal Atlético had conceded – as many as in the whole of last season, no longer good at the things that defined them. It was nicely taken; it was also dreadfully defended, and still it wasn’t as bad the second, scored by Hugo Duro and assisted by half the Atlético team. “My heart hurt,” Simeone said. There was, he admitted, “desperation, anxiety, sadness about what was happening to us”, not least because it had happened before. At half time he told his players that they could lose, but not like this. Ultimately, they didn’t lose at all. Correa came on at the break, Cunha was introduced 12 minutes later for Lemar, and centre-back Felipe replaced João Félix. That decision drew whistles, but it worked. “In the second half I could see something I identify with,” Simeone said. Cunha scored the first after an hour but going into the last minute Atlético were still losing 2-1. They had never won a league game from that position. Now, they did. On 89.58, Correa made it 2-2, dashing into the net to get the ball back. On 92.13, Mario Hermoso made it 3-2. Between the equaliser and the winner, the ball had only been in play 46 seconds. Now suddenly, Luis Suárez was leaping on to Hermoso’s back, crashing to the ground, teammates chasing. From the touchline they came too, 11 men sprinting towards the south end. In the leading pack, Simeone was flat out. From the tunnel came Antoine Griezmann, injured and unavailable but moving fast, leaping into them and almost sending Simeone to the turf. As he headed back towards the bench, Simeone’s head lolled and his legs gave way, looking to the sky about to cry like a marathon runner approaching the line, nothing left. He paused, put his hands on his knees and spat, as if post-puke, a portrait of the pressure. There were eight more minutes to endure: when the final whistle went, for once Simeone didn’t sprint straight up the tunnel. Instead, Valencia’s players were first, one booting the wall, a miracle he didn’t break his foot. “This can’t happen; we have to defend tooth and nail,” Duro said. His teammates said worse things, if they said anything. Another sat on the stairs alone, silently waiting for an opponent’s shirt. By the time he arrived, he had given it away.
They all had. Simeone had embraced them all, leaping into Lemar, strangling Suárez, leading them towards the fans to throw their shirts into the stands. “Any other fans would have turned against us,” Simeone said. Can you explain what that felt like, Cunha was asked. “No,” he said and started laughing. “To be honest, no.” It is not the only thing that evades easy explanation; the whole season does, that Atlético again found themselves needing to come from behind, why their title defence ended so fast. The hope now is that this can be a turning point – a phrase just about everyone used afterwards. “I’m convinced,” Correa said. “We needed this.” Hermoso added: “It’s been difficult since the [last] Valencia game; what better day to turn it around?” “The first half is not us, the second is,” Simeone said, which was partly the point: too often that first half has been them. This is a recurring theme, a question of identity: who they are, what they want to be and how. Asked why this Atlético is not Atlético, there was something pointed in his response: “Maybe the coach doesn’t clearly individualise which players can transmit what we saw in the second half. [He has] to identify those who can do that.”
This season Yannick Carrasco – fabulous on Saturday – has started 18 of 21 games. Hermoso has too, in different roles. Koke, left out recently, has started 16. No one else is over 14. One of them, Marcos Llorente, has not had a defined role. Another, Suárez, has not scored since the Valencia game, often withdrawn early and increasingly often not starting. Stefan Savic has been injured and missed. So too Giménez. Griezmann needs accommodating. Correa somehow never quite feels like an automatic first choice. “When they score the second goal you start to think: ‘why is this happening to us?’” Correa admitted. So why is it? “I don’t know,” he replied. “I couldn’t explain it to you, but it’s a reality.” Sometimes the margins are fine: expected goals, for and against, suggest Atlético shouldn’t have dropped so many points. Even Jan Oblak has looked normal, not the saviour he was. But chance is an unsatisfactory explanation even when it does play a part, which it always does. Last year too, Atlético had been forced into rescuing results in an extraordinary run in, but they did win the league. And maybe that’s part of it too. Success shifts things, shaping expectation, mind-sets, group dynamics, altering or even eliminating the sense of resistance or rebellion, of collective cause. Signings do too. Administering abundance is not the same, creating different challenges. Who are they? The league champions, supposedly the best squad Atlético have ever had. “For a team like Atlético it’s not easy to be champions; it’s a club not used to being champions every year,” Simeone said. “They were champions after 25 years [actually 19, from 1977 to 1996]. We took it to 18 [between 1996 to 2014], then seven [from 2014 to last season]. You have to maintain that [trend] and it takes a lot to do that. You have to prove yourself daily; nothing you did before counts; what counts is what lies ahead. That has to be a lesson to teach for me and the players to the path now.”
“When you win the league, lots of teams relax because they say ‘well, it’s happened’,” Giménez said. “Four new players came and the team relaxes a bit. You think that if they score, no worries, you have players who can win it for you [still], and that was a bit what happened to us. Last season, games started and we would bite. This year, I see a slight relaxation in comparison. We were first to the challenges, the loose balls, we were aggressive in the areas, we defended games to the end. This year, that wasn’t happening. Why? Because we have a great team, but a great team is built on results too. “Today, it did: hopefully this can be the push we need to be better,” Giménez added, “but you have to believe it: you can’t say ‘done’, next week we win just with the shirt. This is a turning point we have to grab. In the end, what you need is a win. What you need is this. If you play like you always played, like Atlético Madrid, you can win any game.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/atletico-revel-in-madness-of-wildest-win-yet-but-will-it-be-a-turning-point;sports
1567;1567;1567;1567;1586;1586;Gainsborough’s Blue Boy: a cocksure kid who looks right through you – review;2022-01-24;['Jonathan Jones'];['Art', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Painting', 'National Gallery', 'Exhibitions'];"You must remember Thomas Gainsborough’s Blue Boy. It’s the painting that gets stolen from a rich man’s house in the 1929 Laurel and Hardy short Wrong Again. Trying to claim the reward, Stan and Ollie fetch a racehorse called Blue Boy instead and attempt to “leave it on the piano” as they were asked. If only the National Gallery screened this in their tiny exhibition to mark The Blue Boy’s return to Britain for the first time in a century, we might get a sense of what it once meant. In 1921 railway magnate Henry E Huntingdon bought this 1770 painting for a world record price, making it as famous in 1920s America as Banksy is now. Perhaps The Blue Boy even inspired pop art, for it injected glamour into jazz age Hollywood. But that was then. This glittering dazzle of blue and silver with a bonny face on top has come home far too late. Shown with two other Gainsboroughs and two portraits by his inspiration, Anthony van Dyck, it embodies a vision of English art that’s as hokey as a Disney cartoon of a fox hunt. It makes you wonder if as a nation, when it comes to art and the soul, we have something missing.
I thought I loved Gainsborough’s virtuoso brushwork, like a bravura bit of Mozart or Haydn in paint, pleasing itself in molten chromatic fripperies. But staring too long at The Blue Boy is a good way to get fed up with his talent. This painting of an entitled, arrogant youth in a fancy dress costume has a country-house worth of technical magic but no soul. It surely appealed to people a century ago – including Americans who still emulated the English upper class – as a quintessentially English icon of snobbish disdain and style. Today it might stick in our throats for the same reason. But that is not, exactly, what is wrong with it. The craft of this show-off painting scintillates. You enter the small room where it is on display and are delighted by that burst of silvered azure. Whoever this adolescent was – the identity of the Blue Boy has never been established – Gainsborough turned him into precious artwork. He got him to dress in an archaic costume inspired by the cavaliers Van Dyck painted in the 1600s on the eve of the English civil war. Van Dyck, from Antwerp, created a definitive swaggering look for high-style English aristocratic portraiture. In Gainsborough’s day, when portraitists were vying for the custom of an elite enriched by the agricultural revolution, global trade and slavery, the Van Dyck manner was hot. So, in this tour de force of oil painting, Gainsborough takes on Van Dyck and out-primps him. Van Dyck’s portrait of Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart, painted about 1638, is hung for comparison. These two youths with expressions of ice-cold hauteur become a bit more sympathetic when you realise they would both shortly be killed in the civil war, probably while brushing their long hair. Lord Bernard Stuart wears a silver and blue cloak, blue pantaloons and fawn boots. He poses with one knee raised, hand on hip, looking down on us over his shoulder.
Gainsborough’s youth wears a version of this very garb yet it is painted much more playfully. Van Dyck’s brushwork is meticulous. Gainsborough’s is rollicking. He lets loose glancing dazzles and dips of light and cool in every crease, riffs on each frolic of lace like a drunken flautist. He has great fun, riffing on ruffs. If that was enough to make a portrait great, this would be one of the greatest. However, it is not. The painting’s most brilliant visual coup is also the beginning of what it lacks. Gainsborough sets off the electric storm of blueness against a rainy English sky. As the Victorian critic Ruskin noted, Gainsborough’s weather is the most British thing about him. This sky is brown and brackish, laden with chilly moisture, a sublime bass note to contrast with the piping flute. It is a romantic landscape – one of the first. Yet Gainsborough does not use it romantically. He uses it for pure visual effect: the morose setting exaggerates the figure’s brightness. Instead of a solitary walker lost in landscape we get an overdressed cocksure kid looking right through us. Gainsborough sacrifices emotion for effect. The Blue Boy’s face doesn’t betray the least hint of introspection. In reality, the youth’s aristocratic demeanour may be a put-on. One possible candidate for the model is Gainsborough’s nephew and apprentice Gainsborough Dupont. That makes sense if, as I suspect, The Blue Boy is not a real portrait so much as a display piece Gainsborough kept in his studio to razzle-dazzle potential customers. It was painted when he had a portrait business in Bath. Gentlefolk staying at this spa town for the season could pose for him between playing cards at the Assembly Rooms and marrying off their daughters. Gainsborough called it “pickpocketing the rich”. And yes, he was happy to pickpocket people whose money came from slave plantations. To me The Blue Boy looks like his brilliant advert – today it might be a video he played for the client so they could see how he might transform them. That would explain why it has so much style and so little soul.
Gainsborough could be so much better than this. And the National Gallery accidentally shows that by including one of his real masterpieces, Elizabeth and Mary Linley, which is a risky move if you want people to look at anything else in the room. Mary Linley returns your gaze with true feeling and intelligence while her sister looks into the landscape with Romantic feeling. This is how Gainsborough could paint people he really cared about – who usually tended to be women, or fellow creative workers. The musical Linleys were both. These paintings are keepers but The Blue Boy had me fidgeting after five minutes. It is as boring as it is impressive. It seems the art market a century ago was as silly as it is today. Gainsborough’s Blue Boy is at the National Gallery, London, from 25 January to 15 May.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/24/gainsborough-blue-boy-a-cocksure-kid-who-looks-right-through-you-review;entertainment and culture
1574;1574;1574;1574;1593;1593;From Line of Duty to #JusticeforBarb: TV’s obsession with shock early deaths;2022-01-24;['Michael Hogan'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio'];"It was Lisa Faulkner’s deep-fried face that started it. Almost 20 years ago, swishy new BBC spy drama Spooks seized viewers by the lapels – and saw the Broadcasting Standards Commission inundated with complaints – in only its second episode when Thames House trainee Helen Flynn (played by Faulkner) volunteered for a risky undercover mission, but found herself getting served up with salt and vinegar. Brookside alumnus and lads’ mag favourite Faulkner had just completed a stint on Holby City. Among a cast of newcomers, hers was the biggest name. Viewers assumed she would be a key player in the show taglined “It’s MI5, not 9 to 5”. Hence it was a jaw-dropper in spring 2002 when her character infiltrated an extremist group but got rumbled and gruesomely murdered. First, her hand was plunged into a deep-fat fryer by Kevin McNally’s far-right leader, which was wince-inducing enough – until he shoved poor Helen’s head in, too. Her fellow agent, Matthew Macfadyen’s Tom (not Wambsgans, sadly) was held at gunpoint and could only watch in horror.
The set piece was originally pencilled in for the series finale, but as producer Jane Featherstone reasoned: “Let’s move the most dramatic thing you’ve got to episode two and kill off the only actress the audience recognise and then you’ve got them hooked.” The Guardian’s Charlie Brooker approved: “The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it’ll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas … sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation.” Despite airing after the watershed, the grisly scene sparked the most complaints of any show that year. It also set a trend in box set drama for bumping off big names early. It might be risky (what if fans switch off in protest?) but it’s a bold move that drastically raises the stakes. Viewers are kept guessing and gripped. If they can wipe out a headline name, what else might they do? ITV’s bomb disposal drama Trigger Point began with a similarly loud bang on Sunday night. Slight spoiler in case you have miraculously managed to avoid them and intend to catch up, but a central character got blown to smithereens before the credits rolled on the opening episode. As with Spooks, the message to viewers was clear. In this show, the jeopardy is real. Nobody is safe.
Trigger Point, of course, hails from the Jed Mercurio stable. The don of tense TV thrillers didn’t script this one, but he executive-produced, and mentored screenwriting debutant Daniel Brierley. Mercurio the Merciless has a track record of swiftly killing off his star signings. Keeley Hawes was blown up by a briefcase bomb before the midway mark of ratings blockbuster Bodyguard. Jessica Raine, Daniel Mays and Jason Watkins got guest-star billing in Line of Duty series two, three and four respectively. None survived beyond the first episode. Sign up a major star, then unceremoniously off them – that’s the Mercurio method. His trademark life-or-death cliffhangers suddenly become a lot more potent when someone genuinely could cark it. (As a budgetary bonus, it also means paying a pricey performer’s fee for fewer episodes.) The trick soon spread across the Atlantic, where perhaps the prime exemplar was Game of Thrones. The debut season of HBO’s shagging-and-dragons saga placed Sean Bean’s brooding patriarch Eddard “Ned” Stark front and centre, not just on the billboard posters but within the narrative. It had been a casting coup to lure the craggy Lord of the Rings star back to the fantasy genre, let alone the small screen. Ned was established as the show’s moral centre – until episode nine, when he was gasp-inducingly beheaded on the whim of punchable poison dwarf Joffrey.
“This is probably the first time a US drama series has ever killed off its main character in the first season as part of its master creative plan,” wrote Entertainment Weekly. “It’s just not done. You don’t cast a star, put him on bus stops and magazine ads, get viewers all invested in his story, and then dump him nine episodes later just because it arguably makes the story a bit more interesting.” Oh yes you do. Showrunner DB Weiss admitted that Ned’s early demise had been a “selling point” for him and co-creator David Benioff. “It completely ups the ante whenever a character is in danger if you know someone else didn’t survive a similar situation,” he said. Slaughtering a high-profile cast member early not only has shock value but promises all manner of unexpected twists. Christopher Eccleston’s amiable scientist was viciously mauled to death in the first episode of Sky’s frost-bitten Fortitude. Ariana Grande was dispatched equally swiftly in Ryan Murphy’s Scream Queens, stabbed in the back while sending a tweet. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. Real-time thriller 24 gleefully killed off anyone who wasn’t Kiefer Sutherland. David Haig’s spook lasted just three episodes of Killing Eve before Villanelle did her thing. Tragedy at the end of act one provides an emotional climax early in the piece.
And who can forget Nancy’s beloved bestie Barb (Shannon Purser) getting dragged into the Upside Down and killed by the Demogorgon within two episodes of Stranger Things’ debut season? It not only cranked up the fear factor but made her such a cult figure that #JusticeforBarb trended on Twitter. Purser earned an Emmy nomination for mere minutes of screen time. We got another big one – or should that be Big one? – only last month. Divisive Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That began with Carrie Bradshaw living smugly ever after with John “Mr Big” Preston. Forty cringe-making minutes later, Chris Noth’s cigar-puffing, eyebrow-waggling alpha male keeled over from a fatal heart attack after a home workout – plunging Peloton into a PR crisis in the process. HBO execs can be forgiven for breathing a sigh of relief though, because multiple women have since accused Noth of sexual assault. He has denied the allegations but writing out his character proved a smart move in more ways than one. The show itself immediately switched from nostalgic lifestyle larks to bittersweet sad-com. Not entirely successfully, sure, but at least grief and midlife widowhood made for more interesting subject matter than cosmos, corsages and camp one-liners. And just like that, Carrie swapped her bright blue silk Manolos for a deeper, darker hue. Moral of the story? On 21st-century TV, no character is safe. Nowadays the bigger the star’s name, the higher their odds of getting cruelly killed early doors. Also: steer clear of exercise bikes, deep-fat fryers and improvised explosive devices.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/from-line-of-duty-to-justiceforbarb-tvs-obsession-with-shock-early-deaths;entertainment and culture
1589;1589;1589;1589;1608;1608;Jodorowsky animated Dune in development, says crypto group;2022-01-24;['David Barnett'];['Film', 'Science fiction and fantasy films', 'Science fiction books', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Fiction', 'Alejandro Jodorowsky', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'Dune'];"A cryptocurrency-backed consortium that paid £2.2m – 100 times the estimate – for concept art for an unmade film adaptation of Dune has claimed that their animated version has gone into development despite questions over copyright. The group, called Spice DAO, caused a flurry of excitement on social media when it announced last weekend that it had bought the book of art, created by director Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 1970s, at auction in November and planned to “make the book public (to the extent permitted by law)” and, more ambitiously, to “produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service”. Frank Herbert’s novel Dune has been filmed three times: David Lynch’s 1984 version, a TV miniseries in 2000, and Denis Villeneuve’s version released last autumn. However, as many people pointed out in the thousands of replies to Saturday’s Twitter post, ownership of a copy of a book, no matter how much was paid for it, does not confer any intellectual property rights to either distribute copies of it or to adapt it into another medium. The announcement was roundly dismissed as a stunt by social media users who suspect Spice DAO’s ultimate plan is to sell the individual pages from the book as NFTs – digital images with ownership rights – especially as there was speculation on a Spice DAO internet forum that the physical book could be burned as a publicity stunt after the NFTs have sold.
While the book did indeed sell at Christie’s in Paris for €2.6m on 21 November, Spice DAO have offered no actual proof that they are the purchasers, nor explained why the price paid was so astronomical when the auction house had put a €25,000-35-000 estimate on it. It has been reported that Spice DAO’s co-founder, millionaire Soban Saqib, put up the bulk of the purchase fee from his own funds after raising $750,000 (£550,000) from the consortium’s members. Adrien Legendre, of the books department of Christie’s in Paris, told the Guardian that the book came from the private collection of an individual and that bids were taken on the day from the room, by phone and online – where the winning bid came from, which Legendre was not at liberty to discuss. As to the surprising price the book realised, Legendre said that the estimate was based on “previous sale results, reflecting the appetite and market for the object and the context”. In a Medium post on Thursday, Spice DAO seemed to concede that they did not have any rights to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – and instead were ploughing ahead with creating an original animated series. The post reads: “After two months of outreach, conversations with former business partners and consultations with legal counsel we have not been able to reach an agreement with any of the rights holders involved in the creation of the contents of the book of collected storyboards of Jodorowsky’s Dune.
“Our research over the past two months has only increased our respect for their project and we were so inspired by the book and learning more about its creation that we saw how we could develop our own intellectual property that we own 100% and control all aspects of the production of an original animated limited series. Spice DAO claims are in the development phase and have a “whirlwind week of meetings” coming up with writers, producers, three Los Angeles animation studios, graphic novel publishers, and the “entertainment attorney for Drake” – presumably the Canadian-born rapper. Kirsty Stewart, legal director and trademark attorney in the Dundee office of law firm Thorntons, wrote on the company’s site: “Unfortunately for Spice DOA, the collective who purchased the Jodorowsky Dune bible, Frank Herbert died in 1986, meaning copyright persists in the base text of Dune until at least 2056. Similarly, the book they purchased, as it was produced to sell the idea to studios at the time, is likely protected by copyright until at least 2092, as Jodorowsky, one of the authors of the book, remains alive. “As such, in order to produce or authorise derivative works such as an animated series, Spice DOA would need to obtain licenses from the Herbert estate, as well as potentially Jodorowsky (and any other authors such as Michel Seydoux) if the adaptation was based on the Jodorowsky book. Similar to how buying a Batman comic does not give you the inherent rights to produce a new Batman film, the purchasing of this director’s bible does not give Spice DOA any intrinsic rights to produce new material.”
French-Chilean director Jodorowsky acquired the film rights to Dune in 1974, and envisaged an epic topping 15 hours. Jodorowsky engaged a trio of comic book and science fiction artists – Jean Giraud, known as Moebius; Chris Foss, a British illustrator famous for his science fiction novel covers; and Swiss artist HR Giger, who would later become known for his concept work on the Alien movies – to design the look and feel of his projected adaptation. They failed to get financial backing from the studios, though, and the project died, its only legacy being the concept art books that Jodorowsky produced – of which Christie’s say only around 10 survive. The lot sold in November was described by Christie’s as “oblong octavo (210 x 295 mm). 11 colour plates, after drawings by Christopher Foss, Jean Giraud-Moebius and HR Giger, one title-page, 268 black and white plates, mostly the storyboard for the movie, with dialogues in French and English, and some studies for characters, environments and vehicles, one page with the printer’s name and address. All the plates are photographic reproductions, printed single-side.” It has been pointed out on social media that many of the pages of the rare book are already available online. Spice DAO were contacted via their Twitter account and after initially seeming amenable to conversation, blocked this writer after being asked: “How do you propose to adapt a book that you don’t have the rights for and get a streaming service to take it? Or is this more about selling the pages as NFTs?”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/dune-animation-based-on-jodorowsky-concept-art-in-development-says-cryptocurrency-group-spice-dao-frank-herbert;entertainment and culture
1591;1591;1591;1591;1610;1610;Hallé/Elder review – Elder’s measured passion unleashes Mahler’s magic;2022-01-24;['Hugh Morris'];['Classical music', 'Hallé Orchestra', 'Mark Elder', 'Music', 'Culture'];"The once familiar sight of bustling Bridgewater Hall greeted the Hallé orchestra, who opened their spring season with a long-awaited performance of Mahler’s Third Symphony – originally scheduled for May 2020. Where Mahler’s Second Symphony follows the passage of darkness into light, the Third gets even closer to his world-encompassing aspiration, charting nature’s journey via mankind towards God’s love. Involving six, lopsidedly arranged movements, requiring a vast number of musicians and lasting for well over 90 minutes, it’s an ambitious piece to programme at any time, but, with a vista of performers on one side and a packed auditorium on the other, Mark Elder was a picture of calm, interrupting his economical gestures only to shake more sound out of the strings. Elder’s dedication to painting the big picture can come at the expense of rhythmic transparency, but the sound he conjures from the Hallé is plush, dramatic and – crucially for this work – unhurried. The orchestra’s nine horns began proceedings resolutely as each section presented their own vivid colours in turn through the sprawling opening movement, Katy Jones’s sonorous trombone solo the pick of the bunch.
Symphonic logic rapidly departs as the piece travels through an impish minuet to a folksy movement originally titled What the Animals of the Forest Tell Me – the latter possessed bags of the earthiness that’s key to releasing Mahler’s magic. The two vocal movements brought sharply contrasting characters: Alice Coote leant heavily into the world-weary mood of Nietzsche’s enigmatic “superman” text, while the Hallé Choirs delivered their short contributions with gusto. The slender fifth movement was a multi-layered delight, courtesy of beaming “bimm! bamm!”s from the Children’s Choir and genuine church bells (borrowed from the Liverpool Philharmonic). But the evening’s high point was Elder’s judicious handling of the finale’s consecutive peaks – measured in its passion, and rapturously applauded.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/halle-elder-review-mahler-3-bridgewater-hall-manchester;entertainment and culture
1598;1598;1598;1598;1617;1617;Liverpool bomber had asylum claim rejected six years before attack;2022-01-24;['Josh Halliday'];['UK security and counter-terrorism', 'Liverpool', 'UK news'];The Liverpool bomber had an asylum claim rejected on multiple grounds six years before he attempted to detonate a homemade explosive outside a hospital, court documents show. Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, was killed when the bomb he was carrying exploded inside a taxi outside Liverpool women’s hospital on Remembrance Sunday last year. The Home Office twice rejected Swealmeen’s claims for asylum – once in 2014 and again in 2020 – and new details raise questions about why he was not pursued for deportation as long ago as 2015. Court documents obtained by BBC News show he claimed to be of Syrian heritage and in fear for his life, but was unable to give basic details about where his family lived or why they were in danger. Language analysis conducted by the Home Office concluded that there was a high likelihood that he was Iraqi and was “very unlikely” to be Syrian. Swealmeen travelled to the UK in 2014 on a genuine Jordanian passport, which gave his birthplace as Iraq and his date of birth as 11 October 1989. An immigration judge dismissed his asylum appeal in April 2015, writing in a ruling quoted by BBC News: “His account of his time in Syria gives the impression of someone quoting information that is in the public domain rather than having first-hand experience. “The appellant did not identify himself with any particular faction or indicate that he would be at risk other than in a general sense.” That ruling meant the Home Office had the green light to send Swealmeen back to Iraq or Jordan, as it had previously told him it would do. Instead, however, Swealmeen remained in the UK and is thought to have been moved to the Fazakerley area of Liverpool in late 2016. In 2017 he mounted a new asylum claim using a different name but that was rejected at the end of 2020, prompting another appeal in January 2021. Police believe that Swealmeen was plotting a terror attack by at least April 2021, when he rented a property and started buying parts needed for a bomb. Detectives believe it is most likely that he acted alone although counter-terrorism experts have said it is incredibly rare for someone to plan an atrocity for seven months without telling anyone. The case raises questions about why Swealmeen was not deported in 2015 when his first asylum appeal was rejected on several grounds, and he could have been spotted earlier as a danger to himself and others. The Home Office declined to comment on Swealmeen’s case but said: “We are fixing the broken asylum system. The ‘new plan for immigration’ will require people to raise all protection-related issues upfront to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/liverpool-bomber-emad-al-swealmeen-asylum-claim-rejected-before-attack;business and economy
1601;1601;1601;1601;1620;1620;How we met: ‘My sister suggested I try going on the radio to find a date’;2022-01-24;['Lizzie Cernik'];['Life and style', 'Relationships', 'Family'];In 1986, Toni was working as a clinical laboratory director in St Louis, Missouri. “I was single at the time and keen to meet someone,” she says. One Friday night, she and a friend were listening to the area’s flagship radio station KMOX, which hosted a show called Dateline. “The idea was that single people called in, shared a bit about themselves, and listeners could contact the radio station for their details afterwards,” says Toni. She made a bet with her friend that she would call one of the men from the show. “At the time, it wasn’t the thing to do,” she laughs. “Internet dating didn’t exist back then and a lot of strange people would call into that show. But we thought it would be a funny story to tell if I gave it a go.” She had vetoed lots of callers before Ron came on the show at the end of the night. He had recently moved from North Carolina to a nearby town to work for a medical technology company, and was keen to meet new people. “My sister suggested I try going on the radio to find a date,” he says. “Now I’m used to public speaking, but at the time I was very scared. [The station] gave you guidelines on how to introduce yourself and I was on air for about a minute.” Toni says he was the only person who sparked her interest. “He said he wanted someone family-oriented, sporty and fun-loving, which described me,” she says. “Before he came on, I thought: ‘Whoever this is, I guess I need to call them, because I’d said I would.’ Luckily he sounded nice.” Although she wasn’t expecting it to go anywhere, the pair immediately hit it off when she called. “I had about five calls after the show but Toni stood out,” says Ron. “We agreed to meet at a restaurant in St Louis.” Over the phone, he described himself as “average-looking”, so Toni was surprised to discover he was “very handsome”. During their dinner date, they found out they had lots in common. “We are both from large, Catholic families, worked in similar fields and shared a lot of the same values,” says Ron. For their next date, Toni travelled to his town, just outside St Louis. “There were no cellphones, so I looked at the back of the phonebook for a map of the city area. I couldn’t find his town at first and it took me ages to figure it out.” She eventually made it and they went on a bike ride together. “I fell off and cracked my fingers,” she says. “Then Ron took me to his place and cooked dinner.” From then on, they became a couple. “At first, I was worried it wouldn’t work because he was a few years younger than me,” says Toni. “I told a girl at work about him and she said I could introduce him to her instead if I wanted. That was when I knew I wanted to keep him for myself.” Both passionate about the outdoors, they spent their dates walking, talking and playing tennis. Ron proposed to Toni at a Billy Joel concert in 1987, and they married and moved in together the following year in St Louis. Having a family was equally important to both of them, and their children joined the family in 1991 and 1994. “We still have lots of shared interests and love going to national parks together,” says Toni. “He’s slow to anger and pretty calm, which was really important to me, as it means we never get into big fights. He’s also a very hard worker, which our family really appreciates.” Ron loves his wife’s commitment to their family. “We’ve both been dedicated to raising our children,” he says. “Toni is a great mother, and we’re constantly supporting each other in everything we do. I really value the simple things that some people forget over time, like her honesty and loyalty.” Want to share your story?

1618;1618;1618;1618;1637;1637;Spice up your life! 22 sensational seasonings that aren’t salt or pepper;2022-01-24;['Tony Naylor'];['Food', 'Restaurants', 'Restaurants'];"Historically, Britain has been timid about table condiments. Salt and pepper are the standard duo in the UK, while an exhilarating array of flavourings is deployed globally to tweak cooked foods: traditional spices, evolving spice mixes, clever powders created by imaginative chefs. In deep midwinter, what could be better than sprinkling a dash of vibrant colour across your meals? Here are 22 ways to spice up your food in 2022. Dehydrated chicken skin “It will transform chips, fish, boring salads, anything,” enthuses Sam Grainger, the chef-owner at Belzan in Liverpool. On a greaseproof tray, flatten chicken skin, salt it and scatter with garlic and thyme. Place baking paper on top and a tray to weigh it down. Oven roast at 170C (150C fan)/335F/gas 3½ for 40 minutes, until the skin is crisp. Remove the top tray and paper, and continue to dry the skin in the oven at about 75C fan for a further eight hours. Let it cool on kitchen towels to absorb any oil. Pat dry. Using a blender, blitz the skin and a little coarse salt to a fine powder. Portion out your batch of powder – you could use an ice-cube tray or clingfilm “twists” – and freeze in an airtight container. Sumac “On Iranian tables, you’ll find salt, pepper and a shaker of lemony sumac to add floral acidity to dishes,” says Marwa Alkhalaf, the chef at Nutshell in London. Alkhalaf namechecks the sumac – a powder ground from the dried fruit of the sumac shrub – from Anjoman and Persia Food. “I like its sweet-sour flavour on ice-cream and fruit.” Furikake
“It’s very popular in Japan,” says Masaki Sugisaki, the chef-owner at Dinings SW3 in London. Furikake is normally used to transform steamed rice, but this crunchy, umami blend of sesame seeds and seaweed, seasoned with slow-roasted fish or egg, is a potential pick-me-up for drab salads or tuna-topped baked potatoes, too. Sugisaki rates the Noritama brand. Dukkah This Egyptian creation pivots around nutty flavours (sesame, almond, hazelnut, pumpkin, chickpea), toasted with herbs and spices (mint, cumin, coriander), which are pounded into a powder or a crunchier, chunky consistency. “Every family has their ratios and spice preferences,” says Mitshel Ibrahim, the chef-owner at Ombra in London. Dukkah was traditionally used as hummus dressing or to top dipping oils for breads and meze vegetables. But its “fragrant, gentle spice” is a versatile addition to breakfast eggs, soups, couscous and fried fish. Ibrahim recommends the stockist Persepolis, “a little shop of Middle Eastern wonders” in Peckham, south-east London, that ships nationwide. The tagline for its dukkah is: “So good you’ll want it on everything.” Gremolata This chiffonade of finely chopped garlic, lemon zest and flat-leaf parsley brings a fresh, savoury sheen to a number of dishes, says Esther Miglio, a co-owner of OWT in Leeds: “It works brilliantly on stews, fried chicken, roast vegetables, through salads.” Adjust ratios to taste, but two-thirds garlic cloves to one-third fresh parsley and the zest of one lemon will make gremolata for four to six people. Refrigerate for up to three days. Achar masala
Primarily a pickling mix, this crunchy combo of salt, chilli, asafoetida, mustard and fenugreek seeds, bound with a little oil, doubles as a dry Gujarati condiment. “It’s used on rice and dal,” says Mayur Patel, a co-owner of the Bundobust restaurants in northern England. “When I was a kid, my mum would smash up Seabrook’s ready salted crisps – their crinkles hold the masala better – and sprinkle achar and lemon juice into the packet. We’d have that on white-bread sandwiches.” In south India, “gunpowder”, or milagai podi, is considered similarly useful. A seasoned mix of roasted, ground coconut and lentils, it is best known for flavouring potatoes, but Avinash Shashidhara, the head chef at Pahli Hill in London says: “We use it on everything, even on ghee-buttered toast.” Powdered seaweed A fantastic salt alternative, saysGrainger: “It gives another layer, umami and flavour impact, without tasting like pure salt.” In a blender, with a little salt to help the grind, blitz sheets of seaweed (“nori or dulse work best”) into fine dust. “It’s great on fish or vegetable dishes.” Dunn’s River all-purpose seasoning From the US seafood seasoning Old Bay (a favourite of Ravinder Bhogal, the chef-owner at Jikoni in London) to lapsang souchong salt, there are numerous ways to titivate chips. A moreish mix of paprika, mustard and onion powder (among other spices), Dunn’s River’s all-purpose seasoning is recommended by Michelle Miah, a co-owner of the London restaurant Rudie’s Jerk Shack: “Some seasonings can be salty or overly flavoursome. Dunn’s has balance.” Phrik pon Roast, ground chillies complete khruang phrung, a quartet of Thai table condiments (including sugar, fish sauce and vinegar-pickled chillies) that enable endless customisation. Andrew Chongsathien, the owner of Brother Thai in Cardiff, uses phrik pon’s “exciting” smoky spice instead of orthodox chilli flakes. In a wok, roast long red dried chillies (shorter ones will be hotter) on a medium-high heat for three minutes, ensuring they do not blacken (open a window first). “When you start coughing, they’re done,” says Chongsathien. “When cool, grind the chillies in a pestle and mortar. I prefer coarse flakes.” In an airtight container, “they keep for ever”. Shichimi tōgarashi With its chilli heat, citrus peel, sansho pepper and roasted sesame savouriness, this aromatic, seven-ingredient topping is essential in Japan. “In good versions, you taste all the flavours in one,” says Kaori Simpson, the chef-owner at Harajuku Kitchen in Edinburgh. Use tōgarashi on noodles, soups, tempura and fried chicken, but not ramen: “It’s a no-no on Japanese versions of Chinese foods; instead, you have white pepper and chilli oil.” Espelette
“Black pepper is too aggressive,” says Josh Overington, the chef at Le Cochon Aveugle in York. He uses the “bittersweet, elegant heat” of this Basque chilli pepper. Traditionally used to cure jamón, espelette is great on eggs, asparagus, grilled chicken and bland foods, where its subtlety can shine. Gochugaru This sun-dried, ground Korean chilli, which gives kimchi its red colour, comes in a variety of consistencies and heats, but its “bright, fruity, slightly smoky flavour” makes it a versatile ingredient and table condiment, says Judy Joo, the chef-owner of the Seoul Bird restaurants in London. “I sprinkle it on everything from pizza to veggies,” says Joo. “Store it in your freezer to keep it zesty.” Cumin Used to season everything from boiled eggs to roast lamb, ground cumin and salt are the staple Moroccan table condiments, says Nargisse Benkabbou, a chef and the author of the cookbook Casablanca. Cayenne pepper is also offered – “to add heat without too much flavour”. Paprika “Agridulce [a Spanish sweet-and-hot paprika mix] is used on every fried egg of ours,” says Ben Wright, the owner of Porta in Chester. It also gives a smoky kick to fried potatoes or octopus. Paprika is big in Romanian cooking, too. Irina Georgescu, the author of the cookbook Carpathia, uses the smoked version alongside salt and pepper: “Sprinkle on potato salads, omelettes, fried fish and roast vegetables, especially carrots or parsnips, where spice – not salt – complements their flavour.” Chinese five-spice salt
“I’m a big fan of Cantonese-Vietnamese ‘spicy salt’ – classic five-spice with salt – used as a dip for fried and grilled poultry,” says Lap-Fai Lee, a Birmingham-based restaurant consultant and food tutor. “A good cook will make this fresh, doing enough for that meal.” In a hot pan, toast salt for 30 seconds with whole Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon or cassia, star anise, cloves and fennel seeds. The ratio is 2:1 salt to five-spice (the spices combined in equal amounts). For extra oomph, add MSG powder in equal quantity to one of the spices. “It’s not the same without it,” says Lee. Grind the mix into a fine salt and dip your meat delicately as you eat. Sal de gusano A Mexican salt made by roasting so-called “worms” (caterpillar larvae) found on the agave plant, then mixing them with salt and sometimes chillies. “I add it where I want smoky depth,” says Shaun Hurrell, the chef-owner at Barrio Comida in Durham. That might be sweetcorn, a steak or popcorn. Sal de gusano is available from Cool Chile Co. Burnt onion powder “A versatile workhorse,” says Alex Rushmer, the chef at Vanderlyle, a plant-focused restaurant in Cambridge. Peel red or white onions, separate the “petals” on a roasting tray and bake them in a process of “dehydration, caramelisation and controlled burning” at 160-190C (140C-170C fan)/325-375F/gas 3-5 for approximately one hour, until dried and dark brown. Keep an eye on their progress: “They should turn to powder when you squeeze them in your hand.” Blitz to a fine powder in a blender, store in a dark, airtight container for two weeks, then “sprinkle on anything you want to taste oniony. It’s an awesome seasoning for roasted nuts and would be great over white pizza, or sprinkled on a cheese crouton on french onion soup.” Za’atar This fusion of sumac, dried thyme, toasted sesame and salt (“characteristically bright and fresh, earthy and zesty,” says Calvin von Niebel, the executive chef at the Ottolenghi restaurants in London) is terrific when used to finish seafood, dusted over labneh or on pitta pieces or chips. Tajín
This zingy combo of chillies, salt and dehydrated lime (it is hard to find here but available online) is ubiquitous in Mexico. “It’s found in fine restaurants, at home on popcorn, on street stalls mixed with fruit or veggies. I love it on a grated carrot, beetroot and jicama yam slaw,” says Adriana Cavita, who will launch her eponymous London restaurant in spring.
Yaji Commonly retailed as “suya spice”, after the west African grilled meat skewers it regularly dresses, yaji comes in several varieties. It has core ingredients – chilli and onion powders, ginger, paprika and cloves – but there have been additions as its fame has spread from northern Nigeria. Garlic, explains Adejoké Bakare, the chef-owner at Chishuru in London, “was not common in the old days”. There is a specific yaji for cooking sauces (this includes dawadawa, fermented locust bean), while peanut-boosted yaji-kuli is used on those suya kebabs, hot off the grill. “It adds texture to the meat,” says Bakare, who grew up using basic yaji to season salads or, in combination with mai shanu butter, rice pancakes and couscous. Nut parmesan “A super-savoury seasoning with a cheesy nutritional-yeast flavour, and I add chilli for a kick,” says Bettina Campolucci Bordi, the author of the vegan cookbook Happy Food. To make a 75g sample, blitz 30g each of hazelnuts and almond flour with half a teaspoon each of salt and nutritional yeast, adding chilli flakes to taste. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to two weeks. “I keep it handy to season soups, pastas and roast veg, or as a toast-topping.” Chaat masala This tangy, spice mix (key ingredients: dried mango and black salt) is, of course, used in the potato, chickpea and gram-salad-cum-snack chaat, but it also seasons “everything fried”, says Gouranga Bera, the chef at Curry Leaf Café in Brighton. “Add chaat to pakoras and bhajis when they’re crisp, so the spices stick. Its sweet, sour, spicy taste is also delicious on grilled meats with lime or lemon juice.” Chaat masala’s addition of a “savoury note” to fruit salads has been a “revelation” for Curry Leaf’s co-owner Euan Sey, who suggests trying MDH’s chunky chaat masala as a premixed version: “I’m something of a fruit dodger, but I love fruit chaat.”";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/24/spice-seasonings-salt-pepper-britain-chefs-zaatar-yaji;business and economy
1628;1628;1628;1628;1647;1647;Coalition shift on rapid antigen tests for disability carers still falls short, advocates say;2022-01-24;['Luke Henriques-Gomes'];['National disability insurance scheme', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Disability'];"National disability insurance scheme participants will be able to dip into their core funding to purchase rapid antigen tests for themselves and their support workers, but critics have warned the change is still inadequate. The policy shift, confirmed by the Morrison government on Monday, is aimed at addressing an inequity in the system that meant some NDIS participants who lived in their own home, rather than in a group home, were being forced to spend hundreds of dollars on rapid antigen tests for their support workers, as revealed by Guardian Australia last week. In one particularly shocking case, Carolyn Campbell-McLean, who has muscular dystrophy, and as a result limited lung capacity, had spent $1,300 on tests for her carers, just so they could continue to enter her home and help her with tasks like getting out of bed, showering and dressing herself.
However, the new policy still falls short of demands from disability advocacy groups, who say the tests should be free, and was criticised by the federal Labor opposition on Monday. The new scheme means NDIS participants will use their existing “core” budget funding funds to buy the tests. This pool of money is allocated for use on core services, such as support workers, transport and other everyday items related to a person’s disability. The government said NDIS participants would be able to use these existing core funds to buy tests for themselves or their carers. About 18% of all NDIS participants, including Campbell-McLean, are not eligible for the 10 free tests over three months that are being provided to concession card holders, a measure that came into force on Monday.
The NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, said the change to allow participants to buy RATs with their funding was “another example of how we are supporting participants to use their funding flexibly during the Covid-19 pandemic”. “We know that rapid antigen tests are an important tool for ensuring that participants continue to access their disability-related supports,” she said. “NDIS participants can claim rapid antigen tests to ensure their continuity of services.” Campbell-McLean welcomed the change as a “fantastic outcome”, though the Physical Disability Council of NSW, which also raised the issue last week, noted a need to increase plan budgets “when funds are used prematurely to cover this substantial additional cost”. An NDIS spokesperson said participants can “use their existing funds flexibly to purchase rapid antigen tests”. “Plans will not be automatically adjusted – if a participant thinks their plan funds are too low to claim the RAT support, they can contact the NDIA by phone [on]1800 800 110,” the spokesperson said. Max Burt is an advocate who is immunocompromised and has multiple disabilities following a head injury sustained in car crash in London 22 years ago. He now requires daily care and told Guardian Australia he had spent about $1,000 on rapid antigen tests for his team of several support workers. Burt said allowing NDIS participants to use their allocated funds to purchase RATs prompted the question of whether the government would be increasing funding packages to cover the extra costs. “And priority is an issue,” he said. “If the government is not prioritising concession card holders access to RATs via their pharmacist, and is now prioritising teachers and school children with free and available RATs directly supplied to schools, then where does that leave NDIS participants? In the queue with the general public?
“Buying them via normal retail channels – left behind at the back of the queue again?” Burt said the free tests for concession card holders, which he was able to access, were insufficient and also not particularly helpful, due to the limited supply. “If you’re in my position as well, in a wheelchair, [going out] to shop at a chemist is just not that easy,” he said. Labor’s NDIS spokesman, Bill Shorten, said rapid antigen tests should be free for all NDIS participants. “It is not the job of NDIS participants to do the Morrison government’s job of continuing services. Providers and carers should be able to access rapid tests easily and at no cost.” Unlike the aged care sector, NDIS providers do not have access to the federal government’s national stockpile of rapid tests, meaning they have been forced to compete with other businesses to source them in the free market. One provider told Guardian Australia this month it had only been able to source seven rapid antigen tests for its entire workforce in Tasmania.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/coalition-shift-on-rapid-antigen-tests-for-disability-carers-still-falls-short-advocates-say;health

What we can’t afford is the alternative | Kevin Watkins;2022-01-24;['Kevin Watkins'];['Aid', 'Inequality and development', 'Sustainable development goals', 'Global development', 'World Bank', 'International Monetary Fund (IMF)', 'Inequality', 'Society', 'World news', 'Economics', 'Global economy'];"“The peoples of the Earth,” Henry Morgenthau said, “are inseparably linked by a deep underlying community of purpose.” In July 1944, Morgenthau, the US Treasury secretary, was closing the Bretton Woods conference with a reflection on extreme nationalism and the failures of cooperation that had led to war. Cautioning against the pursuit of national interest through “the plan-less, senseless rivalry that divided us”, he outlined an accord for new institutions grounded in an appeal to shared humanity. Reading Morgenthau’s speech today is a jolting reminder of how a generation of political leaders sought to remake the world. The institutional architecture – the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and what became the World Trade Organization – that emerged from Bretton Woods may have been deeply flawed. But this was an attempt to underpin through practical financial and monetary cooperation the human rights and freedoms envisaged in the UN charter. Today we need institutions equipped to rise to the great challenges posed by Covid-19, poverty and the climate crisis. Yet political leaders gripped by vaccine nationalism, climate nationalism and economic nationalism are manifestly lacking the “community of purpose” their citizens and the world need in this moment of crisis. Nowhere are the failures more starkly evident than in the financial response to the pandemic. When Covid-19 struck, governments in rich countries acted decisively to contain the social and economic impacts. Fiscal rulebooks were torn up and monetary orthodoxies abandoned. Even the most conservative finance ministers responded to the crisis like Keynesians on public finance steroids. According to the IMF, economic stimulus measures equivalent to about one-quarter of GDP were implemented. Contrasts with lower-income countries could not be more striking. Most were unable to muster more than 1-2% of GDP in increased public spending, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected and economies trapped in a downward spiral.
Recession magnified pre-pandemic debt problems, leaving more than half of low-income countries either in, or at risk of, debt distress. Amid the public health crisis triggered by the pandemic, 43 lower-income countries were left spending more on debt than public health. The financing disparities have fuelled what some commentators have described as a Great Divergence. While rich countries have all but recovered the economic ground lost during the pandemic, average incomes in the poorest countries will remain below pre-pandemic levels until mid-decade. Meanwhile, budget austerity is reinforcing inequalities within countries as vital public services are cut. The human consequences have been devastating. Progress towards the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) has been thrown into reverse. The number of people in poverty has increased by more than 90 million. Two decades of progress towards universal health coverage have ground to a halt, raising the spectre of setbacks in child survival and maternal health. Malnutrition is rising. Disruption to education systems could leave 70% of children in the poorest countries in “learning poverty”, lacking the skills they need to escape their circumstances. It would be folly for citizens in rich countries to imagine they will be immune to the instability and insecurity that will accompany these reversals. Yet their governments have responded with a trickle of increased aid, which gives new meaning to the phrase “too little, too late”, and a conservative approach to the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions. To be fair, the World Bank and IMF have demonstrated leadership. Commitments for the poorest countries under the bank’s International Development Association (IDA) rose by a fifth in 2021, to $36bn (£27bn). The IMF has scaled up its programmes, underwriting a surge in emergency financing, and providing $14bn in zero-interest loans to poor countries. The fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, navigated a new $650bn allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) – a central bank reserve asset – through the G20. None of which is enough. Financing from the World Bank and regional development banks will provide limited protection against the fiscal retrenchment now in prospect. IMF loans are short-term and must be repaid. Under current allocation rules, two-thirds of the new SDRs will be allocated to rich countries that don’t need them.
In effect, we are fighting an SDG forest fire with financial water pistols. The IMF estimates that low-income countries alone will need an additional $550bn to get back on an accelerated recovery pathway. Meanwhile, recession and human development reversals have increased the SDG financing gap by 70% to about $4.2tn, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – and that’s without the additional $1tn needed to finance a green energy transition in developing countries. The time has come to reimagine a development financing system. More could – and should – be done on aid. The UK’s retreat on that front, most recently in slashing support for the IDA, has been profoundly harmful. But aid cannot substitute an international public finance system aligned to the SDG ambition. The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) should be deployed far more aggressively. Less risk-averse approaches to capital adequacy and modest increases in finance would enable MDBs to triple their lending portfolios to more than $1.3tn, helping to unlock the private finance for a green recovery and deliver investment in global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness. In a period of low interest rates, this is a no-brainer. So why is the G20 endlessly reviewing options instead of acting? The new allocation of SDRs has opened up opportunities now at risk of being squandered. Rich countries do not need the $433bn in additional reserves bestowed on their central bank balance sheets through the IMF. Recycling the SDRs through multilateral banks or other mechanisms could provide developing countries with the liquidity and finance they need to support an SDG recovery and a green transition. Debt relief is critical. If there is one lesson from the 1980s, it is that delayed action on debt is the route to a lost decade of development. With IDA countries scheduled to pay $35bn in debt servicing this year, much of it to private creditors, there is an urgent need to convert unpayable debts into investments in health, education and safety nets. The IMF and World Bank should now be equipped to buy back unsustainable commercial debts at a hefty discount. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, once dismissed the argument that Britain had reached the limits of affordable social provision with a simple rejoinder: “Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” As an international community we can afford to deliver on the SDGs and prevent climate catastrophe. What we can’t afford is the alternative.

1636;1636;1636;1636;1655;1655;Chiefs v Bills: did we just witness the greatest two minutes in NFL history?;2022-01-24;['Melissa Jacobs'];['NFL', 'Green Bay Packers', 'Tampa Bay Buccaneers', 'Los Angeles Rams', 'Tennessee Titans', 'Cincinnati Bengals', 'San Francisco 49ers', 'Kansas City Chiefs', 'Buffalo Bills', 'US sports', 'Sport'];"Moments after Josh Allen’s 19-yard strike to Gabriel Davis deep in the fourth quarter, television crews cut to the quarterback’s family celebrating in a box at Arrowhead. The Bills led 36-33 and the champagne was about to be popped. Tears of joy streamed down Joel Allen’s face as he watched his son, who was having a perfect postseason, punch his ticket to the AFC Championship. Or so we thought. Then the Allen family had to sit through the most excruciating 13 seconds of their lives. CBS’s Tony Romo actually joked about the improbability of what was to come, “What can Patrick Mahomes do with 13 seconds left? Probably nothing. [Pause] But maybe something …” Maybe something was right because thanks to his immense skill and Buffalo’s inexplicably bad prevent defense, Mahomes had two quick completions, the first a 19-yard pass to Tyreek Hill, followed by a 25-yard dart to Travis Kelce. In marched Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to knock through a 49-yard field goal with no time in regulation remaining. 36-36.
Buffalo were stunned. Arrowhead was deafening. Kelce later explained how he and his quarterback freestyled on the completion: “I told [Mahomes] I’m probably not going to run the route that’s called and I was going to run to the open area. And in his cadence he was yelling to me, ‘Do it! Do it!” Again, the Bills coaching staff are going to have a lot of regrets when they evaluate film of those final 13 seconds. And Bills fans will wonder why the team didn’t try a squib kick after scoring their final touchdown, something that would have taken vital seconds off the clock (instead, Tyler Bass’s touchback saved the Chiefs valuable time). Butker’s field goal was the culmination of perhaps the most exhilarating two minutes the NFL has ever produced. Yes, there were bad defensive calls from both teams. But above all, it was Allen and Mahomes showing every inch of their talent and heart, the best v the best. In the two-minute span, there were three lead changes and a tie. Twenty-five points scored. The quarterbacks combined for 221 passing yards and three touchdowns in the same period. Bills wideout Gabriel Davis, until Sunday barely known outside Buffalo, became a household name – he finished the game with 201 receiving yards and four touchdowns, an NFL postseason record. Mahomes made magical throws from every angle. Allen did the same and picked up a litany of first downs using his legs.
Mahomes v Allen is now the most compelling quarterback rivalry in football and will be for years to come. Allen finished the day with 329 passing yards and four touchdowns, Mahomes with 378 passing yards and three touchdowns. Neither quarterback threw an interception. But it will be those final moments that will define this epic duel. To recap a two-minute span like no other: 1:54 remaining. Allen to Davis on a 27-yard touchdown (two-point conversion is good): Bills 29-26 Chiefs 1:02 remaining. Mahomes to Tyreek Hill on a 64-yard touchdown (extra point good): Bills 29-33 Chiefs 13 seconds remaining. Allen to Davis on a 19-yard touchdown (extra point good): Bills 36-33 Chiefs
0:00 remaining. Butker’s 49-yard field goal is good. Bills 36-36 Chiefs
Then there was overtime. If we learned anything from the final two minutes of regulation it was that the winner of the coin toss was marching down the field and winning the game. Kansas City got the ball and lo and behold, Mahomes led his teammates against an exhausted Bills defense, found Kelce in the end zone and voila, the Chiefs will host the AFC Championship for the fourth consecutive year. The NFL overtime rules, under which the team that receive the ball can win with a touchdown, will be under much scrutiny this offseason. It was a travesty to deprive Allen the opportunity to match Mahomes point for point just because a coin landed on the wrong side for the Bills. But that’s a debate for another day. For now we should sit back and thank the football gods for a phenomenal divisional weekend topped off by a Bills-Chiefs classic. How much longer do we have to wait for these two powerhouses – and these two brilliant quarterbacks – to meet in the playoffs again?
MVP of the week Matthew Stafford, quarterback, Los Angeles Rams. OK, this should be a joint one for Mahomes and Allen but it would be a shame not to discuss Sunday’s earlier game. Sean McVay wasn’t going down without a fight. The tide had taken a drastic turn for the Rams, who had let a 27-3 lead evaporate in the second half against Tom Brady and the Buccaneers. McVay’s playcalling was timid. There were fumbles and a high snap that went awry. Meanwhile, Brady was doing what he’s done so often. He was laser-focused on destroying the soul of his opponent. But with 35 seconds remaining, McVay wasn’t messing around. He dialled up consecutive Stafford passes to Cooper Kupp, first a 20-yarder followed by the nail-in-the-coffin, a perfectly placed 44-yard strike to Cupp who had blown by safety Antoine Winfield. Gay knocked through the 30-yarder to send Los Angeles back home to host the NFC Championship. Stafford, who was almost flawless in the first half, threw for 366 yards, knocked off the Super Bowl champs, and is headed back to LA where his team will host the NFC Championship against the 49ers.
Quote of the week “Lots of decisions to be made. I don’t want to be part of a rebuild if I’m going to keep playing” – Aaron Rodgers following Green Bay’s 13-10 loss to San Francisco. Rodgers’ season may have abruptly ended but that doesn’t mean we’ll get a break from nonstop chatter about where he goes from here.
Rodgers has his ticket out of Green Bay in the form of a restructured deal last summer that saves the team $20m if he’s traded before June 2022. The Packers are about to be $44m over the salary cap, leaving the future of many key players – including Davante Adams who will be a free agent and command a massive paycheck – in doubt. Despite the off-the-field distractions this season, Rodgers is still an elite quarterback whose departure would command high draft picks at the very least, and put the Packers in a strong position to rebuild. (Not to mention a notable reduction in stress.) But there’s also a disparity in success between the regular and postseason versions of Rodgers. That the 38-year-old Rodgers has only played in one Super Bowl at this point in his career is underachieving at its finest, from both the player and his team. Perhaps he’ll have better luck in Pittsburgh, Denver or New Orleans. Video of the week What an authentic moment of joy between Robbie Gould and Jimmy Garoppolo following the 49ers’ dramatic win at a snow-covered Lambeau Field. In the video, captured by NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales, Garoppolo called Gould “a fucking legend”. Hard to argue with the quarterback’s assessment given that Gould is now 20-for-20 on field goals in the postseason, including Saturday’s game-winner. Garoppolo also let out an audible curse directed at the Packers. The emotions were perhaps not surprising from a quarterback raised in Illinois and a kicker who played 11 seasons in Chicago.
Bonus video More ice from Gould:
Stat of the week 9. The Tennessee Titans pass rush was ready for its close-up, sacking Joe Burrow nine times. Defensive end Jeffery Simmons was unstoppable, collecting three sacks. Yet the Titans still lost 19-16. Racking up nine sacks in a playoff game and still losing is not an easy feat; in fact, the Titans are the first team since the 1970 merger to earn the honor. But when Ryan Tannehill throws an interception on his first pass of the game, his first of the second half, and his last of the season, it’s a scenario that starts making more sense. The Bengals weren’t exactly offensive juggernauts but the final 32 seconds was a masterclass in clutch. A Logan Wilson interception. A 19-yard pass from Burrow to Ja’Marr Chase that set up the game-winning field goal. Evan McPherson nailing the 52-yarder. It’s on to the AFC Championship for Cincinnati.
Elsewhere around the league • Tom Brady’s future will now take centerstage after an ESPN report suggested the 44-year-old is mulling his future. Brady was non-committal when asked about his future following the Bucs’ loss to the Rams on Sunday: “I haven’t put a lot of thought into it. I’ll just take it day by day. And we’ll see.” • Bengals defensive tackle DJ Reader had a spectacular performance shutting down Derrick Henry and the Titans rushing game all day. When he wasn’t creating space for the linebackers, he was making tackles of his own. After the game, Reader spoke about a recurring theme for his team whose motto has been Why Not Us. “We’ve been getting slept on the whole year. It’s something we take pride for in this locker room. We take it as disrespect every time.” • When San Francisco beat the Rams in a Week 18 thriller, SoFi Stadium looked and sounded like a 49ers home game. The Rams are trying to prevent a repeat in the NFC Championship game by restricting ticket sales. I’m sure no one will figure out a workaround.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/nfl-playoffs-bills-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-josh-allen-football;sports

What makes it extra special is the punchy herb-laced tahini dressing and the chicken fat and harissa flatbread croutons – it’s worth cooking it just for those. Serves 4 chicken breasts or thighs 800g, bone-in, skin-on olive oil 6 tbsp harissa 1 heaped tsp flatbreads 3, roughly torn into 2cm pieces cos lettuce 2 heads, torn into large pieces parsley leaves a handful coriander leaves a handful preserved lemons 2 small, rind only, finely chopped feta cheese 100g pitted black olives 100g For the dressing parsley a small handful, roughly chopped coriander a handful, roughly chopped garlic 1 clove, finely grated lemon juice of 1, or to taste tahini 40g extra virgin olive oil 40ml Greek yoghurt 2 tbsp Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large ovenproof cast-iron frying pan over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving for 8 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Turn the chicken and cook for another 8 minutes until it is browned on the other side. Remove the chicken with tongs and put on a plate. Add the harissa to the chicken fat and juices in the pan, along with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and swirl around so the harissa amalgamates with the oil. Toss the flatbread into the pan, tossing it through the juices. Put the chicken back in the pan and roast in the oven for 15 minutes until it is cooked through and the flatbread croutons are golden brown and crisp. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Place the parsley and coriander in a blender, along with the garlic, lemon juice and tahini, and whiz to a smooth paste. With the blender running, drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to a bowl and then fold in the yoghurt. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the lettuce, herbs and preserved lemon on a platter and dress with some of the green tahini dressing. Crumble over the feta and scatter with the olives. Drizzle over the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes, then slice it off the bone and place on top of the salad, along with the croutons. Serve with more dressing on the side.

1647;1647;1647;1647;1666;1666;‘Wisdom and incredible strength’: the exhibition showing the lives built by Holocaust survivors ;2022-01-24;['Nicholas Wroe'];['Photography', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Holocaust', 'Second world war', 'Judaism', 'Family', 'Life and style'];"The film and photographic images that emerged from the Holocaust, often in a blurrily dark monochrome, instantly became the visual definition of evil in the 20th century. So to set this brutal iconography against the cheerily crisp colours of modern English suburban homes in springtime – complete with armchairs, French doors on to patios, bright tulips in pots – might risk accusations of superficiality, or worse. But when the people in these apparently mundane locations are themselves survivors of the Holocaust, the sheer joyful fact of their existence becomes a triumphant rejoinder to the unimaginable cruelty and depravity of three-quarters of a century ago. The new images are collected together in Generations: Portraits of Holocaust Survivors, which opens later this week to coincide with world Holocaust day, at the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) gallery in Bristol after a showing at the Imperial War Museum in London. The exhibition was initially intended to run in 2020, to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps in 1945, and plans were made to photograph the 70 or so Holocaust survivors living in the UK. “Of course lockdown ensured that didn’t happen,” says the RPS project curator, Tracy Marshall-Grant. “Then in spring of last year, when things were looking a little more open, we tried again and it came together remarkably smoothly.” Marshall-Grant has invited fellows of the RPS – as well as its patron the Duchess of Cambridge, who, in an unexpected juxtaposition, shares wall space with the Sun’s longtime royal photographer Arthur Edwards – to capture the survivors at their homes, often surrounded by their families. “There was no uniform brief,” says Marshall-Grant. “All the photographers know what they are doing so I just asked them to treat it as one of their own projects. The result is fascinatingly diverse. There are some very traditional portraits but also things that look like they are out of glossy magazines. And the photographers often became close to their subjects and kept in touch. Sian Bonnell’s picture of Tomi Komoly – someone simply in their garden wearing their good clothes – has such a warm and personal feel that you wouldn’t be surprised if it was a family picture.” This family aspect cuts to the heart of the project. The survivors were young during the Holocaust and down the years have become parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. “Along with their families there have also been businesses and charity work and all the other elements of productive and useful lives,” says Marshall-Grant. “Here they are, products of the lives they have built. Of course the horrors of what they and so many others endured is always there, sometimes directly in these photographs in terms of personal effects from the time and so on. But ultimately it has been such a privilege to work with these people and with this material because what actually comes out of it is not only a sense of revulsion at what happened, but huge admiration and gratitude for the positive legacies that have been allowed to be passed on down the generations.” Family snapshots: pictures and stories from the Generations exhibition Sir Ben Helfgott (main picture, above) photographed by Frederic Aranda with his grandson Sam at his home in London, was born in Poland in 1929 and incarcerated in the Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps. After the war he came to the UK and became a weightlifter, representing Great Britain at the 1956 and 1960 Olympics. He was knighted in 2018 for his contribution to Holocaust education. “My experience may have hardened me, made me more realistic about human nature,” Helfgott has said, “but I was repelled by the evil I witnessed. I despaired but I did not let cruelty and injustice break my spirit.”
Dorothy Bohm (above) was living in Lithuania in 1939 when she was sent to the UK to escape the Nazis. She didn’t see her family again for 20 years. Bohm went on to become a leading photographer, was a co-founder of the Photographers’ Gallery and worked into her 90s. This was taken in her home in Hampstead where she talked to photographer Jillian Edelstein about her father. “Their separation during the war had been particularly painful,” says Edelstein. “We decided to use this photograph of him to commemorate that time and to have in the image, almost as a symbol of their survival.”
Tomi Komoly (above) lost many family members in the Holocaust. He came to the UK in 1956 as a refugee and had a long career in the chemical industry. Photographer Sian Bonnell wanted the image to share the “wisdom of his experience and his incredible strength”. In 2020 Komoly was awarded the British Empire Medal for his work telling the story of the Holocaust in schools, and his contribution to the fight against hate crime.

1652;1652;1652;1652;1671;1671;‘Stop nagging!’: Why China’s young adults are resisting marriage and babies;2022-01-24;['Vincent Ni'];['China', 'Population', 'Asia Pacific', 'Society', 'World news', 'Women'];"Early in January, China’s state news agency Xinhua posted a video reminding young Chinese men born in the year 2000 that they were eligible to get married. “Post 00s have reached legal marriage age,” it declared. The hashtag swiftly popped up in the top-searched list of Weibo hot topics, but many read it as the government’s attempt to put pressure on them. “Who dares to get married these days? Don’t we need to make money?” one questioned. “Stop nagging me!” said another. Under Chinese law, men can marry from 22 and women from 20. Young Chinese people’s mixed response to state media’s message came as the country faces what some analysts described as a “demographic timebomb”. Last week, China’s government reported its population growth rate had fallen to a 61-year low, with births barely outnumbering deaths in 2021, despite efforts to encourage Chinese couples to have babies in the last few years. “Young Chinese’s attitude towards marriage poses a big threat to Beijing’s effort to alter the looming demographic crisis,” said Dr Ye Liu, a senior lecturer at King’s College London’s Lau China Institute. “Coupled with a higher level of education and economic betterment, this will become a bigger headache in the years to come.” A growing number of young people across east Asian societies are delaying getting married as the region becomes more prosperous. Yet in urban China, this change has been especially swift, said Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine. Comparing Chinese census data in 1990 and 2015, Wang said that the share of never-married Chinese women in their late 20s had shot up by eight times in the span of 25 years. Census data from the years 2000 and 2010 show that college-educated young Chinese between the ages of 25 and 29 are most likely to be single. And women in developed Chinese cities, in particular, have fewer ambitions to get married. On social media and in daily life, the resistance to early marriage is strongly on display. In 2017, for example, a Shanghai-based chamber choir performance struck a chord with millions of young Chinese people facing the same dilemma across the country. The viral song Spring Festival Survival Guide – or What I Do Is For Your Own Good in English – told insisting Chinese parents: “My dear family, please just let me live my own life.” Vicky Liu, who is from northern Tianjin and was born in 1997, is one of those young Chinese. She said as soon as she graduated with a master’s in England last year, her parents began to arrange blind dates for her. “But I am an adult woman. I want a career and a good circle of friends. I just don’t want to be tied into a family life too soon.”
The attitude has alarmed the authorities further as the decline in population growth has become more evident in recent years. To reverse the trend, Beijing scrapped the decades-long one child policy in 2015, and last May it introduced a three-child policy. One economist, Ren Zeping, even suggested the government should print more money to fund a baby boom. Ren has been banned from posting on social media following this comment. But Ye Liu, of Kings College London, said that these policies are “masculine” and they are “disconnected” from the reality facing China’s generation Z today. “What they want is a better career future, an opportunity to have it all – career and family as well as self-fulfilment. Without these, it’s hard to convince them to have babies first,” she said. This is particularly the case with young Chinese women, she added. “Gen Z Chinese women have more education than previous generations. They are more likely to prioritise their career rather than get married after a university education.” Wang agreed and said that in reality, Chinese women were “severely under represented” in political and economic power. “China has a long way to go to create a more gender equitable society. But the difficulty here is that it is not achievable simply via the state issuing policy documents.” Yi Fuxian, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also the author of Big Country with an Empty Nest, said there were tangible measures the government could take to assuage the situation. “For example, job opportunities for young Chinese and help with the cost of living – in particular, the cost of property. The government should also make it easier for young couples to raise children.” For Vicky Liu, there is more to it. “[My parents’] logic is that as a woman I don’t have too long to find an ideal husband. For them, I have to get married, be pregnant and become a mother as soon as possible. Chinese parents simply won’t accept their daughters remaining single for too long.” With assistance from Xiaoqian Zhu";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-generation-z-resisting-marriage-and-babies;environment
1668;1668;1668;1668;1688;1688;What does Australia’s removal from the European Council’s travel ‘white list’ mean?;2022-01-24;['Calla Wahlquist'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Australian immigration and asylum'];"The European Council has removed Australia from the “white list”, a register of countries from which it recommends travel restrictions should be lifted. The council’s list of epidemiologically-safe third countries is non-binding and countries within the European Union are able to set their own border requirements, which may involve quarantine or testing requirements. What did the European Council decide? The European Council said on 17 January it had updated its list of countries for which travel restrictions should be lifted, and removed Argentina, Australia and Canada. The decision is non-binding on European Union member states and reviewed every two weeks. Under the criteria used by the European Council, all restrictions on travellers from a third country can be lifted if the rate of Covid-19 infections in the past 14 days is less than 75 in 100,000.
The criteria also states that if countries accept proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions such as testing or quarantine requirements, they should in principle lift restrictions on travel for all double-dosed international travellers. This decision to remove Australia from the list was made in the 14 days in which Australia’s daily Covid numbers shot up from 30,000 to more than 100,000. In the past week, Australia has averaged 274 cases per 100,000, a 20% drop on the previous seven days. The European Council criteria also includes an “emergency brake mechanism”. It states: “Where the epidemiological situation of a third country or region worsens quickly, in particular if a variant of concern or of interest has been detected, member states should adopt an urgent, temporary restriction on all travel into the EU”. At the moment, the list of countries for which European countries are recommended to allow not-restricted travel is: Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, and China, subject to confirmation of reciprocity. What does that mean for Australians planning to travel to Europe? The chief executive of Flight Centre, Graham Turner, says the removal of Australia from the EU white list will have “minimal effect on vaccinated Australians travelling to Europe”. “Each EU country has their own protocols and if you are vaccinated most do not require pre-departure testing and isolation at arrival,” he said. “I believe the indications are that within three to six weeks Australians will be able to fly to North America and UK/Europe without pre-departure tests and tourists will be able to fly here under the same conditions.” Cyprus, Greece and Italy have already said they will not restrict travellers from Australia. Germany, meanwhile, has listed Australia as a high-risk area since 9 January, but quarantine-free travel is still allowed for fully-vaccinated Australians who test negative after arrival. Does this affect travel to the United Kingdom? No. The United Kingdom is currently open to quarantine-free travel from all countries. If you are fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine and have a vaccine certificate, you are required to book and pay for a Covid-19 test before getting on your flight to be taken within 48 hours of your arrival in the UK.

1669;1669;1669;1669;1689;1689;China sends largest incursion of warplanes into Taiwan defence zone since October;2022-01-24;['Helen Davidson'];['China', 'Taiwan', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"China’s air force flew 39 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Sunday, the largest daily number since record-breaking incursions in October. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defence said it had tasked aircraft in response, issued radio warnings to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pilots and deployed missile defence systems to monitor the activity. In recent years the PLA has ratcheted up its incursions, which it says are training drills, to near daily frequency. Over four days in October nearly 150 planes were dispatched, breaking previous records and coinciding with China’s National Day, a key patriotic holiday.
Sunday’s sorties into the Taiwan Strait included 34 fighter jets, one bomber, two electronic warfare planes and two intelligence-gathering planes. They flew near the disputed Pratas Islands and close to the edge of the median line, an unofficial border of set length through the Strait between Taiwan’s main island and China. Longstanding tacit agreement over the marker appeared to be thrown out by China in 2020, when a foreign ministry spokesperson said there was no such thing. No Chinese missions crossed the line between its declaration in 1955 by US military figures and 1999, and remained rare in the years after. In September 2020 Taiwan accused China of flying dozens of planes across the line after a visit by senior US official Keith Krach. On Sunday the Financial Times reported China had established a permanent presence of at least one warship in the waters between Japan’s southern islands and Taiwan for the last six months, the first time it has done so on the eastern side of the islands between it and the Pacific. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a province of China, and has not ruled out taking it by force. The PLA flights into the Strait are grey-zone tactics – war-adjacent strategies which do not meet the threshold of combat – which are thought to be designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear out its military by forcing constant responses. Taiwan, which is a self-governing democracy with open elections and free press, maintains it is a sovereign nation. In response to Beijing’s threats it is strengthening its military with assistance and weapons purchases from the US, but faces challenges. Earlier this month it suspended combat training for its F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the plane crashed into the sea, presumably killing the pilot, whose body has not been found.
The Chinese planes did not fly into Taiwan’s sovereign airspace on Sunday, which would represent a significant hostile act. The ADIZ is a self-declared airspace which Taiwan’s government monitors for defence purposes. China’s military did not give a reason for the missions on Sunday, but it came days after a US warship conducted a freedom of navigation exercise near the disputed Paracel Islands. US and Japanese naval forces were also conducting exercises in the Philippines Sea over the weekend, which the US Pacific Fleet said included two carrier strike groups “conducting training to preserve and protect a free and open Indo Pacific”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-sends-largest-incursion-of-warplanes-into-taiwan-defence-zone-since-october;politics
1674;1674;1674;1674;1694;1694;Port in a storm: the trailblazing town welcoming climate refugees in Bangladesh;2022-01-24;['Kaamil Ahmed', 'Isabel Choat'];['Global development', 'Internally displaced people', 'Flooding', 'Bangladesh', 'Climate crisis', 'Refugees', 'Environment', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"By the time the rising sun breaks through the morning mist over the Mongla River, the rhythmic chug of motors strapped to wooden canoes is already audible as thousands of workers are hurriedly ferried across the waterway. They jump on to the small landing dock, pick up a potato-stuffed shingara pastry for pennies and rush towards the factories in Mongla’s export processing zone (EPZ), which has transformed the small town into an employment hub in a part of Bangladesh ravaged by the climate crisis. About 30 miles (50km) inland from the Bay of Bengal, Mongla is the gateway to the Unesco-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest, home to the endangered Bengal tiger. Its port, founded in the 1950s, has been the focus of an ambitious, decade-long project led by one of the world’s leading climate scientists to transform it into a town that actively welcomes climate refugees.
“In my 30 years here I’ve seen so many changes. The roads, the docks, the number of people coming here. It has all changed,” says Abdul Jalil, a 52-year-old boatman on the Mongla River. “We used to have a lot of problems; after rains the roads would be flooded, we had very little infrastructure around here.” He used to row manually but says all the boats have motors now, with each carrying about 700 people a day across the river, on their way to work in the export zone or in Sundarbans tourism. “These people crossing, they’re all from other places, from the villages near the Sundarbans. They work here in the EPZ, for tourism in the Sundarbans, instead of going to places like Chittagong. It’s safer here, there isn’t crime, there are jobs and the living standards are better.” Bangladesh is an internal migration pressure cooker. There is nothing new in the country’s rural poor moving to cities in search of work. But catastrophic weather events are speeding up the waves of people flowing into the urban centres. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 4.1 million people (2.5% of the population) were displaced in Bangladesh as a result of climate-induced disasters as of 2019. A recent World Bank report predicted that the country will have 19.9 million internal climate refugees by 2050, almost half the projected number for the entire south Asia region.
Most of those forced to leave their homes head to the capital, Dhaka, one of the fastest growing megacities in the world and among the least liveable. Home to 20 million people, over a third of whom live in slums lacking even the most basic infrastructure, the city is dangerously overcrowded. Against this grim backdrop of daily struggles and looming catastrophe, Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), has formulated a vision of “transformative adaptation” to alleviate pressure on Dhaka and its conurbations. It aims to divert people to smaller urban centres with the capacity to expand and, crucially, jobs to sustain a rapidly growing workforce.
“The phenomenon of migration is age old – there’s nothing new here – but climate change is causing people to move and we are having to deal with this very, very quickly – that is what made us work on the idea,” says Huq. More than a dozen satellite cities and towns, all adjacent to economic hubs such as sea and river ports or export processing zones, have been identified as potential migrant-friendly locations. “They are all secondary towns with populations of between a few hundred thousand and half a million which can absorb up to half a million climate migrants each,” says Huq. Among those towns, Mongla stood out for the progress it had already made on climate breakdown mitigation, driven by the town’s dynamic mayor, Zulfikar Ali. In his 10 years in office, from 2011 to 2021, an array of infrastructural developments made Mongla a safer, more resilient town.
They include a 7-mile raised embankment along newly built Marine Drive designed to protect against flooding; two flood-control gates; an improved drainage system; two 40 hectare (100 acre) reservoirs and a fresh water treatment plant that has increased the proportion of houses with running water from a third to a half. Sheikh Abdur Rahman, who took over from Ali as mayor of Mongla in January 2021, has picked up the baton. “At one time the city was regularly flooded by high tides. Now it is being brought under climate-friendly city planning,” he says. A public address system was installed to announce changes in weather to the community.
The town’s proximity to the second largest port in Bangladesh and an export processing zone that already employs 8,000 people also made it economically attractive, says Huq. “The primary carrot [in luring people to a town] is jobs,” he says. “But that’s the easy part.” The challenge, he says, is the “softer interventions”, the social and cultural changes required to bring about his vision of a network of towns whose existing residents welcome newcomers. “Hostility between host and migrant happens everywhere,” says Huq. “In Bangladesh, we have several big advantages – one is that we look the same so migrants are not distinguishable; second, there is one language – we all speak Bangla; and third, we all have the same religion. What we do have is a class barrier, so the newcomer is a poor person eking out a living – and that is what we are working on, humanising what is initially seen as ‘other’.”
These softer interventions include making sure the children of migrants are well integrated in schools and encouraging them to go on to university to break the cycle of poverty. These may be relatively modest aims on paper but they require buy-in from educational institutions. Huq and his team have spent time talking to schools and universities to gain their support for the concept. Mongla’s population was below 40,000 in the 2011 census but a decade later three times as many people are thought to be living there. Huq’s mission to actively encourage migration to the town is likely to swell that figure by tens, possibly hundreds of thousands more.
Mongla is the first town to adopt ICCCAD’s recommendations, but others will follow. “This is a 10-year action programme and we are taking it town by town, mayor by mayor,” says Huq. Over time, towns will set up outposts in the coastal areas and villages where the majority of climate migrants come from. Huq envisages these outposts as mini embassies that will act as information hubs for migrants, steering them away from Dhaka and towards host towns that are better equipped to cope with an expanding population, and where migrants can be fully fledged, as opposed to second-class, citizens. It is early days in a long-term process that has been hampered by Covid and the UK government cutting the aid which was funding the research, but Huq is confident that Mongla and its sister towns will become models of disaster management, adaptation and resilience.

1677;1677;1677;1677;1697;1697;‘I stayed at the party too long’: Ozark’s Jason Bateman on Arrested Development, smiling villains and his lost decade;2022-01-24;['Zoe Williams'];['Television', 'Jason Bateman', 'Film', 'Television & radio', 'Arrested Development', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'US television'];"Jason Bateman appears on a Zoom screen from Los Angeles, bespectacled, calm and in uncluttered, butter-coloured environs. It’s as if Michael Bluth, the character he played in Arrested Development, had dressed up as a therapist for some hilarious purpose. To fans of the show, its entire cast will always have traces clinging to them, as if they have all been, well, arrested in that dysfunctional family. But today we’re here to talk about Ozark, a drama with a reputation that has been climbing each season (it’s now in its fourth and final) and so has, arguably, become even more defining for Bateman. Tense and lingering, Ozark has the dizzying pace and visual sumptuousness that the modern long-running box set demands. What was haunting about it from the start were the subtle performances of Bateman and his co-star, Laura Linney; just a regular, affluent, middle-aged couple, except he was about to launder $500m for a drug cartel and she’d just watched the murder of the lawyer she was having an affair with. They were on the run, but only sort of. They hated each other, except they didn’t. What passed between them gave such propulsive energy to their characters that from the very beginning you could trust one thing: it might be improbable, but it was never going to be boring. But all that nuance was a double-edged sword. “Marty and Wendy are really intelligent characters,” Bateman says. “Sometimes that narrows your options as a writer, trying to keep things plausible. They can’t do really stupid things. The smart thing to do is to turn yourself in. Then the show’s over.” Typically (although not this time, because of Covid) Bateman would direct the first two episodes of each season. He starts off describing the appeal of being an actor/director quite neutrally. “It’s more efficient for me to be playing a character in something, because that’s one less person I need to direct,” he says. “I don’t have to have any sort of creative negotiation with that actor.” Then he slides into the territory of the self-aware control freak: “Especially when I’m the lead character, I can just adjust my own performance to motivate a different performance out of the other actor. I can get them to speed up or slow down or trick them by being more emotional.” Finally, he clarifies forcefully and winningly, he’s not a control freak at all. “I had a very fortunate first experience. My first big job, Little House on the Prairie, had Michael Landon as the director, actor, producer – and sometimes writer. There’s this theory that you need to scream at people to get them to work their hardest. I saw by example there that the opposite is true.”
It’s pointless of course to pretend not to have been a child star if you were one, but it also takes a certain kind of comfort in your skin to underline immediately how incredibly long your career has been. Little House on the Prairie first aired in 1974. Bateman didn’t join the cast until the early 80s. His career dates officially from a Golden Grahams advert in 1980, when he was just 11 (he’s now 53). He talks about his mother – a Pan Am flight attendant, originally from the UK – a lot. If something is hilarious to him, it’s because “my mother is British and everything is dry to her”. His father would be the more obvious role model in professional terms. Kent Bateman was an actor, writer and director, and the producer of the 1987 fantasy comedy sequel Teen Wolf Too, the lead role that sealed his son’s teen-idol status as mischievous, unthreatening and very 80s. Bateman became a complete sitcom fixture in titles that are familiar to US viewers but less so in the UK (TV didn’t travel so much then). Silver Spoons, the Hogan Family, “these shows in front of a live audience, where there’s a performance type of obligation: you’re incorporating their laughter, it’s more like being on stage”. Inevitably, trying to make the transition from child to adult, while simultaneously trying to morph for audiences from cute kid to serious actor, was fraught. He describes the 90s as effectively wilderness years, while robustly objecting to the term “wilderness years”. “It was a combination,” he says. “Me stopping everything on purpose, to catch up with all these inabilities I had as a kid, because I was always working.” (“Inabilities” is a curious word – he’s saying his early career meant he missed out on a carefree childhood and teenage years, trying not to offend his parents, perhaps.) “I wanted to get the wiggles out.”
He has described in the past how his wife, Amanda Anka, also an actor and mother of their two daughters, Francesca and Maple, gave him an ultimatum about his partying. It’s such an imprecise term, “partying” – it can mean anything from too many beers to a heroin habit, but it’s nothing like as imprecise as “wiggles”. He has been less oblique in the past, describing all-night booze and drug binges (“It’s like French fries and ketchup – I don’t want one without the other”) before he finally decided to go into AA. Information, it seems, is often sprinkled, rather than hosed, with Bateman. Later, talking about Smartless, the podcast he started in 2020 with Will Arnett (a magnificent comedian and ex-alcoholic, who played Gob in Arrested Development), he says: “Will started everything by saying, ‘Who’s gonna listen to some boring thing about sobriety?’ And I said: ‘At least let me be on it, so we can talk about sobriety and “the journey”.’” When Smartless arrived, also featuring Sean Hayes (from Will & Grace), it was nothing really to do with partying, it was all about friendship. It’s also absolutely stop-in-the-street-to-laugh brilliant. Back to the lost decade. “Having thought, ‘This is really fun,’ and staying at the party a little bit too long, I’d lost my place in line in the business; it was a case of trying to claw that back towards the end of the 90s, and not getting a lot of great responses.” The official end of that dry spell was Arrested Development, which first aired in 2003, but also, Juno, in 2007, a fascinating indie film about a teenager who gets accidentally pregnant and agrees to have the baby adopted. It’s quite an uncomfortable movie, seen, at the time, as implicitly anti-abortion, and deliberately vague and airbrushed on what the experience of giving a baby up for adoption is actually like. But the characterisation is complex and interesting, in large part because of Bateman’s prospective adoptive dad, reversing and messing with expectations. He starts out as something you think you understand – a wholesome everyman – then becomes a much darker character, on whom the coating of nice-guy shellac shimmers somewhere between shtick and active deception. It’s not a huge role but is a perfect distillation of Bateman’s mature performances; the guy who uses his everyman face like a Trojan horse. He says he likes to play characters as “not too far from the average person. Even if the part is not right in that lane, but maybe adjacent to it, I will pull the character into that. Even if they’re not vanilla on the page, I like pulling them into vanilla.” He has said before that he only took the role in Juno because Francesca, recently born, had colic, and it was a guaranteed three weeks out of the house. “No, no, no,” he now says, disapprovingly. “I said that to be fun. I said it with, hopefully, an obvious wink.” There he goes again, pulling himself back into vanilla. To rewind to Arrested Development: it started at Fox and was an immediate success, winning five Emmys for the first season. It was cancelled, because Fox is crazy. The first three seasons were breathtakingly good – and surprising. The way each actor was so distinct and yet so locked together in the ensemble, the sheer quality of the cast – Jeffrey Tambor and the late Jessica Walter as the parents, Bateman, Arnett, Portia de Rossi and Tony Hale as their adult children – was remarkable. Bateman is very clear about what made it funny: “This is not funny to anybody inside the show. This is a drama to them. Almost like an animal documentary, where you’re watching these freaks, and how they gather their food, and how they make their house. And let’s make sure we all whisper because we don’t want these folks to know how much we’re laughing at them.”
Having been dropped, it was picked up six years later by Netflix, back when the streaming behemoth had no real track record of programme-making, except for David Fincher’s House of Cards. “What’s good for David Fincher sure as shit better be good enough for us,” is how Bateman describes the united attitude of the cast. There were plenty of people queueing up to say it wasn’t as good at Netflix, and truthfully, the fourth season wasn’t. Critically, the reception went up and down – at its putative worst, it’s still funnier than most things – and career-wise, he says: “I will always respect the access and relevance that that show gave me, and try not to take that for granted again, and do everything I can to earn this place in the business that I love. It created an environment; I loved going there every single day.” This is surprising, since if Arrested Development is famous for one thing, other than itself, it’s for a terrible atmosphere on set. Or at least, that was the story in a New York Times cast interview in 2018. Walter, who died in March last year, said of Tambor: “In almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.” Bateman and Hale tried to damp down the situation, and the whole thing – particularly coming when it did, when the lid was just being lifted on Hollywood harassment, sexual or otherwise – saw them accused of minimising. Bateman remains adamant about his original stance and says of that interview: “Things got misinterpreted and there was a fallout – it was unfortunate. But it was an anomaly. Any family work environment, you’re going to have situations where things go a little pear-shaped every once in a while. I just have the fondest memories of 100% of that experience. You know, the ups and the downs, the good, the bad, the funny, the sad: all of it was a positive to me.” There’s a lively internet chat scene on the similarities between Marty Byrde in Ozark and Michael Bluth in Arrested Development – that they are morally so alike, Ozark must have been (consciously or not) conceived as a prequel to Arrested Development. In this fan-fictional universe, Michael is actually Marty post-witness protection scheme. I disagree with that. Part of the genius of Bateman’s Arrested Development performance is how completely, learning-resistantly hapless he is, while as Byrde he can see round corners and get the better of any situation. He doesn’t really want to adjudicate on this question and ruin any fan debates, so says mildly: “I think they have similar blind spots. Their arrogance and hubris leads to early decisions. Perhaps they should think a little bit longer about what they do.” If there’s another through-line, Bateman says, it’s that: “I’m not too far removed from a drama when I’m doing Arrested Development and I’m not too far from a comedy when I’m doing Ozark.” He reaches to describe some quintessence to his acting another way: “In a drama, I’m not the person with a knife, I’m the person getting chased. In a comedy, I’m not the person farting, I’m the person who smelled it.” It’s so neat, so succinct, and so drolly sums up the paradox: it’s actually terribly rare to meet an everyman, almost unique to meet one who’s everymanning on purpose. Ozark is available to stream on Netflix.

Sixty-two residents of the remote Mango Island have had to relocate to nearby Nomuka Island after losing their homes and belongings, and the government warned they may have to relocate again to the main island due to food and water shortages. The government also released the names of the two Tongan nationals who died in the tsunami: Lataimaumi Lauaki, a 49-year-old woman from Nomuka; and Telai Tutu’ila, a 65-year-old man from Mango Island. They were buried in the days after the disaster.
As well as the three fatalities, which included 50-year-old British woman Angela Glover, several people had been injured, the government said, including one person on Ha’apai who required emergency medical treatment, eight injuries on Nomuka Island, four minor injuries on Fonoi Island and two minor injuries on Tungua Island. A field hospital was set up on Nomuka, where the tsunami washed away the health centre.
The government said communication between the islands, which was cut off when the eruption damaged the undersea communications cable, was “an acute challenge”, though some international calls were now possible. “A New Zealand relief flight arrived with much-needed telecommunications equipment to re-establish limited internet connection,” the statement said. The vessel that will attempt to repair the undersea communications cable, severed by the eruption and tsunami, is expected to reach Tonga “in the next few days”, the government said. “Although there has been no further volcanic activity, challenges to sea transportation remain as fallout on the surface of the ocean is causing damage to the vessels.”
The National Emergency Operations Centre said water was their main request and they had distributed nearly 60,000 litres already. But the government said “water supplies have been tested: groundwater and clean water are safe to drink”. Bulk water supplies and relief stores, donated from New Zealand, arrived last week, with more due to arrive from Australia early this week onboard the HMAS Adelaide. Support has also been pledged from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Japan and China. “His Majesty’s government is deeply appreciative to the international community for their generous and timely assistance in response to this unprecedented event,” the Tongan government said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/tonga-volcano-84-of-population-affected-by-ashfall-and-tsunami;environment
1706;1706;1706;1706;1726;1726;‘I can’t sit on the bench’: Sam Billings targets regular England role;2022-01-23;['Simon Burnton'];['England cricket team', 'Kent', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Sam Billings knows exactly when he was last at home, though the memory is increasingly distant. It was 20 September 2021, two days after he captained Kent to victory in the Vitality Blast. “After that I went Indian Premier League, World Cup, holiday in the Maldives for a week where I got engaged to my other half, Sarah – I haven’t seen her since – and then Big Bash, then Test match, then here.” These have been four whirlwind months, culminating most recently in a nine-hour, 820km drive from his BBL assignment on Australia’s Gold Coast to join England’s Ashes squad in Tasmania for his Test debut, followed a few days later by a marathon journey to join the Twenty20 side in Barbados via stop-offs in Sydney, Los Angeles and Miami. “I’ve tried to work out how long the journey took about four times,” he says. “The amazing thing was I took off at 11am on the 18th and I landed in LA at 8am the same day. I’d been on a plane for 15 hours. I don’t know what day it is. It’s just great to be here.”
What is particularly remarkable, given how much time he spends on international commitments, is how little international cricket Billings has played. England’s shambolic defeat to West Indies in the first of five T20s on Saturday night was the 30-year-old’s 60th international appearance in all formats, spread across – excluding one-off matches – 30 different series and nearly seven years. He has constantly been asked to score runs without ever being given one. “Being the age I am now, I’ve got a really good idea of where my game’s at, and what I need to do to be ready,” he says. “The franchise world, I know it’s spoken about really badly by some people but actually it teaches you as a player to be self-sufficient. You work out pretty quickly that you can’t have everything you want, and you have to figure out what you need to get yourself ready to perform in a very short space of time.” But there has not been a great deal of consistency in his recent international outings, either of selection or output: after Saturday night Billings’ past five international innings had come in three different formats across seven months, and he had scored one, two, two, three and 29. But he arrived here buoyed by his performances in the BBL, where he averaged 40.57 in nine matches.
“This is a really interesting time for me as a cricketer,” he says. “I feel like I’m playing my best cricket and moving forward I’ve just got to play. I can’t sit on the bench. I’ve done enough time doing that. I’ve been in and around the different environments and been a great squad player and actually done pretty well when I’ve stepped in, but clarity is a huge thing for me moving forward. “With the [Sydney] Thunder, you know you’re going to play this number of games, you know your role, you know you’re a senior player, and you get backed. And after a bit of backing, in terms of a run of games, I back myself to perform every single time. I think it’s the toughest thing to do, coming in and out of a squad. That’s why I was so forthright in saying I’d love to get out to the West Indies, because this is a run of games for me, something I’ve waited for.”
He had to be similarly patient for a chance to play Test cricket before injuries to England’s first- and second-choice wicketkeepers opened a way into the team in Hobart. But unlike some England players Billings will feature in the Indian Premier League auction instead of opting to rest and focus on a red-ball summer. “I really want to give Tests a real good crack,” he says. “I suppose the challenge comes from a clarity point of view. I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not centrally contracted, I’ve never been centrally contracted, so it’s very hard to get that clarity as a player. I think central contracts give you real clarity to schedule what you can do for the year. I’ve never had that. Guys like myself, we have to keep our options open.” The next round of central contracts will be announced in October. Until then Billings will remain on standby, options open – and passport at the ready.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/sam-billings-targets-regular-england-role-cricket;sports
1708;1708;1708;1708;1729;1729;US vows ‘swift, severe and united response’ if Russia invades Ukraine;2022-01-23;['Richard Luscombe'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Biden administration', 'US foreign policy', 'US national security', 'US military', 'US news', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Europe', 'Nato', 'World news'];"The US and its allies will deliver a “swift, severe and united response” if Russia invades Ukraine, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned on Sunday amid rising tensions.
The top US diplomat’s comments came as Russia continued its military build-up on the Ukraine border and Britain said it had exposed evidence of a plot by Vladimir Putin to install a pro-Moscow government in Kyiv. The Russian president, Blinken said, must choose between the “preferred path of diplomacy and dialogue” or “Russian aggression and massive consequences”. The US, Nato, and Europe stood ready to deal with any eventuality, he said. “We’ve been very clear that if there is any further Russian aggression in terms of sending Russian forces into Ukraine, there will be a swift, severe and united response from the United States and Europe,” Blinken told CBS’s Face the Nation, echoing the message he said he delivered to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in “frank and substantive” talks in Geneva last week. “We’ve been equally clear that Russia engages in other tactics short of sending forces into Ukraine, or other countries, hybrid actions, cyber attacks, efforts to bring the government down. There, too, I’m confident based on the many consultations I’ve had with European allies and partners that there will be a swift, calibrated and also united response.” Blinken would not say if that response included committing US forces, but told CNN’s State of the Union the alliance was looking at “very practical and important measures”, including military options. “One thing we’ve been clear about, besides the massive economic, financial consequences that would befall Russia if it makes further aggression against Ukraine, is the ongoing, continued build-up of defense capacity in Ukraine and, equally, continuing to build up Nato’s defensive capabilities, including on the so-called eastern flank, the countries near Russia. “A single additional Russian force” going into Ukraine would trigger a response, Blinken said. “We’re looking at every single scenario, preparing for every single one.” His comments came as the state department ordered the families of all American personnel at the US embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion. On Sunday the department told the dependents of staffers at the US embassy in Kyiv that they must leave the country. It also said that non-essential embassy staff could leave Ukraine at government expense. State department officials stressed the Kyiv embassy will remain open and that the announcement does not constitute an evacuation. With an estimated 125,000 Russian troops at or close to the Ukraine border, western allies have scrambled to bolster military assets in the region. About 90 tons of US equipment arrived in Ukraine this weekend, part of a $200m package of “lethal aid” approved by Joe Biden last month. The UK has sent anti-tank weaponry and personnel to help train Ukraine forces.
The Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are among nations sending or promising aid, although questions remain over the strength of the alliance and last week’s insistence by White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that Nato’s 30 member states were “speaking with one voice”. Germany has refused to send weapons, saying it would be “unhelpful” and that Berlin would instead contribute medical resources. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukraine minister of foreign affairs, responded in a tweet that the result of Germany’s position was to “undermine unity and encourage Vladimir Putin to a new attack on Ukraine”. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Blinken was dismissive. “I sat with Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz just last week for an hour and listened very carefully to him. I’ve been on the phone and saw my own German counterpart, foreign minister [Annalena] Baerbock, and I can tell you that the Germans very much share our concerns, and are resolute and determined to respond swiftly, effectively and in a united way. I have no doubts about that.” Blinken also rebuffed calls from critics, voiced on Sunday by the Iowa Republican Joni Ernst, that the US should impose sanctions on Russia before any invasion took place. “We need to show strength and not be in a position of a doctrine of appeasement, which seems to be how President Biden has worked his administration,” Ernst, a member of the Senate committee on armed services, told CNN. Blinken said preemptive sanctions would weaken the allies’ position. “The purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression. So if they’re triggered now you lose the deterrent effect,” he said. “All of the things that we’re doing, including building up in a united way with Europe massive consequences for Russia, is designed to factor into President Putin’s calculus and to deter and dissuade him from taking aggressive action, even as we pursue diplomacy at the same time.”
Support for Blinken came from an unexpected quarter, his immediate predecessor as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, praising a “stronger statement” than that from Biden this week.
“I hope they’re serious about this,” the Trump loyalist told Fox News Sunday. “I hope they’re prepared not only to speak about this, and that they have a plan, but they have an execution matrix that sits underneath that so that they are prepared to actually do this in real time. “It doesn’t take days of meetings and discussions with allies and friends to plan to execute a response commensurate with the activity the Russians take.” Pompeo also criticized Biden’s efforts to clarify comments this week that a “minor incursion” by Russia would provoke a lesser response. The president later said any “assembled Russian units” moving across the border would be viewed as an invasion. Striking a note familiar in rightwing US circles, Pompeo also had praise for Putin. Under Trump, he said, “we had respect for him and his power. He’s a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. We should respect that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/blinken-swift-severe-united-response-russia-invades-ukraine-biden-putin-pompeo;politics
1766;1766;1766;1766;1787;1787;Nusrat Ghani: a Muslim pioneer who was unexpectedly sacked;2022-01-23;['Maya Wolfe-Robinson'];['Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Birmingham', 'Race'];"Nusrat Ghani has been first many times. She was the first Muslim female minister to speak from the Commons dispatch box, the first Muslim woman elected as a Tory MP in 2015, the first woman to represent the Conservative stronghold of Wealden, East Sussex and has said she was the first woman in her family to attend university. Born in Kashmir to Pakistani parents, Ghani, 49, grew up in Birmingham before studying at Birmingham City University and Leeds. She worked in an investment bank, charities and the BBC World Service before an unsuccessful attempt at election in 2010 for the seat of Birmingham Ladywood. Ghani was appointed a member of the home affairs select committee in 2015 and backed Brexit in the EU referendum in 2016. She was promoted to assistant whip and transport minister in 2018 under Theresa May, which the former transport secretary Chris Grayling said at the time showed the Conservatives “were a party of opportunity”.
Ghani wrote on her website: “A century after women got the vote for the first time, I hope that today young people can see that regardless of their background, faith, race, gender or sexuality, there will be a warm welcome on the green benches, and no matter where you are from you can achieve your dreams and ambitions.” While a minister, Ghani revealed she had been bombarded with emails from a Conservative activist and constituent praising Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and questioning whether immigrants should be allowed to stand for parliament. She has also detailed an “incredibly draining” ordeal where she was stalked for two years by a man she said eventually made clear that he had targeted her because she was a female MP, Asian and a Muslim. In February 2020, Ghani was replaced by Kelly Tolhurst in a reshuffle. The Guardian reported that Ghani had been widely tipped for a job overseeing HS2 but was sacked without explanation. A few months later, the former minister said ethnic minorities had “had enough of warm words and zero action” from the government. Following Boris Johnson’s announcement of a commission on racial inequality, Ghani said on Twitter that the prime minister needed to “crack on with real practical solutions”. Ghani is a steering committee member of the Covid Recovery Group, a group of Tory MPs who have opposed lockdown measures.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/nusrat-ghani-a-muslim-pioneer-who-was-unexpectedly-sacked;politics

1780;1780;1780;1780;1801;1801;Severe shortage of nurses in UK children’s intensive care units;2022-01-23;['Denis Campbell'];"[""Children's health"", 'NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Nursing', 'Health', 'Children', 'Society', 'UK news']";"Britain’s sickest children are being treated in intensive care units that are struggling with severe shortages of the specialist nurses needed to look after them, a report says. The shortages in the UK’s 30 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are so severe that healthcare assistants are covering the work of nurses in an attempt to ensure that staffing levels are maintained. Only one of the PICUs – at the James Cook University hospital in Middlesbrough – was found to have enough nurses to guarantee the standards of care expected. About 15,000 children and young people a year, often with life-threatening conditions, are cared for in PICUs. Clinical standards that prevail in PICUs require them to ensure that seven nurses are on duty for each bed in a 24-hour cycle. However, the report by the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet), a group of experts from Leicester and Leeds universities, found that 29 of the 30 had too few nurses to do that, and that all 30 had vacancies, sometimes large numbers of them. “Parents will find this extremely alarming”, said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s England director. “Most people wouldn’t believe that only one paediatric intensive care unit across the whole UK has enough staff to function properly, but this is the reality of the workforce crisis. Key roles in specialist nursing teams are lying vacant for years.” The PICANet team identified nurses’ salaries and the cost of living in urban areas as key reasons. It found that three of the five hospitals with the lowest number of PICU nurses were in London: the Portland private hospital and Royal Brompton and Royal London NHS hospitals. Oxford’s John Radcliffe and Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children were the others.
“The nursing shortage is crippling,” one paediatric intensive care doctor in London told the Guardian. “It means that we are routinely cancelling elective surgery that requires a PICU bed. Literally every single hospital in London with a PICU has had to do that recently.” The post-Brexit loss of PICU nurses from EU countries such as Spain and Portugal has exacerbated the situation. A leaked NHS memo about three London hospitals shows that on 12 December there were just nine nurses on duty to look after 12 children in the PICU at King’s College hospital, seven to care for 11 young people at St George’s hospital, and 19 to look after 18 patients at Evelina children’s hospital. “Clearly [the nurse-to-patient staffing] ratio isn’t being provided, so yes, kids are getting substandard care.” A second paediatric intensive care doctor said: “The shortage of PICU nurses is awful. Healthcare assistants can be very good. But their main strength is in soft skills stuff, like being a shoulder to cry on. But they can’t set up a renal haemodialysis machine or calibrate a ventilator for a child who is on oxygen, for example. Only a nurse can do that. “Units try to stretch a smaller number of nurses to look after more patients. You try to deliver the same level of care with a lower number of staff, which is a patient safety issue,” he added.
Carli Whittaker, a nurse and the president-elect of the Paediatric Critical Care Society, said fewer PICUs were meeting staffing standards. Understaffing had led to an “erosion of morale” among PICU nurses and was affecting their emotional and psychological health, she added. But she welcomed PICANet’s finding that despite the widespread nurse shortage, the quality of care children and young people receive in PICUs had not been affected. The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/childrens-intensive-care-units-uk-nurses-shortage;health
1781;1781;1781;1781;1802;1802;Denis Shapovalov hits heights to topple Alexander Zverev in Australian Open;2022-01-23;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Australian Open 2022', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'Tennis'];"Between his pure shotmaking, his dynamic athleticism and the all-court style that ties his game together, there are few sights in men’s tennis as spectacular as Denis Shapovalov at the height of his powers. The question surrounding the Canadian and his future prospects has never been about his ability, but rather whether he can harness those talents and consistently replicate a high level on the biggest stages. On Sunday afternoon Shapovalov took a step forward in his progression as he produced statistically the best win of his young career by toppling Alexander Zverev, the third seed, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. It was a notable performance not because of any delirious shotmaking, but rather the calm, disciplined manner in which he dismantled a top player.
Afterwards Shapovalov, 22, stressed his satisfaction about the patience and intelligence with which he played. His discipline was reflected in the statistics. Shapovalov won only one more point than Zverev in nought-to-four-shot rallies, 66 to 65. However he outscored Zverev by a combined 15 points in rallies played between five and eight shots, and nine-plus shots. “It’s definitely something I’ve been learning to do,” he said of his patience. “Hasn’t come natural to me, unfortunately. I’ve always wanted to play quick and go for my shots. But it’s difficult when you play a guy with the calibre of Sascha [Zverev]. You can’t go through him in one or two shots. You have to stay in the rallies, you have to work for the points. Then when you have an opportunity you can swing in and go for it.” Shapovalov’s success in Australia is even more impressive considering the ordeal that preceded it. He was one of the players who tested positive for Covid-19 in December, his pre-season seemingly ruined. He emerged from quarantine and played in the ATP Cup shortly afterwards, joining forces with Félix Auger-Aliassime to win Canada’s first ever top-level team tournament. Shapovalov says he had picked up some niggles as a result of his unhelpful preparation and he did not practise much in the days before the Australian Open. Despite those obstacles, he is 7-0 in 2022. “Obviously every day is different,” he said. “But I feel with every match I have gained a little bit of confidence and comfort playing on these courts. I’m just pleased overall with my game so far and my fighting spirit. Yeah, just battling out in every single match. Hopefully I can continue going this way.”
Across the net, it was a dire performance from Zverev, but it fitted into one of the most notable patterns in his career. Despite reaching the US Open final in 2020, he has never beaten a top-10 player at a grand slam tournament and he tends to struggle against elite players in these events. Beating Shapovalov, ranked 14th, would have been the second best grand slam win of his career by ranking. He did not come close. Zverev is still under investigation by the ATP after his ex-girlfriend, Olya Sharypova, alleged that he was physically and emotionally abusive to her. Zverev denies the allegations. With Zverev’s loss, the implications for the men’s draw are significant. He was the second favourite to win the tournament, meaning Daniil Medvedev is now an even heavier favourite. In his quarter-final match, Shapovalov faces the unenviable task of playing against the new second favourite, Rafael Nadal.
Nadal advanced to the last eight in straight sets, but only after enduring some genuine tension early on. His manic first-set tie-break against Adrian Mannarino turned into one the moments of the first week as they ended up duelling for 28 minutes. Mannarino saved six set points, mostly with supreme shotmaking, while Nadal saved four set points himself. The tie-break ended with an appropriately absurd final point, at 15-14 to Nadal. Mannarino was in complete control but he tried to finish the point by attacking a forehand behind Nadal. Nadal had held his ground and he reflexively responded with a winning drive volley to snatch the set. Nadal eventually won 7-6 (14), 6-2, 6-2. “It is a victory with a lot of value, especially the first set, so very happy for that,” Nadal said. “I was able to resist the tough moments in the first set. So, yeah, a very important victory for me.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/denis-shapovalov-beats-alexander-zverev-australian-open-tennis;sports
1789;1789;1789;1789;1810;1810;Christ and cocaine: Rio’s gangs of God blend faith and violence;2022-01-23;['Tom Phillips'];['Brazil', 'Christianity', 'Gangs', 'Religion', 'World news', 'Americas'];"“Pastor, do you think we could hold a service at my house next Thursday?” the peroxide-haired gangster wondered, cradling an AK-47 in his lap as he took a seat beside the man of God. A few months earlier, the 23-year-old had bought his first home with the fruits of his illegal work as a footsoldier for one of Rio de Janeiro’s drug factions. Now, he wanted to give thanks for the blessings he believed he had received from above. “I’ve dodged death so many times. It was He who delivered me from evil,” the drug trafficker reflected as he began another 12-hour night shift on the frontline of the Brazilian city’s drug conflict. That Christian conviction was echoed all around the young outlaw, on walls adorned with frescoes of the Old City of Jerusalem and an extract from the Epistle to the Galatians: “Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” The gangster’s body celebrated his religion, too. One wrist carried a tattoo of a cross and the words “Jesus lives”. The other featured the motto: “May my courage be greater than my fear and my strength as great as my faith”. “They know theirs is a cut-throat world so they seek something to believe in,” said Elias Santana, a favela-based preacher who has made it his mission to save the souls of Rio’s ever more evangelical gangsters.
When Rio’s drug conflict exploded in the 1980s, Brazil’s evangelical revolution was still gathering pace and many gangsters looked to Afro-Brazilian deities such as Ogum, the God of war, for protection. Drug bosses frequented Afro-Brazilian temples, built shrines to Orixás and wore necklaces to show their devotion to the Umbanda and Candomblé faiths. Four decades later, many of those sanctuaries have been replaced with sculptures of Bibles and murals of the Last Supper, as a new generation of born-again criminals takes power, influenced by a brotherhood of pentecostal preachers. The sway those pastors hold over Rio’s so-called “narco-pentecostals” is unmissable in the hundreds of favelas controlled by gunmen from its three main gangs: the Red Command (CV), the Friends of the Friends (ADA) and, perhaps the most evangelical of all, the Pure Third Command (TCP). Drug lords, some regular churchgoers, have incorporated Christian symbols into their ultra-violent trade. Packets of cocaine, handguns and uniforms are emblazoned with the Star of David – a reference to the Pentecostal belief that the return of Jews to Israel represents progress towards the second coming. Gang-commissioned graffiti offers spiritual guidance and heavenly praise.
On one recent evening, a senior trafficker wandered into a service in suburban Rio, unarmed and unannounced, as a preacher read from the Book of John. “I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.” Surrounded by local children and their smartly-dressed parents, the gangster took a white plastic chair in the corner, bowed his head and began to pray. Nowhere is the evangelisation of Rio’s underworld more visible than the Complexo de Israel, a cluster of five favelas near the international airport governed by Peixão (“Big Fish”), a preacher turned drug peddler who takes his nickname from the ichthys “Jesus” fish. (The drug lord’s second-in-command is named after the Judaean prophet Jeremiah, while their troops are known as the Army of the Living God). In tribute to the area’s boss, a mural of the cartoon character Fishtronaut has been painted at one entrance, framed by a line from Psalm 33: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord”.
A neon Star of David, at night visible for miles around, sits on a water tower at one of the complex’s highest points. Nearby, on an outcrop looking south towards Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue, a Bible sits in a display case. “Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men,” reads its inscription, from Psalm 140. “Protect me from men of violence who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.” Police call Peixão, who is wanted for dozens of crimes including torture, murder and concealment of death, one of Rio’s most ambitious and iron-handed villains, whose fast-growing criminal empire makes a mockery of his purported Christian faith. In 2019 he was accused of leading the Bonde de Jesus (Jesus Crew), a gang of rifle-toting extremists who allegedly ransacked a succession of Afro-Brazilian temples. Afro-Brazilian celebrations have reportedly been outlawed in the Complex of Israel.
But some residents say the bling-averse gangster’s Bible-infused “doctrine” – which includes keeping the community’s streets tidy and well-lit, acts of charity to impoverished locals, discouraging swearing and drug use among gang members and a military-style focus on discipline – has improved life in a ghetto long neglected by the state. “There’s order in the favela,” said Juju Rude, a local rapper whose songs describe life in a community ruled by God-fearing gangsters. The Afro-Brazilian musician, who identifies as an evangelical Christian and has an Uzi tattoed on her belly, said she was troubled by Rio’s surge in faith-related bigotry and violence. “It’s not cool to see people prevented from practising their faith in the place where they live.” Overall, however, she thought life had improved under the favela’s current churchgoing administrator: “It’s new for everyone, an environment like this.”
Rio’s narco-pentecostals admit their often brutal line of work clashes with the scripture they profess to follow. As one top trafficker in another gang-run part of town lounged on top of a Honda motorbike surrounded by bodyguards with automatic rifles, he acknowledged the drug trade was an “evil” business that sometimes entailed horrific violence. But the gangster claimed his faith inspired him to minimise the barbarity, by trying to persuade fellow criminals to spare those who crossed them. “Those I can save, I save,” he said, remembering how he once persuaded a colleague not to murder a trafficker who stole a weapon and defected to a rival group. Instead, the traitor was forced to clasp his hands together, as if in prayer, and shot at close range, shattering his metacarpal bones but preserving his life. In another favela, a footsoldier with a Bible tattooed on to his chest spoke of how he enjoyed attending services at the God is Love pentecostal church, a fundamentalist congregation with temples across the US and Europe. “It makes me feel lighter,” he said, before racing away on his motorbike with an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. Christina Vital, an academic who has spent nearly 30 years studying evangelism’s advance into gangland Rio, said it was inevitable traffickers had embraced Christianity, given the breathtaking evangelical tsunami that has swept over Brazilian society during that time. Evangelicals now occupied key positions in the world of crime, just as they did in the media, politics, judiciary and culture, she said.
Nor was it surprising that vulnerable, marginalised young men sought guidance and compassion from the preachers searching Rio’s favelas for souls: “It’s such an awful, fragile life. They live in fear.” Vital said the consequences of the improbable fusion between crime and Christianity were unclear. There was evidence of “a certain containment” of bloodshed, she said, but the blending of religious intolerance with “staggering” gang violence was disturbing. Pastor Elias said he respected all faiths and believed his Godly crusade was helping pacify a city where hundreds of mostly young, black lives are lost each year. “This is Christianity’s duty: to save.” A week after being invited to bless the footsoldier’s first home, the preacher donned a garish magenta shirt and set off down winding, muddy passageways to the modest first-floor abode for which the criminal had paid 8,000 reais (£1,000). He squeezed inside, accompanied by half a dozen Bible-carrying helpers, and the group began to sing an anthem called “Oh! Jesus Loves me”. “Far from the Lord, I walked, on the path of horror. Never did I ask about Jesus. Nor did I seek His love,” they sung as the gangster bowed his head.
When the singing stopped, a female church member stepped forward and clutched the host’s arm as his girlfriend and mother – a cleaner just home from work – looked on. “God has chosen you. God is here right now!” the woman told him. “Just look at my goosebumps! God is here!” she proclaimed, her voice trembling as she summoned an angel to watch over the trafficker’s life. After 20 minutes of prayer and a reading from Psalm 23, the trafficker thanked his visitors over hotdogs and led them outside, visibly moved by their words. “It’s a life of loneliness,” said the pastor, “and Christ has come to free them from this servitude.” A warm breeze coursed through the favela’s narrow back alleys and for a moment the world seemed at peace – but the calm lasted only two hours. Shortly after midnight the crackle of gunfire woke residents, as traffickers stormed a nearby neighbourhood in the hope of expanding their domain. Another night of chaos and heartbreak in a city crying out to be saved.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/christ-and-cocaine-rios-gangs-of-god-blend-faith-and-violence;business and economy
1816;1816;1816;1816;1837;1837;Public health experts say schools are safe – but districts struggle to convince parents and teachers;2022-01-23;['Jessica Glenza'];['US education', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'US unions', 'US news'];Short-term school closures across the US amid the Omicron surge have reignited debate about how to protect the nation’s students and teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Public health experts have found themselves squeezed between exhausted parents and teachers, as schools try to keep children learning in-person despite the recent swell in cases. “This is such a highly charged emotional issue,” said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, who has helped advise Baltimore city public schools on how to return to in-person instruction. “All I can say is – there exists tools that can make the school safer and not have this kind of spread you would expect to have outside of the school.” Air filtration systems, ventilation, universal masking and most importantly vaccination reduce spread of Covid-19. Across the country, the overwhelming majority of schools are open and providing in-person instruction, as public health authorities have recommended. However, local school districts have also found themselves battling to convince both teachers and parents that school is a safe place. “I have gotten a lot of pushback on all of these things,” Gronvall said. People have said, “‘Well, the kids don’t really wear their masks all the time,’ or the air purifiers – ‘How do we know they’re working?’ or the ventilation in the building.” Multiple studies have shown schools that implement layered approaches to Covid-19 safety – such as ventilation, vaccination, cohort surveillance testing and masking – are largely safe and unlikely to drive coronavirus transmission. Nevertheless, local teachers unions have received attention for demands to return to remote learning, a strategy public health experts said will not reduce the prevalence of Covid-19. Some parents have been reluctant to send children to school, while others do not support vaccine mandates, as education is yet again disrupted. The pinch for public health experts comes as staff shortages have closed schools due to illness as the Omicron variant sweeps across the country. There are nearly 100,000 public schools in the US, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, and more than 6,200 were disrupted the week of 10 January, according to data from school closure trackers at Burbio, the highest number since school started this fall. “We have to look at the spectrum of illness we’re seeing in kids, and even adults now, and ask ourselves whether the risk to children’s education loss and accumulating mental health issues is not much more serious for families than from Covid-19,” said Dr David Rubin, director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s (Chop) PolicyLab and a professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Most experts believe it is too early to relegate the risks of Covid-19 to part of everyday life. Nevertheless, Rubin said, “The pandemic is really transitioning.” When Chop issued in-person schools guidance to reflect that transition, including a call to end all testing of asymptomatic individuals, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers objected. The guidelines feel “like a very ill-advised effort to downplay Covid cases and sweep our concerns regarding a massive surge under the rug,” the federation’s president, Jerry Jordan, said in a press release. Jordan declined a request for an interview and for comment. The union later called for a “pause” to in-person education to address safety concerns. “What we’re trying to do is help people recalibrate that some of these interventions are going to be moving away,” said Rubin. “The scaffolding is going to begun coming down.” The hospital, he said, is trying to “change the public perception after a very traumatizing experience”. “Vaccinations and boosters are really the intervention,” said Rubin. “It’s not clear to me closing schools will change the risks – it will just increase the negative consequences without a clear benefit to reducing transmission risk.” The most prominent local school closures to result from union action took place in Chicago – the nation’s third-largest school district – after a dispute between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district over safety protocols. The two sides eventually struck a deal, which included provision of KN95 masks for students and staff and the availability of weekly Covid testing. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) has repeatedly emphasized schools should be back to in-person learning, and the majority of teachers support that, as long as they feel that adequate safety precautions are in place. In Columbus, Ohio, more than 2,800 teachers, about two-thirds of the union, signed an open letter calling on the city to “immediately institute a two-week temporary remote learning pause to get us through the worst of the current COVID-19 Omicron surge”. “From a health and safety perspective, which is my lens, we do know that sending students home for two weeks is not going to change the community rate of Covid,” said Dr Sara Bode, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics council on school health, the medical director of Nationwide children’s hospital’s school-based health and mobile clinics, and now the district medical consultant to Columbus city schools. What’s more, she said students have become the “silent sufferers” of the pandemic, and now have higher rates of mental illness as a result of isolation and the loss of a safety net school provides. In the 2020-2021 school year, Columbus students had just 19 days of in-person school. Data have shown multi-layered safety approaches ensure that “school is not an independent driver of the rate” of infection, said Bode. Meanwhile, some parents have advocated for remote education because of concerns about the Omicron variant. “The decisions parents are making about schooling right now are very much a product of the kinds of challenges and constraints they’re facing in their lives,” said Jessica McCrory Calarco, an associate professor of sociology at Indiana University who has interviewed hundreds of parents about their feelings on education amid the pandemic, and who has two young children herself. “The pandemic has not affected every family equally”. In a paper under review for an academic journal, Calarco found white and higher income families were more likely to be “desperate” to have children return to in-person education, compared with families of color. Although the correlation was not “one-to-one,” Calarco said white, higher income families were less likely to live near family, more likely to have two parents working full-time and more often cited demanding workloads. Parents of color and low-income parents were more likely to lose a job as a result of the pandemic so have a parent home, live in multi-generational households or have underlying health conditions that could increase risk of infection, Calarco said. “There are widely varied opinions among parents about what steps schools should be taking at this point,” said Calarco. Notably, a large majority support mask mandates, about 70%, while only about one-third support a vaccine mandate for children. That is reflected back in childhood vaccination data – just 18.8% of children aged five to 11 and 54.6% of children aged 12 to 17 are vaccinated. Part of the discrepancy in that rate is probably because older children became eligible for vaccination before younger children. Concerns about kids contracting Covid-19 in school and mandatory quarantines mean some teachers have faced half empty classrooms after winter break. In just one example, school authorities said 40% of students were absent in Rochester, New York, when winter break ended. In Newark, New Jersey, which temporarily returned to remote education after winter break, parents said emotions ranged from excitement to angst when children returned to the classroom earlier this month. After interviewing hundreds of parents and conducting a national survey, Calarco said one theme rang throughout: a desire to return to normal. “Parents are most frustrated by the ambiguity,” Calarco said.;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/23/public-health-experts-say-schools-safe;health
1829;1829;1829;1829;1850;1850;Hopes shattered as banks fail to pass on interest rate rise;2022-01-23;['Rupert Jones'];['Money', 'Consumer affairs', 'Savings', 'Savings rates', 'Banking', 'Banks and building societies', 'Interest rates', 'Business', 'Economics'];"The recent unexpected rise in interest rates could have been the good news that savers had waited so long for. But more than five weeks after the Bank of England increased rates, only four financial firms have passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers. The Bank decided on 16 December to lift the base rate from its historic low of 0.1% to 0.25%, prompting expectation it would be passed on. But several banks and building societies boosted rates on just one, or a handful, of accounts in the weeks following the decision, and some have even reduced them. Only Suffolk, Newcastle and Cambridge building societies, and Atom bank, raised rates by the full 0.15% across all, or the majority of their ranges, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. This leaves the vast majority of long-suffering savers still waiting for a rise that may never come. Some commentators believe this is unlikely to change any time soon, even if – as many expect – the Bank announces another increase on 3 February. Analysts expect further rises this year to take the base rate above 1%. Adrian Lowery, a personal finance expert at investing platform Bestinvest, says that “most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers’ deposits … and so will probably decline to pass on base-rate hikes in any meaningful way”. That is echoed by Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, who says: “The banks have plenty of cheap money from the government, so they are in no rush to raise rates to attract more from savers.” Even if providers do nudge up rates, rising inflation will eat away at the value of savings. On Wednesday it emerged that it had jumped to 5.4% – the highest in almost 30 years. Moneyfacts says there is not one standard savings account that can outpace 5.4%, but adds that getting the best deal is essential to soften the impact of the rising cost of living.
“It’s imperative that savers continue to monitor and switch if they are on a poor rate,” says Rachel Springall at the data provider. Ipswich-based Suffolk building society says all of its currently available variable rate savings accounts had 0.15% added with effect from 4 January. Newcastle building society says it will apply the rise to the majority of its variable-rate savings accounts, which means that 97% of those who have one will benefit from 1 February. Two recently launched accounts – triple access saver and monthly access saver – will not see a rise, however. Atom bank has raised the rate on its instant saver account (its only variable rate account) by 0.15% to 0.65%, making this one of the best easy-access rates available. Cambridge building society says it will increase by 0.15% its instant access, your saver, first account and 100 day notice accounts from Tuesday. And Yorkshire building society, with nearly 3 million customers, says it is adding 0.1% to its variable-rate savings accounts on 1 February. Most experts say that everyone should aim to have some cash in an easy-access account to provide a financial safety net. Unfortunately, some of the leading ones – including Lloyds Bank’s easy saver, HSBC’s flexible saver and Halifax’s everyday saver – pay just 0.01%. There are providers offering a lot more, though some have restrictions. Topping the table at the time of writing was Shawbrook Bank’s easy-access account, paying 0.67%, though the minimum opening balance is £1,000, and the minimum withdrawal £500. Be aware that savings products are coming and going very quickly, so you may need to act fast. Financial app Chip offers an easy-access account with a relatively good rate, though it was last week reduced from 0.7% to (a still pretty good) 0.61%. Marcus by Goldman Sachs has an online savings account paying 0.6% and you can start with as little as £1. That includes 0.1% interest bonus, fixed for the first 12 months. If you want a return of more than 2%, you will typically have to lock your money away for several years. There are a number of five-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying just over 2%, from the likes of Charter Savings Bank, Hodge Bank, InBank and Monument Bank. Some of the best rates are offered by regular savings accounts, where you put aside money each month. If you have a NatWest current account, you can apply for its digital regular saver, which pays 3% on balances up to £1,000 (and just 0.01% above that). You can withdraw your money at any time, though you can only pay in up to £50 each month. Similarly, Nationwide and TSB have regular savings accounts for current account customers paying 2%. Yorkshire building society last week launched a regular savings account with a lower rate than that – 1% – but boasting an extra perk: the chance to win £1,500 cash prize each month. There will be 11 prize draws, at the start of the month, between March and January 2023, with the account maturing in a year. This easy-access account, called make me a saver, allows customers to pay in up to £150 a month. One big-name provider that was fairly quick to respond to the rate rise was National Savings & Investments (NS&I), which increased rates on three accounts on 29 December. Its direct Isa, direct saver and income bonds now all pay 0.35%. The Isa previously paid just 0.1%, while the other two offered 0.15%. These are far from table-topping – but it is possible that NS&I may soon have to increase them again to get more people through the doors. That is because it has an official target to raise about £6bn in 2021-22. In October, halfway through the current financial year, it revealed it had so far only raised £0.6bn.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/23/hopes-shattered-as-banks-fail-to-pass-on-interest-rate-rise;business and economy
1851;1851;1851;1851;1872;1872;Death threats and phone calls: the women answering cries for help one year on from Poland’s abortion ban;2022-01-23;['Weronika Strzyżyńska', 'Rosie Swash'];"['Poland', 'Abortion', 'Global development', ""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Health', 'Europe', 'Society', 'Women', 'World news']";"One year ago, on the night Poland introduced one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, the phone started ringing at the country’s most high-profile family planning organisation. Over the course of the evening, volunteers took calls from more than 20 panicked women who suddenly found their next-day appointments for abortions cancelled. One of the calls was from hospital staff at a loss over what to do about a woman who broke down after being told that her termination would not go ahead. “She went into a frenzy, got into the hospital lift and was going up and down, up and down, without stopping for an hour,” says Krystyna Kacpura, director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa). Staff at Federa were used to helping women navigate a hostile healthcare system in which legal terminations were already virtually impossible. But the new legislation put in place an almost total abortion ban in everything but name, allowing women to terminate only if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest, or if it represented a threat to life or health. At the time the legislation was brought in, about 1,000 legal abortions were carried out in Poland every year, 98% because of foetal abnormalities. This option was now closed to women. It was, says Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer for Federa, a devastating blow. Since its announcement, at least 34,000 women in Poland have managed to get abortions despite the ban, and hundreds travelled abroad for later abortions, facilitated by groups such as Abortion Support Network and Women on Web.
But now the women calling Federa for help are often in serious distress, many further into their pregnancy because they have discovered a problem at a second-trimester scan. Pregnancies are more likely to have been planned. “In the past, it was rare for us to receive calls from individuals in this state. This last year, it has been 80% of our work,” says Ferenc in Federa’s Warsaw office. “Every call is very emotional.” In the past year staff and volunteers at Federa, like many other women working as advisers, lawyers and activists in the pro-choice movement, have faced death threats, intimidation and legal challenges. Many have said they are exhausted by their increasing workload as they struggle to help women trying to access safe abortions. Ferenc says she is not afraid of the people who send bomb threats to her office or superimpose bullet holes on pictures of her face. “I’m more scared that one day prosecutors will launch an investigation against us,” she says. In the past, few Poles faced trial on abortion-related charges. The state largely turned a blind eye to illegal abortion services, with pages towards the back of newspapers filled with euphemistic adverts for private clinics offering “restoration of the menstrual cycle”. That changed when the new law came in.
A member of pro-choice group Abortion Dream Team became the first Polish abortion activist to face the prospect of trial in September, after a man notified the police that his wife ordered abortion pills online. The case is ongoing. Ferenc believes the latest changes did not fully appease the ruling Law and Justice party’s (PiS) religious base. “Before, abortion was not a topic, no one wanted to talk about it. Now the anti-abortion groups on whose support PiS is relying are demanding blood.” Marta Lempart – who is fighting 86 court cases under various charges – heads the pro-choice Polish Women’s Strike movement and says the new laws have targeted the women most at need of healthcare and support.
“Polish women with unwanted pregnancies are now in a better situation than those with wanted pregnancies but who are facing complications, because there is a working system completely outside of public healthcare for the former. But the healthcare system does not provide a service to the latter at all.” A further attempt to ban abortion completely and jail women who had terminations for life was rejected by the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament, but the government has since announced it would begin compiling a database of all pregnancies across the country, a move defended as a digitisation of existing documentation but which women’s rights groups believe is another natalist policy designed to control women’s lives and a sign that worse is to come.
Meanwhile, an underfunded and overstretched Polish healthcare system, accused of failing to provide women with reproductive care, is emboldened by the new laws. “Women are falsely told by doctors that contraceptive pills give them cancer, or that an IUD is dangerous for those who haven’t had children yet,” says Ferenc. She has begun advising women to record their conversations with doctors. One woman said that doctors treating her breast cancer repeatedly told her the illness was caused by an abortion she had months earlier. But Kacpura and others believe the legislation may also have had a chilling effect on doctors who are terrified of navigating the new law. She says, before the 2021 ruling, doctors would rarely contact her, but in the past year she has been answering their calls day and night. “No one [in authority] explained to the doctors what they should do,” she says. Sometimes, doctors call to pass on the numbers of patients they were not able to legally help. “I called one woman straight after she left the hospital. She was in an awful state, it’s hard to say what she would have done if we hadn’t reached her.” Agata Bzdyń, a lawyer who represents a number of women who have taken their abortion refusals to the European court of human rights, points to reports that Bielański hospital in Warsaw, which she says “has a reputation for still providing abortions”, has been under pressure from the government to hand over documents on the number of terminations approved. Bielański did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond the government, Roman Catholic lay groups continue to exert pressure for an outright abortion ban. The group Ordo Iuris (Order of Law) was one of the mobilising forces behind a citizen’s bill in favour of a total abortion ban, a move that was rejected by parliament but precipitated the ruling. Since 2016, the organisation has acted as official adviser to the PiS government in areas of reproductive rights and education. The organisation recently announced that it will provide legal representation to a man who is suing his wife for having an abortion, which Ordo Iuris argues violated the man’s right to family life.
The most shocking case of the past 12 months is that of a woman called Izabela, who died in November of septic shock while in her 22nd week of pregnancy. Doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, in south-west Poland, did not perform an abortion, even though her foetus would not survive, according to a lawyer for the family. “For now, because of the abortion law, they can’t do anything,” Izabela texted to her mother shortly before she died. An investigation found “medical malpractice” led to Izabela’s death and the hospital was fined . She is survived by a husband and daughter. Kacpura said she knows of several cases in the past year where the woman’s waters broke prematurely, as Izabela’s did, but doctors refused to perform a caesarean or induce birth. “A nightmare, because the foetus cannot survive but the heartbeat can continue for days, sometimes weeks, and the woman has to wonder whether she has already become a coffin.” Bartłomiej Wróblewski, a leading PiS parliamentary force behind the change in the law, said: “It is not true that this law puts women’s lives in danger, because nobody challenged existing provision of Polish law to rescue endangered life and health of the mother, even when it leads to the death of their unborn child.” Echoing other governmental and anti-abortion voices, he stressed that in his eyes there was no connection between Izabela’s death and the new abortion restrictions, instead putting the blame on doctors.
But Izabela’s death horrified the country and sparked fresh protests. It may have proved a turning point. Several polls have found the majority of people in the country oppose the 21 January ruling. Even those who are not pro-choice resent what they see as the Roman Catholic church overstepping the mark by creating political pressure for a ban, says Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at Sussex University. “About 40% of people in Poland still attend weekly mass, but that is not to suggest they are happy for the church to have more control of their lives,” says Szczerbiak. He believes the change in law may have shifted perceptions of the issue in Polish politics.
Ferenc echoes this. “We thought there was no political chance to change [the law around abortion]. The paradox is that it has changed for the worse, but that means we have a chance to liberalise the law too,” she says. A pro-choice citizen’s bill calling for abortion to be made fully available is gaining momentum. “We had an older gentleman come in whose wife told him to print the form from the internet and he got his friends to sign it, and then he came to deliver his 10 signatures,” says Lempart from her office on Wiejska Street, a few doors down from the Polish parliament. “Before, initiatives to collect signatures were mostly organised by groups and political parties. Now, I’d say 60% is just individuals collecting signatures.” Organisers say the citizen’s bill has reached the 100,000 signatures needed for official recognition and more signatures are coming in every day.

1864;1864;1864;1864;1885;1885;‘Bob wouldn’t be Bob without Rita’: Ziggy Marley on his mother and father;2022-01-23;['Rob Walker'];['Bob Marley', 'Music', 'Photography', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Reggae'];"Ziggy Marley was only eight years old when his mum and dad – the reggae great Bob Marley – were shot in an apparent assassination attempt inside their home in Kingston, Jamaica. But he remembers it like yesterday. “Cops came for us children in the middle of the night and carried us away to a secret hideaway up in the hills – no one really knew what was happening. It was scary but it was kind of exciting,” he says. Yet just two days later, on 5 December 1976, Bob Marley insisted on playing the Smile Jamaica Concert at Kingston’s National Heroes Park, as planned – even though he had bullet wounds in his arm and chest. The gig was seen as a rallying cry for peace against the backdrop of Jamaica’s spiralling violence and political unrest, with 80,000 people watching Marley swagger his way through classics including Get Up Stand Up. For reggae fans it’s the stuff of legend, though Ziggy insists his mother, who had been shot in the head on that night, deserves equal credit. “She still showed up for the show, the same as he did. I’m proud of both my dad and my mum because there’s a team work going on between them. Bob wouldn’t be Bob without Rita, you know what I’m saying?” Now 53, Ziggy is speaking to the Observer on the eve of a new exhibition about his father’s life and influences opening at the Saatchi Gallery in London next month. It’s the latest celebration of a singer who four decades after his death from cancer, aged 36, is still one of the bestselling artists in the world. His posthumous greatest hits album, Legend, released in 1984, has spent more than 950 weeks in the UK top 100 and has sold more than 25m copies worldwide. The exhibition – which includes a giant vinyl installation of Legend – is pitched as a “multi-sensory experience” with numerous rooms and spaces, each highlighting different aspects of Marley’s life. One room, for example, is designed as a forest with the sounds and smells of Jamaica, the visual backdrop to many of the songs. In another space, they have recreated a concrete urban landscape with huge art installations and there’s even a mock-up of the backstage corridor of a Bob Marley and the Wailers concert. A silent disco, which they’re calling the Soul Shakedown Studio, invites visitors to don headphones and groove to a reggae dance party. But the highlight of the show is arguably a collection of never-seen images of Marley himself. Ziggy explains that they were discovered in the storage locker of photographer Jean Bernard Sohiez, who died last year and whose two dozen photos are all seemingly taken on the same day in Kingston, more or less a year before Marley’s death.
They are un-posed candid shots, some capturing the singer playing football, which he said was his greatest passion after music. “He was fanatical,” agrees Ziggy. “It was a big part of his life, and my life as a child around him, but it wasn’t just about football – he loved all sports. He loved boxing, running, table tennis, he was a sporty guy.” He would sometimes come to Ziggy’s primary school and play against his teammates, he says, adding: “He was fast and he had a good kick.” He laughs out loud though at the idea his dad’s game was on a professional level, as friends who played with him have claimed. “That was his aspiration!” he quips. He thinks playing football was a way for Marley to alleviate some of the pressures of his day-to-day life. His dad was always in demand, he says, and sometimes it felt like everyone wanted a piece of him. “Football helped him free his mind,” he says. Disturbed by the shooting at his home, Marley moved to London for a spell, living in the relative calm of 42 Oakley Street in Chelsea. It’s there that he wrote one of his most enduring songs, Three Little Birds. Ziggy stayed on in Jamaica along with the rest of his siblings (Marley had 11 acknowledged children) but claims he didn’t miss his father during the separation. Not because he didn’t love him, but through necessity, he says. “When you reflect back you can feel sad, but in that moment you gotta do what you gotta do,” he says. “I had to go to school, there were a lot of things going on, so you just get on with it.” Ziggy (a nickname his dad gave him, meaning “little spliff’’) was 12 when Marley died. He even performed at the funeral. And in a wider sense he’s “got on with it” all his adult life, carving his own niche as a top recording artist. He’s an eight-time Grammy award winner, picking up best reggae album seven times, most recently in 2017.
Ziggy has a similar Trenchtown accent to his father, although he’s been living in Los Angeles with his wife Orly and four children for around 15 years now. “As my father used to say, my home is in my head,” he says. He knows he’ll never step completely out of his father’s shadow and he admits that some people want him to be his father. There’s always an expectation that he will do covers of Bob Marley songs at his live events, but that’s something he says he’s more than happy to do. Sometimes he does tours where he only sings his father’s songs. He doesn’t have a favourite one, but singles out Redemption Song as the one that is closest to his heart. It’s a song that was played a great deal around the time his father died, he says, and it meant so much to so many people. “It carries a lot of emotional connection for me.” The Bob Marley One Love Experience is at London’s Saatchi Gallery from 2 February – 18 April";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/23/bob-wouldnt-be-bob-without-rita-ziggy-marley-on-his-mother-and-father;entertainment and culture

Our three-month-old boy is up at 6.30am and our eight-year-old son loves to jump in our bed. I’m a lounger, but I’m very conscious that Sunday is a day to spend with family. Sundays growing up? My mother was a minister, so Sunday mornings were quite an event, getting eight kids ready to go to church. There is a particular smell of black hair being straightened with a hot comb heated on the fire in the kitchen that reminds me of all my sisters getting ready for Sunday school. Sunday lunch? We’re savage carnivores, so my family loves my herb-crust roast beef and curried salmon. I compete with my wife over barbecued pork ribs. She’s from Taganrog in Russia and her mother sent her some interesting spice, but she won’t tell me what it is. Sunday music? We do a lot of Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, John Coltrane. I’ve been listening to a lot of piano players – Gerald Clayton, Kenny Barron. I’m a fan of the very soulful classical artists. Sunday exercise? We don’t like structure, so we may play a game of smacking the tennis ball over the tree, or swinging a golf club or cricket bat. I haven’t busted any windows yet. We like to play checkers and chess and cheat. It’s a family thing, to take something and deconstruct it. Sunday chores? Especially during Covid, we didn’t have anybody coming to clean. So I do the mopping and vacuuming. Then there’s the things you forget about: how do you get the dust off of the top of the curtains? Somebody has to do it. Last thing Sunday night? I prefer to fall asleep accidentally. I’ll often be watching the BBC in a hotel room and will get a bang on the wall at 3am: ‘Turn the damn TV off.’ When I’m home, there’s a lot of me falling asleep in front of the TV, or on my office floor listening to records. I get in trouble with my wife. She says: ‘Why do you sleep like a bumpsh’ – which means a homeless person in Russian – ‘in your own house?’ Gregory Porter’s latest album, Still Rising, is out now;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/23/sunday-with-gregory-porter-i-compete-with-my-wife-over-barbecued-pork-ribs;entertainment and culture
1887;1887;1887;1887;1908;1908;My wife will have me home after an affair, but I long for more | Ask Philippa;2022-01-23;['Philippa Perry'];['Relationships', 'Marriage', 'Life and style'];"The question I had a very intense two-year affair with someone who, like me, had long been married. Eighteen months in, I left my wife, feeling sure my affair partner was the love of my life, and in the hope it might lead to us being together. This led to the loss of my home and much of my social network, and the need to change jobs. My affair partner decided to stay in her marriage, citing the wellbeing of her children. She wanted to keep the relationship with me going indefinitely in secret. This rapidly became unbearable to me and I have now cut off all contact, which was not her wish. She was evasive about whether she intended, or even wanted, to leave her marriage and be with me openly. Her final message to me expressed that this was now her intention, but that she could give no sense of a timescale. I have told my wife absolutely everything and she has been phenomenally sane. She is offering to have me home, for a trial period, with a view to mutual kindness, leading to either reconciliation or a better parting. There was much of value in our shared life. I know that the rational thing to do is to assume my affair partner will never be able to be with me, but I still love her and think of her with hope. I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence with anyone else. Every day, a part of me wants to reach out and tell her this, for the millionth time, to try to win her. I obsess about it. Another part of me wants to have no contact. My life is stuck. Philippa’s answer “I wouldn’t want to belong to a club that would have me as a member,” said Groucho Marx. What is the pull of a potential partner who is not committing to you? What is this about? Did you have to work hard to get the approval of a parent? Did a teacher you had a crush on withhold praise? Have you had a pattern of falling for unavailable lovers, those who lived abroad, or were already married? I want you to think about your longing. At the moment, you are your longing, your longing is you, you are it. Take a step back from it. Look at it in a detached way. You’ve told me: “In my whole life, I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence.” And I’m tempted to prompt: “What about your mother when you were two?”
Now this might sound far-fetched, but look at the way a toddler wants their parent. Notice the clinging, the desperation, the longing: it’s all there. I’m guessing you may be haunted by an inner ghost of that baby or toddler who longed and longed and sometimes had the ecstasy of being momentarily held, in an intermittent way that reinforced the longing and made you long all the more. The trouble with what is familiar in this way is that it feels right. Sometimes people say love feels like “coming home”, like coming back to what is familiar, from a time even before words could explain that familiarity. You learned how to long – like a sort of default mood for you – before you knew any words. The love you have with your lover sounds like a “falling in love” type of love. The type we see in films where you are swept up in a passive way: it happens to you. Very much, really, like it happens to a baby or a toddler, they don’t do anything, they fall into longing. But the love your wife is showing you? Wow! That is a different sort of love altogether. That isn’t passive, that is love as a verb, that is love as an action, that is the sort of steady, committed, available, consistent kindness that, had you experienced it as a toddler, I don’t think you’d be in this situation now. That is probably the love you need, rather than the one you think you want. What would I advise you to do? Go home and develop the appreciation for your available (at least for the moment; she probably has her limits) kind wife into something deeper. Not the heady obsessional, no-one-has-had-a-love-like-ours craziness that you had for your lover, not that raging sea, but a steady lake than runs deeper than you could have ever imagined. And that old, old scar that your lover picked into a scab will heal and – more than heal – will become memory upon memory of love in action, rather than love that falls down a familiar hole again. Don’t fall into the longing-trap, be loving. It’s better, far better in the long run and leads to something more sustainable. Short answer: be interested, not in your lover, but in the way you long for someone who won’t prioritise you. Find out about that part of you. Find a narrative for how that part came into being. Second, appreciate what you do have. If what I’ve said has any resonance for you, follow it up. If it all seems like double-Dutch, don’t worry, keep seeking help until you find what you need. You may also find a therapist who uses attachment theory useful, too (welldoing.org).

1907;1907;1907;1907;1928;1928;Confusion over UK claim that Putin plans coup in Ukraine;2022-01-22;['Emma Graham-Harrison', 'Luke Harding', 'Andrew Roth'];['Ukraine', 'UK news', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Boris Johnson', 'Joe Biden'];"The Foreign Office has said that it had exposed evidence of a plot to install a pro-Moscow government in Ukraine, and Boris Johnson promised to “ramp up pressure on Russia”, as his own domestic political troubles deepened. Saturday’s rare reference to intelligence-gathering went into almost no detail about a conspiracy that, if accurate, could mean a serious escalation in the threat to Ukraine. Politicians there were sceptical that the government could be replaced without a full-blown invasion of the capital, Kyiv. The Foreign Office also said it had information on former Ukrainian politicians who had links with Russian intelligence services, and listed five men. “Some of these have contact with Russian intelligence officers currently involved in the planning for an attack,” the statement added. However four of the five men live in exile in Moscow, making their ties to Russia’s leadership less a matter of subterfuge than public record. The Foreign Office’s claims were thrown into further confusion when the man it named as a “potential candidate” as Moscow’s presidential pick told the Observer he would make an unlikely candidate to head a puppet government for Moscow. “You’ve made my evening. The British Foreign Office seems confused,” said former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev, laughing. “It isn’t very logical. I’m banned from Russia. Not only that but money from my father’s firm there has been confiscated.” The Foreign Office statement was followed by an intervention from No 10 that Johnson “has pushed for a gear change on the Ukraine situation”, after a period when his government appeared to take a back seat on international diplomacy around this issue, while battling heavy political challenges over lockdown-busting parties.
While US president Joe Biden and a host of European leaders have made a series of interventions on Ukraine over the past week, the prime minster has largely avoided the recent flurry of diplomacy aimed at averting war. Last week, as high-level talks took place across Europe, the UK’s defence and foreign secretaries, Ben Wallace and Liz Truss, were both in Australia. “It’s been striking that in this week of acute tension in Europe, the prime minister seems to have been absent from top-level Ukraine diplomacy, and the foreign secretary has managed to be in the wrong hemisphere,” said Peter Ricketts, former national security adviser and former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office. In Ukraine, Vasyl Filipchuk, a former spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, who now runs a thinktank, described the British allegations of a plot as “ridiculous”. Even a rigged election would not bring the pro-Russian actors power, and trying to install them by force would mean a very long and very bloody fight, he claimed. “This scenario would only work with a fully fledged invasion taking over Kyiv,” he said. “The city would be decimated, its land burned and a million people would flee. We have 100,000 people in the capital with arms, who will fight … There may be a plan but it’s bullshit.” The prominent TV journalist Yevgeny Kiselyov, who moved to Ukraine in 2008, said that mainstream opposition figures who opposed Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would never talk to Russian spy agencies, however unhappy they were with the present government in Kyiv. Russian intelligence had a history of telling the Kremlin what it wanted to hear, rather than objective reality, he added. The Foreign Office statement seemed plausible but did not contain any obvious new intelligence, analysts and regional experts in the UK said, given that Moscow has been massing troops near the border and makes no secret of its unhappiness with the country’s current government. A Foreign Office spokesperson declined to respond to questions about whether the British government had any details of timing or the method that Russia intended to use to change the leadership in Kyiv. The scarcity of details about the plot, and the sudden diplomatic push after a period on the international sidelines, risked leaving Johnson open to charges that he is exploiting a volatile international crisis to shore up his own position at home. “It is bad we’ve got ourselves into a situation now where our ability to respond to what Putin is doing is damaged by wounds inflicted on ourselves politically over a period of years going back to 2003,” said David Clark, a former special adviser to the Foreign Office. “This is not a government that’s well placed to take a lead on this issue, either in terms of domestic opinion, or frankly, in terms of wider western unity given the context of Brexit,” he added. “The current immediate domestic context is of a government in trouble, a government with a track record, frankly, of engineering sensational news interventions in order to distract and deflect from their own difficulties.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/confusion-over-uk-claim-that-putin-plans-coup-in-ukraine;politics

And yet for all that issues of infrastructure and administration continue to blight the highest level of the African game, where there has been clear progress has been lower down the pyramid. There is a healthy and growing middle class. It’s not so long ago that expanding the Cup of Nations from 16 to 24 teams would have seen a marked dilution of quality, but not now.
Comoros and the Gambia, both traditional minnows and at their first Cup of Nations, have reached the last 16. Comoros have perhaps been a touch fortunate but the Gambia have played with an impressive level of calm organisation and deservedly beat Tunisia to go through. Malawi, in their second tournament, beat Zimbabwe and, but for VAR controversially overturning a penalty, might have beaten Senegal. Only Mauritania have really looked out of their depth – which, given what a terrible format six groups of four is, might be an argument for expanding to 32 teams. Logistics may make that difficult but, given Zambia, South Africa and DR Congo all failed to qualify, it’s hard to argue against the move on grounds of quality. The format – with four third-placed sides making the last 16 – is awful. There is too great a risk of dead rubbers, advantaging the teams in the later groups who know what they need to do, and there is the fundamental unfairness of comparing between groups that have their own dynamics – most obviously a team resting players for the final game if they’re already through – and should be discrete. But the tournament has developed a recent habit of producing remarkable drama. The final round of group games at the Euros – Viktor Claesson’s injury-time winner for Sweden to put Poland out, Germany saved by Leon Goretzka’s late equaliser against Hungary – may have been more thrilling but those at the Cup of Nations felt more consequential, with the reigning champions, Algeria, and the four-time champions Ghana both eliminated. Algeria were the big surprise. Ghana were in obvious chaos before the tournament, with Charles Akonnor sacked in November to make way for the return as coach of Milovan Rajevac. The Serb led Ghana to the final in 2010 but his cautious, possession-based approach, which got the best out of a young side including André Ayew, has led only to sterile football this time.
Goals conceded in the final 10 minutes cost them a draw against Morocco and a win against Gabon, a match that ended in a brawl that highlighted the frustration in the camp, Benjamin Tetteh being sent off for a left hook. Still a win against Comoros would have taken them through, but having been undone on the break, they lost Ayew to a harsh red card for a challenge on the goalkeeper. A second goal on the break followed, and although Ghana fought back to level, Comoros picked them off again in the 85th minute, the culmination of 10 days of rolling ill-discipline that saw Ghana fail to make the knockout stages for the first time since 2006. The president of the Ghana Football Association, Kurt Okraku, defended Rajevac, pointing out how little time he has had to work with his squad – but that prompts the question of why the GFA sacked Akonnor when they did. The dismissal of the Serb, at a reported cost of $275,000, was confirmed morning. There was no such sense of foreboding about Algeria, though. Rather they came into the tournament on a run of 34 games unbeaten as, by general consent, the best team in the continent. The only real doubt about them was the habitual struggles of north African sides outside north Africa; Egypt in 2008 and 2010 remain the only north African country to win a Cup of Nations south of the Sahara.
To an extent Algeria were unfortunate in Cameroon – a sense only exacerbated when their federation released a statement denying it was bringing in a faith healer to help. They had more touches in the final third than any other side in the group stage while only Nigeria and Mali had more shots, and there’s no doubt that the poor quality of the pitch in Douala hampered their passing. Djamel Belmadi proved two years ago in Egypt what a capable coach he is, his side playing a modern pressing game that looked ideal for international football. He had suffered only one defeat in 44 games in charge before last Sunday, since when he has suffered two in a week – to Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast.
Both were similar in the way the midfield, at key stages, disintegrated and allowed their opponents to counterattack. The final 10 minutes against Equatorial Guinea were extraordinary in the way the structure that had been such a strength in 2019 fell apart: essentially four forwards standing on the halfway line and waiting for the ball to be delivered to them as Equatorial Guinea frolicked in the space in the Algerian half. Similarly the 15 minutes after half-time against Ivory Coast were shambolic: the Ivorians scored a decisive third but missed three other decent chances. Perhaps it was just one of those things. Bad things can happen to good sides at tournaments. But equally it feels significant that the two finalists from 2019, Algeria and Senegal, both of whom play very structured football, managed just two goals between them in six group games.
The lack of preparation time before this tournament, exacerbated by Covid complications, has probably cost them fluency – and it has been notable how much better the football has become generally as the group stage went on – and in the present environment, in which there are a wealth of decent if not brilliant teams, can be enough to cause the continent’s giants real problems.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/22/afcon-algeria-ghana-comoros-the-gambia;sports
1921;1921;1921;1921;1942;1942;Easy wins: spend five minutes a day to score an edible garden and an obscene amount of joy;2022-01-22;['Steph Harmon'];['Life and style', 'Gardening advice'];"After spending three decades murdering every plant I touched, I was astonished to find myself in lockdown with a functioning edible garden. Perhaps isolation taught me patience. Perhaps the pandemic made me more careful. It certainly helped that there were already veggies growing in raised garden beds when we moved in: from them I learned that part of gardening is watching plants die (some died! it was OK!), and from that I gained the confidence to plant more. My first tip is to start simple. Basil, dill, parsley, chilli, snow peas, lemon thyme, strawberries and mint are all hardy if you have good soil (did you know you can simply go out and buy an entire bag of worms? And then just chuck them in?), enough sun and remember to water each day. I keep my herbs and small vegetables in balcony boxes that hang above the garden beds, which grow zucchini, beans and tomatoes I can take little credit for; the beds were already irrigated.
My second tip is to keep it simple by way of cheap accoutrements that remove both guesswork and legwork. I have a big rubber tub ($4, Bunnings) collecting rain (free, La Niña). I have a soil meter ($17) that measures moisture, pH and light (a magical tool that tells you when to water and has kept my indoor plants alive as well). I plant seeds in a seedling box ($12) first, which keeps the weather off until they’re big enough to be moved. Once set up in their balcony boxes ($11), I scatter a smorgasbord of year-round flowers around them to lure bees that will pollinate the plants. Bees: also free! It is obscene how much joy this all brings me – and it takes around five minutes each day to tend. I run out every morning now with my dumb cute watering can ($20) to water everyone, trim off the dead leaves (it helps the plant focus on the living ones) and see if anything has happened. A new strawberry! A different flower! A bee! Look at this BEE! I yell all the developments at my bored partner and show him the tiny yield I have gathered in a tiny basket (so it looks bigger). Sometimes I wear a hat while I’m doing it, like some lady in a boring BBC show. It’s so much easier than I thought! And incredibly dull.

1924;1924;1924;1924;1945;1945;Ruffled feathers: is the power imbalance in Australia’s chicken industry making shortages worse?;2022-01-22;['Natasha May'];['Agriculture', 'Chicken', 'Supply chain crisis', 'Australia news', 'Business', 'Food', 'World news'];"The domination of the chicken processing industry by a few large players has contributed to the shortages in supermarkets across Australia, farmers and industry representatives say. But that claim is rejected by chicken processors, who say the current supply chain crisis is “unprecedented” and not related to the number of processors or the structure of the industry. Chicken farmers are contracted to provide the land, sheds, equipment, utilities and labour necessary to grow the chickens for large processing companies such as Inghams and Baiada, who own the birds.
James Jackson, the president of NSW Farmers, says chicken meat production in Australia is dominated by a small number of vertically integrated businesses where the ownership up the supply chain is controlled by a single operator, from the hatcheries through to the processing plants and distribution. Jackson says in 2020 Inghams Enterprises and Baiada Poultry supplied 70% of Australia’s chicken meat while 90% is supplied by just six processors. He says while the supermarket shortages were a result of the impact of Covid-19 on the workforce, the concentration of ownership in chicken processing has also played a part in reducing supply options. “Chicken processors, red meat processors, truckies and warehouse workers – no one has been spared from Covid,” Jackson says. “More broadly we have raised the importance of having options in our supply chain so that when one or two big companies have issues – as we have seen recently – our dinner plates aren’t left empty.” NSW Farmers has described the chicken meat industry as a “regional monopsony environment”. A monopsony is a market dominated by a single buyer with the power to influence prices. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter
John Courtney, a former chicken farmer, says the conditions in the chicken meat market make it particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. “With very few suppliers, it’s all concentrated in the hands of the two big players, so when you have a hiccup, it’s major,” he says. “Whereas before, being spread out among half a dozen smaller operators, there wouldn’t be a problem of keeping up supply.” Courtney and Jeremy Cruickshank were two of the 13 farmers in the New South Wales northern rivers who were contracted to Sunnybrand Chickens, a family-owned processing company with a plant in Byron Bay.
The company was bought by Inghams, which shut down the Byron Bay plant and made the farmers send their chickens to Brisbane. Courtney and Cruikshank were both told their costs were too expensive and their contracts were not renewed. “Whiz kids with degrees in economics started calling the shots and didn’t know a chook from a chihuahua … and they said you fellows are too dear, we’ve got too much freight to Brisbane,” Courtney says. “I had to go get a job at 65 just to pay the bills.” Courtney and Cruikshank say the expensive infrastructure their contracts had required them to invest in became valueless without contracts to grow chickens. Cruikshank says more processing areas would reduce the risk of Covid-19 affecting the workforce, and believes the industry’s lack of diversity could produce further shortages in future in the event of avian disease. “The biggest problem with the industry is the only way they can save money in growing chicken is by putting 100 sheds in one row – makes it a lot cheaper to transport out of that spot. “But what will happen is if we get avian influenza or Newcastle disease? It’s going to wipe out not just three farms that are separated by kilometres like it usually does, it’s going to take the whole operation out.” Inghams was contacted for comment and referred the inquiry on to the Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF).
A spokesperson for the ACMF, which represents chicken processors, said there were multiple chicken suppliers in Australia of various sizes and across several states. “The chicken industry is extremely robust and stable,” the spokesperson said. “What we are currently experiencing is unprecedented, and has affected nearly every industry in the country. “The current supply issues experienced by industry have nothing to do with the size and/or number of processing plants, nor the structure of the industry. “All processing plants – big and small and across all suppliers – are experiencing the same difficulties, which are resulting from staff shortages due to COVID-related absenteeism, and all have impacted supply in the same way.” The ACMF spokesperson said the staff shortages were not just at processing plants but right across the supply chain, including transport. “Over the past few weeks there have been times when we haven’t had enough staff to collect birds from farms, but at other times plants have been able to produce the product but had to cancel orders because of transport industry issues – there were not enough truck drivers to deliver product to stores.” The perishable agricultural goods inquiry report released by the ACCC in 2020 acknowledged the power imbalance in the chicken meat industry. Michael Moore, the executive officer of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, said since the turn of the century smaller processors have been absorbed by larger ones, leading to decreasing levels of competition at the processing level and as a result monopsony conditions. “Processors are more able to put in place pricing that may be pushing growers to the edge of unprofitability. If they are the only person out there offering a contract, it’s take it or leave it, that is the price.” Moore said processors used to be prepared to issue contracts for up to 10 years, which would cover the cost of building new farm infrastructure, but contract terms have fallen steadily over the years with many growers on yearly contracts.
Cruikshank says Inghams gave his farm and 12 months notice that it would not be renewing its contract and left him “to go broke”. “That’s what we’ve got from chicken farming.” The contract had required the investment of millions of dollars in modern feeding, lighting, ventilation and water systems. “Because these sheds are so specifically designed for growing chickens in, you’re left with no real options for what to do with your sheds,” Cruikshank says. Peta Easey, poultry meat manager at NSW Farmers, says chicken growers are forced to compete in a pool system and the final buying price can vary significantly from batch to batch. A decade ago, in NSW there were nine significant chicken meat processing plants owned by six different companies, but now there are only four processing plants in the state owned by just two companies, according to Easey. Staff shortages have been worst in processing plants, where chickens are cut into pieces such as thigh and breast fillets, resulting in more whole chickens shipped to supermarkets and other retailers. Moore says that meat processing plants are vulnerable to the spread of viruses as people need to work in close proximity.

1947;1947;1947;1947;1968;1968;A courageous reissue in the not-so-brave new world of publishing | Rachel Cooke;2022-01-22;['Rachel Cooke'];['Publishing', 'UK news', 'Books', 'Advertising', 'Media', 'Cabaret', 'Stage', 'Eddie Redmayne', 'Theatre'];"A parcel arrives, inside which is a copy of Kay Dick’s dystopian novel of 1977, They: A Sequence of Unease, and a letter informing me that Faber is to reissue it next month. Crikey, but isn’t this amazing? Dick, who died in 2001, is something of a minority interest at this point. She didn’t write much and what she did is either quite peculiar or quite bad, though I’ll always be fond of Ivy and Stevie, a collection of interviews with Ivy Compton-Burnett and Stevie Smith that wears its eccentricity like some crazy hat (“I realised that she had lovely legs because, quite often, she would delve under her skirt for her handkerchief, which she tucked into her knickers,” Dick writes of the former, on whom she first “called” in 1950.)
But if this book’s reappearance is surprising, it’s also ironic. In They, Britain is in the grip of a mercilessly cruel group of philistines: a mob that burns books and paintings, punishing all those who resist. Faber hopes, very laudably, to bring it to a “new generation” of readers and to help it do so, its edition comes with praise from Margaret Atwood and an introduction by Carmen Maria Machado. The wicked thought occurs to me, however, that it’s really publishing itself that most needs this book right now. As Machado notes: “Censorious impulses… and soft bigotry are hardly the exclusive property of the right.” Dick’s novel is reborn in a world in which some imprints (not Faber, I hope) are content to excise completely writers they were delighted to publish only five minutes ago; in which social media seems more and more utterly to terrify editors; and in which, at certain moments, the Society of Authors falls oddly silent. Oh, well. The good news is that this scary little novel can now be theirs – or anyone’s – for just £8.99. Preying on our fears
Out in the world again, everything is at once the same and subtly different. On the tube, I find myself transfixed by the ads in my carriage, which now speak with one voice of the pandemic. Like a dandelion poking through a crack in a paving stone, capitalism determinedly locates our weaknesses and anxieties, the better that it might brazenly exploit them. Personalised vitamins (“we know you are weary”), a strange concoction for the turbulent gut, mindfulness delivered to your door in a little cardboard box. Be warned: the snake oil merchants are out in force. Come to the Cabaret…
By the time you read this, I will finally have seen Rebecca Frecknall’s new production of Cabaret, starring Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley, a night out I had to remortgage the house to afford. (Those ticket prices really do evoke the Weimar, I can tell you.) Will I be as high as a kite or suffering from the mother of all anticlimaxes? I don’t know. But either way, at least my pre-show nerves will at last be gone. The emails from the theatre last week were enough to bring on an attack of the vapours, their anhedonic tone somewhat at odds with the fact they purport to be from the Kit Kat Club, as if the place really exists. “Action required!” they command, after which there follows a long list of instructions involving Covid tests and arrival times. We have been told to appear a full 75 minutes before curtain up, which seems completely mad, especially since I couldn’t get two seats next to one another. Will we both be allowed to go to the same bar? Or will one of us end up – I’m reading the small print now – at the place that only serves schnapps? • Rachel Cooke is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/22/courageous-reissue-not-so-brave-new-world-of-publishing;entertainment and culture

His debut album is a deft blend of jazz and Arab-Andalucian tradition, led by his own mandole – a 10-stringed lute – alongside bass, drums and bass clarinet, the last an unusual instrument skilfully handled by one Clément Meunier. The quartet conjure a variety of moods from that configuration. Opener Sans Pap (a pun on no paper/no pope) is exuberant, led by Cherif’s rippling runs, and there’s a similar joyousness to tracks such as Savage Butterfly and Virgule, with its Indian melody and driving drums. It’s a communal effort, with Meunier’s burbling woodwind (with none of the clarinet’s usual shrillness) offsetting the twang of the lute. The record’s more meditative pieces are just as engaging. The first of two vocal outings, Call of the Night, conjures a humid North African evening, with glimpses of “staggering bodies in the shadows”. Better still is the waltz-time Amiret Erriyam, where Cherif slips between nostalgia, despair and the determination to start anew; like the rest of the album, a piece of musical autobiography.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/anouar-kaddour-cherif-djawla-review;entertainment and culture
1956;1956;1956;1956;1977;1977;‘I was in so much pain’: snowboarder Katie Ormerod on injury, recovery and dreams of an Olympic medal;2022-01-22;['N/A'];['Winter Olympics Beijing 2022', 'Sport', 'Snowboarding'];"Katie Ormerod – nicknamed “Katie Oh!” for her crowd-pleasing medley of acrobatic snowboard tricks – is Team GB’s all-action poster-girl for the Beijing Winter Olympics next month, and an authentic hope for the country’s first ever snowsport gold medal. The 24-year-old athlete, an unexpectedly shy Yorkshire woman, became Britain’s first ever World Cup slopestyle champion in 2020. She has somehow overcome Britain’s lack of mountains, and a potentially career-ending shattered heel in 2018 (which required seven operations, the insertion of two metal pins, and a graft of pig skin), to make it this far. “It feels amazing – I’m just really happy that I am able to do this, because I had to work so extremely hard to make it here, and to come back from injury,” Ormerod explains. Ormerod and I are speaking via Zoom from her home in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, during a break between contests in America and Canada. She speaks softly but assuredly in a Yorkshire accent; her lightning-blonde hair, which fans usually see dancing around in a plait as she executes her flamboyant tricks, is tucked casually beneath a cap. Growing up in a country with an average altitude of just 75m was far from ideal for a wannabe snowboard champion. While her rivals were raised in the mountains of America, Japan, New Zealand and Canada, Ormerod learned to board on the moss-covered dry plastic slope in Halifax, five miles from the family home. But her disadvantages only inspired her to train more intensely and intelligently. “I made the most of the local Halifax dry slope. If you have the passion and you work hard, I have shown you can win world titles. We are at a disadvantage in the UK because I grew up riding literally on plastic bristles. A lot of [foreign] riders think we’re crazy. But people respect us, because we have taken the difficult route and we’re competing at the highest level. I’m proud to be British. I am proud of my Yorkshire background. And I hope others will follow in my footsteps.”
Thanks to the backing of her sponsors, and the GB Snowsport governing body, she now trains abroad in the resorts of Italy and Switzerland. But such trips still feel like a privilege. “Whenever I get the opportunity to go abroad I make the most of every second I’m on snow,” she insists. “I don’t take it for granted. I am riding until the last lifts, doing everything I can. I have worked a lot harder than people who grew up in the mountains..” Although Britain has won Winter Olympic gold medals in disciplines including skating and skeleton, a traditional snowsport (ski or snowboard) gold has remained elusive. Snowboarder Jenny Jones claimed Britain’s historic first slopestyle bronze in Sochi in 2014, before Billy Morgan and Izzy Atkin won bronze in the snowboard big air and ski slopestyle events in 2018. Next month, in the slopestyle event, Ormerod will perform her repertoire of twists, jumps and flips on a skateboard-style course of ramps and obstacles. In the big air event she will speed down a monstrous 60m-high ramp at 40-50mph and launch off an 18.9m-high ledge before executing her tricks mid-air. Many pundits are quietly confident that Ormerod can go all the way. Ormerod had an inauspicious start to her sports career. Aged four, she flung herself out of a cardboard box at home and broke her nose. “My parents say they knew I would be an athlete as I was bouncing off the walls at home,” she laughs. “That’s why they took me to gymnastics. I then started snowboarding at five. My first memory is going off the big kicker at Halifax dry slope. Today, it seems really small. But when I was five, it was huge. I got a bit of air time and I loved it.” She also enjoyed winter holidays in Europe with her parents, Mark and Claire, who skied for fun, and her brother Harvey. But it was her love of gymnastics that would one day set her apart on the slopes, empowering her to perform the outrageous world-first tricks that have made her a YouTube star. Aged just 16, she became the first woman to perform a “backside double-cork 1080” – an iconic snowboard trick involving two 360-degree front flips and a full 360-degree corkscrew spin.
“I was a competitive gymnast until I was 16, but I was also part of a cheer squad at school and we were national champions,” she recalls. “When I was younger, I was Yorkshire [gymnastics] champion and in national finals. The two sports are similar in terms of spatial awareness and muscular strength so I still do tumbling, trampoline work and floor skills as part of my snowboard training.” Her snowboard performances are judged using similar criteria to gymnastics, including technical difficulty, execution, amplitude, landing, variety and progression (originality). But what made her choose snowboarding over gymnastics? “I just loved the lifestyle with snowboarding more,” says Ormerod, who claimed senior snowboard titles at the British Championships at just 14. “I loved the freedom, the creativity and the opportunities.” Hamish McKnight, GB Snowsport’s head snowboard coach, has worked with Ormerod since she was 13. “It was obvious with Katie from a young age that she was extremely talented,” he says. “Not just on a snowboard, but she also had an unusual work ethic. She had a very intense approach to practice and self-determination, which is rare nowadays.” In the brutal world of snowboarding, you also need luck. Injuries are inevitable. Ormerod has fractured her shoulder, broken both arms, snapped her anterior cruciate ligament and broken her back. But her cruellest setback came when she shattered her heel after coming off a rail in training only days before the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Her face muscles tighten a little when she recalls the searing pain as medics took two hours to cut her boot off. “I’ve had injuries in the past, but none compared to that pain,” she admits. “I was in shock that it was actually possible to feel so much pain.” During her agonising year of rehab she wondered if she would ever walk pain-free again. She was in a wheelchair for months, unable to walk or even wear shoes. When the flesh on her heel began to blacken and die, she had to have a chunk of skin from her hip and a lump of pig skin grafted on to it. She strived to remain positive, but it was tough. “I saw every gym rep and every physio session as one step closer to being back,” she says. “But I love what I do. And the love for that was bigger than the pain I was in. After nine months I was still limping and in pain. I knew if that pain didn’t go away I wouldn’t be able to snowboard. It was a really scary moment. But I was not going to give up. I had another operation to remove the pins, which were sticking into my Achilles and causing the pain. And when I did the rehab for that I knew instantly: I will be OK. I will snowboard again.”
When she returned for the 2019-20 season, Ormerod became the first Brit to win a slopestyle World Cup title and a much-coveted FIS Crystal Globe – a prestigious International Ski Federation award for the athlete who earns the most points during the season. Her coach was astonished. “Very simply, most athletes don’t come back from an injury like that,” McKnight admits. “Some injuries are expected. But Katie’s heel injury was a car crash incident.” Backed by £11.1m of UK Sport funding for the Beijing campaign, GB Snowsport is starting to catch up rival nations, thanks to skilled coaches, dedicated training camps and research into everything from wax analysis to aerodynamics. Ormerod can now practise her tricks on airbags, trampolines and foam pits with GB Snowsport’s acrobatics coach Ross Hill at the Graystone Action Sports centre in Manchester before attempting them on snow. And this creative innovation is her secret weapon. “Katie is trying to push the boundaries,” explains McKnight. “What we see in competition today will be bettered tomorrow. So it requires a lot of forward planning and discovery. She is always looking into the unknown.” Ormerod carefully conditions her body and mind for the impossible. Despite her petite 5ft 2in, 55kg frame, she can deadlift 80kg. She also spends hours visualising her new tricks, entering a meditative trance in which she pictures herself smoothly executing each move. “I have to be able to see it really clearly in my mind before I do it on snow,” she says. Studies involving brain scans and muscle analysis have revealed that when winter sports athletes visualise their performances they experience brain impulses and muscle contractions that closely mirror those experienced when actually riding, thereby strengthening the neural pathways which encode their new skills. Following her experiences, mental health has become a new focus for Ormerod and she now keeps a journal. “I write something every day: what went well; if I have an idea; something that I feel inspired about; if something went wrong and what I can learn from it,” she says. Most athletes would have lost confidence after such a bad injury, but Ormerod is performing bigger stunts than ever. “I had a whole year to visualise the kind of tricks I wanted to do,” she laughs. “That’s a lot of practice.”
Ormerod is impressively calm and analytical. McKnight insists that the adrenaline junkie stereotype is wrong. “Katie’s not fearless and she does get scared,” he says. “But she has an ability to embrace that fear and use it to analyse the right time to take risks.” Ormerod agrees that fear sharpens her mind. “I get really nervous at the top, but I know that’s fine because it usually pays off,” she explains. “I had good risk-assessment before, but I am extra-cautious now in terms of things like the speed of a jump. I always watch other people first and make sure that I know 100% what the best speed is.” Away from the slopes, Ormerod prefers a mellow lifestyle. Her Instagram feed is full of normal 20-something posts, from cartwheels in the garden to sunbathing in the park. She is diligently studying for a degree in sport coaching and development at Manchester Metropolitan University, and renovating her home, a Victorian property that she bought in 2020. “I got really into all the interior design, learning how to pull plaster off the wall and things like that,” she says. Her secret passion is West End musicals. “I recently went to see Moulin Rouge and Come From Away, but my favourites are Wicked, Phantom of the Opera and Bat out of Hell,” she says. “I have always liked music. I started learning the ukulele when I was 17 and I ordered a keyboard that gets delivered today.” It is strange to imagine Ormerod unleashing death-defying tricks on her snowboard one day, then writing essays and playing her ukulele the next. But this balance between all-action flamboyance and solitary pursuits is part of her success. “The snowboard training is quite intense, so it is nice to totally switch off,” she says. Ormerod’s deep commitment and passion for her sport is what has sustained her through all the setbacks and shattered bones. “I just want to have that Olympic experience at last, land the big tricks, and show people what I can do,” she says. “You can’t really replicate the feeling of it. You get a huge adrenaline rush and sense of freedom. I am in the zone, 100% focused. I don’t know what’s going on around me. It’s just me and the mountain.” Katie Ormerod is a Red Bull athlete";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/snowboarder-katie-ormerod-interview-recovery-from-injury-and-olympic-medal-hopes;sports

It came on after her second child, Hayden, was born on Christmas Day 2011. With two children under two, she sometimes wouldn’t leave the house for days at a time. “I didn’t know what was happening to me,” says Leach, 41, who lives in Stroud, Gloucestershire. “There was this overwhelming feeling of being really anxious and panicky.” She didn’t tell anyone – not even her partner or her mum. “I was embarrassed,” says Leach. “I felt alone.” Postnatal depression (PND) is common, and affects more than one in 10 women within a year of giving birth, but Leach did not know that at the time. Going to the supermarket or the park was hard work. She avoided crowds. “I was just surviving,” she says. “Getting through each day and keeping the children alive, and making sure they were fed and happy. I struggled to look after myself. I wouldn’t eat properly. It was all about them.” She lost a lot of weight.
Before she had children, Leach had always worked. She struggled with being at home full-time. “I had too much time to think,” she says. “I was on my own all day long with the kids. I wasn’t doing anything except looking after them. I’d worry about everything.” If the kids were ill, she would panic. She’d become terrified something would happen to her and she wouldn’t be able to look after them. One child hated going to her playgroup, so Leach would feel horrifically guilty every time she sent her there. She had always wanted children, so couldn’t understand why she felt so sad all the time. In spring 2013, Leach broke down in an emotional phone call to her mother. “I told her everything.” She told her husband not long afterwards. “It was a relief that people knew,” she says. “I didn’t have to keep making excuses for why I didn’t want to go places, or would leave early, or cancel at the last minute.” Leach was referred to local support group Mothers in Mind, run by Home-Start, a community network that helps families with young children.
She remembers her first meeting, in a Scout hut. “I didn’t want to go. We all sat around and had to introduce ourselves. I burst into tears and said, ‘I can’t do it.’” She struggled with feelings of guilt and shame: many women with PND feel as if they have failed their children or are not living up to societal expectations of proper parenting. “Before I had kids,” says Leach, “I used to think about how I couldn’t wait to stop working and stay home with my children. And then there was this big shock of being at home, and realising that I hated it.”
Over time, the support group became a lifeline. “It’s peer support. So many mums come in to the group, and make friends and help each other,” she says. “Everyone makes you feel so at ease.” Leach is now a volunteer facilitator with the group, using her experience to support other mums struggling with PND. She helps run two groups a week, and also assists with arts and crafts programmes. “She supported so many mums online during lockdown,” says Tracey Edwards of Home-Start, “as well as completing two mental health training courses, and home-schooling three children. She’s an inspiration to every mum in the group.” Such groups are a lifeline to women, particularly in an era of ever-constrained NHS budgets. Leach was given 12 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy for her PND. “It wasn’t enough,” she says. “They got me another two sessions, but that was it. They said that if you still need help, you’ll have to go back on the waiting list. But I didn’t feel better. It would have been nice to do CBT until I felt better.” At the group, Leach tells women there’s always hope. “There are people out there who feel like I did,” she says. “I want them to know it’s OK, and they won’t feel like this for ever.” After so many years of attending and then leading the group, Leach feels incredibly strongly about the power of community.
At Leach’s request, we arrange a spa day. “I never get to be pampered,” she says. The Greenway Hotel and Spa in Cheltenham offers her a complimentary spa package. “I didn’t know what to do with myself when I got there,” says Leach. “because I’m not used to that sort of thing. But when I relaxed I enjoyed it.” She swam in the pool, basked in the steam rooms, and had a facial and a massage. “It does you the world of good, doesn’t it?” says Leach. “I felt really happy afterwards. It was a bit of time for myself.” It is a fitting treat, says Leach, because the importance of taking time away from the kids often comes up in her support groups: “We always say to the mums, they need to find time for themselves. That’s what the group is all about: a space for them to sit and chat, a bit of time for them.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

1995;1995;1995;1995;2016;2016;Digital detox: Going cold turkey with no wifi in the Lake District;2022-01-22;['Gemma Bowes'];['Lake District holidays', 'Family holidays', 'Cottages', 'Wifi', 'Technology', 'Rest and relaxation', 'Health and fitness holidays', 'Travel', 'United Kingdom holidays', 'England holidays', 'Self-catering'];"“The question comes almost as soon as we step inside the remote cottage in the western Lake District: “Where’s the telly?” The door of the holiday cottage in Eskdale opens straight into the tiny lounge, and in the space where the TV should be there’s only a simple fireplace, a wooden bookcase stuffed with maps and nature books, and a couple of high-backed armchairs. “Well, can we go on the iPad then?” is the next request. Then, when they’re informed that no, we didn’t bring it, comes, “Can I go on your phone?” There is a look of confused disbelief on my children’s faces when I explain that there’s no internet, no computer, not even a phone signal, and that, in fact, we’re not going to be looking at screens of any sort for our entire week-long stay. They are young enough to not immediately kick off and storm out, but I imagine the scene would be rather different if they were teenagers.
Doing a digital detox wasn’t my main motivation for escaping to this remote hideaway – the thrilling scenery and sense of isolation are the big draws – but the lack of wifi is a huge bonus. Though my children are only six and eight, their predilection for screen-based entertainment is increasingly tiresome. They may not yet have their own mobiles or tablets, but the shows they like are streamed online, they long for free rein on YouTube, are desperate to join in the school craze for FitBits, and adore “doing funny faces” – creating long strings of emojis on my phone to text to their friends (or rather their friends’ parents, who are bombarded with messages of 200 watermelons). Most of their homework is done online. The digital world encroaches. Putting a complete, non-debatable stop to it for a while feels essential. I’m not alone in craving this. January’s flood of wellbeing-related travel publicity contains more mentions of digital detoxes than ever, with tour operators such as G Adventures predicting it as a huge trend, exacerbated by lockdowns. All that Zooming, digital home-schooling and Netflix-bingeing made it seem like every aspect of our existence was lived online. Many of us feel screen-sick, desperate to disconnect.
My family’s antidote in recent years has been to escape to various off-grid Cumbrian cottages: this is our second stay at National Trust-owned Bird How, which is on a quiet lane that ends at the next farm. It is basic. The mattresses are hellish – a detail much lamented in the visitors’ books – and there’s no bathroom, only a sani loo in a cobwebby space beneath the cottage, accessed from the outside (no fun at 3am in torrential rain), and a shower bag that you fill from the kitchen tap (there is hot water and electricity) and hook up outside, in view of the occasional rambler. All of this creates a sense of adventure, of course, and with no other building in sight, it feels like you have this phenomenal valley to yourself. After their initial shock, the kids get by without watching Avatar: The Last Airbender with surprising ease. We hang out in the wild garden, through which a small stream trickles, with novels and colouring books, and eat on a picnic bench under the tree. We go hiking, and my daughter embraces wild swimming, throwing herself into freezing Eskdale pools, secret canyons in neighbouring Duddon valley and any filthy-looking moorland pond. At night we watch for bats and the bright headlamps of drivers tackling the terrifying Hardknott Pass above: they sometimes bob slowly down in reverse when they lose their nerve. As the week goes on, complaints about the lack of screens are more easily quashed by the suggestion of a game of Uno or a walk to the Brook House Inn for ice-cream.
The surrounding fields come into their own for imaginary play, even if it is TV-inspired – I spend a huge amount of time pretending to be wildlife presenter Steve Backshall chasing rare animals – but at least we’re tearing down grassy slopes and scrambling along streams in the process. My partner and I take turns to go out running, and on one of mine, up a bracken-choked path on the valley’s opposite flank, I call across to the others, barely visible at the cottage. I’m overjoyed to catch their hoots of response on the wind, so take off my jumper and wave it madly like a flag, rewarded by the blur of red cloth their ant-sized forms wave back. This rudimentary communication, not unlike that used by Roman soldiers stationed nearby at Hardknott Fort 2,000 years ago, gives me a burst of happiness no number of Instagram likes could match. It may be tougher to convince older children and teenagers that a spell with no wifi is a good thing, but growing awareness of the mental-health benefits of switching off, studies of the detrimental effects on adolescent brains of social media and overuse of technology, and the way wellbeing is in vogue may make them less resistant than you might expect. Many have embraced mindfulness, yoga and veganism – why not this? When our tech habits are so deeply ingrained, we can’t rely on flaccid promises to use our phones a bit less. Going somewhere like Bird How means there’s no choice. Perhaps like dry January, we must force these experiences on ourselves. A cold turkey digital detox can’t be argued with, especially when it comes with such appealing trimmings.

2012;2012;2012;2012;2033;2033;Scents and sensibility: what’s behind the rise of extreme smells?;2022-01-22;['Imogen West-Knights'];['Fragrance', 'Life and style', 'Fashion', 'Makeup'];"One night last week, I sat in my kitchen with my eyes closed, inhaling the rich, earthy scent of tomatoes. I felt transported: I was in an Italian garden, sun-dappled leaves swaying as I picked the plump, ripe fruit for a late pasta dinner with my large and beautiful family. I was, in essence, one of the puppets from the Dolmio adverts. But the smell wasn’t coming from a tomato. It was coming from a candle. How did they make it smell so real? I called my boyfriend over to share in this miracle. He put his face right over the flame, said that it smelled like burnt nose hair and quickly lost interest. But I remained tickled by this magic trick. A candle, that smells like tomatoes! There is something in the air at the moment, and it’s not just vine tomato candles: ever more eclectic smells – from the uplifting to the downright bizarre – have been making their way into perfume and candles. Is it a consequence of having been so smell-starved, so downright bored during the pandemic? An increased desire for the things we buy to give us experiences beyond mere enjoyment? And why do people want to smell weird stuff? Our interest in these smells has now spread outside our homes and into our cultural, public spaces. The past year alone has seen: an exhibition of floating machines perfumed with smells of coal, marine life and vegetation at Tate Modern; a gallery in the Hague infused with the fishy odour of a 17th-century Dutch canal; and a dedicated olfactory art space launched in New York. Olfactory art is far from new. Coffee beans were roasted behind a screen to create “the smell of Brazil” at the International Surrealist Exhibition of 1938. And let’s not forget the experiential dining experience at places like El Bulli and the Fat Duck at the start of this century. But the fact that we still view it as something of a novelty suggests we still view smell as a lesser sense. Novelty scents have been around for a while. In the US, Demeter Fragrance Library was established in 1996 selling perfumes based on everyday scents. It started with Dirt, Grass and Tomato, and has since expanded into more unusual smells like Play-Doh, New Car and Funeral Home. Yankee Candles’ off-the-wall options have included Bacon, Schnitzel with Noodles, and something rather unnervingly called Man Town.
Anya Hindmarch sells candles that smell like pencil shavings and chewing gum. D. S. and Durga make several weird scents, including one called Burning Barbershop, which is supposed to smell like a specific barbershop in New York state that caught fire. I’ve never been, but the pleasing woody smell made me want to. Recent years have seen a rise in avant garde scents and more prosaic smells, says fragrance writer, Lizzie Ostrom. Perfumed goods used to be about beauty and vanity, she says. “But now we’re thinking, ooh, what is it that a fragrance can do? And what sorts of fragrances might I like that aren’t just the usual scents that I thought I wanted to wear?” Surprisingly, it seems the pandemic only increased our olfactory desire. We didn’t have any nights out to smell nice for, yet somehow the fragrance industry didn’t suffer at all – perfume sales were up 45% in the first quarter of this year. “I think people discovered that fragrance was not just for someone else to smell and admire, but is primarily a personal experience, with the power to make you feel good about yourself,” said public relations specialist Daniel Williams.
Scented candles saw a huge boost in sales, too. Deprived of many kinds of stimulation – including smells other than that of our own homes or our breath inside a face mask, it’s no wonder we turned to scented candles. If we were going to be stuck in our homes 23 hours a day, we might as well make home a nice place to be. One of the many unhinged habits I developed during the winter lockdown was sitting in my bed holding a scented candle in both hands, breathing deeply from the flame and thinking, “what am I doing?” Looking back, I think my nose was hungry. Loss of smell as a side-effect of Covid has been a common experience in the past 18 months, and people who regain their sense of smell often report that it comes back in patchy, faulty ways – smelling things that aren’t there, or favourite foods now smelling like sewage. Doctors have recommended “smell training” : buying essential oils and sniffing them repeatedly as a sort of nose physio to try to retrain the body to sense aromas. Remedies for smell loss trending on social media include eating burnt oranges. “Getting their sense of smell back has for millions of people a real source of relief and joy – and perhaps now they’re wanting to really explore,” Ostrom said.
Vegetables are having a moment – as well as the Urban Apothecary vine tomato candle that so impressed me, I could have a Loewe room spray that smelled like coriander or beetroot – but there are also candles that smell of chlorine, and perfumes with a base note of asphalt. And all the talk of everyday smells magically replicated at the light of a wick or the pump of an atomizer has a touch of 1999 about it, of scratch-and-sniff cards, and dorky experiments with Smell-o-vision. Last year, a lingerie brand released a range of “pillow mists”, supposedly designed to help you sleep, that smelled like celebrities such as Harry Styles and Maya Jama. Hotels, cars, sports stadiums have “signature scents”. McDonald’s did a line of Quarter Pounder-scented candles in February 2020. Products are also increasingly taking inspiration, although one hopes not ingredients, from the human body. There’s the infamous Goop vagina candle, of course, but that’s nothing compared with a scent called Vulva Original. The Amazon listing promises “intense scent of a vagina”, and it has some of the more disturbing reviews I’ve read in my time, including: “I have met several girls and I know what that smells like …” But for something truly out there, Etat Libre d’Orange’s Sécrétions Magnifiques is just the thing. The scent claims to smell of blood, sweat, sperm and saliva, and reviewers describe it as “upsetting”, “completely unwearable”, and like “sweaty debauchery in the locker room of an indoor pool with rusty metal ladders”.
How much is this all just gimmick, simply another way to sell us stuff? Prof. David Howes, director of the Centre for Sensory Studies in Montreal and co-author of Aroma: The Cultural History of Smell, is rightly sceptical of this sort of marketing strategy, which relies on dodgy science about smell appealing to a primitive part of our brains: “The idea is that marketers can get under the conscious defences of the cerebral cortex by using smell to market things, which I think is rubbish. That kind of physiological reductionism is really just another marketing ploy.” Still, we ought to be wary of crying gimmick at any unusual smell experiences – and scents in art galleries – because we’re not trained to take smell seriously. Because of the Proustian madeleine moment, we in the west tend to connect smells with memories and emotions. We don’t think of, say, communication, or knowledge. Philosophers Aristotle, Kant and Hegel believed that the sense of smell it should be considered below sight and hearing, and Freud had almost a horror of smell, referring to it as something that we needed to move beyond now that we were no longer going around on all fours like dogs. Howes goes as far to say that we live in an odour-phobic society. “Witness all of our deodorising and then re-odourising rituals: the morning shower followed by adding all these artificial scents.” Why should smell remain such a neglected sense? Why should people wear one perfume but have a wardrobe full of clothes, several Spotify playlists, and eat different meals every night but balk at filling their living rooms with different scents? Just as we can learn to like fine whisky and coffee, we can learn to appreciate stranger smells – and perhaps should. “Our noses are woefully uneducated now,” Howes told me, “and I’m very much in favour of liberating the nose. It has been kept down for too long.” Last week, I came across a scent called Stercus. Made by perfumer Allessandro Gualtieri, Stercus is Latin for dung. “He [Gualtieri] is eccentric to say the least,” said Daniel Williams of the PR agency. “You’re sitting there at a press launch and when you ask him what the smell is based around, he tells you it’s his anus.”
When this bottle – which I’m sorry to have to tell you is brown – arrived at my flat, I interrupted my housemate watching a documentary about space and asked him to smell it with me. I gave it a couple of spritzes, and waited. “It’s like if you used a leather bag to steal a load of vanilla candles” he said, confusion on his face. I told him what the special note was, and we both sat there sniffing the air and thinking about arseholes. “I kind of like it,” he said. If you didn’t know what the scent’s origin was, you wouldn’t necessarily suspect, although there is an unmistakable note of the farmyard about it. Maybe all this is only the beginning. Maybe in 50 years’ time, when we’re stinking to high heaven of all manner of as-yet unimaginable futuristic smells, we’ll look back and think: “Chewing gum candles? Anus perfume? That’s nothing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/22/scents-and-sensibility-whats-behind-the-rise-of-extreme-smells;entertainment and culture
2047;2047;2047;2047;2068;2068;‘I cried all day’: the anguish of people locked out of Japan by Covid;2022-01-22;['Justin McCurry'];['Japan', 'Coronavirus', 'World news'];"Late last year, Pablo Ortez quit his job, sold his belongings and prepared to join his wife in Japan, where she is studying for a doctorate. But 72 hours before he was due to leave Argentina, he checked the Japanese foreign ministry website to find that the government had imposed a near-blanket travel ban to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. “I called the Japanese embassy and they said I couldn’t fly,” said Ortez, who has moved in with his mother and does not know when he will be able to join his wife, whom he has not seen since she visited Argentina last April. The 33-year-old is one of tens of thousands of people with plans to study, work or join relatives in Japan who now find themselves “locked out” of a country that has maintained some of the world’s strictest travel restrictions throughout the pandemic. The latest measures, imposed at the end of November, apply to all arrivals except Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents – new students, guest workers, technical interns and, in some cases, the foreign spouses and children of Japanese nationals. Lewis Hussey had set his heart on studying in Japan before he graduates from university this summer. But the travel ban means the Missouri-based student has had to drastically rethink his plans.
“It’s incredibly disappointing,” Hussey, 26, said. “There have been times when it looked like Japan was about to open up, and then it didn’t. It’s frustrating because I could have considered other places. I feel like I’ve been cheated out of the opportunity to study abroad because of the inconsistent and nonsensical approach of the Japanese government.” The World Health Organization has urged countries not to impose blanket travel bans, warning that they were ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus and created economic and social misery. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, is unlikely to make significant changes to the border policy, however, after a recent poll showed 88% of the public believed the measure was “appropriate”. But it has not prevented Omicron from taking hold in Japan, which reported a record 46,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday. This weekend, large parts of the country, including Tokyo, will enter a quasi-state of emergency to relieve pressure on health services. Japan has imposed tight travel restrictions throughout the pandemic, with moves to relax them quickly undone by waves of infections driven by new variants. The only exception came last summer, when tens of thousands of athletes, officials and journalists arrived for the Tokyo Olympics. Aware of how mismanagement of the pandemic helped topple his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, Kishida is hoping that travel restrictions will play well among voters during upper house elections in July. Kishida recently said the ban would be extended until the end of February, but Jade Barry is bracing herself for more delays.
The 29-year-old was poised to fulfil her professional ambition of expanding her hairpiece business when the latest ban went into effect, forcing her to drop plans to scout locations in Tokyo for her new outlet. “I was devastated,” Barry said from her home near Chicago. “I cried all day and my kids were wondering what was wrong with mom. “I have been in love with Japan since I was little. Expanding my business there was a way of realising my ultimate goal of starting a life there. I still believe it’s a beautiful country, but to be banned for so long means I feel resentment towards the government.” Stranded students have found little sympathy among Japanese politicians but have received support from some business leaders, who say the ban will stifle innovation and threaten Japan’s long-term interests as more students look to other countries, including economic rivals such as South Korea.
Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of the e-commerce group Rakuten, has likened the ban to the isolation brought by the sakoku “locked country” policy during the Edo period (1603-1868). On the day Kishida extended the restrictions, Mikitani tweeted: “What is the point of not letting in new foreigners now? Do you want to shut Japan off from the rest of the world?” A letter to Kishida signed this week by hundreds of academics and experts in Japan-US studies, urged his government to relax border controls to allow educators, students and scholars to enter Japan. “They become the bridges between Japan and other societies. They are future policymakers, business leaders and teachers,” the letter said. “They are the foundation of the US-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japan’s core national interests. The closure is harming Japan’s national interests and international relationships.” “It’s frustrating,” said Imane, a 20-year-old Canadian student who has waited two years to begin her Japanese-language studies in Tokyo. “It’s been two years of wasting time, waiting for Japan to open its borders. “I love Japan so this is heartbreaking, but I can’t spend my whole life waiting,” added Imane, who preferred to use only her first name. “If Japan doesn’t open its borders this year I’m going to have to look elsewhere.” Her frustrations are shared by Vilhelm, a student from Lithuania, who gets up at 4.30am for online classes in international business studies at a university in Tokyo.
“The most frustrating part is that I can see no end to this,” said Vilhelm, who asked that his surname not be used. “I’ve invested in studying in Japan and I feel like it is treating me very unfairly. I still love Japan, but sometimes I forget why.” Barry took to social media to rally students and other stranded people behind a campaign to end the restrictions, with protests outside Japanese embassies planned for later this month. “To have the opportunity to come to Japan ripped away is devastating. And I can’t imagine what it’s like not to be able to see your child because of border restrictions. The uncertainty is no longer acceptable. This is literally ruining people’s lives.” The government responded to mounting criticism by opening the door, if only by a fraction. It will allow 87 students on government scholarships to enter in February, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said last week. But that leaves almost 150,000 others, mostly privately funded, who have been waiting up to two years to begin their studies. They will continue to live in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to begin their new lives in a country that has effectively become a Covid hermit kingdom. “Japan is damaging its soft power and its economy because it is punishing people who have a genuine interest in the country,” Ortez said. “It’s ruining its reputation. This will have long-term consequences for Japan.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/i-cried-all-day-the-anguish-of-people-locked-out-of-japan-by-covid;environment
2054;2054;2054;2054;2075;2075;Average UK first-time buyer is now older than 30, says Halifax;2022-01-22;['Richard Partington'];['First-time buyers', 'Housing market', 'Business', 'Property', 'Money', 'UK news', 'Real estate', 'House prices', 'Help-to-buy scheme', 'Mortgages'];"The average age for joining the property ladder in Britain has risen to above 30 in every region of the country, as surging house prices mean first-time buyers must save for longer before they can afford their own home. Halifax, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender, said the national average for a first home purchase had risen to 32 in 2021 from 29 a decade earlier, and was above 30 for every region. Despite a record year for growth in first-time buyers, with an increase of more than a third compared with 2020, it said rising average house prices meant waiting longer to become a homeowner than in previous generations.
The average age remains highest in London, at 33, although it has only risen by a year in the past decade. Other regions have recorded a sharper increase, including a three-year jump in Wales to 31, and a rise of two years to 30 and 31 in the north-east and north-west of England. Esther Dijkstra, the mortgage director at Halifax, said the difficulty of raising a deposit, rising property prices and changing lifestyle factors were pushing back the date at which people bought their first home. “Over time more people have chosen to go on to higher education, go travelling, or move around for work, which are all factors in the increase in first-time buyer age,” she said. “However, undoubtedly, the biggest drivers are the cost of homes and the need to save a significant deposit to get on the housing ladder. In 2021, the increase in average house price to £264,140, combined with difficulties in raising a deposit, meant that the gap between purchase price and deposit widened in every region in the UK.” Halifax said the number of people buying their first home rose at a record rate in 2021, soaring by 35% to 409,370 – the biggest jump on records dating back to 2006 – despite surging property prices. Dijkstra said it was clear the government’s stamp duty holiday (which applies in England and Northern Ireland) had increased the availability of first-rung homes as others moved up the property ladder. First-time buyers already benefited from full relief when purchasing a home worth up to £300,000 and a reduced rate up to £500,000.
The figures come as ministers push to support first-time buyers, including through the government’s help-to-buy scheme. The Bank of England is also considering watering down mortgage affordability rules in a development that could help more people on to the property ladder. Rates of homeownership among young adults have fallen dramatically in recent decades, plunging from a peak of 51% in 1989 to just 25% in 2016, according to the Resolution Foundation. Rates have risen slightly in recent years to 28% in 2019. Halifax said the price of an average first-time buyer home was less than four times the average income – considered the limit for affordability under rules set by UK financial regulators – in just 15 local authorities.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/22/average-uk-first-time-buyer-is-now-older-than-30-says-halifax;business and economy

Replying on Twitter to a Reuters story that Tonga could be without internet connection for a month, the billionaire entrepreneur wrote: “Could people from Tonga let us know if it is important for SpaceX to send over Starlink terminals?” The tweet soon went viral as Tongans from all over the world replied with pleas for help to reestablish communication to contact families and coordinate assistance. Tongan politician Lord Fusitu’a responded by saying: “Yes we need them to get liquidity in to purchase much-needed goods. Voice and data completely down with undersea cable severed.” Fusitu’a also tweeted that he was organizing an airdrop of ham radio for basic communications, and requested for direct contact with Musk to coordinate assistance. Other members of the Tongan community responded positively to Musk’s tweet, including Josephine Latu-Sanft, a Tongan communications specialist, who wrote: “I don’t know the details of what Starlink can do, but I know you have the technology and means to help.” She suggested giving people internet until the undersea cable is repaired, then working with partners to establish robust communications infrastructure across disaster-vulnerable Pacific. In response, Musk wrote: “This is a hard thing for us to do right now, as we don’t have enough satellites with laser links and there are already geo sats that serve the Tonga region. That is why I’m asking for clear confirmation.” Communications are still down in Tonga except for satellite phones and limited internet access for a handful of officials and media. The exchange comes after the New Zealand MP Shane Reti wrote to Musk requesting he provide Starlink internet communications to Tonga to assist in recovery efforts.

2115;2115;2115;2115;2137;2137;Boris Johnson’s history is catching up with him, says Welsh first minister;2022-01-21;['Steven Morris'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Mark Drakeford', 'Politics', 'Welsh politics', 'UK news', 'Wales', 'England'];"The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has launched a fierce attack on Boris Johnson, claiming “his history is catching up with him” and suggesting the easing of Covid restrictions in England is designed to distract attention from the crisis the prime minister is facing. In sustained criticism of Johnson, Drakeford highlighted that Johnson had twice been sacked from previous jobs for lying and said he believed that everything the Conservative UK government was currently doing was about protecting his position.
Speaking at a press conference in Cardiff, Drakeford, who leads a Labour administration, said: “The prime minister is someone who’s been sacked from two previous jobs for not telling the truth.” He flagged up a newspaper editorial on the eve of the December 2019 election that spelled out Johnson’s flaws, adding: “In many ways, I think what you see is his history catching up with him.” It is believed he was referring to a Sunday Times editorial that said Johnson had an “on-off relationship with the truth” and often preferred “bluster to grasp of detail”. In 2004 Johnson was fired by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, from positions as shadow arts minister and party vice-chair for lying about an extramarital affair. In the late 1980s, Johnson was sacked by the Times over a front-page article in which he allegedly invented a quote. Drakeford claimed the decision this week to lift coronavirus restrictions in England was about distracting the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing Johnson. “Everything that goes on in Whitehall and Westminster at the moment for the UK government is seen exclusively through the lens of: how does this make a difference to the efforts that are being made to shore up the position of the prime minister? “This is a government that at the moment is simply not capable of doing the ordinary business of government in a competent and sensible way because it is overwhelmed by the headlines that surround dreadful events that went on in Downing Street.” Drakeford said Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron storm and more restrictions such as limits on sporting events have been lifted. The country is due to return to alert level 0 – under which more restrictions are eased – on 28 January as long as the situation continues to improve. The first minister’s attack on Johnson was in turn strongly criticised by the Tories, who accused him of playing politics and trying to distract people from the ongoing restrictions in Wales. The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: “These are completely unnecessary and inappropriate comments by the first minister and is further proof that it’s always been about the politics, and not the science, for his Labour administration. “They are a straightforward deflection tactic from a government that has punished Welsh families and businesses with the harshest restrictions in the UK throughout the pandemic.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/boris-johnson-history-catching-up-welsh-first-minister-drakeford;politics

About to take a flight to LA, she took a PCR test to check for Covid – and it came back positive. But it wasn’t her first infection, or even her second. Walton had tested positive for the fourth time. “I thought, surely, I could never get it again,” she said. The 20-year-old student nurse in the north-east of England caught her first infection in September 2020, shortly before she left for university. “This was the point where everyone knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who had Covid,” she said. “But no one knew someone that had Covid … It was kind of like, no one believed in it, because everyone was like, ‘Well, I’ve never seen anyone [with it].’” At the time, Walton was working in a pub and wearing a face mask. “I hadn’t left the house other than to go to work because I was working nine hours every day, coming home, getting up, going back to work,” she said. “I started to feel a tiny bit rundown, runny nose, and stuff – but I have allergies anyway. So I assumed it was an allergy.” Walton was persuaded by her mother to take a PCR test. The result was positive. “I just isolated in my room,” she said. At the end of January 2021, both of Walton’s parents caught Covid. She took care to avoid contact, leaving takeaways just inside their front door, but a few days later she had to take a Covid test before starting her nursing placement. The PCR came back positive. The third infection came several weeks later. When a family friend fell very ill with Covid in Brussels in February that year, Walton flew out to help with childcare. On leaving the UK she had a negative PCR test. But her return was delayed. “I went to get my PCR to go home and it came back positive,” she said. While Walton didn’t feel unwell for her second and third infections, bar a bit of a runny nose the second time, the fourth infection was different, bringing flu-like symptoms a couple of days after testing positive. Walton, who is double-vaccinated and awaiting her booster, suggested there is an irony to her story. “The funniest thing about it all, really, is every time I’ve had it I’ve never been near a hospital. But all the time I’ve been working with Covid patients I’ve never got it,” she said.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/the-uk-student-nurse-who-has-caught-covid-four-times;health
2121;2121;2121;2121;2143;2143;Tory whips allegedly tried to smear Christian Wakeford after defection;2022-01-21;['Rowena Mason', 'Aubrey Allegretti', 'Heather Stewart'];['Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'House of Commons', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Conservative ministers and whips began spreading rumours about Christian Wakeford’s personal life minutes after the MP defected to Labour, it has been alleged amid growing concerns over dirty tactics in politics. The Guardian has been told that senior members of the government spread the rumours in parliament after the MP for Bury South crossed the floor on Wednesday. On Friday night it was reported that the senior Tory MP William Wragg would meet a detective from Scotland Yard next week to discuss what he claimed was attempted blackmail and intimidation of some colleagues suspected of opposing Boris Johnson. He told the Telegraph that he was speaking to police as he wanted to leave any investigation of these claims “to the experts” rather than No 10. Johnson has said he had “seen no evidence” of such threats. A Labour source said the party had prepared Wakeford before his defection for the possibility of the Tories or hostile media trying to dig around in his private life.
Asked about the allegation that there was an attempt to smear Wakeford, a government source said: “It would be unacceptable. The chief whip [Mark Spencer] wouldn’t condone that behaviour at all. It’s not a practice that would be employed at all. It’s true there was shock and disappointment at a defection but that doesn’t ever cross into smearing other people.” Since defecting, Wakeford has also alleged that party whips told him he would lose funding for a new high school in his constituency if he did not vote with the government. There were also reports on Thursday that rebel Tory MPs were considering releasing details of text messages and a recording of their dealings with the party’s whips. Following the spotlight on the tactics of the whips, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said allegations of blackmail by government whips against Tory rebels needed to be investigated – but were unlikely to be true. Speaking to Sky News, Kwarteng said: “Any form of blackmail and intimidation of that kind simply has no place in British politics.” He added: “We need to get to the bottom of the matter. I’d find it very unlikely that these allegations are true.” But one Tory MP said: “Blackmail is not just about money for constituencies, it’s tittle tattle, personal things, affairs or who’s been to a lockdown party. At the far end it’s corruption and misconduct in a public office – on the other it’s a breach of the ministerial code. Either way it’s a resignation issue. “The culture comes from the top – it’s learned, bullying behaviour. Unless you stand up to bullies, they carry on.” Another MP from the 2019 intake also stepped forward anonymously to say they felt they had been threatened and bullied when they rebelled in a vote last spring. They said that threats about ministerial careers were perfectly normal but that they were told “it would be a shame” if their constituency did not get the towns’ funding it had asked for. “I complained to another MP, they said that’s outrageous – the whips have no such powers, it’s just one of their tactics.” The MP said they did not think Johnson was to blame and that it was not widely known about, but a tactic employed by some individual whips, adding: “They’re empty threats, but it is unacceptable – it’s a form of bullying.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/tory-whips-allegedly-tried-to-smear-christian-wakeford-after-defection;politics
2145;2145;2145;2145;2167;2167;Rare photo of Charles Dickens sporting ‘glorious’ moustache goes on show;2022-01-21;['Alison Flood'];"['Charles Dickens', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Fiction', 'Heritage', 'Photography', 'Museums', 'Men', 'Life and style', ""Men's hair"", 'Beauty', 'Fashion']";"Summon up an image of Charles Dickens, and his luxuriant “doorknocker” beard will be one of the first things to come to mind. But an “extremely rare” portrait of the author, depicting the “glorious” moustache he sported for few years only, is set to show his more dapper side. Dickens is thought to have first experimented with a moustache in 1844, and seems to have been immensely pleased with the new look. “The moustaches are glorious, glorious. I have cut them shorter, and trimmed them a little at the ends to improve their shape,” he wrote to his friend, the artist Daniel Maclise. “They are charming, charming. Without them, life would be a blank.” Later, on discovering that his brother Fred had also become moustachioed, Dickens wrote to his wife, Catherine: “He has a moustache … I feel (as the Stage Villains say) that either he or I must fall. Earth will not hold us both.”
A sharp, detailed daguerreotype profile portrait of Dickens sporting his moustache was made in around 1852-55, when he was writing Bleak House and Hard Times. It was donated to the Charles Dickens Museum in London by a private collector last year, and the museum has put it on display for the first time, until 31 March, limiting the time it is shown to ensure its conservation. The image had previously been in the private collection for 20 years, after it was rediscovered in the collection of a reclusive Irish photography enthusiast, Charles Cloney. Emily Smith, the museum’s curator, said the portrait was “extremely rare”. “A moustachioed Dickens is hard to find,” she said. “While his bearded visage in instantly recognisable, Dickens’s early experiments with face furniture are far less well recorded and evidence is scarce. Dickens was image-conscious, definitely a dandy; his public image was carefully crafted and presented and portrait sittings, though not always enjoyed, were not taken lightly.” Not everyone was impressed by the author’s new look, however. According to British Library curator Andrea Lloyd, Dickens’s friend John Forster described the moustache as a “hideous disfigurement”, and delayed a portrait of the author that he had commissioned because of it.
The moustache, however, developed: by 1853, Dickens had added a “Newgate Fringe”, or hair under the chin. Travelling in Italy with Wilkie Collins, author of The Woman in White and The Moonstone, the pair entered a facial hair-growing competition. Dickens wrote to his wife Catherine: “You remember how the corners of his mouth go down, and how he looks through his spectacles and manages his legs. I don’t know how it is, but the moustache is a horrible aggravation of all this. He smooths it down over his mouth, in imitation of the present great Original.” By 1858, it had mushroomed into the full beard he is known for today – something which friends feared aged Dickens. But the author said it “saved him the trouble of shaving, and much as he admired his own appearance before he allowed his beard to grow, he admired it much more now, and never neglected, when an opportunity offered, to gaze his fill at himself”. The Charles Dickens Museum’s daguerreotype was made by John Jabez Edwin Mayall at his 224 Regent Street studio. His technique involved covering the centre of the image with “blackened zinc” before exposing the whole image to light, which wiped out all details except for those protected by the zinc. “The technique produced highly detailed images,” said the Charles Dickens Museum, which is at 48 Doughty Street, Dickens’s only surviving London house. “In the Mayall portrait, Dickens’s tousled hair, broad moustache and the individual lines around his eyes and mouth and on his forehead are vividly reproduced.” Writing to his friend, philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, in 1852, Dickens spoke of how he had sat for a portrait with Mayall, saying that “I am disposed to think the portrait, by far the best specimen of anything that way, I have ever seen.”";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/21/rare-photo-of-charles-dickens-sporting-glorious-moustache-goes-on-show;entertainment and culture
2161;2161;2161;2161;2183;2183;London NHS hospitals bought £36m of services from US healthcare firm HCA last year;2022-01-21;['Julia Kollewe'];['NHS', 'Private healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Health', 'Society', 'London', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'Cancer', 'Health policy', 'Business'];"London NHS hospitals struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic bought £36m of cancer care, cardiology and other services directly from the UK’s largest private healthcare group, HCA, last year. Analysis of monthly public data from NHS trusts, published by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), reveals the extent to which London hospitals have become reliant on private providers, prompting concerns about creeping backdoor privatisation of the health service. “Covid has been very much used as a cover for shrinking NHS care and expanding private healthcare provision,” said Allyson Pollock, a clinical professor of public health at Newcastle University and an honorary professor at University College London. She said the money would be better used to invest in NHS staffing, equipment and expansion.
This level of spending by individual NHS trusts was unprecedented for cancer care and cardiology, said CHPI. The spending is over and above the £2bn so far handed over from central NHS budgets to private hospitals during the pandemic. In recent years NHS hospitals have bought extra capacity from private providers for simple procedures such as hip and knee operations, but they have not previously spent large sums outsourcing more complex treatments. HCA said its support had allowed 14,000 complex cardiac and cancer NHS patients to receive the care they needed. Many of them were casualties of the widespread suspension of normal care during the pandemic, as resources were diverted away from many specialisms, including cancer, to treat Covid-19 patients. By outsourcing some of the most pressing cases on their backlog to HCA, trusts ensured that those most in need were cared for. Prior to the pandemic, HCA carried out virtually no work for the NHS. Founded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1968, and listed on the New York stock exchange, HCA is the largest healthcare company in the world and has more than 30 hospitals and clinics in London and Manchester, with another one due to open in Birmingham this year. CHPI’s research shows the company was the biggest private beneficiary of funds spent on cancer care and cardiology direct from NHS hospital trusts in London between December 2020 and December 2021. The biggest spender was Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust, which bought more than £20m of services from HCA. Barts was the second largest spender, with £10m. University College London hospital (UCLH), Imperial College, Chelsea and Westminster, and the Royal Free also paid for HCA services. “The extent to which the private sector is now being used to deliver NHS cancer care services is unprecedented,” said David Rowland, the director of the CHPI. “We estimate it is only likely to grow as the NHS comes under more pressure over the next few months.” HCA said it had chosen not to take part in a deal struck between NHS England and private hospitals this month for up to £525m for reserve beds and staff in case of an Omicron admissions surge. A spokesperson for the firm’s UK arm said: “We can safely provide this level of complex care because of the deep clinical infrastructure we have in our hospitals, which includes the highest levels of intensive care and trained staffing support. We work with NHS trusts on an individual basis and in response to their requests for support.” The fees the London NHS trusts paid to HCA were covered either by NHS England, which has agreed to pay private hospitals £10bn over four years to help tackle its backlog, or from the Treasury-funded elective recovery fund, created last summer to help hospitals recover their levels of activity post pandemic. Guy’s and St Thomas’ said the money had been mainly spent on oncology and cardiology, as waiting lists had risen during the pandemic. A record 6 million people are on NHS waiting lists for routine hospital care in England. A trust spokesperson said: “We have worked with HCA to provide complex elective care from admission to discharge, including surgery and supporting diagnostic services, such as scans, while continuing to maintain urgent and emergency care to Covid and non-Covid patients on our NHS sites.” Barts Health NHS trust mainly bought cardiology and breast cancer surgery services from HCA. A Barts spokesperson said: “The trust has used HCA to enable staff to continue to provide planned care in a separate Covid-free environment while hospitals prioritised urgent and emergency care and Covid-19 patients.” He added that as the pandemic eased, it was likely that Barts would continue to use the private sector to assist with reducing waiting times.
UCLH spent almost £3m with HCA last year, buying more than 500 procedures, most of them surgery for breast, head, neck, bladder and stomach cancers. Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust spent £2.6m. Chelsea and Westminster hospital bought nearly £900,000 of services from the company, while the Royal free hospital spent £2,000. Chelsea and Westminster said it used HCA mainly to provide colorectal and gynaecology cancer treatment to patients, primarily between December 2020 and March 2021. “This short-term measure must not become a long-term expediency to running down the NHS in favour of the private sector,” said Colin Hutchinson, the chair of the campaign group Doctors for the NHS. “The principal reason the NHS now needs to make use of the private sector is because of long-term underinvestment.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/london-nhs-hospitals-bought-36m-of-services-from-us-healthcare-firm-hca-last-year;health
2177;2177;2177;2177;2199;2199;Now the mini is back is it time I finally embraced black tights? | Jess Cartner-Morley;2022-01-21;['Jess Cartner-Morley'];['Fashion', 'Life and style', 'Tights and socks'];"Black tights are fashion Marmite. If you love them, you look forward to the first brisk September or October day when it is acceptable to stop pretending that “late summer” exists on these shores and layer a thick pair of tights under your dress. You have strong views on optimum denier count and can debate the relative merits of Falke and Wolford at length. You could happily give a Ted talk on the whether the Edie Sedgwick modern jazz vibe of a matte pair is more chic than the lustre of a velvet or satin finish. The other camp – my camp – would sooner brave horizontal snow and sleet bare-legged than be seen dead in a pair. In fashion, not wearing tights has long been a badge of honour. Around the time that tottering around in high heels all day stopped signalling elegance and began to make you look a bit deranged, going bare-legged took over as the style set’s equivalent of a club tie. Going bare-legged through winter requires a high tolerance for windchill and, depending on your skin colour, a time-consuming fake-tan habit. Still, the bare-legged brigade eschew tights because we think it looks better.
I suppose this is all an elaborate justification for the fact that I stopped wearing tights because no one else on the front row was wearing them and they felt kind of scruffy. Going bare-legged made me feel like a contender. Style is a way of insisting on something, as Susan Sontag said, and black tights felt like giving up, like throwing in the towel. In the noughties, when Prada was all about a knee-length skirt, and through the 2010s, when the midi skirt ruled, going bare-legged didn’t mean being cold. I could wear ankle boots with socks, a long-ish skirt and a coat, and I was technically bare-legged but only a tiny bit of flesh was exposed.
But now the mini is back. Not just in the theoretical, fashion-week sense, but in real life. Skirts and dresses are shorter – on magazine covers and in shop windows but also on the street, on the bus, in the park. And going without tights while wearing a skirt that ends above the knee calls for a double dose of bravery, not only in the face of cold but in feeling exposed and naked. Which is why, while hemlines have been creeping upwards, tights have been making a comeback.
“’Tis the season to start wearing hosiery again” ran an American Vogue headline in September, a declaration that would surely not have had a green light from editor and bare-leg warrior queen Anna Wintour before this year. The black tights renaissance began with polka-dotted sheers, or tights plastered with graphic logos – fancy, fashion-forward hosiery being a way for opaque-sceptics like me to start wearing tights again without losing face. Amina Muaddi – Rihanna’s favourite shoe designer, and 100% the kind of hardcore fashionista who wouldn’t have been seen dead in tights until recently – has designed a range for Wolford that includes a pair with one black lace leg and one plain sheer leg, and stirrup-footed dance tights in high-shine latex. But the crystal dots and the fishnets are just the gateway drug to the hard stuff that is luring us all back in: the true black opaque tight. Bare-leg bravado has been left behind in the olden days, along with spur-of-the-moment city breaks and mask-incompatible lipgloss. Reader, I’m back in my tights.

2221;2221;2221;2221;2243;2243;Ozark review – Jason Bateman and Laura Linney could teach Lady Macbeth a thing or two;2022-01-21;['Stuart Jeffries'];['TV crime drama', 'Drama', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];"Poor Janet McTeer. Not since the Pacific breeze blew Steve Buscemi’s ashes into the Dude’s beard in The Big Lebowski have a character’s remains been so disrespectfully treated. At the start of the fourth series of Ozark (Netflix), Wendy and Marty Byrde, like a pair of Lady Macbeths, are washing the remains of cartel lawyer Helen Pierce (McTeer) out of their clothes in the bathroom of Mexican drug lord Omar Navarro’s palatial compound. At the end of series three, Navarro’s hitman offed Helen, because she was working an angle contrary to the cartel’s interest (trying to take over the Byrdes’ money-laundering casinos). “They blow her brains out two feet from us,” Wendy tells her children later. “We had to wash pieces out of our hair.” The long-awaited, Covid-delayed final season – with one tranche of seven episodes being dropped now and the final seven to come later this year – rejoins Wendy and Marty on the journey they started three series ago. They left Chicago for a resort in the Ozarks, laundering money through a bar and strip club to fund the nonprofit Byrde Family Foundation into which they could funnel heroin money to do good things, such as bankroll rehab centres for addicts. Instead of going straight, though, they sunk ever deeper into evil. By the end of series three, they were laundering drug money for the Navarro cartel through multiple casinos, partnering with the Kansas City mob to deal heroin, and luring the US army to raid and eliminate a rival cartel. Wendy kills her own brother to prove her loyalty to Navarro, helps his thuggish nephew Javi dispose of the local sheriff who asks too many questions, and now plans to offer up her traitorous son Jonah to the FBI. Say what you like about Lady Macbeth: at least she didn’t have siblings to swell the body count nor sons to betray to the feds. Laura Linney’s performance as Wendy is all the more chilling because her face says apple pie, but everything she does curdles into evil. Meanwhile, Jason Bateman’s Marty is a study in how far a pragmatic accountant can go into the depths of wickedness without the strain showing on his face. If one of the great pleasures of Ozark is that strong women motor the storyline – not just Wendy, but hillbilly heroin farmer Darlene Snell and trailer-trash business whizz Ruth Langmore, not to mention daughter Charlotte Byrde, who dreams of whisking herself and brother Jonah to the Pacific north-west beyond their parents’ and the mob’s clutches – none of them is a role model. Even Ruth, who is Ozark’s token moral conscience, her every compunction subtly registered in Julia Garner’s impressive performance, is like everyone else: pursuing Ozark’s version of the degraded American dream – profiting from evil without consequence, then blowing town with a bank account swollen by drug money. Once the Byrdes have washed McTeer out of their hair, they go to Navarro’s gaudy party (the crab alone cost $10,000), where Omar tells them he too dreams of going straight, without having to do jail time or be assassinated by his upstart nephew Javi. “I’m sorry,” says Wendy. “That’s impossible.” “Isn’t this exactly what you were doing with your foundation?” Omar asks reasonably. “You can transform yourselves into a pillar of society, but you won’t do the same for me.” “I’m sorry. It’s not doable.” The temperature drops several degrees. “OK, why are you still alive?” The scene is set for the final season: the Byrdes must help one of the world’s most wanted drug kingpins to walk free or they will go the way of McTeer. The series premiere, The Beginning of the End, actually opens with one of those tantalising foreshadowing scenes that Ozark does so well. The Byrde family are driving to the soundtrack of Sam Cooke’s Bring It on Home to Me – as if their troubles are behind them. It recalls the last scene of The Sopranos, in which the mob family are eating at Holsten’s diner. We await some terrible denouement – machine gun splattering, ziti stuffed with explosives – but it never arrives. There was, rather, the realised possibility that against the odds, crime, indeed, can pay. Ozark ironically inverts that Sopranos ending. A juggernaut barrels down the wrong lane of the Missouri black top towards the Byrdes, forcing Marty to swerve and crash. Was it an accident? Was Navarro’s hitman at the wheel of the oncoming truck? Do the Byrdes survive to do what the Macbeths failed to – escape their bloody pasts? Nothing seems more unlikely, but I’ve been wrong before. • This article was amended on 23, 24 and 26 January 2022. An earlier version said the final season consists of a tranche of eight episodes now and the last six to come later this year; in fact each tranche will be seven episodes. The song playing at the start of the first episode is Bring It on Home to Me by Sam Cooke, not the same singer’s A Change Is Gonna Come. The character Javi should have been described as Omar Navarro’s nephew, not brother. And the setting for the final Sopranos scene was Holsten’s diner rather than Artie Bucco’s restaurant.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/21/ozark-review-jason-bateman-and-laura-linney-could-teach-lady-macbeth-a-thing-or-two;entertainment and culture
2227;2227;2227;2227;2249;2249;Teachers sacked for being gay warn religious discrimination bill will empower similar dismissals;2022-01-21;['Paul Karp'];['Australian politics', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Australian education', 'Australia news', 'Religion', 'Teaching', 'Coalition', 'Liberal party', 'Labor party'];"Two gay educators have spoken out about being sacked for their sexuality, warning an inquiry the religious discrimination bill will make it easier for such dismissals. Karen Pack said she was sacked “purely because I’m gay and I was getting married to my partner” while Nathan Zomprogno warned a Senate inquiry on Friday that schools “can and do” discriminate on sexuality. LGBT equality groups have said the bill will override state laws with more limited religious exemptions to discrimination laws on hiring and firing and give schools stronger rights to sack teachers for their views on sexuality and marriage.
Pack told the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee she was sacked as a lecturer at a Christian theological college after she became engaged to her same-sex partner in 2019. In March and April 2020 the college sacked Pack after it received complaints denouncing her relationship as “demonic”, despite praising Pack for her depth of Christian faith. “It was very clear that the problem wasn’t my teaching, my theology or my character,” she said. “It was purely because I’m gay and I was getting married to my partner, Bronte. “I have a sincerely held Christian faith. I am not trying to insinuate myself into anything. What is happening at the moment with this legislation and others is an attempt, essentially, to purge the church of people like myself.” Teacher Zamprogno told the hearing that Christian schools “can and do” sack teachers for their sexuality, and he and Pack were “just two examples of very many”. After working in private Christian schools for 20 years, Zamprogno said he was “well regarded and good at what I did” and believed his sexuality had “nothing to do with my ability to do my job”.

“When I was challenged about my sexuality, I answered honestly and then I was told that there was no place for me at the school the following year,” he said. “The connection was crystal clear. “Employers will often obfuscate the reason that they’re letting their employee go, even when it is clear that it is because of their religious conviction or their sexuality,” he said. “The provisions of this bill effectively empower those who want to put pressure on and ultimately purge people of a different religious conviction to themselves, within religious communities.”
The attorney general’s department has submitted that although the bill does not affect schools’ ability to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation it “would allow a religious school to consider a person’s religious beliefs about issues such as sexuality” where it is part of the beliefs of the school. The Sydney Anglican church has defended an unnamed Christian school against the widely reported claims that teacher Stephanie Lentz had been sacked for being gay, by arguing she was sacked for her belief that a person can be a Christian and be gay. “A heterosexual teacher who held the same theological views on sexuality and relationships, and therefore was unable to sign the statement of belief, would also have had his or her employment terminated,” it said. Two parliamentary inquiries into the bill are due to report by 4 February.
The bill is likely to require Labor support to pass, as three Liberal MPs are reserving their right to vote against it and a further group of four Liberals agreed to support it in return for greater protections for LGBTQ+ students that the attorney general appears to have reneged on. Michaelia Cash told a Christian webinar in December protections for LGBTQ+ students will have to wait for 12 months, despite Angie Bell, Fiona Martin, Dave Sharma and Katie Allen claiming they’d won support to pass them at the same time as the religious discrimination bill. Independent candidate for Wentworth Allegra Spender said “gay students should never be penalised or expelled from school for their sexuality”. “We mustn’t discriminate on the basis of religion but students and teachers must be protected in any laws,” she told Guardian Australia. “Once again the community is left guessing what the government is going to do. “The government needs to explain how it is going to protect vulnerable young people, rather than leaving us guessing.” Bell told Guardian Australia she will “continue to work with the attorney general and all stakeholders”. “I am certain there will be further discussion on amendments and possible solutions to ensure the safety and protection against discrimination for all Australians once the bill is reintroduced in parliament.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/teachers-sacked-for-being-gay-warn-religious-discrimination-bill-will-empower-similar-dismissals;politics

But while the Coronavirus Act kept the silky Nottingham rap duo off stages, their songs did the algorithm-boosted rounds on TikTok – most notably the smooth slinking Don’t Rush, which was propelled to internet ubiquity (and eventually the US Billboard charts) by a glow-up challenge started on the app by a bored Hull University student. Compounding the runaway success of a single song into something more concrete isn’t a challenge unique to the TikTok age, but it’s one Young T & Bugsey – AKA Ra’chard Tucker and Doyin Julius – are nonetheless shouldering with their second full-length album, Truth Be Told.
The result is a tussle between rehashing the same formula and testing deeper waters. The formula, for the most part, wins out in a stream of similar-sounding, seductive shag rap. Big Bidness, Nice (which features another TikTok rapper, Blxst), and Hall of Flame are all variations on the same sultry theme as Don’t Rush. The Lil Wayne-aping chorus of Prada Bae (“Real Gs move in silence like bolognese”) feels written for an Instagram caption. It’s fun, and fine, if a little self-serious.

Just look at Barbados;2022-01-21;['N/A'];"[""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Global development', 'Barbados', 'Trinidad and Tobago', 'Climate crisis', 'World news', 'Environment', 'Americas', 'India', 'Liberia', 'Ellen Johnson Sirleaf', 'Caribbean', 'Africa', 'South and central Asia', 'Mia Mottley']";"There is a common misconception that the developing world is full of archaic values and that women struggle to have their voices heard. The more countries I visit and the more female leaders I speak to, the more I am convinced the contrary is true. In fact, those in positions of power worldwide could learn important lessons from these strong women when it comes to tackling some of society’s most pressing issues, including pandemics, the climate crisis, education and infrastructure.
Of course, successful female leadership in the developing world isn’t new. During her time as prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi was famously strong. In Africa, I met the highly respected former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was recognised among Time Magazine’s Top 100 Women of the Year in 2020 for her role in picking up the pieces of a damaged nation when she was elected in 2006. I am writing from South America and the Caribbean, having interviewed many female leaders, most recently from Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. The level of respect for female political and business leaders here is partly because they have had to dig deeper to prove themselves, which I believe is one key to their success – particularly during turbulent times. Since taking up office, Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley has changed the face of democracy in the country. She has been transparent, stands up publicly against injustices, and has created authentic ties between Caribbean countries. It is difficult to overstate what her commitment to collaboration across the region and internationally has done for Barbados, securing investment and developing infrastructure to enable a stable and sustainable economy during the Covid crisis. Countries like Barbados are often not the protagonist, yet Mottley put issues such as the climate crisis and international development to the front on the world stage. Such is the level of support for Mottley within the region that it is not uncommon for the president of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, to wake up at 5am to cook his famous fish curries and have them delivered by the next flight, as a gesture of care and support for her. I have also been struck by the role a “first lady” can play in sharing leadership. In Suriname, Mellisa Santokhi-Seenacherry has helped ensure that, through government policy, no one is left behind. A successful lawyer, she has promoted female leadership, empowerment and mental health with rigour. Guyana’s first lady, Arya Ali, has brought family back into the state house and work. She is committed to inclusivity, setting up countrywide schemes that support women and girls, those with disabilities and children, and is not afraid to look at the challenging issues of domestic violence and rape. This takes courage and heart – and she has these in abundance.
In other spheres, Guyana’s Annette Arjoon has been widely recognised for her environmental and community work. Arjoon is responsible for establishing one of the country’s first, and most successful, conservation NGOs, the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society – leading the way in preserving the natural environment for future generations. Trinidad and Tobago has this form of leadership in the private sector – the representation of female CEOs is greater here and in Jamaica than in the US. Trinidad and Tobago Business Hall of Fame award winner Angela Lee Loy continued to invest in training her employees during Covid and supporting them through the challenges of home working, giving parents the flexibility to work around home schooling, for example. “I firmly believe that if their home life needs support, then that should be our domain and area of concern, too,” she says. This approach certainly paid off. Her staff have remained engaged and loyal. It is not easy, and there has never been a linear upward path for female leaders. However, the women highlighted here are courageously carving a path and are a brilliant example to the world. The unprecedented disruption of the past two years has thrown a spotlight on leadership. These women are finding solutions to pressing global challenges with purpose, passion and people at the fore, and are improving the lives of their communities through harnessing the very qualities that make female leaders so successful.

2242;2242;2242;2242;2264;2264;Michael Flynn allies allegedly plotted to lean on Republicans to back vote audits;2022-01-21;['Peter Stone'];['Donald Trump', 'US news', 'US elections 2020', 'US politics', 'Republicans'];"FBI agents and the House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol have both learned of an alleged plan by allies of retired army Lt Gen Michael Flynn to gather “intelligence” on top Republicans to “move” them to back election audits in key states Trump lost, said ex-whistleblower Everett Stern who talked to the panel and the FBI. Stern, who runs the intelligence firm Tactical Rabbit and is a Republican vying for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, in multiple interviews with the Guardian said two Flynn associates with the rightwing Patriot Caucus group enlisted his help in April in a scheme to seek potentially damaging information on two Republican members of Congress to prod them to back an audit of the 2020 vote that Joe Biden won. Stern told the Guardian he spent several hours in November telling House panel investigators about the alleged drive by Flynn associates who sought campaign finance and other dirt on Pennsylvania’s Senator Pat Toomey and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick to win their support for an audit to bolster Trump’s debunked charges that Biden’s win was fraudulent. A long-shot candidate to succeed the retiring Toomey, Stern said he alerted the FBI in June when he learned more details of the bizarre drive by Flynn allies to specifically target the two Republicans, both of whom backed impeaching Trump after the January 6 insurrection. The efforts by Flynn’s Patriot Caucus allies were launched after Trump failed to block Biden from taking office, and are part of a wider drive by Trump loyalists and Flynn to help boost Trump’s political fortunes via more state audits nationwide into false charges that Biden’s win was rigged, and elect like-minded candidates in key states to top electoral offices. Stern provided text messages, emails and other documents revealing he had multiple contacts with one of the Patriot Caucus members, Velma Anne Ruth, and two other influential Flynn allies, Houston real estate mogul Al Hartman and former army Green Beret Ivan Raiklin, who were pushing audits in several key states.
Stern said Flynn’s Patriot Caucus associates first approached him in Pennsylvania for possible help after an April Republican party event, and soon after told Stern in phone calls they worked with Flynn and the Patriot Caucus, and planned to recruit “former domestic and foreign intelligence officials” to facilitate their scheme. The plan by Flynn’s allies alarmed Stern, but as a former whistleblower involved in exposing a large bank money laundering scandal by HSBC in 2012, he told the Guardian he decided to play along for a few months to glean information to expose the Trump allies’ scheme. Stern expressed dismay that Flynn’s Patriot Caucus associates “don’t understand that Biden is the president. They wanted to collect information through Tactical Rabbit and my campaign” to turn up the heat on Toomey and Fitzpatrick to back an audit which Stern viewed as potentially “extortion”. Stern gave the Guardian a voice mail he received in which Hartman talked about leaning on moderate Republican “Rinos” in Pennsylvania to gain support for an audit of that state’s vote which Biden won by over 80,000, and Hartman said a similar drive in Michigan was needed. Stern said Hartman wanted to use Tactical Rabbit’s intelligence gathering tools and his campaign to dig up potentially embarrassing campaign finance information and other dirt about the Pennsylvania members, plus Republican political figures in Michigan who were also resisting audits. Hartman and Raiklin also talked with Stern about meeting Flynn, Trump’s disgraced ex-national security adviser, and proposed compensating him for his information via campaign donations, said Stern. In an April exchange of Hartman text messages seen by the Guardian, Hartman asked a Flynn scheduler to help “connect” Flynn with Stern whose Senate campaign and credentials he touted highly, calling Stern a “strong believer”, in their cause. Although Stern tipped off the FBI in June about what he deemed a threat to national security and he said he met with agents again in November, it’s not clear if his allegations are still being pursued.
Stern’s allegations have echoes of Flynn’s scheming with Trump and other loyalists in late 2020 to thwart Biden’s win, efforts that included a White House meeting with Trump where Flynn proposed declaring martial law in several states Biden won and then rerunning the election there. In November, the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack subpoenaed Flynn who Trump had pardoned post-election even though he had pled guilty twice to lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. In response to the subpoena to testify and turn over documents, Flynn sued the panel but a judge quickly dismissed his lawsuit last month. John Sipher, who was in the CIA’s clandestine services for 28 years, shares Stern’s view of Flynn, who he knew in the military and shortly thereafter. “I am appalled by what he has become,” Sipher said in an email. Asked if he thought the FBI was pursuing Stern’s charges, Sipher said: “I would hope and assume they are taking this seriously.” While Fitzpatrick and Toomey were the main “targets” Stern said other Pennsylvania officials including judges were also being targeted by the Flynn allies as they sought to ramp up pressure for an audit in the state. Neither Fitzpatrick or Toomey’s offices replied to multiple requests for comment. The Patriot Caucus, a coalition of Patriot and other rightwing groups in some two dozen states with which Raiklin and Hartman have ties, according to Stern and documents, has worked with Trump loyalists like Flynn to push audits in key states Biden won, and backed Trump allies for governor, and other top posts in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona Trump lost. Flynn himself on 7 January publicly endorsed another Trump ally and election audit promoter, Doug Mastriano for governor in Pennsylvania, at a campaign rally also attended by Raiklin. Flynn has also endorsed two Trump backed candidates in Arizona: Kari Lake, an ex-Fox News figure, for governor, and Mark Finchem, a state representative who attended the January 6 Stop the Steal rally, for secretary of state. To coordinate national efforts, Raiklin and Hartman on 3 July spearheaded one of a series of “Election Integrity” calls with Trump loyalists, lawyers and donors to discuss the status of audits efforts in several states and other plans to cast doubt on Biden’s win, according to an Arizona senate document shared by the watchdog group American Oversight. “Join us every second Saturday for SITUATION UPDATES and COLLABORATION from active leaders in the election remediation process at state level – attorneys with Mike Lindell and Patrick Byrne, data analysts, state legislators, gubernatorial candidates, and grassroots activists whose goal is completing a cyber forensic audit in their state,” the Arizona document reads.
A who’s who list of Trump loyalists and groups invited to join these calls included the America Project and America’s Future, both of which Flynn played key roles with as they poured some $2m into a discredited audit of Arizona’s largest county, plus the Patriot Caucus’ Velma Anne Ruth, Finchem and Byrne, the millionaire chief financier of the Arizona audit. Hartman in emails with Stern obtained by the Guardian invited him in June to attend a religious far-right meeting known as Ziklag in Dallas where he could meet separately with Flynn. Stern said Hartman told him a “private meeting was going to be arranged with Flynn” who Stern was told wanted to meet him. After indicating to Hartman he would attend, Stern opted to cancel at the last minute after his lawyer indicated there could be legal repercussions from a meeting with Flynn. “I thought it was extremely dangerous to meet with a three star general who I believed had broken the law. “They planned to give my campaign funds to help me” develop damaging information on Toomey and Fitzpatrick, Stern claimed. “It was like a wink, wink. Hartman is the man behind the curtain. He’s an operative and financier,” promoting audits. Hartman has long been a donor to the right. He is on the advisory council for the pro-Trump Turning Point USA and has been active in the conservative donor network led by oil billionaire Charles Koch. Raiklin, an army reserve officer who reportedly has known Flynn since 2014, is facing an internal army reserve investigation into possible violations of rules barring partisan political activity, according to a military official who spoke to Reuters last month. Raiklin in December 2020 outlined a wild scheme in tweets and a podcast to thwart Biden’s win, charging a vast conspiracy that included Pence, intelligence, China and Big Tech, as Reuters reported. Raiklin told Trump to “activate the emergency broadcast system” and deployed the hashtag #FightLikeAFlynn, stressing that “we the people are going to force this plan on them”. Neither Hartman or Raiklin replied to multiple calls seeking comment. A Flynn scheduler did not respond to questions for the story. Velma Anne Ruth with the Patriot Caucus, who was photographed with Stern at a June event in Pennsylvania where she wore a tank top that said General Flynn, called Stern’s charges “delusional, fabricated and defamatory”, in a text message. Stern said he shared the photo and other documents involving exchanges he had with Ruth with the FBI. Senior ex-prosecutors and intelligence officials say Stern’s allegations merit law enforcement attention. “Stern’s allegations suggest serious crimes,” said ex-prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig, who worked on Ken Starr’s team during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. “If his allegations were corroborated by extrinsic evidence they clearly would warrant investigation.” Former CIA official Sipher, who has spoken with Stern before, said: “Everett is someone with a strong sense of right and wrong, and willing to suffer the consequences of doing the right thing. We would be better served to have more people like Everett in public life.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/michael-flynn-allies-allegedly-targeted-republicans-back-election-audits;politics

2264;2264;2264;2264;2287;2287;Two-thirds of passengers on first flight to Covid-free Kiribati diagnosed with virus;2022-01-21;['Rimon Rimon'];['Kiribati', 'Fiji', 'Asia Pacific', 'Pacific islands', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];"After remaining Covid-free for the entirety of the pandemic, Kiribati has reopened its borders – only for two thirds of the passengers on the first international flight to arrive in ten months to test positive for the virus. The island nation is now set to impose a four-day lockdown from Monday after the virus was found to have spread into the community. All 54 passengers, 36 of whom were diagnosed with Covid after arriving from Fiji last Friday, have now been quarantined and are recovering well, according to authorities. But after a security guard at the quarantine centre also tested positive on Tuesday, the island nation introduced a two-week curfew and other public health measures such as mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing and vaccine passes for travel outside of the capital, Tarawa. The security guard and two of his close contacts were also quarantined while his home village was placed under a two-week lockdown.
A further two positive cases were detected in the community on Thursday, prompting the government to announce that a full lockdown would begin on Monday, with schools closed and people only allowed to leave their homes for essential services. News of the Covid-positive arrivals and the security guard caused locals to panic, especially as it was leaked to the public rather than being officially announced. “As parents, we are worried about our children because unlike us, they are unvaccinated and have no access to one [a vaccine] on the island,” said Kareaua Nawaia, a 32-year-old schoolteacher and father of three. The arrival of Covid-19 was inevitable, he noted, but added that the timing was avoidable considering Fiji is battling a third wave of the coronavirus. Others expressed concern about the delay in imposing the lockdown. Dr Tabutoa Eria, the first person to receive the Covid vaccine when it arrived in Kiribati in May 2021, wrote on Facebook that it “might [be] too late if you [the lockdown] come next week. Our beloved n beautiful pple pliz avoid unnecessary movements. Virus won’t move if we don’t.” Questions have also been asked about how the passengers contracted the virus. All had been in pre-departure quarantine for two weeks before the flight and had undergone regular testing. They were only allowed on the flight after returning negative tests. Last month the Kiribati government said that 93.4% of the population aged 18 and over has had their first dose of Covid vaccine but only 53.1% had had a second dose.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/two-thirds-of-passengers-on-first-flight-to-covid-free-kiribati-diagnosed-with-virus;health
2280;2280;2280;2280;2303;2303;Swimming Australia report calls for skinfold test ban and female coach quota;2022-01-21;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Swimming', 'Sport', 'Australia news'];"An internal review into Swimming Australia’s treatment of girls and women has recommended the organisation drop skinfold tests and the term “physique”, and to adopt a quota for female coaches. The report lists 46 recommendations, including urging SA to issue a statement acknowledging “the practice of assessing body composition is harmful to swimmers” and to rethink its approach to coaching.
One recommendation said SA should “challenge the misinformed view that lean body mass predicts performance” and that it should develop “training in using humanising and non-objectifying language in managing body image concerns.” “The term ‘physique’ has meaning and consequences, including overvaluing body shape and size in terms of their impact on performance,” the report reads. The report goes on to recommend banning “unjustified routine periodic screening”, saying body composition assessments should only be conducted twice a year unless there is a “justified need”. It says SA should “demonstrate clear leadership” by banning “the use of surface anthropometry, specifically skin folds, as a measure of body composition at any stage of a swimmer’s career”. It recommends SA integrate training on how “to be an ally”, to “increase the capacity of all coaching staff, but especially the male coaches, to understand the impacts of bullying and exclusion of female coaches and enhance opportunities for creating meaningful change for gender equity.” The report also addresses SA’s complaints process, recommending it adopts a “character test” for selecting coaches and support staff for teams, which will consider active and previous complaint information, and urging SA to adopt a quota for “female representation among advanced and performance coaches”. It also references World Rugby and AFLW as models for female inclusion among coaching staff. “Swimming Australia [should] show cultural leadership by prioritising behavioural standards over a coach’s performance standards. The athletes’ welfare must be the primary driver for coach selection.” It says SA should commit to “never again selecting an all-male team for national and international competitions and ensures that a minimum number of women coaches are included – no less than two women when four or more coaches are selected and at least one woman where there are three or less coaches selected”. The report was commissioned in June 2021, after a series of accusations of sexual abuse and misconduct rocked the organisation. Swimmer Madeline Groves, a silver medalist at the Rio Olympics, withdrew from the Tokyo Olympic trials as a “lesson to misogynistic perverts and their bootlickers”. “You can no longer exploit young women and girls, body shame or medically gaslight them and then expect them to represent you so you can earn your annual bonus. Time’s UP,” she tweeted. Groves has since alleged she was sexually abused from the age of 13 by someone still working in the sport. It also came after gold medallist Cate Campbell said female swimmers have been subjected to body shaming, in a book she wrote with her sister Bronte. She said the attitude of many male coaches was that “the skinnier the better,” with girls given smaller plates so they would eat less and many criticised in front of other swimmers if they gained any weight.
Swimming Australia president, Kieren Perkins, said in a statement that the SA board “acknowledges” their responsibility in making changes. “The Swimming Australia board acknowledges the ultimate collective responsibility and commitment in addressing these recommendations rests with the board and the executive team in delivering and committing to meaningful and enduring change, being transparent and regaining and earning the trust of our athletes and our entire community.” In the same statement, SA said it welcomed the report, reflecting on the fact that 60% of their participant base was female. “The feedback was open and frank and there were experiences recounted that were difficult to read,” it said. “Broadly, the review found that Swimming Australia must address the coaching gender imbalance, coaching culture, education and accreditation, governance structures, and the complaints process.” The panel also recommends SA release the report in full, which it has rejected, citing privacy concerns. “While we cannot release the full report due to the confidentiality guaranteed to participants, the themes of the report are clear in the recommendations and provide public accountability for our steps forward.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/swimming-australia-report-recommends-banning-skinfold-tests-and-introducing-female-coach-quota;sports
2284;2284;2284;2284;2307;2307;Britishvolt gets £100m boost to build UK’s first large-scale ‘gigafactory’;2022-01-21;['Jasper Jolly'];['Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Automotive industry', 'Business', 'Technology', 'Environment', 'Motoring', 'UK news', 'England'];"The UK government will invest £100m in Britishvolt as the car battery manufacturing startup seeks to build Britain’s first large-scale “gigafactory” in the north-east of England. The government’s Automotive Transformation Fund will invest alongside asset management company Abrdn and its majority-owned property investment arm, Tritax, to fund a sale and leaseback deal for the huge building that will house the electric car battery factory, near Blyth in Northumberland. Peter Rolton, Britishvolt’s executive chairman, said: “The UK automotive industry needs a local source of batteries. Chinese or other Asian imports are not going to be an option. There will be very, very significant shortfalls of batteries. We are absolutely vital to maintain the UK industry and support those jobs.”
Britishvolt is one of two major UK battery manufacturing projects that has secured funding, alongside an expansion of an existing plant at Sunderland owned by China’s Envision that supplies to Nissan. The company is hoping to build the plant rapidly with the aim of supplying a large part of the UK car industry’s needs as it transitions from internal combustion engines to electric cars that produce zero exhaust emissions. It is in talks with several potential clients, and sportscar maker Lotus has signed a memorandum of understanding, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
The plant will employ about 3,000 workers when it is at full capacity in around 2028. The first batteries are scheduled to start production in 2024 to take advantage of rising demand ahead of the UK’s 2030 ban on new cars without a battery. The government and Britishvolt declined to detail the size of the government investment, citing commercial confidentiality. However, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said it was worth about £100m. The government-funded Advanced Propulsion Centre calculates that the UK will need to produce batteries with a capacity of 90 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year if it is to retain a car industry of a similar size. Current UK production capacity is less than 2GWh, but Britishvolt hopes to produce 30GWh. Local authorities in the West Midlands and Somerset are trying to attract investors to two more potential battery manufacturing sites. The West Midlands site at Coventry airport last week gained pre-emptive planning permission. Rolton said: “The company was still working on the timing of a planned stock market listing which will raise the money to build the production line. The full project is expected to cost £3.8bn, but the government backing has already helped in conversations with potential investors.”
Britishvolt has previously won backing from Glencore, the FTSE 100 miner, and preparatory construction work at the 93-hectare site has begun. Securing investment in UK-based battery manufacturing has been an important goal for the government. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has on several occasions referred to his hopes for the project as part of his plans to “level up” parts of the country that have missed out on investment in recent decades. The plant will be based in the constituency of Wansbeck, narrowly retained by Labour in the 2019 general election. It is next door to Blyth Valley, a seat formerly part of Labour’s “red wall”, which voted in a Conservative MP for the first time in that election. Johnson said the plan “is a strong testament to the skilled workers of the north-east and the UK’s place at the helm of the global green industrial revolution”. He added that the factory will “boost the production of electric vehicles in the UK”. Rolton said Britishvolt had taken part in a jobs fair in the area which prompted “queues round the block”, while some parents even took children out of school to attend. “That’s what it means for the area,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/britishvolt-electric-car-battery-uk-gigafactory-blyth-jobs;science and technology
2290;2290;2290;2290;2313;2313;Tory whips accused of intimidating MPs who oppose Boris Johnson;2022-01-20;['Jessica Elgot', 'Peter Walker', 'Josh Halliday'];['Conservative leadership', 'Boris Johnson', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'Gray report'];"Tory whips were accused on Thursday of using dirty tactics to intimidate rebels as Boris Johnson was said to be increasingly convinced he could see off a vote of no confidence. Though allies of Johnson believe a vote is almost inevitable after the inquiry into Downing Street parties is published next week, one cabinet minister said on Thursday there were now significant doubts among the rebels about whether they could defeat the prime minister. The Guardian has been told of at least five MPs who have expressed concerns about the government threatening funding for their constituency or encouraging damaging stories to be published in newspapers. MPs said the tactic had been used not only during the so-called partygate scandal, but ahead of the votes on Uighur genocide, cutting international aid, free school meals and the rise in national insurance. The Times reported that rebels were considering releasing texts or recordings of their conversations with whips to show their tactics. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.” Johnson said he had “seen no evidence” of those threats. The row over whipping tactics came amid other developments as: A significant email from a senior official warning Martin Reynolds not to hold the summer party on 20 May has now been obtained by the inquiry by Sue Gray. Anger among Johnson critics escalated after sources briefed that rebels were losing their nerve. MPs denied that letters of no confidence had been withdrawn, calling it spin by Number 10. Leading Brexiter Steve Baker said it looked like “checkmate” for the prime minister. As allies of Johnson claimed the prime minister was being given a reprieve before the Gray report, senior Tory William Wragg, who chairs a government scrutiny committee, claimed there was attempted blackmail against some colleagues involving public money. He urged MPs to report government ministers, whips and advisers to the Speaker – and even the police. Two of the MPs, the Tory defector Christian Wakeford and Andrew Bridgen, another Johnson critic, spoke publicly on Thursday about the tactics they claim had been deployed against them. Wakeford backed up the claims by Wragg that threats involving public money were made by the whips. “I was threatened that I would not get a school for Radcliffe if I did not vote in one particular way,” he said. “This is a town that has not had a high school for the best part of 10 years. “How would you feel when they hold back the regeneration of a town for a vote. It didn’t sit comfortably. That was the start of me questioning my place, where I was and ultimately to where I am now.”
Wragg, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC), which looks into the work of government and the civil service, said it would breach the ministerial code “in threatening to withdraw investment from members of parliaments’ constituencies which are funded from the public purse”. He said encouraging the publication of stories in newspapers would also be a breach. “The intimidation of a member of parliament is a serious matter,” he added. “Moreover, the reports of which I’m aware would seem to constitute blackmail. “As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the commissioner of the Metropolitan police.” Bridgen, a Conservative backbencher who was among the first MPs to call for Johnson to go, said he believed a story in the Times on Monday detailing his links to a Ghana-based timber company had been inspired by No 10. “Not only am I confident that happened, but so are all my colleagues,” Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, told the Guardian. “One of them told me, ‘It’s not even subtle nowadays.’” One former minister said he was incensed by the tactic of threatening to cut funding to seats. “It has unusually high leverage with our newer colleagues. We have young, new members with marginal seats in poor areas.
“That’s precisely the area where the seat is dependent on allocations of money and the levelling up regime. The scope for this kind of threat is much more than it would have been. If you use this tactic all the red wall are susceptible to it.” The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said allegations about potentially criminal offences would be a matter for the police. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the alleged threats to withdraw investment to force support for Johnson were “disgusting” and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Johnson was “now in full scorched earth mode”. One cabinet minister said Johnson was increasingly confident that he could “probably win” in a vote of no confidence and called the whipping row “a sideshow”. He said colleagues were beginning to think it was “electoral suicide” to depose Johnson. “When you start to put it to people that the prime minister who got us this huge majority might have to go over cheese and wine – well it starts to look ridiculous.” But other MPs said Johnson was still in deep peril. “There are a lot of people who do not like these kinds of threats; they don’t like bullies,” one MP said. Another MP opposing Johnson denied that letters of no confidence had been withdrawn after Wakeford defected to Labour. “These briefings of withdrawals are pure invention from No 10,” one said. “Wakeford may have stayed some people’s hands yesterday but this isn’t going into reverse.” Johnson is understood to be keen for Gray’s report to be published by Tuesday, to allow him to make a statement before facing another PMQs on Wednesday. A significant email from a senior official warning Martin Reynolds not to hold the summer party on 20 May has now been obtained by Gray, first reported by ITV. Cabinet Office sources said she had already been given the authority to search email records – which are retained even from departing officials. A Whitehall source said Gray is nearing the end of her inquiry and publication next week was very likely. Baker, a key Westminster figure who often led rebellions including on Brexit and Covid, said he would not be organising against the prime minister but said he should resign if he broke the law or misled parliament. “I’m appalled we’ve reached this position,” he told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast. “At the moment I’m afraid it does look like checkmate but whether he can save himself, we’ll see … I’m very clear that if he’s broken the law or lied at the dispatch box, then he must go. But one thing I would say I’m not going to organise against Boris Johnson, my heart wouldn’t be in it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/boris-johnson-ministers-confidence-vote-whipping;politics

It is the third year in a row that the clock has been set at that time, which is closer to midnight than at any period during the cold war, including the Cuban missile crisis. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which curates the annual unveiling of the clock’s hands, said the decision to leave them unchanged reflects that a few positive developments over the course of the past year have been counterbalanced by continued drift towards the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the climate emergency, and the rise of biological threats. “The Doomsday Clock is holding steady at 100 seconds to midnight. But steady is not good news,” said Sharon Squassoni, a George Washington University professor and the co-chair of the Bulletin’s science and security board, which decides the clock’s hand movements each year. “In fact, it reflects the judgment of the board that we are stuck in a perilous moment, one that brings neither stability nor security.” Among the positive developments noted by the board was the decision last year to extend the New Start arms control agreement between Russia and the US, the restart of talks over the Iran nuclear programme, and the coming to office in the US of an administration that believes in climate science and has pledged to act to mitigate global emissions.
Set against those trends, the board pointed to the continued investment by major powers in their nuclear arsenals, the absence of progress in the Iran nuclear discussions, and the weakness of global actions to address the climate emergency. “The Doomsday Clock is not set by good intentions, but rather by evidence of action, or in this case inaction,” Scott Sagan, a political science professor at Stanford University, said. The board also drew attention to biological threats in the light of the global vulnerability highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The fact that we have active biological weapons programs in Russia and North Korea, with China and Iran close behind, should give us pause,” said Asha M George, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense. “We stand on the precipice of a biological cataclysm. It will take very little more from this arena to push us right over the edge.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/doomsday-clock-holds-at-100-seconds-to-midnight;environment

Irving’s comments to the fan during the second quarter of Brooklyn’s 114-107 loss on Monday were captured on video. Irving used profanity in reminding the fan that he helped the Cavaliers win the NBA championship in 2016. “Got y’all a championship and motherfuckers still ungrateful,” Irving could be heard saying in a clip that has since gone viral.
Irving hit the winning shot in Game 7 of the NBA finals over the Golden State Warriors in 2016, sealing the first and only championship in the club’s 52-year history. The NBA has been trying to clean up profanity among players, fining Irving’s teammate Kevin Durant and New York’s Julius Randle recently for using obscene language during interviews. Irving’s exchange with the fan was part of an eventful return to his former home. After the game, he reiterated that he wasn’t changing his stance on refusing the Covid-19 vaccine, which has kept him ineligible to play in home games because of New York City’s mandate for professional athletes. In five games played since making his season debut with the Nets, Irving has averaged 20 points, 5.5 rebounds, and five assists while shooting 36.8% percent from beyond the three-point line.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/kyrie-irving-fined-brooklyn-nets-profanity;sports
2328;2328;2328;2328;2353;2353;From Brexit ultras to net zero sceptics: what the Tory factions want;2022-01-20;['Peter Walker'];['Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservative leadership', 'Brexit', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"While it remains to be seen whether Tory opponents of Boris Johnson can generate enough MPs’ letters to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister, let alone win one, it is clear that the parliamentary party contains a series of factions with their own gripes and wishes, some overlapping. By no means do all of them actively want Johnson gone – at least not yet – but they do at least hope his current woes could prompt a No 10 reset in a direction they would like. Here is a brief guide to who is seeking what. Singapore-on-Thames brigade
Grouping together the largely overlapping contingents of fervent Brexiters and low-tax, low-spend Tories, these MPs are frustrated that after departure from the EU Johnson has not fully seized what they believe are the opportunities for slashing regulations and focusing on growth through unfettered free enterprise. Often citing Singapore as an example – while ignoring elements of the city-state’s model such as mass social housing – they want the government shrunk and taxes cut. As a starting point they would like the imminent rise in national insurance cancelled. Steve Baker is a key proponent of this (and several other) issues. Brexit ultras
Best represented by the European Research Group, which played a pivotal role in toppling Theresa May, these share many of the small-state views of the above, but with a particular focus on Brexit-related issues, particularly the impasse over Northern Ireland. They would like Johnson or his successor to trigger article 16 as a means to resetting the Irish border issue, and to take a combative line more generally with the EU. A key No 10 role for David Frost would be welcomed. Lockdown opponents
Also largely represented by a formal and influential body – the Covid Recovery Group, headed by the former chief whip Mark Harper – these MPs will have been cheered by the announcement on Wednesday of government plans to phase out more or less every remaining pandemic rule in England over the next few weeks. However, they would still like more assurances from Johnson and from the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that such restrictions will never return. Net zero sceptics
A group that often crystallises wider Tory worries over the cost of living, this increasingly influential contingent says the best way to reduce energy prices would be to not just remove VAT from bills but also green-based taxes, which pay for renewable energy schemes and the like. More widely, some such as Craig Mackinlay oppose targets for an end to conventionally powered cars and gas boilers, while some want investment in domestic gas and shale gas production. The 2019 intake
By no means a unified or coherent group, not least because there are 107 MPs who first joined the Commons in the landslide Tory election win, 2019ers have nonetheless been at the centre of efforts to remove Johnson due to the party allegations, in the so-called pork pie putsch, named after the Rutland and Melton constituency of one member, Alicia Kearns. The motive appears to be largely that they feel let down and worry that the man who helped propel them into parliament is now electorally toxic. Some longer-standing Tory MPs say part of the rebellion is down to some 2019ers’ annoyance at missing out on promotion, but this is arguably a factor in most attempts to change prime ministers. The culture warriors
Like the Brexiters, this contingent has probably got much of what it wanted out of Johnson. Such efforts are led by Munira Mirza, a key figure in No 10 policy, who has helped oversee initiatives including a report on racial disparities that largely dismissed structural factors, and a robust defence of the rights of statues. However, some want more, perhaps not least the Common Sense Group, led by the veteran MP John Hayes, which opposes what it calls “subversives” such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. Some of these MPs suspect Johnson remains an Islington liberal at heart, and might prefer someone such as Liz Truss. The dislikers
The final group is the most disparate but is united by one thing: they have openly called for Johnson to step down. A handful, such as Caroline Nokes, are from the more obviously liberal wing of the party, and never had a huge amount of faith in Johnson. Others, such as Andrew Bridgen, are former supporters who have become disillusioned. Their policy ask is very simple: that he quits.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/from-brexit-ultras-to-net-zero-sceptics-what-the-tory-factions-want;politics
2336;2336;2336;2336;2361;2361;Welcome to Britain’s newest televised pro league: wheelchair basketball;2022-01-20;['Paul MacInnes'];['Basketball', 'Disability and sport', 'Sport'];"‘I want it to be big,” says Jade Atkin of the Cardiff Met Archers. “I want people to be saying: ‘You’re on TV, we want to watch you’ and I want people to want to come and I want the sport to do well. We all want the sport to do well. And to be honest, I think that can happen.” The sport is wheelchair basketball and Atkin, a Great Britain international, is going to be part of a revolution. When the Women’s Premier League taps off for the first time this weekend it will not just create a new professional league in women’s sport, it will be the first in women’s parasport in the UK. Four teams – Worcester Wolves, Loughborough Lightning, East London Phoenix and the Archers - will compete for the title and the BBC is committed to showing eight games live, including May’s final.
“Whenever you see sport on the TV it’s always the men, and always the men making all the money,” says the American Curran Brown, who will play for the Phoenix. “Women as a whole struggle to make a name for themselves in the sporting world and when you put disability with it it’s even lower, it’s not represented at all. I think we have two barriers on top of each other. So I think this is a great beginning, to show what we represent and that we can play toughly as well.” Wheelchair basketball was the third most-watched sport during Channel 4’s Paralympics coverage last year. It is fast, technical, tactical and easy for newcomers to understand. Supported by a network of 200 clubs and community organisations across the country, the British Wheelchair Basketball Women’s Premier League (or BWBWPL for short) starts from strong foundations and 1,000 tickets have been sold for Saturday’s opener in Worcester between the Wolves and the Lightning. The BWBWPL is breaking sporting ground, not just in itself as a competition but by aiming to shift perceptions more broadly. Speak to any Paralympian and they will tell you that the next challenge for parasport is to take the attention and passion that alights on the Games every four years and bring it back into domestic competition all year round. This is a chicken and egg situation to an extent, with the contribution of broadcasters a crucial component but regular compelling competition a prerequisite too. Women’s wheelchair basketball now aspires to provide that offering.
Beaming parasport (and, as Brown observes, women’s sport too) into the nation’s homes then provides other opportunities. “This is hugely significant in getting disability representation out there,” says Lisa Pearce, the CEO of British Wheelchair Basketball, “and also to help more disabled people across the country and around the world see how incredible this sport is and how great it is to get involved in sport and physical activity.” Seven in every 10 people who have died from Covid in the UK up to this point have been registered disabled, but the pandemic has also brought a disproportionate impact on activity levels of people with disabilities more broadly. “It’s completely unacceptable, and we need to create more opportunities for disabled people to have sporting and physical activity opportunities,” says Pearce. “We need to create a platform to have wider conversations too and sport – wheelchair basketball in this instance – offers a great opportunity to have a wider societal discussion about why there are so many systematic issues with disability in this country.” The opportunities for disabled people to engage in sport are limited and so too is awareness. Atkin says she did not know about wheelchair basketball herself until a few years ago. At that time she was not disabled herself, but she accompanied her sister as she discovered the sport, forming an enthusiasm of her own. When Atkin later developed the same condition as her sister, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, she continued to pursue that passion. Now Atkin can dream of being someone who people want to watch on TV, and can seek to inspire other young women and other people with disabilities. Among that audience may be the parasport champions of tomorrow. More importantly, however, there may be more people who simply find the opportunity to fall in love with the sport as Atkin has. “It’s so much fun”, she says. “Every time I play, whether it’s internationally or national league [a mixed-sex competition], wherever I play, I play for fun. I play for fun no matter what and that won’t change, it will never change. I love basketball.” To find out more about the BWBWPL and to buy tickets, go to www.britishwheelchairbasketball.co.uk/womens-premier-league";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/welcome-to-britains-newest-televised-womens-pro-league-wheelchair-basketball;sports

Our fear is that the removal three months ago of the £20-a-week increase in universal credit, just as the cost of living began to rise sharply, has slammed shut the window of opportunity to continue reducing the need for food banks. Members of Feeding Britain’s social supermarkets are already showing signs of distress. People who were shopping every couple of weeks for low-cost food are now doing so daily or weekly. Among those who relied only on the option of low-cost food, there is a growing need for the help we can offer with gas and electricity costs as well. Two moves the government should make to rescue those households are to recalculate April’s benefit uprating so as to reflect the actual costs of living, rather than those of six months ago; and to both reform and extend the warm home discount to this group. In the absence of these moves, worse is indeed yet to come. Andrew Forsey National director, Feeding Britain • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Two years spent mostly indoors has killed the art of dressing. My style references since March 2020 have been hip teens on TikTok, who lately are looking like they just walked off the set of underrated 2000 teen classic Whatever It Takes, and the five-pack of men’s flannelette shirts I got on sale.
No one knows what we are supposed to wear. What we used to wear, as adults with professional jobs, is both uncomfortable – so many waistbands! Such narrow heels! – and, at this point, not even cool. But before you go out to buy an entirely new wardrobe of elastic-backed slacks in some kind of classic bone to pair with an oversized blazer in an attempt at post-Covid office casual, consider this: don’t. Instead, try dressing in the clothes you really enjoy. This does not have to mean embarking on the introspective and often fraught process to determine your personal style, which can be great fun if you are into clothes and up for being negged about your proportions by a New York style consultant, but can also be quite stressful. What if, after your serious consideration, you discover that your personal style is deeply boring? Best not to risk it.
The easiest way to determine what clothes you actually like wearing is to think back to a time when you had the highest level of personal choice over your outfits relative to your awareness of outside opinions. For me, this was about age seven. When I was seven, I wore elastic-sided jodhpur boots with all outfits at all times. I liked stripes. I liked orange and acid green. I did not care whether things were flattering to my body shape because I did not have a shape. Now, at 34, I have four different pairs of elastic-sided boots and am considering getting a fifth. No one has questioned whether this is appropriate. We are living through a traumatic, world-shaping event. We should be able to do so wearing overalls if we wish. Old friends may do a double take when you turn up to brunch dressing confidently like your seven-year-old self. But then they’ll lean forward and ask: “Is that what we’re wearing now?”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/easy-wins-no-one-knows-what-were-supposed-to-wear-so-dress-like-a-seven-year-old;entertainment and culture
2359;2359;2359;2359;2384;2384;Top investor castigates Unilever after failed £50bn bid for GSK arm;2022-01-20;['Mark Sweney'];['Unilever', 'GlaxoSmithKline', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Business'];"A leading Unilever shareholder has called the company’s failed £50bn offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare division a “near-death experience” and said management should focus on improving its core business – or step down. Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, lambasted Unilever in a “postmortem” letter to investors in his £29bn asset management business. The letter comes a day after Unilever said it would not increase its bid for a fourth time, leaving GSK free to float its consumer arm as planned this summer. “[This is] about a near death experience as it now appears that Unilever’s attempt to purchase the GSK consumer business is now thankfully dead rather than the value of our investment in Unilever,” said the letter, which was co-written by Fundsmith’s head of research, Julian Robins. Fundsmith is the seventh largest active shareholder in Unilever, the owner of numerous household brands, including Marmite and Dove soap. In a wide-ranging critique of Unilever and its management, Smith and Robins attacked the company’s long-term performance, accused it of not engaging with shareholders, having a flawed mergers and acquisitions strategy, as well as a “penchant for corporate gobbledegook”. “Unilever’s performance has been poor,” the letter said. “It is the worst performer by a considerable margin amongst the multinational FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] companies we have owned and not just in terms of share price but also in terms of sales growth.” The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of the GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make it more expensive for the company to borrow and force some investors to dump the shares.
Unilever’s share price has lagged rivals in recent years and are down 30% since 2019, when Alan Jope took over as chief executive. Its market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months, even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. “It seems to us that Unilever management’s response to its poor performance has been to utter meaningless platitudes to which it has now attempted to add major M&A activity,” the letter said. “What could possibly go wrong.” Last week, Smith, whose fund holds a position worth more than £800m in Unilever, used his annual letter to clients to attack the Jope’s strategy of boosting the environmental, social and governance credentials of the company rather than focusing on core business performance. Smith said on Thursday: “We believe Unilever management – or someone else if they don’t want the job – should surely focus on getting the operating performance of the existing business to the level it should before taking on anymore challenges.” Fundsmith said Unilever investors should just wait to buy a piece of GSK Consumer Healthcare when it floats, rather than own the business outright by paying a higher price through a takeover.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/top-investor-castigates-unilever-after-failed-pounds-50bn-bid-for-gsk-arm-terry-smith;business and economy
2364;2364;2364;2364;2389;2389;The three lessons for the voting rights struggle from the latest Senate setback | Steve Phillips;2022-01-20;['Steve Phillips'];['US politics', 'US voting rights', 'US news', 'Democrats'];"At the conclusion of the 1984 Democratic national convention, Jesse Jackson gathered his supporters and offered important perspective to those of us who had labored long and hard on his presidential campaign, telling us, “We’ve never gotten freedom at a convention. The convention is a comma, where you pause and go on. We’re going to keep fighting for freedom – at the polls, in the courts, in the streets.” And then he concluded by invoking the phrase made famous by Malcolm X – “Freedom, by any means necessary.”
This week’s fight in the US Senate over the voting rights bill is a comma in a much, much longer story. It is a story that started in 1619 when Africans were brought in chains to America’s shores to do the work that created the wealth that made many white people rich. It is a story encapsulated in the country’s 1790 Naturalization Act, one of the nation’s very first pieces of legislation, which stated that citizenship is reserved to “free white person[s]” (a law that defined US immigration policy until 1965). It is a story that saw hundreds of thousands of Americans who wanted to be able to continue to buy and sell Black bodies go to war and kill hundreds of thousands of other Americans who sought to end slavery. At its core, it is the story of the centuries-long struggle over whether the United States of America should be a multiracial democracy, or whether it should be a white nationalist country. Reflecting on the defeat in the Senate, three dominant realities can help us make sense of what just happened and determine where we go from here. First, the cold, hard truth is that the majority of white politicians have always been reluctant to make America a multiracial democracy (between the House and Senate votes, 60% of the white members of Congress voted against the John Lewis Voting Rights Act). Passage of the 15th amendment itself, guaranteeing the right to vote, was a ferocious battle that raged over months and multiple votes in 1869. Nearly 100 years later, in 1965, it was only after Jimmie Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo and James Reeb lost their lives in the struggle for voting rights that Congress was finally moved to pass the current Voting Rights Act. None of this unwillingness to protect the right to vote is new, and we should be disappointed – but not surprised – at the conduct of the country’s elected officials during this week in which we supposedly honored Martin Luther King Jr. The second reality is that many top Democratic strategists and leaders are behind the times and bad at math. The fact that Democrats put their political capital behind an infrastructure bill before taking on the task of protecting democracy was a race-based political calculation. The infrastructure bill was an attempt by Democrats to woo the support of white swing voters by emphasizing bipartisanship and brick and mortar, race-neutral, projects. The scary policies associated with people of color – things like reimagining public safety, providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants and combating aggressive voter suppression – were downplayed.
The mathematical calculation in determining that sequence of priorities was off from the start. Beyond the morality of the matter, from a crass realpolitik point of view, voting rights protections and ending whites-first immigration practices bring more people of color into the electorate. And people of color vote Democratic. The third, and most hopeful, reality is that progressives can still win, and we need look no further than Georgia for inspiration and instruction about what is possible even in the face of opposition from the right and lack of conviction on the left. Stacey Abrams is very good at math, and she has been working for a decade to engage the 1.1 million people of color who were not voting in a state where elections were routinely decided by 230,000 votes. On the right, Republican Brian Kemp, who was secretary of state during his gubernatorial run against Abrams, improperly purged 340,000 people from the rolls in the 2018 election Abrams lost by 54,723 votes. Abrams did not treat her defeat as a fatal blow; she saw it as a comma, and she went on to continue organizing and building a statewide network of groups and activists who could turn out large numbers of voters of color. For a long time, the leaders in Georgia soldiered on without support from top Democrats who couldn’t calculate the advantage of focusing resources in a state where the strategy centered on expanding the number of people of color voting. By late summer 2020, for example, Senate Majority Pac had invested zero dollars in Georgia while spending $7m in 85% white Iowa. Biden himself expressed amazement at his victory there, saying on election night, “We’re still in the game in Georgia. That’s not one we expected.” The Georgia model elected Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and delivered the current Senate control to the Democrats. In 2022, it can expand that majority, dramatically decreasing the dependence on Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Massive investments in civic engagement organizations and voter mobilization efforts in Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin can propel Val Demings, Cheri Beasley and Mandela Barnes to victories in their races against Republican incumbent senators. This week’s defeat of the Voting Rights Act is one chapter in a long story. While a sad chapter, it need not be the last chapter, and by applying the lessons from Georgia’s journey, we can actually write a happy ending over the next several years.

2365;2365;2365;2365;2390;2390;Colbert on Trump’s ‘pattern of possible fraud’: ‘Certainly more believable than a pattern of business’;2022-01-20;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Seth Meyers', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Trevor Noah', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Television & radio', 'US television'];"Stephen Colbert Late-night hosts lapped up details of financial misconduct by the Trump family on Wednesday evening, a day after the office of the New York attorney general, Letitia James, told a court that its investigators uncovered a pattern of “fraudulent or misleading” business practices at the family company. “That’s believable,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “It’s certainly more believable than a pattern of business at the former president’s fraud.”
James filed the motion in response to Donald Trump’s attempts to block her from questioning him and two of his children, Don Jr and Ivanka, under oath. “Lord, please make that happen,” said Colbert. “I don’t ask for much, and I don’t ask often. All I want before I die is to see Don Jr swear in on a jar of hair gel. It’s the only thing he believes in.”
According to the filing, James’s team found significant evidence that Trump fraudulently valued multiple assets, including his private residence in Manhattan; Trump claimed the triplex apartment was 30,000 sq feet in size, when in fact the actual size was just under 11,000 sq feet. “Yeah, that’s not a surprise – he’s known for falsely tripling the size of his assets,” Colbert remarked. “He once told Stormy Daniels his penis was three inches.” Trevor Noah
On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also reacted to the allegation that Trump overstated the valuation of his New York apartment by over $200m. “No, Donald, no! You can’t exaggerate your apartment’s value by $200m!” Noah said, feigning concern. “I mean, I’d get it if it’s an NFT, but this is an apartment, my friend! “Donald Trump does not give a fuck, let’s be honest,” he continued. “This dude will brag about himself even if it gets him in trouble. I bet if a cop asks him how fast he was going, he was like, ‘yeah, I do 400bn miles a second, the fastest anyone has ever gone, I was so fast. So fast, you want to test it again?’” But though there’s plenty about the former president to mock, “I can’t get mad at him for this,” Noah conceded. “Because deep down, he’s just a landlord, and this is what every landlord in New York does. They’ll say an apartment has three bedrooms, then you get there and two of the bedrooms are somehow in the kitchen, but it’s still the best deal for your budget, so you sleep in your dishwasher. It is what it is.” Jimmy Kimmel
“The walls appear to be closing in on Trump,” said Jimmy Kimmel. “Big, beautiful walls. Mexico’s like, ‘Let us know if you need us to chip in with that, muchachos.’ “Who could’ve ever predicted? I mean, of all things, fraud?” he joked, riffing through old news reports of the family’s numerous fraudulent schemes over decades, from Trump university to his father’s real estate business. “It’s a fairly straightforward case,” he concluded. “To find fraud in a business, you just have to look for the signs, particularly the signs at the top of the building that say Trump on them. And you will find it there. There is where you will find his male-pattern fraudness.” In other bad news for the the former president, the House select committee for the January 6 attack on the Capitol subpoenaed four of his former advisers this week, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. “Which is unnecessary – all they need to do is say his name three times in the mirror and he will appear,” Kimmel joked. “And even if he does show up to answer questions from the committee, he’s just going to lie. That’s just what he does. He’s a liar. He lies about things he doesn’t even need to lie about.” Seth Meyers
And on Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into Giuliani’s subpoena for his role in spreading election lies and fomenting the January 6 insurrection. “I’ll never get over the fact that that guy, who sounds like the guy who sprays the shoes at the bowling alley … that guy was once crowned ‘America’s Mayor’ on magazine covers and became the personal attorney to the president of the United States,” Meyers mused. “Rudy is what happens when a scientist accidentally splices the DNA of a fruit bat and Mr Bean, and yet somehow he ended up working for the most powerful person in the world. “You imagine in your head that the president has all this power and information at their fingertips,” he continued. “They have 17 different intelligence agencies, the White House situation room, an army of government lawyers, and some of the richest, most powerful people in the world on their side, and yet Trump ended up with a Moleman who sweats like he’s the defendant. “Trump told the guy to hold a press conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, and he ended up at the Four Seasons Landscaping Company,” he added. “As a career comedy writer, I’ve got to tip my hat.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/20/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-late-night-tv;entertainment and culture
2372;2372;2372;2372;2397;2397;Talking Horses: Dunne lodges appeal against 18-month ban for bullying Frost;2022-01-20;['Greg Wood'];['Horse racing', 'Horse racing tips', 'Sport'];"Robbie Dunne, who was banned from riding for 18 months in December after being found to have engaged in a campaign of bullying and harassment against fellow rider Bryony Frost, has lodged an appeal against both the finding and the penalty imposed in the case. Dunne denied all but one of the charges against him at a hearing in front of a three-person panel last month, but was ultimately found to have engaged in “conduct prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct and good reputation of racing” by subjecting Frost to a persistent campaign of physical, verbal and online bullying and intimidation over a seven-month period from February to September 2020. The British Horseracing Authority brought a series of charges against Dunne after Frost lodged a formal complaint against him in September 2020. Its case included six alleged instances of bullying and harassment, including two during races at Leicester and Market Rasen, and a confrontation after a race at Southwell when Frost told the panel that Dunne “promised” to cause her physical harm by “putting [her] through the wing [of a fence]”. “The independent judicial panel has received an appeal from the representatives of Robbie Dunne in relation to the finding and penalty imposed on him by the disciplinary panel after its recent hearing,” the BHA said in a statement. The independent judicial panel will now convene an appeal board for the hearing and liaise with representatives of all parties regarding a potential date for the hearing, which will be communicated in due course.” Dunne initially had seven days from the publication of the panel’s written reasons for their finding on 6 January to lodge an appeal, but the 36-year-old rider was subsequently granted an extension until 20 January. Lucky Max stands out at Winter Million The £100,000 Sovereign Handicap Hurdle is the feature event on the first day of the inaugural Winter Million meeting at Lingfield on Friday and it has attracted a strong field including Metier, a Grade One winner as a novice, and three challengers from Ireland. Metier has failed to add to his decisive victory in the Tolworth Hurdle in three subsequent starts, but he hinted at a return to something like that level when fourth in a valuable race at Ascot just before Christmas. Harry Fry’s runner also has form on heavy going, unlike Emmet Mullins’s Carrarea, a sole ride on the card for Irish champion Paul Townend. Fellow raider Lucky Max (3.35), however, is a winner on deep ground and defied a 15lb hike in the weights to complete a hat-trick in a big field at Cork in December. The sixth and eighth horses home there were winners next time, he gets on really well with useful 3lb-claimer Jack Foley and Sean Doyle’s fast-improving six-year-old looks the pick of the prices at around 6-1.
Market Rasen 1.30: The market leaders Minella Buster and Le Grand Lion both put up improved performances last time. A strong pace seems certain here and that just tips the balance in favour of Ben Pauling’s six-year-old, who proved his stamina at Huntingdon last month. Lingfield 1.50: Le Ligerien has never been the most consistent of performers but his debut win over fences at Chepstow a fortnight ago was backed up by a strong time so perhaps a wind op over the summer has done the trick. Market Rasen 2.05: Angels Landing improved to finish within five lengths of a useful winner at Ludlow earlier this month and starts his handicapping career on a very fair mark. Lingfield 2.25: If On The Blind Side runs to the form of his close second in a Grade Two in November, he will take all the beating but his last two outings have been well below par and Emitom, returning to hurdles after two tries over fences, may be the more reliable option. Market Rasen 2.40: Mullenbeg was easy to back on her debut 11 days ago but she powered clear to win with any amount in hand and Milton Harris’s mare looks overpriced again at around 12-1. Lingfield 3.00: Broken Halo improved from his chasing debut to win a handicap at Exeter in a decent time on New Year’s Day, and can take this step up in class in his stride. Market Rasen 3.15: A 3lb rise in the weights is unlikely to stop Hunny Moon following up his course-and-distance win in November. • The Market Rasen meeting is subject to an 8am inspection due to the threat of frost.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/talking-horses-lucky-max-stands-out-at-lingfields-winter-million;sports
2388;2388;2388;2388;2413;2413;Tory defector says whips told him to back PM or lose school funds;2022-01-20;['Peter Walker', 'Jessica Elgot'];['Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'House of Commons'];"The former Conservative MP Christian Wakeford has alleged that party whips told him he would lose funding for a new high school in his constituency if he did not vote with the government. The claim came as the senior Conservative William Wragg urged MPs to report government ministers, whips and advisers to the Speaker – and even the police – for what he claimed was attempted blackmail of some colleagues suspected of possibly opposing Boris Johnson. Anger among Johnson critics escalated again on Thursday after sources briefed that rebels were losing their nerve. Another MP opposing Johnson denied that letters of no confidence had been withdrawn after Wakeford defected to Labour. “These briefings of withdrawals are pure invention from No 10,” one said. “Wakeford may have stayed some people’s hands yesterday but this isn’t going into reverse.” Speaking at a Labour event on Thursday, Wakeford backed up the claims by Wragg that threats involving public money were made by the whips. “I was threatened that I would not get a school for Radcliffe if I did not vote in one particular way,” he said. “This is a town that has not had a high school for the best part of 10 years. “How would you feel when they hold back the regeneration of a town for a vote? It didn’t sit comfortably. That was the start of me questioning my place, where I was and ultimately to where I am now.” Wragg, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC), which looks into the work of government and the civil service, said whips had threatened to withdraw funding from the constituencies of MPs opposing Johnson.
Speaking at the start of a hearing of the PACAC, attended by Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, and Alex Chisholm, the department’s most senior civil servant, Wragg said he believed the actions breached the ministerial code. “In recent days a number of members of parliament have faced pressures and intimidation from members of the government because of their declared or assumed desire for a vote of confidence in the party leadership of the prime minister,” he said. “It is, of course, the duty of the government whips’ office to secure the government’s business in the House of Commons. However, it is not their function to breach the ministerial code in threatening to withdraw investment from members of parliaments’ constituencies which are funded from the public purse. “Additionally, reports to me and others of members of staff at No 10 Downing Street, special advisers, government ministers and others encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass those who they suspect of lacking confidence in the prime minister are similarly unacceptable.” “The intimidation of a member of parliament is a serious matter,” he added. “Moreover, the reports of which I’m aware would seem to constitute blackmail. As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the commissioner of the Metropolitan police. And they are also welcome to contact me at any time.” Wragg asked Barclay and Chisholm to convey his concerns to ministers and the civil service, which they said they would. Johnson said he had seen no evidence to support the claim made by Wragg. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.” The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said allegations about potentially criminal offences would be a matter for the police. “While the whipping system is long established, it is of course a contempt to obstruct members in the discharge of their duty or to attempt to intimidate a member in their parliamentary conduct by threats,” he said. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the alleged threats to withdraw investment to force support for Johnson were “disgusting”. She said: “These are grave and shocking accusations of bullying, blackmail, and misuse of public money and must be investigated thoroughly.” Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the claims showed Downing Street was “now in full scorched earth mode”. He said: “All Boris Johnson cares about is saving his own skin. He’s acting more like a mafia boss than a prime minister.” Wragg was one of the first Conservative MPs to call publicly for Johnson to go because of allegations about lockdown-breaching Downing Street parties, saying the prime minister’s position had become untenable. For Johnson to face a confidence vote among his MPs, 54 of them – 15% of the total – would need to submit letters seeking this to the 1922 Committee, which represents backbenchers. There have been regular predictions this week that the total was about to be met, but it has not yet happened. Wakeford, introducing a speech by Rachel Reeves in Bury the day after his defection, said it was “a great honour, if not a surprise, to be here today”. He said Labour was “ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of and deserves, and certainly not to be embarrassed by, that is one of the reasons I am here today.”.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/ministers-attempting-blackmail-colleagues-who-might-oppose-pm-alleges-tory-mp-william-wragg-boris-johnson;politics
2449;2449;2449;2449;2474;2474;UK government puts animal welfare policies on pause;2022-01-20;['Helena Horton'];['Rural affairs', 'Conservatives', 'Animal welfare', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Animals', 'Boris Johnson', 'Zac Goldsmith', 'Politics'];Some of the government’s most prized new animal welfare policies are being put on pause in what supporters see as a sneaky attempt to ditch the “woke” measures altogether. Senior sources in the Conservative party have confirmed to the Guardian that a series of policies including a ban on trophy hunting imports, stricter sentences for puppy thieves and a ban on live exports of livestock have been put on pause after a campaign led by Mark Spencer, the chief whip. The minister responsible for the policies, Zac Goldsmith, is understood to have heard the news just before taking off on a flight to Ecuador. Spencer, who is a farmer, is understood to be less than keen on the animal-friendly policies touted by Boris Johnson and his influential friends including his wife, Carrie, and Lord Goldsmith. Others within the party, in rural constituencies, have privately complained that the animal welfare policies have been campaigned for by people who live in cities, and that it has made them unpopular with landowning, shooting donors and voters. Many backbenchers hope the next Tory leader is unlikely to continue with the legislation as it is unpopular with influential figures in the party. Allies of Johnson have told the Guardian that the policies are “as good as dead” if the prime minister faces and loses a vote of no confidence. Goldsmith said: “It’s not just that the future of government is uncertain. So too is continued leadership on climate and nature. The measurable truth is that we are now world leaders and have moved things massively on nature – abroad and here (with much more to come) If this PM goes, that very likely ends.” A senior MP who has called for Johnson to resign but supports the animal welfare legislation took a more balanced view. The MP said: “This could be a sort of attempt to coerce the parliamentary party into thinking ‘we have to keep Johnson because otherwise we won’t get the animal welfare legislation’. “We are keeping an eye on it, and certainly will not be supporting any leadership challenger who does not plan to quickly move this legislation through parliament. The thought has crossed all of our minds that another leader might try and dilute the legislation. We have to fight hard against that.” The influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which includes Carrie Johnson, Dominic Raab and Lord Goldsmith among its patrons, plans to throw its weight behind any challenger who backs the welfare legislation. Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet and a spokesperson for the group, said: “We’d be looking for undertakings from any future leader that they would support this legislation. We would be looking for support for the excellent programme of animal welfare legislation the public voted for in the 2019 manifesto.” Friends of Spencer said he was grumbling about the animal sentience bill, which passed in the Commons on Tuesday night, as many farmers believe it could make their lives more difficult and cause welfare standards to be raised on farms. The bill has come under fire from backbenchers as it enshrines in law the feelings of animals including lobsters and fish. There are beliefs that this could harm the fishing industry and that it could turn off traditional Tory voters who see such policies as “woke”. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Animal welfare is an absolute priority for this department. We are getting on with the job, and just last night the sentience bill passed in the House of Commons.” Animal welfare campaigners previously criticised the government for delaying a law that will clamp down on trophy hunting and prevent people from buying harmful animal experiences such as elephant tours. The start of its passage through parliament has been postponed, with ministers accused of “dithering”. The bill was first hoped to be published before the summer recess in July, but has since been pushed back repeatedly. Lorraine Platt, a campaigner who runs the CAWF, told the Guardian: “We support our prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to advancing animal welfare and the world-leading legislation currently passing through parliament to end live animal exports and much more. “It is paramount that this excellent programme of legislation continues its passage for the sake of millions of animals who are set to benefit from this government’s reforms. Any pause in the passage of the current animal welfare bills will be detrimental and deeply unpopular with the British public. We shall be looking to ensure that this powerful suite of legislation continues forwards.” Spencer could not be reached for comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/uk-government-puts-animal-welfare-policies-on-pause;environment
2460;2460;2460;2460;2485;2485;US film-maker tried in Italy on fascist-era charge over tainted blood testimony;2022-01-20;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Italy', 'World news', 'Europe', 'Film', 'Documentary films'];"An American film-maker has been put on trial in Italy for “offending the honour or prestige” of an Italian prosecutor after testifying in a criminal case against a former health ministry chief and representatives of a pharmaceutical company accused of supplying Italians with tainted blood products. Kelly Duda, who revealed how contaminated blood taken from prisoners in Arkansas was sold around the world, faces up to three years in prison if found guilty of an offence that dates back to Italy’s fascist period.
Duda, who also gave testimony to the UK’s tainted blood inquiry in 2007, was contacted by Italian lawyers after his 2005 documentary about the Arkansas scandal, Factor 8, revealed that thousands of unwitting victims in several countries, including Italy, had died after receiving contaminated medications imported from the US. The cases in Italy dated back to the 1980s and 1990s, when 2,605 haemophiliacs were infected with HIV and hepatitis through plasma drawn from the blood of inmates in Arkansas. Duda’s investigation revealed that for three decades the state of Arkansas profited from blood collected from the prisoners, as part of a plasma programme run on behalf of the state by a now-defunct healthcare company. The blood products were sold worldwide, and the prisoners were paid a pittance. Before the documentary and being asked to testify, Duda had no connections to Italy and had not even visited the country. “For me, Italy first came up in 1999, when I discovered that the US FDA had enacted two international recalls of tainted blood, from the Arkansas prison system, and one of the countries this blood had gone to was Italy,” he said. “When I was asked to testify, I debated about whether to do it [and] in the end, I thought I was doing something good as so many people had suffered. But I ended up in a hornet’s nest.” In December 2017, Duda travelled to Naples to testify for the prosecution in a manslaughter trial against Duilio Poggiolini, a former chief of the health ministry’s pharmaceutical division, and 10 representatives from Marcucci Group, a pharmaceutical company which produced and marketed blood products. The defendants were acquitted in 2019. During what Duda described as a chaotic and confusing hearing, prosecutor Lucio Giugliano allegedly attempted to block and discredit his testimony – even though he was a prosecution witness – including evidence of a link between tainted blood from the Arkansas prison and Marcucci Group. After the hearing, as Duda shook hands with Giugliano, he told him: “In my country, what you did today as a prosecutor would be disgraceful.” Giugliano then told the judge that Duda had just committed a crime and the American was briefly detained. Two years later, Duda learned he would face a criminal trial in Rome on charges of having offended a prosecutor’s honour or prestige. Giugliano was not present at a hearing on Wednesday and the trial was postponed until July. Duda, who is being tried in absentia, said: “The prosecutor tried to block his witness – as in, me – from giving evidence and then only asked me questions designed to discredit me. And for this now I’m the one on trial? It’s mind-boggling, but I’m looking forward to defending myself.” The Council of Europe (CoE) published an alert about Duda’s case on its journalism protection platform, to which Italy is yet to respond, and he is being supported by Ossigeno per l’informazione, an organisation established to defend the rights of journalists. The crime that Duda is charged with dates back to 1930, during the rule of Benito Mussolini. Several other journalists have faced similar cases, including the Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo, who is facing two libel claims by a prosecutor in Sicily over a Facebook post and a series of articles published by the Guardian. The CoE posted an alert about Tondo’s case in November, flagging the claims as potential acts of state “harassment and intimidation”. Libel cases filed by prosecutors against journalists have increased in Italy in recent years. “This crime is the heritage of a fascist setting and it’s incomprehensible that it still exists,” said Andrea Di Pietro, Duda’s lawyer. “Even the supreme court has said in several cases that prosecutors, especially prosecutors, must submit to criticism.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/kelly-duda-trial-us-film-maker-italy-tainted-blood-scandal;entertainment and culture

However, I’ve discovered you don’t have to be a customer to have your time wasted. I was emailed an e-receipt from the Wednesbury store (almost 200 miles from where I live) for a £1,589 television. I had not made this purchase and was anxious to discover if this was fraud or error. The email address on the receipt was no longer in operation, and the web chat didn’t work so I had to call customer services. I was promised a response within 48 hours, but heard nothing more. Meanwhile, I was besieged by daily emails thanking me for my purchase, and offering associated deals. I called again, and was passed between operatives who again promised a response within 48 hours. One said he’d put me through to the fraud department and connected me to the police. All I received since then was an email asking for feedback on my recent purchase. CJ, Wareham, Dorset Your experience highlights two concerning issues: firstly Currys’s seeming indifference to a possible case of fraud or error. And secondly, its bombardment of customers who do choose to make a purchase. I’ve previously exposed follow-up phone messages from the company within hours of a sale which customers – and even some agents – assumed were from scammers. It turned out the company was using mobile phone numbers required for delivery updates to hard-sell extended warranties (Currys calls them “care plans”). It claims that its volley of after-sales communications is to make customers feel “supported”. It seems it’s less keen on being contacted by customers who need support. Only after I asked it to explain your predicament did it acknowledge it had made an error. It claims the email of the customer who bought the TV differed from yours by one digit and was inputted wrongly. Your details have now been deleted and the correct customer contacted with the receipt and, doubtless, the onslaught of sales pitches. Currys has paid you £50 in goodwill and says it’s truly sorry for the distress caused. Significantly, no remorse for its failure to address the mistake before media involvement.

Slater, who has not publicly disclosed his Covid vaccination status, has aired some controversial views on the Covid vaccine, including an Instagram comment in October that claimed he knew “more about being healthy than 99% of doctors”. The American tour veteran, who has no medical qualifications, has previously said he is not anti-vaccine but opposed to making vaccination mandatory.
Slater has also been critical of the visa process that ended with the recent deportation of tennis world No 1 Novak Djokovic. The best surfers in the world are scheduled to arrive in Australia for back-to-back World Surf League events at Victoria’s Bells Beach and Western Australia’s Margaret River in March and April this year. “I think we’ve been pretty clear with the Novak Djokovic case of no vax, no play,” the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told Australian broadcaster Channel 9. “It’s a pretty simple message, doesn’t matter what sport, we’re even-handed. I hope he [Slater] gets vaccinated and I hope he competes.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he hoped there would be no repeat of the saga that overshadowed the build-up to the Australian Open and left Djokovic unable to defend his title at Melbourne Park. “It’s important there is clarity from the commonwealth government about who gets in and who doesn’t,” Andrews said on Thursday. “That is a good thing. Least you don’t have a soap opera, drama, that wastes everybody’s time. Tennis is bigger than any one person [Djokovic] and we’re seeing that ... whether it’s at any of the venues down at Melbourne Park.” Andrews said it was unlikely the state government would open discussions with the World Surf League over possible exemptions for unvaccinated athletes following the Djokovic debacle. “That’s kind of a moot point because the commonwealth government have been very clear,” Andrews said. “Clearer now than they have been for a while, which is good.” On Wednesday, the federal sports minister, Richard Colbeck, said there was “no chance of getting into the country” for Slater if he was unvaccinated. “I reckon he knows the rules,” Colbeck told Nine newspapers. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a surfer, or a tennis player, a tourist or anyone else, those are the rules. They apply to everyone. “I don’t like the chances of him competing in Victoria and I’d hate to think of what the chances were of him competing in Western Australia.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/kelly-slater-australia-covid-vaccine-rules-visa-not-vaccinated-surfer-world-surf-league;sports
2488;2488;2488;2488;2514;2514;I read all 27,000 Marvel comics and had a great time. Here’s what I learned;2022-01-20;['N/A'];['Culture', 'Comics and graphic novels', 'Marvel', 'Books', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Superhero movies'];"This should not be too hard, I thought, as long as I stay disciplined. All I have to do is read 27,000 comic books, then write about them. I had just signed a contract to write All of the Marvels, a book about reading every superhero story Marvel has published since 1961 as one single gigantic narrative. The Marvel story is omnipresent – its characters are everywhere, in movies, on television, even gracing shampoo bottles and bags of salad – yet also unknowable. It purports to be one big story: any episode can refer to, and be compatible with, any earlier one. But not even the people telling the story have read the whole thing. That’s not how it was meant to be experienced. I did not, however, read six decades of stories in order. That would have been unbearable – and it is one of the two mistakes Marvel-curious readers often make. It is a surefire route to boredom and frustration as the fun lies in following your whims. The other error is trying to cherrypick the greatest hits, the pivotal single issues. Taken in isolation, these are peaks without mountain ranges. Their dramatic power comes from their context. Instead, I would go grazing, looking at whatever seemed most fun that day: the plot-dense 1980s Spider-Woman, then the monstrously huge dragon Fin Fang Foom, followed by a bunch of 1970s romance comics that gave veteran cartoonists (who had been drafted into the superhero game) a chance to get back to their roots, specifically, drawing young women wearing very fashionable clothes and crying.
I read the stories on couches, on the bus, on the treadmill. I read them as yellowing issues I had bought when they were first published, scored at garage sales as a kid or snagged from a discount bin at a convention as an adult. I read them in glossy, bashed paperbacks from the library and as gems borrowed from friends. I read a few from a stack of back issues somebody abandoned on the table next to mine as I sat working in a Starbucks. I read a hell of a lot on a digital tablet. I did not intend to read any at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert in the summer of 2019. The only comics I had brought with me were copies – to give away – of 1998’s X-Force #75 , in which the team attends the same event, transparently renamed the “Exploding Colossal Man” festival. But somebody had set up a memorial shrine for Stan Lee, Marvel’s longtime figurehead, and at its base there was a box labelled: “Read me.” It contained some battered but intact 50-year-old issues of The Amazing Spider-Man, Thor and Tales of Suspense. What was I going to do, not read them? And I had an absolutely great time. The best of Marvel’s comics, old and new, were as astonishing, thrilling and imaginative as popular entertainment gets. There was also plenty of sophomoric, retrograde stuff, rushed out to serve an audience of credulous kids or bloodthirsty nostalgics. I was often aware that I was gorging on something that had only been made for snacking, indulging the worst part of the collector’s impulse: the part that strives for completeness (just like the Beyonder in Secret Wars II!) rather than enjoyment.
Fortunately, by the time I had by the time I’d waded in too far, a useful transformation had come over me. I realised that I was able to find something to enjoy in just about any issue: examples of a certain creator’s unique use of language or weird cultural references that could have appeared at no other moment. That may have been Stockholm syndrome, I admit. But when someone recently asked me if I had actually read every issue of NFL SuperPro, a mercifully short-lived series about a super-powered American football player, I said: “Of course! And #10 includes both a parody of the mythopoetic men’s movement of the early 1990s and a character whose power is literally to throw money at problems – coins come flying out of his hands.” The reading stage went on for longer than I thought it would. It turns out my brain can only handle so much gaudily coloured, hyper-violent soap opera in a single day. The high point may have been wrestling with the thoughtful, exquisitely drawn, yet problematic 1974-1983 title Master of Kung Fu, which introduced the character of Shang-Chi, who recently made it to the big screen. A taut, introspective espionage thriller whose antagonist is Fu Manchu, the series became, over time, both more impressive and – for its racist portrayals – more wince-inducing.
Or it may have been rediscovering writer Chris Claremont’s legendary 16-year run on Uncanny X-Men, whose freaky inventiveness and compassion for its cast of mutants and outcasts made it the comics equivalent of David Bowie’s career. Then there was the joy of reading Ryan North and Erica Henderson’s disarmingly tender The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl series with my son. Its protagonist has the “proportional speed and strength of a squirrel”, but her real power is a knack for creative nonviolent conflict resolution, a rare quality in a superhero. The low point was definitely the week and a half I spent locking myself into a New York apartment, forcing myself to plough through 30 years of the blood-drenched adventures of my least favourite character, the Punisher, who has so far slaughtered upwards of 1,000 drug dealers, security guards and the like. (I counted.) I also developed a fascination with the extremely minor 1961 series Linda Carter, Student Nurse. It is not good, by any reasonable standard, but it is remarkable as an example of Marvel’s forgotten titles from the 60s about ordinary young women, and how their characters and tone were absorbed into the superhero line. Its protagonist turned up again a decade later, in the cast of the even shorter-lived Night Nurse, and again in the 2000s as a nurse who runs a secret medical clinic for injured superheroes. For a while, she also dated Doctor Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, who lived in New York’s Greenwich Village and is due to appear on screens this year, in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
I saved myself a fine dessert: the last title I checked off my spreadsheet was Thunderbolts, the long-running, constantly mutating, gleefully perverse series about a team of supervillains masquerading as heroes, who do very good things for very bad reasons. As I had hoped, I gradually got a sense of the grand, accidental shape of the Marvel story and the way it reflected its times. Once you see Iron Man as a 60-year running commentary on the US’s military-industrial complex, you cannot unsee it – from the protesters picketing Tony Stark’s weapons plant in the 1970s to the drone technology he deploys in the 2000s. I noticed Black Panther’s curious history, how the gorgeous concept of Wakanda, his African home, evolved from dozens of writers and artists improvising on each other’s inventions over decades: from the Afro-technological utopia of that fictional nation’s first appearance in 1966, to the political intrigue added in the 1970s, and the regional factions that debuted in the late 1990s. The writing process also took longer than I had figured it would: turns out it is not easy to get a solid grip on a story more than half a million pages long. After finishing an initial version, I ended up scrapping it almost completely and starting over. What made everything eventually click was realising that I could be a tour guide for readers. The last stage of writing went painfully slowly, during the awful months when the pandemic overlapped with Donald Trump’s presidency. But my immersion in the Marvel story had become a useful lens, even in that moment. It became clear that Dark Reign, with its interlinked storylines that appeared in 2009, had been unnervingly prescient, both about what a totalitarian monster rising to power in the US might look like (in this case, the ultra-wealthy, mediagenic, murderously cruel Norman Osborn, AKA Spider-Man’s old archenemy the Green Goblin) and about what might bring him down (the reunion of a fractured coalition, here in the form of the Avengers, as well as some smart reportage).
I refuse to claim that there is some kind of canon of essential issues that everyone can enjoy. There is no such thing. What I can do is offer pathways into the mountain of Marvel, and suggest perspectives from which that enormous story can offer the joy for which it was designed: a 1966 issue of Fantastic Four that shows the frantic inventiveness of Jack Kirby and Lee in their golden era; a decades-spanning cluster of Thor and Loki comics that provide an ingenious meditation on fiction, myth and lies; a set of Vietnam war-era issues that chart the evolution of Marvel’s relationship to politics. You want to know my favourite characters? I am not going to tell you, because it doesn’t matter. What I care about is giving you the tools to find your own.

2512;2512;2512;2512;2539;2539;Antimicrobial resistance now a leading cause of death worldwide, study finds;2022-01-20;['Andrew Gregory'];['Antibiotics', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'World news', 'Society', 'Health'];"Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to humanity, health leaders have warned, as a study reveals it has become a leading cause of death worldwide and is killing about 3,500 people every day. More than 1.2 million – and potentially millions more – died in 2019 as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, according to the most comprehensive estimate to date of the global impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The stark analysis covering more than 200 countries and territories was published in the Lancet. It says AMR is killing more people than HIV/Aids or malaria. Many hundreds of thousands of deaths are occurring due to common, previously treatable infections, the study says, because bacteria that cause them have become resistant to treatment. “These new data reveal the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, and are a clear signal that we must act now to combat the threat,” said the report’s co-author Prof Chris Murray, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “We need to leverage this data to course-correct action and drive innovation if we want to stay ahead in the race against antimicrobial resistance.” Previous estimates of the health impact of AMR have been published for several countries and regions, and for a small number of pathogen-drug combinations in a wider range of locations. However, until now no estimates have covered all locations or a broad range of pathogens and drug combinations. The new Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (Gram) report estimates deaths linked to 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations across 204 countries and territories in 2019. Statistical modelling was used to produce estimates of the impact of AMR in all locations – including those with no data – using more than 470m individual records obtained from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other data sources. The analysis shows AMR was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide, and associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths, in 2019. HIV/Aids and malaria have been estimated to have caused 860,000 and 640,000 deaths, respectively, in 2019. While AMR poses a threat to people of all ages, young children were found to be at particularly high risk, with one in five deaths attributable to AMR occurring in children under the age of five. The report highlights an urgent need to scale up action to combat AMR, and outlines immediate actions for policymakers that would help save lives and protect health systems. These include optimising the use of existing antibiotics, taking greater action to monitor and control infections, and providing more funding to develop new antibiotics and treatments. The UK’s special envoy on antimicrobial resistance, Dame Sally Davies, said AMR was “one of the greatest challenges facing humanity”. She added: “Behind these new numbers are families and communities who are tragically bearing the brunt of the silent AMR pandemic. We must use this data as a warning signal to spur on action at every level.”
Regionally, deaths caused directly by AMR were estimated to be highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, at 24 deaths per 100,000 population and 22 deaths per 100,000 population respectively. In high-income countries, AMR led directly to 13 deaths per 100,000 and was associated with 56 deaths per 100,000. In the western Europe region, which includes the UK, more than 51,000 people died as a direct result of AMR. Other experts said Covid-19 had demonstrated the importance of global commitments to infection and control measures, such as hand-washing and surveillance, and rapid investments in treatments. Tim Jinks, the head of the drug-resistant infections programme at Wellcome Trust, said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global collaboration: political leaders, the healthcare community, the private sector and the public working together to tackle a global health threat. “Like Covid-19, we know what needs to be done to address AMR, but we must now come together with a sense of urgency and global solidarity if we are to be successful.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/antimicrobial-resistance-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infections-deaths-lancet-study;health
2524;2524;2524;2524;2551;2551;Louis Hanson: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet);2022-01-19;['N/A'];['Comedy', 'Culture', 'Internet', 'Social media'];"You’re about to take a journey through the inside of my mind. Take a seat and make yourself comfortable. I hope you like what I’ve done with the place. To the left you’ll find a bunch of old MySpace HTML codes, Spice Girls song lyrics and a play-by-play of every embarrassing thing I’ve ever done (they like to come to the surface at 2am whenever I’m trying to fall asleep). To the right, just over there, is my “no thoughts, just vibes” room – a space reserved for zero memory retention. It’s a place I like to visit whenever I try to think of a recipe or remember someone’s name immediately after meeting them.
Down the hallway, you’ll find a shrine containing some of the funniest things I’ve ever seen on the internet, curated from my years of being online. Here are 10 of those things. Godspeed. 1. Extreme ironing
I first discovered the art of extreme ironing back in 2017, when I came across some pictures of people ironing in various intriguing locations, like underwater, on canoes or atop mountain lookouts. As someone who a) hates ironing and b) engages in activities that aren’t considered extreme (napping all day), I’m in awe of their dedication to the craft. (For further reading, check out the history of the Extreme Iron world championships – riveting stuff.) 2. Art restoration fails
I derive great pleasure from art restoration fails, because I am a sick and twisted being. Thankfully, for my sick and twisted soul, there are many out there on the internet. This one is my favourite. 3. ‘But he’s gay’
This moment will go down in television history as one of the most wondrous on-air bloopers of all time. “But he’s gay,” the anchor begins, before realising the error of her ways, and pivoting. “I mean, he’s gay, excuse me … he’s blind.” She really Dua Lipa-ed and “did a full 180” on this one. Whiplash. I return to this priceless gem thrice a year. 4. Hobby horse riding
Here, my dear friends, you’ll find footage of the annual hobby horse riding championships in Finland from 2017. While galloping on hobby horses, competitors engage in dressage and show jumping, with a ferocity that one can’t help but be enamoured of. I cannot express how much joy hobby horse riding gives me. I hope to follow in their footsteps one day. Clop clop. 5. Ava
Occasionally, I’ll come across something on the internet that epitomises my very existence in a matter of seconds; Ava is one of these instances. Lady Gaga’s Bad Romance on the television? The matted pink wig? That swift swivel to reveal a look of disgust at being interrupted? Ava is not only a mood, she is the mood. Ava is you, Ava is me, Ava is all of us. 6. Yassification
The rise of “yassification” in 2021 – thanks to @YassifyBot and its use of extreme Facetuning to give any and every picture a gorgeous smoky eye and airbrushed complexion – also fills me with immense of joy. 7. Voice reveals
The juxtaposition between player one deepening his voice in a bid to sound as sexy as possible and player two sounding like a mythical troll mid-exorcism had me hunched in the foetal position for approximately 35 seconds. I then sat back up and resumed my day. 8. Toy drama
@Sylvaniandrama has amassed an army of loyal followers on TikTok for using Sylvanian Families toys to construct dark and twisted storylines (think lots of drugs, alcoholism and murder to the score of a cute Taylor Swift song). I am one of those loyal followers. 9. Stop being horny. Find Jesus
A Twitter account that lectures its followers on masturbation, horniness and Jesus? Delightful. 10. The Chanel multiverse
A woman loses her parrot, an African Grey by the name of Chanel, who flies towards a canal. The internet then holds a candlelight vigil, spawning a number of sassy Twitter accounts from the perspective of Chanel and her love for the canal. Chanel ultimately becomes the heralded princess of the internet, and the woman’s cries are turned into several underrated club remixes. Need I say more? It’s the gift that keeps on giving. The Chanel saga was arguably the saving grace of 2020. God bless Chanel, and God bless the internet. Louis Hanson is a writer, podcaster and presenter.

2527;2527;2527;2527;2554;2554;ITV agree deal to show Premiership rugby, including live final;2022-01-19;['Robert Kitson'];['Premiership', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"English club rugby is set to return to free-to-air television following the agreement of a new deal with ITV. At the start of this season there was widespread disappointment when the popular Channel 5 highlights show was axed but Premiership Rugby has now negotiated a fresh partnership with ITV until the end of the 2023-24 season. There is a catch for viewers hoping to see full games on ITV every weekend, with the deal involving a mere four live matches this season plus the final on ITV4. Premiership officials, though, are delighted that their grand finale, for the first time in the competition’s history, will be shown on live free-to-air TV in tandem with BT Sport’s well-regarded coverage. In each of the next two seasons, however, seven games including the final will be aired by ITV, organisers having apparently accepted that the abrupt disappearance of the sport from Channel 5 was a mistake which needed rectifying. It was the first time for 14 years that Premiership rugby had not been available on terrestrial television, with Craig Doyle and Martin Bayfield having presented their first ITV highlights show in 2007. The new weekly highlights show on ITV4 will now be fronted by David Flatman and Topsy Ojo.
Premiership Rugby’s new chief executive Simon Massie-Taylor hailed the deal as “great news for the league, our clubs, the supporters and the profile of rugby in England” and now hopes it will prove a springboard towards more widespread interest in the sport. “Our ambition is to grow the game and make Gallagher Premiership Rugby available to as many people as possible,” said Massie-Taylor. “BT Sport have done an amazing job in building the core Premiership Rugby TV audience and the ITV partnership allows us to expand our reach into the households of millions of other rugby fans. This season our average match audience on BT Sport has risen 30% year on year, which shows the potential.” Last season’s final between Harlequins and Exeter Chiefs was among Twickenham’s most enthralling days and Massie-Taylor is seeking to make the 2022 final the most-watched fixture in the tournament’s history. “We believe we can achieve that with the match screened on both ITV4 and BT Sport,” he added. “It is also crucial for us to have a weekly highlights programme that is accessible to millions of people. This will allow us to showcase the best of Gallagher Premiership rugby to the widest possible audience.” ITV’s first live game will see Sale Sharks playing host to the Premiership pacesetters Leicester Tigers on 30 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/itv-agree-deal-to-show-premiership-rugby-including-live-final;sports
2531;2531;2531;2531;2558;2558;Biden nominates wealthy Democratic donor as US ambassador to UK;2022-01-19;['Julian Borger'];['Biden administration', 'US foreign policy', 'US news', 'UK news', 'Democrats', 'Joe Biden', 'World news'];Jane Hartley, a businesswoman and Democratic party fundraiser, has been nominated as the next US ambassador to Britain, continuing a practice by both parties in recent decades of appointing wealthy donors to the prestigious job. Hartley, who served as ambassador to Paris in the Obama administration, is a business executive, and is married to an investment banker, with a record of large-scale fundraising for Democratic candidates. She has been a campaign “bundler”, meaning she has solicited and coordinated over $100,000 in contributions to the party from groups of donors. During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden had said he would break from the practice of handing out ambassadorships as rewards for the wealthy faithful. “I’m going to appoint the best people possible,” he promised. “Nobody, in fact, will be appointed by me based on anything they contributed.” Despite that campaign pledge, 25 of Biden’s ambassador picks are former “bundlers”, a third of the total, according to a Washington Post analysis published before the Hartley announcement. That is a higher proportion of fundraisers than either Barack Obama or George W Bush appointed in their first year. Donald Trump did not disclose the figures for the number of “bundlers” he made ambassador, but he made a higher percentage of political appointments than his predecessors. Hartley, 71, will now face confirmation hearings in the Senate. She was a White House staffer in the Jimmy Carter administration but later went in to business and rose to become chief executive officer of the G7 and Observatory Group consulting firms. Her husband Ralph Schlosstein is the CEO of Evercore Partners, a global investment banking advisory business. The main controversy during Hartley’s ambassadorial stint in Paris was her decision to commission Jeff Koons for a monument commemorating the 2015 wave of terrorist attacks in the French capital. Koons produced a giant metal hand holding a multicoloured bouquet of tulips, which triggered an uproar of complaints over its appropriateness, both in style and location. The venue for the 35-tonne sculpture was in a very wealthy area just off the Champs-Élysées and not in the poorer 11th arrondissement where the murders took place in and around the Bataclan theatre. French cultural figures wrote an open letter condemning it as a “opportunistic, even cynical” project. “It’s really shocking that Biden has put forward so many with so little diplomatic experience,” Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House. “In the past, when Hartley served, the stakes were not so high for an ambassador. But, now with the very credibility of our country on the line, with the confidence in our leadership at historic lows, we cannot be sending amateur diplomats abroad.”;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/biden-nominates-jane-hartley-us-ambassador-to-uk;politics
2532;2532;2532;2532;2559;2559;Albanese stakes out Coalition seats in Queensland as Morrison zeroes in on NSW ahead of election;2022-01-19;['Sarah Martin'];['Australian politics', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Scott Morrison', 'Labor party', 'Coalition', 'Australia news'];"The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has spent more than a fortnight in Queensland since parliament rose in early December as he stakes out northern seats as a key part of his plan to form government. A Guardian Australia analysis of seats visited by both Scott Morrison and the opposition leader in the six weeks since the “phoney campaign” began shows Queensland has been the focus for Labor but the prime minister has zeroed in on marginal seats in New South Wales. Albanese’s three Queensland visits, which included a pre-Christmas holiday in Bargara near Bundaberg, have focused on Coalition-held seats, including the safe seats of Dawson, held on a 14.6% margin, and Hinkler, held on 14.5%.
In a 10-day blitz of Queensland seats this month, Albanese has also campaigned in the more marginal government-held seats of Herbert, Leichhardt, Longman, Brisbane, Capricornia and Flynn. At the last election, Queensland was the Coalition’s strongest performing state, with the Liberal National party securing 58% of the vote on a two-party-preferred basis in what was a 4.3% swing towards them. Labor now holds just six of 30 seats in the state and believes it needs to claw back ground in order to form government – with Longman, Flynn and Leichhardt seen as the most likely gains. During his most recent Queensland visit, Albanese acknowledged the Labor party’s poor performance in the state in 2019 and said the party needed to do better. “Well, we didn’t get enough votes right around Queensland. One of the things that I’ve been determined to do is to make sure that we do better right around Queensland,” Albanese said while campaigning in Townsville in the seat of Herbert, held by the LNP’s Phil Thompson with an 8.4% margin. “Across the board, we weren’t successful enough. We’ve learned the lessons. We did a whole review into it … our policy offering wasn’t strong enough to secure the support of people in Queensland.” Albanese said he believed Queenslanders were ready for a change in government but after the swing towards the Coalition in 2019, the ALP faces large margins in seats previously held in order to form government. Capricornia, held by the Nationals MP Michelle Landry, was once a traditional Labor seat but over four elections, from 2010 to 2019, Labor’s first preference vote has halved in the seat. The declining vote has been attributed to Labor’s climate policies – with much of the wealth in central Queensland coming from coal mining. In a visit to the seat of Dawson, where Albanese was asked about government approvals for the New Acland coalmine, a local journalist challenged him on how “coal workers in the regions can trust you’ll protect their jobs”. “I’m in favour of projects as long as they receive environmental approvals going forward,” he said. Albanese has prioritised Queensland over summer but he has also visited the seats of Adelaide and Boothby in South Australia and Bass in Tasmania. The prime minister, by contrast, has mainly visited NSW electorates where the Coalition believes it stands the strongest chance of winning seats off Labor. The Coalition, which now holds 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, needs to retain that number but must offset expected losses in Western Australia where the federal government is deeply unpopular. Morrison found time in December to briefly visit marginal seats in Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland – but the Omicron outbreak has seen him mostly confined to Canberra in the first few weeks of January.
The seats Morrison has chosen to visit suggest the government is targeting a swag of Labor held marginals, including Corangamite in Victoria, held by Labor’s Libby Coker on a 1% margin, Eden Monaro in NSW held on a 0.8% margin and Macquarie held on 0.2% – Labor’s most marginal seat. Last week, the Liberal party endorsed former NSW transport minister Andrew Constance for the seat of Gilmore, which the Coalition is hoping to win back from Labor’s Fiona Phillips, who holds the seat on a 2.6% margin. Both leaders also found time in December to visit the Coalition marginal western NSW seat of Reid, held by the Liberals’ Fiona Martin on a 3.2% margin, which will be a key battleground. Morrison, who has been derided in Victoria as the “prime minister for NSW”, also found time to campaign in Lindsay, held by the Coalition on a 5% margin, a seat also visited by Albanese last month.
In Queensland, Morrison has visited the Labor-held marginals of Lilley, held on a 0.6% margin, and Moreton, held on a 1.9% margin. With the election firming for May – most likely 14 May or 21 May – a formal campaign will begin in earnest within the next 12 weeks. Morrison’s hope for a strong campaign in NSW is being hampered by the party’s failure to endorse candidates in a range of critical seats, with preselections being delayed as a result of factional infighting in the state. Sitting MPs including Alex Hawke, Trent Zimmerman and Sussan Ley are all under threat if plebiscite ballots go ahead, leading to factional leaders attempting to negotiate a peace settlement ahead of the election.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/albanese-stakes-out-coalition-seats-in-queensland-as-morrison-zeroes-in-on-nsw-ahead-of-election;politics
2534;2534;2534;2534;2562;2562;German Green party leaders face inquiry into Covid bonuses;2022-01-19;['N/A'];['Germany', 'Europe', 'World news'];Berlin prosecutors have launched an investigation into the leadership of Germany’s Green party, including the new vice-chancellor and foreign minister, over Covid bonus payments last winter. Prosecutors and the party confirmed on Wednesday the investigation into a preliminary suspicion of breach of trust after a report by the weekly publication Der Spiegel. A Greens spokesperson said the party’s six-member leadership, including Robert Habeck, the economy minister in Germany’s new coalition, and Annalena Baerbock, now foreign minister, were being investigated by the Berlin prosecutors. “The board members concerned and the (party’s) main office are cooperating fully with the public prosecutor’s office to clarify the facts quickly and comprehensively,” the spokesperson said. At issue is the role of the party leadership in approving the so-called corona bonus of €1,500 (£1,250) per person for employees of the party headquarters and leaders. The bonus was meant to compensate for the inconvenience caused by working from home and by renovation works at the building. Habeck and Baerbock are stepping down from the party leadership this month, something the Greens expect of government ministers. Internal party auditors have raised questions over the bonus payments to the leadership board, according to reports. The Greens said its leadership was entitled to make the decision but had since paid the bonuses back. It said the leadership and party headquarters are cooperating with prosecutors to clear the matter up. Prosecutors said there had been several criminal complaints from private individuals, which they were obliged to look into. The investigation was opened on 6 January.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/german-green-party-leaders-inquiry-covid-bonus-payments;environment
2546;2546;2546;2546;2574;2574;Pork pie putsch and curry coup: the history of Downing Street plots;2022-01-19;['Patrick Wintour'];['Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'House of Commons', 'Conservatives'];"The “pork pie putsch”, named in reference to Alicia Kearns, the Melton Mowbray MP allegedly seeking to topple Boris Johnson, is part of a long tradition of British political conspiracy. It is the lot of a modern British prime minister not just to govern, but to survive relentless internal intrigue, some hatched in Midlands curry houses, some in Commons tearooms, and some in country houses or on the boundaries of a Test match at Lord’s. Some plots come into the open at the moment the conspirators planned, others are unmasked prematurely by party whips delighted that early exposure will prove fatal. Some surprisingly succeed, such as the ousting of Margaret Thatcher, while others, such as the one launched by two former cabinet ministers in 2009 against Gordon Brown, evaporate the day they are launched. But the extent to which plots can preoccupy Downing Street is hard to exaggerate. Harold Wilson, often for good reason, was preoccupied by conspiracies to oust him. Lord Marsh, then a court favourite, recalled when he was summoned to the Downing Street flat: “You would sit there for an hour or so and then you would be questioned closely about plots and what Desmond Donnelly or Austen Albu were up to. He distrusted everybody.”
Wilson became so paranoid that he planted stories that Roy Jenkins, Jim Callaghan, and Anthony Crosland had attended a conspiratorial weekend in July 1966 at Ann Fleming’s house in Sevenhampton. Jenkins had indeed been at the house (“in moments of crisis people are caught in characteristic poses”, as Susan Crosland described it), but no other Labour politician had. Such was Wilson’s determination to reveal plots that dissident cells were structured in the parliamentary party on the model of a liberation army. An inner group of nine or 10 MPs was charged with forming a constellation of a smaller group. The dissidents’ gathering of intelligence – over secretive drinks – often sounded more efficient than the reality, according to one of them, David Marquand. He recalled: “When the inner group met, we used to say things like, ‘I have spoken to two and don’t know about the rest’, and somebody would write down Bloggs Unknown. It was all quite ridiculous.” At a May Day rally at the Royal Festival Hall in 1969, Wilson finally confronted the plotters, saying: “I know what is going on.” His biographer, Ben Pimlott, wrote: “There was audible intake of breath as the audience feared some paranoid rambling,” but instead Wilson said to laughter: “I am going on. Your government is going on.” He told the plotters and defeatists to “climb into bed and pull the blankets over their heads and not hinder the rest of us”.
The prize for most ineffective plot was one mounted by Margaret Hodge and Geoff Hoon to oust Gordon Brown, known as the “great goose plot” owing to it being hatched in Hodge’s Suffolk country house over roast goose. Others dubbed it the “pashmina plot” owing to its middle-class origins. It lasted a few hours and had all the momentum of a clamped car. Hoon, defence secretary during the Iraq war, had been planning to oust Brown since November 2009, some say because Brown had not offered him a plum job as a European commissioner. Only six months earlier, in 2009, James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, had walked out of cabinet hoping to trigger a revolt, including by his friend David Miliband. The Hoon plot, also discussed with Patricia Hewitt at Gandhi’s, an Indian restaurant in London, got off to a shaky start when Hoon’s office mistakenly sent a mysterious blank email to Labour MPs at 10.59am. An apology followed and the real coup email was issued at 12.26pm – just as prime minister’s questions ended, a poor moment since Brown had put on a particularly effective performance. They called for the leadership issue to be resolved “once and for all”. Promised heavyweight cabinet support, only silence and then derision followed. Hoon, asked on Newsnight that night whether if he had been Brutus, Caesar would have survived, said: “I am afraid he would.” The hoped for “Et tu, Harriet?” never came. Another ill-executed plot was against Tony Blair, by Tom Watson, a defence minister and one of Brown’s acolytes. It emerged that the day before Watson delivered a letter calling for Blair to resign he had been in Brown’s house in Scotland. Watson claimed he had been staying at a luxury golf resort in St Andrews and, being in the area, popped into the chancellor’s house to deliver (and watch) some Postman Pat videos with Brown’s young son.
Watson’s explanation became even less sustainable when it emerged he had been in a curry house in Wolverhampton with a group of ringleaders the night before the journey to Scotland. The “balti house” or “curry house conspiracy” was revealed when the Mail on Sunday discovered the MPs had signed the owner’s visitors’ book – leaving glowing reviews and incontrovertible evidence they had dined together. Until more recent times, the Conservative party tried to behead its leaders with dignity. Harold Macmillan was “persuaded to retire” by the legendary men in grey suits after he suffered a curable prostate problem. He complained of 20 malcontents. “Some few will be content with the success they have had in the assassination of their leader and will not care very much who the successor is.” But by the end of his prime ministership, he cut a lonely figure, reportedly taking refuge in West End clubs to an almost pathological extent: Pratt’s, Athenaeum, Buck’s, Guards, the Beefsteak, the Turf, the Carlton. A member of Pratt’s calling in one evening in the 1960s inquired if anyone was there that night. “Nobody at all, sir, only the prime minister.” John Major in 1995 was blessed by his challenger being John Redwood, who gathered the courage to take up Major’s back-me or sack-me challenge in a conversation at Lord’s cricket ground. The European Research Group that prematurely tried to oust Theresa May in a 2019 vote of no confidence largely operated in the open in a madhouse parliament. Some cabinet ministers were more discreet, operating as the “pizza plot”, a group of five. Although they never secured their objective, May’s defeat, they did manage to force her to say she would be gone by the next election.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/pork-pie-putsch-and-curry-coup-the-history-of-downing-street-plots;politics
2549;2549;2549;2549;2577;2577;Woman sentenced to death in Pakistan over ‘blasphemous’ WhatsApp activity;2022-01-19;['Shah Meer Baloch', 'Hannah Ellis-Petersen'];['Pakistan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Islam', 'Religion'];"A court in Pakistan has sentenced a woman to death over allegedly blasphemous messages sent over WhatsApp and Facebook. Aneeqa Ateeq, 26, was found guilty and given a death sentence by a court in Rawalpindi on Wednesday after a complaint was registered against her under Pakistan’s draconian cybercrime and blasphemy laws According to the charge sheet, Ateeq, 26, met her accuser, a fellow Pakistani, online in 2019 through a mobile gaming app and the pair began corresponding over WhatsApp. He accused her of sending blasphemous caricatures of holy prophets, making remarks about “holy personages” on WhatsApp and using her Facebook account to transmit blasphemous material to other accounts. In doing so, she “deliberately and intentionally defiles sacred righteous personalities and insulted the religious beliefs of Muslims”, according to the charge sheet.
Ateeq, who has stated that she is a practising Muslim, denied all the charges. During the trial, Ateeq told the court that she believed the complainant intentionally dragged her into a religious discussion so he could collect evidence and take “revenge” after she refused to be friendly with him. The court found her guilty, gave her to a 20-year sentence and ordered her to be hanged. Ateeq’s lawyer Syeda Rashida Zainab said: “I can’t comment on the judgment as the issue is very sensitive.” Pakistan is an Islamic state and has some of the harshest blasphemy laws in the world, regularly handing down death sentences. In practice executions are not carried out and the accused spend their lives in jail. However, blasphemy trials in Pakistan are highly dangerous, with the accused often killed by vigilantes before courts reach a verdict on their cases, while judges, fearful of the implications, rarely acquit the accused and are often pressured into reaching guilty verdicts. Pakistan has recently asked Facebook and Twitter to help identify its citizens suspected of blasphemy so it can prosecute them or pursue their extradition. While minorities such as Christians and Hindus have largely been targeted by the laws, Pakistani Muslims have also found themselves facing blasphemy charges. The cases often take place quickly, in a closed court, away from public scrutiny. Evidence in many of the cases has been thrown into doubt. Pastor Zafar Bhatti, Pakistan’s longest-serving blasphemy prisoner, who was been accused of sending blasphemous text messages abusing the prophet Muhammad’s mother, has alleged the texts were sent by a number that did not belong to him. Bhatti was recently sentenced to death for the charges. In recent years social media has become the new frontier for blasphemy cases. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), passed in 2016, gave the government greater powers to control content posted on social media, including content deemed blasphemous. In 2017, Taimoor Raza was the first person sentenced to death for allegedly committing blasphemy on Facebook, one of the first steps towards an intensified crackdown on dissent on social media after the passing of cyber laws. The issue of blasphemy remains highly sensitive in Pakistan. Last month a Sri Lankan national working in a factory in Pakistan was beaten to death and his body was set alight by a mob of hundreds of people after he was accused of committing blasphemy by removing religious posters from the factory walls. According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, about 80 people in Pakistan are in prison for blasphemy, with at least half sentenced to death, though there have been no executions.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/pakistan-woman-aneeqa-ateeq-sentenced-to-death-blasphemous-whatsapp-messages;politics
2551;2551;2551;2551;2579;2579;Commons backs suspension for MP who ‘undermined’ own apology for bullying;2022-01-19;['Jessica Murray'];['House of Commons', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];MPs have voted to approve a one-day suspension for the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski after he “undermined” an apology he gave in the Commons for bullying staff. The standards watchdog found that the Shrewsbury MP had indicated in media interviews that he did not fully mean the gesture, and recommended his suspension should be limited to one day as Kawczynski had committed to undertaking further work on his behaviour. Kawczynski initially apologised in the Commons in June last year after an investigation found he had ranted at one senior Commons official, called another a “snowflake” and “useless”, and denigrated a third staff member via WhatsApp. He told the Commons: “I have reflected on my behaviour, I accept it constituted bullying and as such was highly inexcusable.” In an interview with his local BBC radio station earlier that day he said the process was unfair and he had no choice but to apologise, prompting a fresh inquiry. In a personal statement in the Commons on Wednesday, Kawczynski said he acknowledged speaking to the media “undermined the sincerity” of his apology and said: “I am sorry that my conduct will have had a further harmful effect on the complainant and that it may have diminished public confidence in the process.” He added: “I accept that speaking out in the way I did to the media had a detrimental effect on the house’s conduct policy by undermining the integrity of the complaints process and I deeply regret my actions. I am committed to learn from the mistakes I have made and to work on my personal development, especially in my communication with others, in every interaction that I have. “I am conscious that my conduct may have merited suspension from the service of the house for a longer period.” The report by the House of Commons standards committee, published last week, found Kawczynski was “still struggling with a capacity for genuine empathy with others, and as a result still has a tendency, which he may not fully realise, to see himself rather than others as the ‘victim’”. The MP said he appreciated “the committee’s consideration of the difficulties that I was experiencing in my personal life of the time and the mental health issues”, having previously said he was in “an emotional and distressed state” on the day of the interview. “A profoundly emotional and devastating family trauma in 2019, coupled with a series of work-related problems, combined to affect my mental health in an unprecedented way,” he said in a statement after publication of the report, adding that he was receiving “abuse in the street” whenever he went out. “I wish to reiterate that nothing I have said about my own mental health struggle should detract in any way from my full acceptance of the committee’s decision.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/commons-backs-suspension-for-mp-who-undermined-own-apology-for-bullying;politics
2554;2554;2554;2554;2582;2582;Big Dog’s contempt comes back to bite him | John Crace;2022-01-19;['John Crace'];['Boris Johnson', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'PMQs', 'House of Commons', 'Gray report'];What a difference a day makes. On Tuesday Big Dog had been Hang Dog. Not remorseful exactly, as that would require a level of empathy and self-knowledge that is well beyond him. But certainly abject. Sorry for finding himself in such a mess, if not for causing it. Sorry that he had reached the end of the road. Come prime minister’s questions, the trademark defences were back in place. The desperation of a leader, already on borrowed time, who is having to beg for yet another last chance. It’s a sight with which countless betrayed wives and girlfriends are all too familiar. First there was the surefire tell that Boris Johnson is about to start lying: the smirk (though these days it’s rarer to find a time when he’s telling the truth). Then there were the desperate and petulant displays of temper, masquerading as banter, from someone who hates to be challenged. A man who consistently mistakes arrogance for genuine self-worth. Finally, there was the contempt. Not just for opposition MPs but also for his own. Especially for his own. He has even less respect for those who buy his crap than those who call him out for the chancer he knows himself to be. Mostly, though, the contempt is for himself. Deep down, at a subconscious level, Boris knows better than anyone that he degrades both his position and the country. PMQs opened with Christian Wakeford, the former Conservative MP for Bury South, defecting to Labour by taking his seat behind Keir Starmer on the opposition benches. A few Tories jeered as the Labour leader welcomed Wakeford to the party, and Starmer ad libbed that the chief whip must have told them to bring their own boos. That stung. It was meant to be their man, their Big Dog, who told the best gags. Now they didn’t even have that. This was Starmer at his most relaxed. He wasn’t that bothered if Johnson went that day or in a week or month’s time. The exit was now priced in, so he would make the most of it and just have some fun with the prime minister along the way. He ran through Big Dog’s catalogue of excuses. First there had been no parties. Then he had been sickened and furious that others in Number 10 had had parties. Then he had been at some of the parties. Then he hadn’t realised the party he had been at had actually been a party. And in any case he had spent the 25 minutes at the party in a totally dissociated state, so he hadn’t noticed there were tables laden with food and booze and people getting pissed. Then when he had come to his senses and realised he was at a party, he had no idea such gatherings were illegal as no one had bothered to tell him what the rules were. Even though he had made them up and had spent an hour a day at press conferences telling the country what the rules were. The five stages of coming to grief. Big Dog tugged at the toddler haircut and waved a paw dismissively. It all made perfect sense, only the entire country was too stupid to see it. “You’ll just have to wait for the Sue Gray inquiry to report back,” he said. Though even if Gray doesn’t directly apportion blame, it’s hard to see how Johnson comes out of an inquiry with a shred of credibility. Just imagine. The best Gray could say about the prime minister was that he had either been in a fugue state or that he was incapable of distinguishing between a party and a work meeting. Starmer continued to expose the absurdities of Johnson’s lies and all Big Dog had to offer in return was more and more lies. He claimed the Tories had fixed the cost of living crisis when only that morning inflation had risen to 5.4%. He claimed to be proud of the work his staff at Number 10 had done while boasting about how many he was going to sack to save his skin. Keep it classy. He claimed it had been him alone who had made all the right calls on Covid when in the first year he had got most things wrong. He lied about the UK having the highest booster take-up in Europe. We don’t. The SNP’s Ian Blackford mentioned the record-breaking 175,000 who had died. Big Dog just sniggered, pulled faces and played with his watch. Still keeping it classy. There was a small band of Boris loyalists, but most Tories were as unimpressed with their leader as the opposition MPs. None who spoke showed any flicker of support, preferring to keep things neutral. Though not David Davis. He went nuclear. Enough was enough. Quoting both Oliver Cromwell to parliament and Leo Amery to Neville Chamberlain, he said to a hushed chamber: “You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.” This wasn’t your average Tory malcontent. It was a respected old-timer, an arch Brexiter and longtime Johnson supporter who saw through Big Dog’s pantomime theatrics. Boris tried to shrug off the attack but was visibly shaken. He even said he had no idea where such a famous quotation came from. It makes you wonder if he actually wrote – let alone read – the passages in his book about Churchill that cover the early years of the war. Johnson the Great Pretender. Who can’t even cut it as a pound-shop Churchill. It was telling that after this, only a few Big Dog diehards bothered to stay for his statement declaring that Covid was as good as over. Boris ploughed on regardless. Even though 438 people had died the day before and the NHS was stretched to breaking point, Johnson was removing all remaining restrictions because that was popular with his party. Besides, if you’re incapable of sticking to the rules, you might as well get rid of them.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/big-dogs-contempt-comes-back-to-bite-him;politics
2555;2555;2555;2555;2583;2583;Unilever will not increase £50bn offer for GSK consumer arm;2022-01-19;['Jasper Jolly'];['Unilever', 'GlaxoSmithKline', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Pharmaceuticals industry', 'Business'];"Unilever has said it will not increase its offer for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare division above £50bn after investors and analysts balked at the risk of it pulling off a large merger. Data shared by GSK suggested the “fundamental value” of the business was no higher than £50bn, Unilever said after the stock market closed on Wednesday. Unilever, which owns brands ranging from Hellmann’s mayonnaise to Dove soap, made three offers to GSK, the last of which was worth £50bn in cash and Unilever shares. GSK is planning to list its consumer arm, which includes brands such as Aquafresh toothpaste and Panadol, by the summer. News of the bids was leaked at the weekend, forcing Unilever to clarify its strategy. In a hastily arranged announcement its chief executive, Alan Jope, said the company was planning to focus on fast-growing health, beauty and hygiene brands and sell slower-growing operations, with parts of its vast food portfolio a key candidate. However, investors did not appear to welcome Unilever’s ambition. Its share price dropped by almost 11% on Monday and Tuesday, before rallying by 4.5% on Wednesday. The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make borrowing much more expensive and force some investors to dump the shares.
Unilever has struggled under Jope’s leadership, and shares remain almost 30% below their 2019 record high. The market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. The company was criticised by Terry Smith, a prominent fund manager, for focusing on sustainability rather than the fundamentals of the business – although Jope argues that environmental, social and governance credentials will protect it financially in the long term. Yet Unilever is also facing pressure from another front, with some shareholders keen to see it push further on improving the health of customers, adding to its ambitious goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2039. On Thursday, Unilever investors who manage $215bn (£148bn) in assets revealed they had filed a shareholder resolution urging the company to adopt ambitious targets to increase the share of healthy foods in its sales. The UK’s largest local government pension fund, the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, was among the investors backing the resolution, which will be voted on at Unilever’s next annual meeting. Other backers include the pan-European asset manager Candriam, the Dutch asset manager actiam, the US healthcare provider Trinity Health and the British asset manager CCLA. Ignacio Vazquez, a senior manager of healthy markets at ShareAction, a campaign group which helped to coordinate the resolution, said: “Unilever has long been a sustainability leader. Some even criticise it for being too focused on the environmental, social and governance [ESG] issues. Yet the health profile of the food and drink products it sells remains a blind spot. This is surprising, as the rapid growth of regulation means that health is a critical ESG issue presenting a real financial threat to its business.” In its statement on Wednesday, Unilever said: “We note the recently shared financial assumptions from the current owners of GSK consumer healthcare and have determined that it does not change our view on fundamental value. Accordingly, we will not increase our offer above £50bn.” GSK said on the weekend that the £50bn bid “fundamentally undervalued” the business, suggesting a merger with Unilever would be unlikely. Unilever added that was “committed to maintaining strict financial discipline to ensure that acquisitions create value for our shareholders”, rather than chasing market share at the expense of profitability. Jope on Monday characterised the approach as “improving the quality of Unilever, not necessarily the size of Unilever.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/unilever-will-not-increase-50bn-offer-for-gsk-consumer-arm;business and economy
2570;2570;2570;2570;2598;2598;MPs who moved across political spectrum;2022-01-19;['Sarah Marsh'];['Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Labour'];"Christian Wakeford told Boris Johnson that the Conservatives “have shown themselves incapable of offering” the “government this country deserves”, in a parting shot as he defected to Labour. But the Bury South MP, who had submitted a letter of no confidence against the prime minister, is not the first to defect to another party due to disagreements with leadership. Here are some famous cases of MPs moving across the political spectrum. Tory to Liberal Democrats – Sam Gyimah Wakefield is not even the first MP to leave due to disagreements with Boris Johnson. The former universities minister Sam Gyimah defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2019, accusing Johnson of “veering towards populism and English nationalism”. The then MP for East Surrey said he had left the Conservatives to fight against the government’s “scorched-earth approach” to delivering Brexit, regardless of the cost to the country. Labour to Liberal Democrats (via Change UK) – Luciana Berger Berger had been a member of the Labour party but was critical of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn’s approach to antisemitism and Brexit. In February 2019, members of her local party briefly proposed motions of no confidence in her for “continually” criticising Corbyn. She went on to join other former Labour and Conservative MPs in forming Change UK, a pro EU party, but left this group in June 2019 to sit as an independent MP, before joining the Liberal Democrats. She stood unsuccessfully for Finchley and Golders Green in the 2019 general election. At the time she left Labour for the Lib Dems she said they were “the strongest party to stop Brexit”.
Labour to Change UK – Mike Gapes Gapes had been a Labour MP for 27 years but left the party due to being unhappy with the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. For Gapes, foreign policy differences were the major factor, and he accused Corbyn in his resignation letter of taking the “wrong side on so many international issues, from Russia to Syria to Venezuela.” Similarly to Berger, he joined Change UK. In the December 2019 election, Gapes was defeated by Labour’s Sam Tarry. Conservatives to Change UK – Anna Soubry Soubry was among a number of MPs who left their political parties due to Brexit turmoil. When she left the Conservatives she said it was because of her party’s shift to the right and support of leaving the EU. She became leader of Change UK but lost her seat in the 2019 general election, finishing a distant third. Conservatives to Labour – Quentin Davies Wakefield is also not the first Tory MP to defect to Labour. In 2007 Quentin Davies made the move, “delighting” the new Labour leader Gordon Brown. The MP for Grantham and Stamford made his decision after clashing with the then Tory leader, David Cameron. He wrote that the party seemed “to have ceased collectively to believe in anything, or to stand for anything”. Cameron wrote back to Davies saying: “You have made your choice and the British people will make theirs.” Conservatives to Ukip – Mark Reckless The Tory MP for Rochester and Strood was among a number of Conservatives to defect to Ukip in 2014. The Eurosceptic politician said he had not taken the decision lightly but claimed the Conservative leadership was “part of the problem that is holding our country back”. His announcement came just before the Conservative party conference in Birmingham and was a blow to Cameron at the time. The defection came eight months before the general election. At the Ukip conference in Doncaster, Reckless said voters felt “ripped off and lied to”, adding: “Today I am leaving the Conservative party and joining Ukip.” He had wanted more action on a European referendum, tax and immigration. • This article was amended on 20 January 2022.

2574;2574;2574;2574;2602;2602;If Johnson is ousted, expect a showdown between Tory MPs and the party faithful | Martin Kettle;2022-01-19;['Martin Kettle'];['Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Priti Patel', 'Liz Truss', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Dominic Raab', 'Politics', 'UK news'];Boris Johnson’s fall is not yet a fact. But it grows more likely by the hour. The hue and cry resumed at full throttle on Wednesday morning. Then Christian Wakeford, Conservative MP for the “red wall” marginal of Bury South, who had been the regional chief of the Back Boris campaign in 2019, defected to Labour. Thirty minutes later, David Davis quoted Leo Amery (who was quoting Oliver Cromwell) telling Neville Chamberlain in 1940: “In the name of God, go.” No leader can indefinitely survive these levels of assault. Assuming it now takes place, there are two important things to keep in mind about the 2022 Conservative leadership election. The first is that the many twists in this extraordinary story may not have all been exhausted. Experience of recent Tory leadership contests suggests that we should expect the unexpected. There are many possibilities. Johnson could pre-empt a confidence vote by the uncharacteristic act of resigning. He may decide to walk away from No 10 immediately, presumably leaving Dominic Raab as temporary prime minister and boosting the justice secretary’s otherwise slim chances. One or more leadership candidates may also pull out unexpectedly, as Johnson and Andrea Leadsom did in 2016, opening the way for Theresa May’s win. Improbably, the Tory party could unite behind Rishi Sunak without a vote, as it did behind Michael Howard in opposition in 2003. The second, if the election process runs its full course, is that this will produce the first change of leader of its kind in British political history. Never before would a prime minister have been forced out by his or her party’s own MPs and then been replaced by a new prime minister chosen by the party’s members. That scenario is stuffed with political dynamite. It could be a brilliant, gamechanging success – but it could just as well be an absolute disaster. There are no precedents. One thing is sure. If Johnson loses the vote of confidence for which MPs are now sending in letters, he would certainly be out. He cannot contest the leadership election that would follow. Not even Johnson can break that rule. This is what happened to Iain Duncan Smith as leader of the opposition in 2003. But it has never happened to a serving Tory prime minister. The last three Tory prime ministers who lost power midterm all did so by resigning. Each quit because the writing was on the wall. Margaret Thatcher decided not to contest the second round of the 1990 contest in order to open the way for someone else – John Major, as it turned out – to stop Michael Heseltine. David Cameron stepped down after losing the vote to leave the European Union in 2016. Although May had survived a confidence vote the previous December, she was forced to quit in May 2019 as the Tory party fell apart over her Brexit strategy. To kick a prime minister out in a vote of no confidence is a very big call indeed. It would be a damning verdict on Johnson personally and on his “great man” view of history and himself. He might not hang around in the Commons, triggering a very losable byelection in Uxbridge. His rejection could cause him to become bitter in his old age, as Ted Heath’s did in 1975. Even more significantly, it could entrench lasting political divisions in the Tory ranks, as the fall of Robert Peel did in 1846. There would be implications for party political realignment here. The immediate political question that most matters is whether the ousting of Johnson will outrage the party membership. There is every reason to expect this, and MPs need to be prepared for it. Judging by the Tories’ recent leadership contests – this would be the third in six years – there will again be lots of candidates: not surprising, with the premiership as the prize. Eight tried to enter the race in 2016. Thirteen tried in 2019. With no overwhelming favourite this time, expect another crowded field as MPs seek to winnow the contest to the final two, from whom the membership will choose. Conventionally, political parties in revolt against themselves tend to choose the opposite kind of leader to the one they have just got rid of. Johnson rather than May is a classic example. Further back, Major rather than Thatcher is another. That might point to Rishi Sunak this time as the candidate with most of the skills Johnson lacks, or suggest Jeremy Hunt would be in with a chance. This doesn’t take into account the cultural and ideological differences between the largely southern, largely old, largely white membership and many of the parliamentarians. For that reason, the candidates who claim to be picking up the populist standard from Johnson may do best. Liz Truss is the initial frontrunner, judging by membership surveys, but Priti Patel will see this contest as her best shot too. Watch out for Steve Baker, who may decide he has the organisation skills to beat Truss among the MPs. Baker will then offer himself to the membership as the only candidate who can be guaranteed to save Brexit and prevent Nigel Farage from mounting a comeback. Much will also rest on the contest’s length and timing. The 2019 contest took nearly two months before Johnson was confirmed winner. If this one does the same, the candidates may have to juggle their responses to anything from a new Covid variant to the energy price rise, trying to sort the Northern Ireland protocol before the May elections, or a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sunak is still probably the best bet in this race. But do not believe anyone who claims they know for certain where all this is leading. They don’t. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/boris-johnson-tory-mps-party-conservatives-populists;politics

2593;2593;2593;2593;2621;2621;What is a pulse oximeter and can I still buy one in Australia? Demand for devices climbs as more people manage Covid at home;2022-01-19;['Donna Lu'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Omicron variant', 'Indigenous Australians'];"Unprecedented Covid cases in Australia have coincided with surging demand for pulse oximeters, as hundreds of thousands of people manage their infections at home. At-home care guidelines for Covid-19 suggest using pulse oximeters – portable devices worn on the finger – to provide a measurement of oxygen in the bloodstream.
Low oxygen saturation levels may be a warning sign of worsening Covid, and people at higher risk of having their condition deteriorate – such as those who are over 65, pregnant, immunocompromised or Indigenous – may be provided with an oximeter by a local health service. But a run on pulse oximeters has made buying them difficult, with experts saying they aren’t a necessary device for everyone who is Covid positive. What is a pulse oximeter used for? President of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, Dr Andrew Miller, said pulse oximeters were reliable devices often used during anaesthesia and in intensive care. “It’s a bit like a thermometer in that … it’s something that can be used at home by a layperson and get a meaningful result out of it.” The device, which clips painlessly over a fingertip, measures blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. It works using lights and a sensor that measures the colour of blood, which is brighter red when there is more oxygen in it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Cheaper oximeters display the measurements as figures, while more expensive models also display a waveform of the pulse in the finger. Some phones and smart watches have a pulse oximeter function, but the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has warned that these “are not accurate and should not be used”. Oximeters can be a useful addition to proper medical care, but not a replacement, Miller said. “We would encourage that they only be used in the context of someone who’s getting clinical support to be at home by either a state hospital-in-the-home service or a general practitioner.” In the absence of an oximeter, breathing rate can be a good proxy, Miller said. “We’re normally breathing about 12 [breaths a minute]. People who are breathing over about 15 to 20 respirations a minute … we start to get concerned.”
Dr Suzi Nou, an anaesthetist in Melbourne who has been managing Covid patients in the community said: “If you’re having trouble breathing, if it’s an effort to do things like walk up the stairs, if you’re having trouble talking in a complete sentence and that makes you breathless, if you’ve noticed your lips or fingernail beds are going a little bit blue – they would be very strong signs that there’s not enough oxygen in their body.” Are they accurate? For those who are able to source a pulse oximeter: an oxygen saturation of 95% or above is the typical baseline for a healthy person breathing at rest. According to Australian guidelines for people with Covid a saturation level between 92% and 94% at rest is a sign of moderate disease. “In a non-pandemic world, if I had a patient who is otherwise fit and healthy and a bad chest or viral chest infection with saturations of 93%, I’d want to be looking into that,” Nou said, adding that people with lung conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis may have a baseline level lower than 94%. “Less than 92%, that is concerning: call an ambulance. Definitely seek medical attention,” she said.
There are certain factors that will help to improve the accuracy of a reading. The devices are affected by movement – such as coughing fits, as well as poor circulation in the fingers. People with acrylic or gel nail polish should rotate the oximeter on their fingertip – so that it clips over the skin instead of the nail. Concerns have also been raised about the accuracy of the devices in people with darker skin pigmentation. Earlier this month, the Therapeutic Goods Administration warned that pulse oximeters could overestimate oxygen levels in people with darker skin tones – meaning that low oxygen levels had the potential to be missed in these populations. “If a state health system was rolling these things out, they need to make sure that they’re using one that’s been validated across ethnicities,” Miller said. Nou said the jury was still out on how significant an effect skin tone had on oximeter accuracy. “I do a lot of work in developing countries with people with darker skin pigment, and I haven’t been too concerned about the accuracy of them,” she said.
“The monitoring is there to assist your … observation of the patient. So if I think someone is looking like they’re having trouble breathing and the monitor tells me it’s a great number, I’m always more likely to believe the patient.” Can I still get one? Nou said anecdotally people had been struggling to source them for personal use. “I’ve had some patients who have been able to get hold of them, so it is variable,” she said. A spokesperson for the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said members had not reported any noticeable uptick in demand for oximeters since the start of the pandemic. But only one of 10 chemists Guardian Australia contacted in Victoria and New South Wales said they had any in stock. One pharmacy worker at a major chain in Melbourne said they had been out of stock for two weeks and were not sure when a resupply would occur. Another said the products were “quite popular at the moment” and that they hadn’t had any available since Christmas. “Everyone’s been trying to get them,” said a third, while a fourth said their usual wholesale supplier was out of stock.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/what-is-a-pulse-oximeter-and-can-i-still-buy-one-in-australia-demand-for-devices-climbs-as-more-people-manage-covid-at-home;health
2615;2615;2615;2615;2643;2643;Monopoly money: is Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard good for gaming?;2022-01-19;['Keza MacDonald'];['Games', 'Culture', 'Microsoft', 'Computing', 'Technology', 'Business'];"In 2014, Microsoft bought Minecraft’s developer Mojang for what seemed, at the time, an eye-popping figure: $2.5bn (£1.8bn). It was the first in a series of bullish video-game studio acquisitions by the tech giant, whose games division has been led by executive Phil Spencer, a long-time advocate for video games within Microsoft and the wider business world, for the past eight years. More studios followed, for undisclosed amounts: beloved Californian comedy-game artists Double Fine, UK studio Ninja Theory, RPG specialists Obsidian Entertainment. It seemed that under Spencer’s leadership, Microsoft was cementing its commitment to the Xbox console and the video-games business by investing in what makes games great: the people who make them.
Then came 2020’s deal to acquire Zenimax (and with it Bethesda), for a properly astonishing $7.5bn. This was different. This wasn’t the Xbox division acquiring studios to make games for its consoles. This was an entire publisher, with several different studios and a whole portfolio of popular game series. At this point Microsoft’s spending started to look like a monopoly move – a bid to sew up the market by closing off hugely popular games behind Microsoft’s own consoles and services. When it was confirmed that Bethesda’s forthcoming games, including this year’s space role-playing epic Starfield and the next fantasy Elder Scrolls game, would be exclusive to Xbox and Microsoft Game Pass, I started to wonder whether Microsoft’s stated aim to make video games more widely available to everyone was lining up with its actions in the market.
But Zenimax is nothing compared with this week’s news that Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard, for nearly $70bn. This latest acquisition – the biggest in video-game history by some margin, more than 17 times what Disney paid for Marvel – shows beyond doubt that Microsoft is extremely committed to dominating the video-game market, now and in the future. Its main competitor Sony has an exceptional stable of talented developers making games for its PlayStation 5 console – the latest of which, Insomniac Games, was bought in 2019 for “just” $299m. Though Microsoft hasn’t released exact sales numbers for its more recent Xbox consoles, it is widely thought that the PlayStation has outsold them by a significant margin. But without Call of Duty, just one of many giant games properties that Microsoft now owns, PlayStation is left even more reliant on its own studios to create games that people want to play. If all of Activision Blizzard’s games soon become Xbox and PC exclusive, as Bethesda’s now are, it will transform the console market, creating even more of a monopolistic environment. Right now, with Nintendo, there are only three big players in games consoles. Do we really want that to become two, or one? What would that mean for games, and the people who make and play them? It’s possible that studios will be largely left alone to create what they want, and that the creative diversity of games won’t be affected too badly. But one company then creams off a large percentage of all the profits.
This is enough by itself to cause a huge stir in gaming, but it’s also only a narrow slice of what this deal means. When it goes through, Microsoft will also own King, creators of Candy Crush and several more of the most popular mobile games in the world. It will own World of Warcraft, one of the oldest and most beloved virtual worlds. It puts one company in charge of an enormous slice of people’s leisure time and money, the world over. Going by Phil Spencer’s past comments, Sony and PlayStation aren’t the only competition Microsoft is thinking about – it’s all games, all the virtual places where people spend their time and money, from Fortnite to Roblox. This is why the word “metaverse” is being thrown around by executives. It’s about more than Xbox v PlayStation. What Microsoft wants is to be where everyone goes to play games, of all kinds. Through its Game Pass service it has laid the foundations for it to become the Netflix of gaming, the hub for all content. But where Netflix has moneyed competitors in Disney, Apple and Amazon, no other company in gaming can compete with Microsoft. Even Nintendo, the longest running and best-resourced company in gaming, does not have $70bn to throw around. (Its entire war chest amounts to $9bn.) What’s happening here is akin to what happens when oil billionaires rock up to the Premier League, buy a team, and pack it with the best players. It is not a level playing field.
Tech companies have, historically, never been able to buy their way to success in the video-game industry. Amazon has failed. Google has failed. Apple has only ever dipped a pinky into the waters. Microsoft itself has made several huge mistakes on this front in the past, buying up developers such as Lionhead only to shutter them later. The fact is that games are not tech products; they are not phones, which get incrementally better each year, or software, or services. They are entertainment; they are art. Technology is what enables games, what creates them, but it is not what they are. Microsoft sees games as content. It seems not so much interested in creating games – or selling consoles – as owning where and how we play them.";https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/19/monopoly-money-is-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-good-for-gaming;science and technology
2618;2618;2618;2618;2646;2646;Why are ministers obsessed with teaching children to read using phonics? | Alice Bradbury ;2022-01-19;['Alice Bradbury'];['Primary schools', 'Education', 'Schools', 'English and creative writing', 'Early years education', 'Literacy'];"Over the last decade the way in which children are taught to read in primary schools in England has fundamentally changed. The teaching of reading is now dominated by phonics, or more accurately “synthetic phonics”, where the focus is on teaching children the connection between phonemes (sounds) and letters. This teaching of the alphabetic code has always been part of learning to read, but our new research suggests it now dominates, to the exclusion of a more balanced approach involving reading whole texts and understanding the meaning of words. For example, children are given a statutory test when they are five or six called the “phonics screening check”, where they are given pseudo-words, or nonsense words, like “sut”, “blem” and “meck” to read. They do not need to know what these mean, but are judged to have “read” them correctly if they say the appropriate sounds. Yet this is decoding, not reading for understanding. Moreover, the inconsistencies in English spelling mean that children cannot only rely on phonics to read: common words like “the” and “she” have to be taught as exceptions. Our new research (written with Prof Dominic Wyse) found that the majority of teachers of children aged three to six were using a “phonics first and foremost” approach. In our survey of more than 2,000 teachers, teachers said that English as a lesson had been replaced by phonics, and that they were under pressure to “live and breathe phonics” to make sure their students did well in the phonics test.
The problem is that the evidence does not back up this push towards phonics. Our review of systematic reviews (that combine evidence from multiple studies) and of robust longitudinal experimental trials, published in 55 research papers, concluded that contextualised teaching of reading is the most effective way for children to learn. This involves combining phonics with reading whole texts, and focusing on understanding words and sentences. There is no substantial research base that supports the dominance of synthetic phonics. Internationally, England is an outlier in using this policy approach to teaching reading, and data from international assessment tests suggest that teaching reading in England may have been less successful since the adoption of the synthetic phonics approach. So how did we get to a point where thousands of children are being taught to read in a way which has no basis in proper evidence? The “reading wars” have a long history, but the shifts in England’s policy in the 2010s marked a new era of phonics dominance in England. This grew out of the recommendation in 2006 by Jim Rose that phonics be taught “discretely” as a separate skill, and the inclusion of phonics within the primary national strategy. However, a huge boost was given to phonics by the introduction of the phonics screening check in 2012, as it brought the particular skill of decoding into the system of judging and comparing schools. Dedicated phonics lessons and a focus on nonsense words have been found in classrooms ever since. The government has recently ratcheted this up further by asking inspectors to check that teachers in reception classes “teach children to read systematically by using synthetic phonics and books that match the children’s phonic knowledge”. The Department for Education has revised the list of “approved” phonics schemes, so schools have had to buy new schemes and sets of “decodable” books. The debate about the teaching of reading relates to a wider problem of education policy that proclaims to be evidence-based but instead relies on limited evidence selected on the whims of ministers. In an open letter with over 250 signatories, we are calling on the government to act on the evidence, and take on a more balanced approach. Teaching phonics has a place – because who would disagree that children need to learn about letters and sounds – – but by focusing on it to the exclusion of other skills, we are failing our children.

2633;2633;2633;2633;2661;2661;Adele’s divorce album is a slyly subversive fit for a Vegas residency;2022-01-19;['Laura Snapes'];['Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Adele', 'Culture', 'Divorce', 'US news', 'World news', 'Las Vegas'];"Las Vegas is a comfortable place to land for pop stars. It’s where you go to bask in the validation of a job well done, to rest on a solid legacy at a point where the future may have become less certain and any tentative steps into it may harm that legacy. It seemed, for a while, a safe harbour for Britney Spears after her troubles (until she said she was made to perform against her will); Lady Gaga and Katy Perry also set up shop in the desert after their imperial phases faded. Adele, whose three-month Caesars Palace residency begins this weekend, has no need for this lucrative safety net – her latest, 30, was the biggest album of 2021 with just six weeks on sale. She’s playing there for practical reasons: she hates touring and wants to be close to her son at home in Los Angeles. But there is also something quietly subversive about her presence, right now, in a place synonymous with light entertainment and celebrating adult milestones. Once known for supplying comfort and artistic consistency (even complacency, perhaps), Adele made one of last year’s most confrontational albums.
Prior to 30, I had listened to Adele’s earlier records out of professional duty, decided they weren’t for me, and moved on; she is my age but felt completely alien from our times. Her third album, 25, made me quite uneasy – here was a young mum, apparently in a solid relationship, revisiting juvenile heartbreak again. Hearing her reanimate that corpse felt to me like another young female artist getting trapped in purgatory – anxiety, whether hers or the label’s, that the public would never let her escape the sadness that made her name. When news broke that she was divorcing, there was an unseemly glee at the album people assumed she would write – a kintsugi masterpiece, flooding her brokenness with that golden voice. Adele may have made some predictable music in the past, but she seldom moves that way in her own life. For the first time, her music followed suit. The album 30 is neither full of recriminations for her ex-husband nor regret; instead Adele is steadfast that she had to leave her marriage because she was unhappy, and she was certain that her commitment to personal happiness would ultimately benefit the whole family – though finding fulfilment isn’t as straightforward as simple emancipation. The album follows a linear journey through her anguish at the pain and confusion it causes their son (My Little Love), and the depression and despair that accompanies her newfound solitude (Cry Your Heart Out). But her self-worth accrues with the album’s run time – and her belief in self-sufficiency. “All you do is complain about decisions you make,” she sings on Woman Like Me. “How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?” She’s singing to a lazy new lover who hasn’t met her expectations, but it also feels like a subtle challenge to Adele’s audience to reconsider how they see her – not as a reliable remedy during their own periods of heartache, but as a woman who took a risk to redefine happiness on her terms and forge a healthier relationship to herself – as well as to truly consider their own lives and potential for change. Critics have often justified Adele’s era-defining success by her relatability, but the daring woman on 30 is a provocation; the pop equivalent of Glennon Doyle, the self-help guru whose work made Adele feel “as if I just flew into my body for the very first time”. 30 hit me in a way I would never have expected. Adele’s album titles – 19, 21, 25, 30 – map a direct journey through adulthood with all its attendant milestones. And as New Yorker critic Carrie Battan wrote, her “contemporary take on soul, blues and gospel has been appreciated as a monument to tradition”. 30 derails that linear path of growth and defies tradition in both senses. It is her most idiosyncratic album, still respectfully in touch with those influences, but more playful with them: the wryly processed Motown girl group harmonies on Cry Your Heart Out; the use of voice notes on My Little Love that she has said nod to Tyler, the Creator and Skepta; the boozy looseness of I Drink Wine. She finds greater power in the subtleties of vocal expressiveness than she did in sheer volume – the coy head-in-the-clouds flirtatiousness of All Night Parking, the embarrassed neediness of Can I Get It – though she makes her unparalleled vocal power into a weapon on To Be Loved, making the listener feel the weight of her decision: “Let it be known that I tried,” she bellows, strafing her vocal chords.
You wonder whether her quest for greater self-knowledge and fulfilment opened up this potential for experimentation, to venture beyond the bounds of her once-fixed musical identity as she did her roles as a wife and mother. The expansive pleasures of this album also stake a claim for the vitality of adult contemporary music, a once-powerful genre diminished by age-conscious segregation of radio formatting and the commercial assumption that parents and pop fans over the age of 35 have Bublé-steeped mush for brains. The realities of adult life and pop are seen to be incompatible: as I previously wrote about Robyn, the music industry is built on selling the kind of self-belief that only truly comes with age, yet few artists, particularly women, get to mature on their own terms.
Even Adele – the century’s biggest commercial success – had to field these concerns. In an interview with Zane Lowe, she recalled a meeting where someone at her label highlighted the importance of making sure 14-year-olds knew who she was. “I’m like, but they’ve all got mums!” Adele said. “If everyone’s making music for the TikTok, who’s making music for my generation, for my peers? I’ll do that job gladly. I’d rather cater to people that are on my level in terms of the time we’ve spent on Earth.” She rejected the idea that 12-year-olds should even listen to 30. “It’s too deep! Thirty- and 40-year-olds are all committing to themselves and doing therapy. That’s my vibe. That’s what I was doing.” Maybe, then, Vegas is the perfect place for Adele to debut this album to the public. In front of the nearly weds and newly divorced merrymakers, here is someone who gambled on her future and won herself back.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/19/adeles-divorce-album-is-a-slyly-subversive-fit-for-a-vegas-residency;entertainment and culture
2634;2634;2634;2634;2662;2662;"Britney Spears accuses father of financial misconduct; threatens sister with legal action";2022-01-19;['Ben Beaumont-Thomas'];['Music', 'Britney Spears', 'Pop and rock', 'Culture', 'US news', 'World news'];"A lawyer acting for Britney Spears has threatened legal action against her sister Jamie Lynn, and accused their father of financial misconduct, including the hiring of a private security firm to keep Britney and people close to her under surveillance. A letter written by Britney’s lawyer Mathew Rosengart instructs Jamie Lynn to “cease and desist from referencing Britney derogatorily during your promotional campaign” for her new memoir. “If you fail to do so or defame her, Britney will be forced to consider and take all appropriate legal action.” The letter states that Jamie Lynn’s memoir contains “misleading or outrageous claims”, and that Britney believed Jamie Lynn had “exploited her for monetary gain”. Britney made the latter allegation previously in a recent Instagram post, saying: “She wants to sell a book at my expense.” Jamie Lynn responded to that earlier statement, claiming: “My book is not about her. I can’t help that I was born a Spears too, and that some of my experiences involve my sister.” She has not responded to the letter, which continues: “Publicly airing false or fantastical grievances is wrong, especially when designed to sell books. It is also potentially unlawful and defamatory.” The letter continues the spat between the sisters, which began after Jamie Lynn was interviewed on Good Morning America and said Britney’s behaviour had historically been “erratic, paranoid and spiralling”.
In the book, Jamie Lynn describes an alleged incident at home with Britney during her childhood: “Britney said to me, ‘Baby I’m scared.’ And she took a large knife from the kitchen, pulled me along to my room and locked us both inside. She put the knife in the bedside table drawer and simply repeated, ‘I’m scared.’ ” Regarding this passage, Britney wrote on Twitter: “Jamie Lynn … you’ve stooped to a whole new level of low. I’ve never been around you ever with a knife.” Jamie Lynn discussed the incident further in a podcast interview, saying: “I never felt like she was going to harm me or anything – it just felt weird.” A later Twitter post saw Britney soften her stance, telling Jamie Lynn “just know I love you”, but also accused her of a lack of loyalty and help during the conservatorship that controlled many aspects of Britney’s life, which was terminated in November. Britney has also newly accused Spears’s father Jamie of financial impropriety during his management of the conservatorship. Jamie Spears has attempted to have legal bills generated by the conservatorship hearings paid by Britney. In response, Rosengart made a court filing that states: “The allegations of misconduct against him are specific, credible and serious, ranging from abuse to conflicts of interest, financial mismanagement and corruption of the conservatorship to implicating state and federal criminal law.” The alleged incidents cited in the filing, reported by the New York Times, include the hiring of security firm Black Box for a total of $6m to monitor Britney’s phone and her mother’s, download notes from her therapy sessions despite being forbidden from seeing them, and track the movements of people associated with her via GPS. Elsewhere in the court filing, Jamie Spears is also accused of selling Britney’s childhood home to himself, of charging high expenses for the maintenance of her property – including sending funds to a company owned by Jamie Lynn’s husband – and of approving unusually large legal fees involving dozens of law firms. The allegations made in the court documents reflect findings by an investigator used by Britney’s legal team to examine Jamie Spears’s management of her affairs. Her investigation included an interview with a former Black Box employee. Jamie Spears has not responded to the allegations. The Guardian has contacted his lawyer for comment. In a previous response to allegations of surveillance, his lawyer told the New York Times: “All of his actions were well within the parameters of the authority conferred upon him by the court. His actions were done with the knowledge and consent of Britney, her court-appointed attorney, and/or the court.” Jamie Spears’s request regarding legal fees is expected to be addressed in a court hearing on Wednesday in Los Angeles.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/19/britney-spears-accuses-father-of-financial-misconduct-threatens-sister-with-legal-action;entertainment and culture

English National Ballet director Tamara Rojo has excellent reasons for a new take on Marius Petipa’s 19th-century Raymonda, an orientalist crusader story of a virtuous maid, noble knight and evil Saracen. She shifts the action to the Crimean war, where a young Englishwoman has followed her soldier fiance, and discovers a sense of vocation in nursing. It sounds like a canny move, setting the scene for a Victorian costume drama about a woman’s choices, inspired by the spirit of national treasure Florence Nightingale – perfect BBC primetime material. Of course, score, sets, style, roles and steps had to be reworked to fit the rethink, but never mind purism: does it work? In parts, but not as a whole. The highlight is Raymonda’s dream scene. It harnesses the essence of balletic magic – a stage flooded with moonlight and dancers in gauzy white – but peoples this traditionally female realm with both men and women, their ordered ranks, crossing runs and sighing spirals engendering an almost spiritual sense of the tender with the wounded. You believe that in nursing, Raymonda really has seen a higher purpose.
But nursing, and indeed the war itself, are marginal to the ballet – sometimes literally, as when bouncy soldiers and smiley wenches hog the stage while casualties and carers remain discreetly on the sidelines. True, the figure of Sister Clemence (Precious Adams) is an intermittent call to conscience, but Raymonda (Shiori Kase) is more exercised by another dilemma: should she choose good English soldier John de Bryan (Isaac Hernández) – husband material, basically – or flashy Turkish ambassador Abdur Rahman (Jeffrey Cirio)? Rojo introduces some effective ambivalence to these interactions, Kase and Hernández in particular often starting their duets physically at odds with each other. But a lot of choreographic action is hard-coded into the score and steps, and sprightly folk dancers in their finest keep bounding in from all over to jolly things along, regardless. A bold concept, lavishly produced with great music and great dancing, but it’s not so great drama when the heroine finally chooses her vocation, and it feels like the most interesting part of her story is about to begin. Raymonda is at the London Coliseum until 23 January";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/19/english-national-ballet-raymonda-review-a-bold-lavish-refit-of-the-petipa-classic;entertainment and culture
2655;2655;2655;2655;2683;2683;The Social Lives of Animals by Ashley Ward review – be more bat;2022-01-19;['Katy Guest'];['Science and nature books', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Vampire bats “have each other’s backs”, according to one of the extraordinary stories in this fascinating book. Should one bat be hungry, a roost mate will regurgitate a nutritious meal of semi-digested blood to help it live to bite another day. In a similar display of apparent altruism, a bee with a parasite will isolate itself rather than infect the rest of the colony – a Captain Oates-like sacrifice on the bee’s part. And, say what you like about rats; in experiments they will open a door to let a cold, wet stranger into their cosy nests. “We can trace direct and important parallels between our own societies and those of the animals with whom we share the planet,” writes Ashley Ward, a professor in animal behaviour. “By understanding animals on their own terms, we can understand ourselves so much the better.” Actually, he draws very few explicit connections between animal behaviour and our own, and is cautious about ascribing emotions or motivations to the creatures he studies – even in tear-jerking anecdotes about how elephants and wolves appear to mourn. But it’s hard not to take from some of his stories the idea that humans could learn a lot from social animals, for all our massive brains and our ability to pass knowledge down generations. “Our instinct for co-operation has provided the foundation for human civilisation,” he points out. We need that now more than ever. Ward describes this book as his attempt “to distil the wonder that I still feel in the company of animals”, and it certainly does that. He seems intent on arousing sympathy for the creepiest of creatures, and while that means that you’ll read some chapters through your fingers as he describes the causes of homicidal locust swarms or the scent of “hyena butter”, any writer who can evoke the existential sadness of a lonely cockroach, or make krill thrilling, or describe a snorkelling colleague being engulfed in a “gargantuan cetacean bum detonation” is a real gift to science communication. Means of cooperation vary widely across species, and many of them have already helped humans to live better. Fish shoals and starling murmurations, for instance, inspired systems to prevent driverless cars from crashing. Swarm intelligence, or “the wisdom of the crowd”, explains the effectiveness of search engines such as Google. On the other hand, it is the natural tendency of fish to shoal that has enabled people, with our huge trawlers and vast nets, to push some species to the brink. If humans had more of a shoal mentality, would we be better able to think about what’s best for the future of the entire group? Some thought-provoking chapters about baboons, bonobos and chimpanzees show how humans could learn from our closest relatives, too. At their best, complex societies are often founded on networking rather than domination by strength, Ward suggests. The alpha male “must be a relationship-builder, rather than a despot”; those who cheat are often punished; and “the perception of fairness may be an essential part of the glue that binds them”. Ward also explains how bonobos greet foreign troupes with a feast in a fruit tree and an afternoon of promiscuous and pansexual genital rubbing, so it is important not to extrapolate too directly from animals to ourselves, after all. Perhaps humans could start by just trying to be a bit more bat. • The Social Lives of Animals: How Co-Operation Conquered the Natural World is published by Profile (£20).

2667;2667;2667;2667;2695;2695;Digital fans represent football’s future so should clubs start listening? | Paul MacInnes;2022-01-19;['Paul MacInnes'];['Football', 'Sport'];"In 2020 the European Club Association conducted research into what it called the “Future Fan”. A survey across seven countries asked 14,000 people about their interest in football and how they interacted with the game. The survey recorded that among all fans only 40% regularly watched professional football in a stadium. Meanwhile 51% said they played Fifa at least once a month. This research caused a degree of consternation in the ECA, especially with its then president, Andrea Agnelli, who believed that “many traditional assumptions about fans need to change” and that the game may need to adapt to meet them. Within months, however, Agnelli’s thoughts had been rendered moot because he had been forced out of the ECA for embracing that most radical of changes: the European Super League.
For many, concern over the “future fan” was simply a cover for some of the biggest clubs wanting to abandon traditional structures in search of more money. But the ECA’s research was not inaccurate and the questions raised were legitimate. As football has grown into a global form of entertainment so those who call themselves fans have changed too. The majority no longer watch football live in person but digitally through a screen. Has the sport come to terms with that shift? Certainly clubs know more about their digital fanbase than they ever did about those clicking through the turnstiles. “The most sophisticated clubs have data coming from a lot of sources; I’d say more than a dozen,” says Roger A Breum, the head of marketing for Hookit, which specialises in tracking the digital footprint of sports teams and their sponsors. “Each of the social platforms they’re on gives them individualised data, then you probably have a social listening tool that’s bringing you broad data on hashtags that your club cares about. You have a sponsorship tool like ours and you might have tracking tools too. There’s a whole suite of sports tech software a club could use.” These tools mean that clubs know what messages and initiatives their fans are receptive to, what they are not and, in some cases, how strongly those opinions are held. “Sentiment analysis”, says Breum, is gleaned most cleanly from the comments under Instagram posts and from tweets. That’s where “the diehard fans are telling you how they feel,” he says. This information is well understood by the clubs, whether it be through their own insight teams or reports commissioned from consultants. They use it to tailor the kind of content they put on Instagram, or how they might help their sponsors run more effective ad campaigns. But that’s where it largely stops: the information is there to help the club run as a business, and it stays on the business side. “Historically there has been a gap between the commercial operations of the club and the sporting operations,” says Ben Marlow, of the consultancy 21st Group, which has worked with the Premier League and Tottenham among others. “I would still believe that to be the case. There’s an element of church and state.” Marlow’s opinion is shared by others who work with and inside Premier League clubs. He also observes that building a club’s strategy around fan sentiment would not be a great idea, but says that a “marriage between sporting performance and commercial performance” is important and that “the two drive each other”. Although sporting performance can be determined by league position, traditionally it involved making the fans happy too. Fans inside the ground, or “legacy fans” as they became known in ESL jargon, are less often the subject of customer research, their views on their club infrequently sought. But they do have the ability to make their opinions known directly to the footballing department, with the strength of their sentiment measured in decibels. There the link between results and enthusiasm is not always straightforward. At Selhurst Park Crystal Palace fans grew frustrated with Roy Hodgson despite mid-table security, while at Old Trafford Manchester United fans stuck with Ole Gunnar Solskjær to the end despite apparent underachievement.
Digital fans do not have the same mechanism for making their feelings known. Yet no one would argue that they are short on opinions. This is particularly true on Twitter, perhaps the place where fandom is most alive outside matches and a place in a constant state of fulmination. As one Premier League executive puts it: “You can feel sometimes that the mood online is very different to the mood in the stadium.” Last year the journalist Dean Van Nguyen wrote a taxonomy of one “extremely online” section of Liverpool’s fanbase, a type he called the “Twitter fan”. They were largely young, he wrote, obsessed with transfers, highly combative and persistently pessimistic. “Not getting what you want from football all of the time seems completely intolerable to them,” Van Nguyen wrote. He argued that similar groups existed in most clubs’ fanbases, something borne out by even the most cursory glance at a Premier League club’s hashtag. The Twitter fan does not represent every “future fan”, but it would seem hard to argue they are not precisely the demographic that clubs want to reach and with the levels of “engagement” that would put them in the highest category of digital supporter. Their support is vocal and dedicated but much of it is critical, with that criticism left unacknowledged by clubs. Some of the criticism undoubtedly filters through, to players with an active social media presence and to other parts of the football department, including one former Premier League manager who in the latter days of his last job would obsessively check online comments the moment he stepped into the dressing room after a match. Other managers might choose to ignore the noise but have comments shared with them by friends and family, or their agent, anyway. More likely, however, the frustrations expressed on social media end up in the ear not of the club but other supporters. Van Nguyen writes that Liverpool’s “Twitter fans” often end up turning on match-going fans and have developed a name for them: “Top Reds”. That term is used in similar online disputes between Manchester United supporters.
“You will be seen as elitist if you go to the games,” says one fan of a top-six club who travels home and away and also has a substantial social media following. “They do see us as the elite. If I speak out on issues that matter to match-going fans, be that ticket allocations, prices, games being picked for TV, the new fans do not give a shit. They do not care about these kind of issues. A lot of match-going fans don’t consider what they call ‘e-fans’ proper fans either. They think that if you don’t go, you don’t know.” It seems inevitable that the importance of the digital fan to football, especially at the top level, will only continue to grow. But while the commercial opportunities offered by a new audience have clearly been identified, it appears the other direction in the relationship, the one that involves listening, has not. Match-going fans might argue it has been ever thus. Perhaps in that respect supporters old and new may share some common ground.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/digital-fans-represent-footballs-future-so-should-clubs-start-listening;sports
2670;2670;2670;2670;2698;2698;‘It’s a war zone’: healthcare workers show signs of stress similar to combat veterans;2022-01-19;['N/A'];['Coronavirus', 'Health professions', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Healthcare industry', 'US news'];"Almost two years after working in a temporary Covid intensive care unit at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Kim Bishop, a critical care nurse, can still remember which patients were in which rooms. “When you walk back on these units, you know which patient survived in which room and which ones didn’t,” said Bishop, who still works at the Philadelphia hospital and moves among different units. “I thought we closed that chapter once we closed that unit, but now walking back into it, it’s almost like a slap in the face.” Bishop’s feelings are not unique among providers who treat Covid patients in the US. Many are leaving the field. Recent research indicates that healthcare workers and first responders are displaying post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms like veterans who served in combat.
Healthcare providers and researchers now say that if hospitals continue to be overwhelmed with patients who have not been vaccinated against the virus and administrators don’t find a way to provide relief to medical staff, many will leave areas where they care for Covid patients – or exit healthcare altogether. That would worsen staffing shortages and further strain hospitals’ capacity to provide necessary care. “It’s important to take care of and think of healthcare workers because they matter as people, and also it has really significant implications for our healthcare system,” said Dr Rebecca Hendrickson, a VA Puget Sound Health Care System clinical psychiatrist and lead researcher of a new study on healthcare workers. “You actually can’t protect your healthcare system without protecting the workers.” The Journal of General Internal Medicine study published in December surveyed more than 500 doctors, nurses and first responders and found that 15% said it was “not at all likely” they would still work in the field in five to 10 years. Among nurses, the figure was 20%. That’s largely because of the deterioration of healthcare providers’ mental health. Seventy-four per cent of respondents reported symptoms of depression; 37% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; and 15% reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm.
A significant contributor to their recent distress, Hendrickson said, was the duration of the pandemic. Earlier in the pandemic, workers knew they were facing a real risk of becoming ill but understood there was no other option to provide care to patients. Vaccines were not yet available, and there was a limited quantity of personal protective equipment. Now, more than two-thirds of hospital workers are vaccinated, according to a September report in the American Journal of Infection Control, but they treat Covid patients who in most cases are severely ill because they have not been vaccinated. Hospitals also still sometimes ask nurses to use less personal protective equipment than they feel they need because of the cost or patients’ complaints, respondents said. “Even when objectively the risk level may be lower” because they are vaccinated and the Omicron variant is less severe than earlier variants, “when they were asked to take risk that no longer felt necessary, that was actually harder to handle and caused more distress”, Hendrickson said. Every day that Kadee Klafka works as a cardiac intensive care nurse at Ball Memorial hospital in Muncie, Indiana, she speaks with the families of Covid patients on ventilators, almost all of whom have not been vaccinated, she said. She often must inform them that their loved ones’ lungs won’t recover. “We have done every single thing we can,” she tells them. “Right now, they are just suffering, and the best thing we can do for them is make them comfortable.” Klafka wishes she could wear a GoPro camera to illuminate nurses and patients’ experience.
“I have had to learn to cope with the anger that continues to rise and fall based on people who will not get vaccinated,” she said. Patients are often angry too because of how long they wait in the emergency room before they can get a bed, Bishop, the Philadelphia nurse, said. In 2021, 71% of medical practices saw an increase in the number of incidents with disruptive patients, according to a January poll from the Medical Group Management Association, which represents large physician groups. Bishop is also drained by two years of worrying about infecting her family, she said. She said the Omicron surge is even harder to manage than previous waves. “I felt like there was a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with the vaccine. I felt like we were getting back to normal, being able to go out and celebrate holidays and other life events with family,” said Bishop, who became a nurse because of her interest in the human body. “The staff is already mentally and physically exhausted, and this is pushing all of us to our breaking point.” Since February 2020, 30% of US healthcare workers have lost their job or quit, and the most common reason was the pandemic, according to an October survey by Morning Consult. Carol Wilcox worked as a discharge planner on a Covid floor at Saint Anne’s hospital in Fall River, Massachusetts, but retired 17 December, after four decades as a nurse.
At the start of the pandemic, Wilcox, 65, woke up each day sick to her stomach and petrified. She and other staff weren’t allowed to wear masks because, like at other hospitals, supplies were limited and administrators “were afraid we would make people nervous”, she said. Before she retired, she felt worn out “just going in to see a patient and putting on the protective gear”, she said. In one case a couple months ago, Wilcox saw a woman who weeks earlier lost her husband to Covid and now had to decide whether she wanted to be on a ventilator. She said no and died. Neither were vaccinated. “We are giving people the best we can,” said Wilcox, who hopes to work part-time from home in case management. “I don’t know how long people can sustain. There is an underlying frustration with people who aren’t getting vaccinated because it’s just so sad.” But there are, perhaps, encouraging developments. Nurses can now make significantly more money than before the pandemic, particularly if they sign up to become travel nurses, due to increased demand. Enrollment in undergraduate nursing programs increased by 5.6% and by 4.1% in master’s programs in 2020, according to an American Association of Colleges of Nursing survey.
At Sister Claire Tynan school of nursing at Holy Name in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 171 people applied to attend the school in 2019; in 2020, there were 325 applicants, and in 2021, there were 292, according to the school. “I think people are realizing that they can contribute to the positive effects in a hospital, that they have something to offer and that they will always have a career,” said Michele Acito, Holy Name chief nursing officer. Chloe Sneyer, 26, started her career in Holy Name surgery and cardiac units and then became an intensive care unit nurse during the pandemic. She now has more confidence in her skills, she said. “It made me realize I can learn something new every day that I go to work, and I can figure it out,” Sneyer added. Early in the pandemic, the hospital also tried to help nurses like Sneyer by having a psychologist host “resiliency rounds” over Zoom where staff could talk about a work experience; becoming sick with Covid; or the loss of a family member, among other topics, said Acito. In one recent case, an unvaccinated young man with Covid died after being on a ventilator. He had been in the hospital for weeks and become close with some staff, Acito said. “Two of our newer staff were very upset, so we made sure they had time to sit, to talk to other staff members,” recalled Acito. “They went outside; they took a little break … and then other staff members called them that night, so it’s that kind of support that has really strengthened that bond.” In addition to providing counseling, Hendrickson also said it’s important that hospitals seek input from healthcare workers on how to manage the risks they are facing, such as what personal protective equipment staff should wear or how food should be handled in inpatient units. “The more that can be actively listened to and reflected in policy decisions in a transparent way, those details make a huge difference for how it feels on the frontlines,” said Hendrickson. But much of healthcare workers’ wellbeing depends on the virus, which remains unpredictable. Wilcox said she fears for the healthcare system if the pandemic stretches on many more months or years. She told her former colleagues that she would return to visit. “But I don’t want to go back,” she said. “I really don’t. It is a war zone.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/healthcare-workers-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-pandemic-covid;health
2692;2692;2692;2692;2720;2720;Expanding national parks not enough to protect nature, say scientists;2022-01-19;['Patrick Greenfield'];['Biodiversity', 'Conservation', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Plastics', 'Oceans', 'Food', 'Fishing', 'Animals', 'World news', 'Cop15'];"Expanding national parks and protected areas will not be enough to halt the destruction of nature, warn leading scientists, who say urgent action on overconsumption, harmful subsidies and the climate crisis is also required to halt biodiversity loss. Governments are expected to commit to a Paris-style agreement for nature at Cop15 in Kunming, China, later this year, with targets that include protecting at least 30% of the oceans and land by 2030. An analysis of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreement by more than 50 leading scientists has found that, while expanding protected areas will, if done well, help slow the destruction of the natural world, much more is needed to stop it.
Prof Paul Leadley, an ecologist at Paris-Saclay University and co-author of the report, said: “The target of protecting 30% of all land and seas is important and attracting a lot of attention. And expanding protected areas is a good start if done well, but far short of what is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss – called ‘bending the curve’ for biodiversity. “There is very good evidence that we will fail again to meet ambitious international biodiversity objectives if there’s too much focus on protected areas at the expense of other urgent actions addressing the threats to biodiversity.” A “massive” reduction in harmful agricultural and fishing subsidies, holding global heating to 1.5C and tackling human overconsumption, including of meat, is necessary, the scientists said, as part of coordinated action across a diverse, interconnected set of “transformative” changes. The 21 draft targets to be negotiated at Kunming include proposals to eliminate plastic pollution, reduce pesticide use by two-thirds and half the rate of invasive species introduction. The agreement aims to stop what some scientists have called the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, driven by human behaviour, which threatens ecosystems vital to human civilisation. The analysis of the proposed agreement, conducted by the scientific bodies BioDiscovery and the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (Geo Bon), has been sent to governments, who will give their feedback later this month. The assessment looked at the impact of three scenarios on halting and reversing biodiversity loss: business as usual, improved quality and quantity of conservation, and transformative change of society. It found that only the last scenario will have the desired effect, assuming global heating is limited to 1.5C.
“What we’re doing is trying to take the best science and explain why the global biodiversity framework looks like it does. A lot of countries are saying it’s so complicated. We’re trying to explain why you need all the pieces and how each piece fits together,” Leadley said. The analysis comes after confusion over the breath and complexity of the draft agreement, which ranges from pollution to the inclusion of indigenous communities. In March, governments are scheduled to hold in-person negotiations for the first time since February 2020, after several delays to the process. Governments have failed to meet a single target on halting the destruction of nature in the past decade. María Cecilia Londoño Murcia, a researcher at the Humboldt Institute in Colombia and co-author of the analysis, said: “The sooner we act, the better. Time lags between action and positive outcomes for biodiversity can take decades, so we must act immediately and sustain our efforts if we are to reach the global goals by 2050.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/19/expanding-national-parks-not-enough-to-protect-nature-say-scientists-aoe;environment
2702;2702;2702;2702;2730;2730;Italian police arrest alleged Black Axe Nigerian mafia members over trafficking;2022-01-19;['Lorenzo Tondo'];['Global development', 'Sex trafficking', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Nigeria', 'Africa', 'Human trafficking', 'Law', 'Society'];"Four alleged members of the Nigerian mafia have been arrested in southern Italy after a young sex trafficking survivor spoke out against them. The men, who were arrested in Palermo and Taranto in the early hours of Tuesday, allegedly belong to the feared Black Axe, a cult-like criminal gang that emerged in the 1970s at the University of Benin, according to police. Investigators in Palermo who led the operation said the woman, who is also Nigerian, was forced into prostitution after taking part in an occult ritual bound up with traditional spiritual beliefs, known as juju, which bond victims to their traffickers and to any debts they will incur. “The suspects were charged with slavery, human trafficking, kidnapping and pandering [recruiting prostitutes],” the police said. The woman, whom investigators said was convinced by a Pentecostal cleric to report her captors to police, had been imprisoned, raped, blackmailed and forced into prostitution to pay a debt of about €15,000 (£12,500). Before she left Nigeria, like many other victims of sex trafficking, the woman had been made to undergo a traditional oath-taking ceremony involving complicated and frightening rituals often using the women’s blood, hair and clothing. Those carrying out the ritual, which has been found to have a profound psychological impact on victims, make it clear that failure to pay off those debts will result in terrible things happening to the woman and her family.
The abuse of religious and cultural belief systems in Nigeria has proved a deadly and highly effective control mechanism for traffickers recruiting women destined for the sex trade in Europe. A hugely profitable and well-organised criminal industry has been operating between Italy and Nigeria for more than two decades but the UN’s International Organization for Migration says it has seen a rise in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving in Italy by sea in the past few years, lured by the promise of work in the country. According to a Save the Children report last year Italy had 2,040 victims of sex trafficking – 716 of whom were registered in 2020 – with the majority of them Nigerian. Father Enzo Volpe, a priest in Palermo who has been helping Nigerian women for nine years, told the Guardian: “These women are terrified of the threats and the violence perpetrated by their captors. They fear not only for their lives but also for those of their families back in Nigeria.” “The problem,” said Volpe, “is that behind the slavery of these women there is a real mafia with members operating across the continent, who have total control over their victims.” Last year, Italian police arrested 30 people suspected of belonging to the Nigerian Black Axe mafia, which has been operating in many regions of the country, among them its suspected 35-year-old leader in Italy. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Four sources confirmed the news to Axios, which was the first to report it on Tuesday. In December, the company ended its show on the platform, which was being overseen by its editor-in-chief, Scott Norvell, a Fox News veteran. Al Jazeera launched Rightly last year to “provide fresh voices that are too often left out of the mainstream media a space to engage and debate the issues that matter most to them”, according to a statement released at the time. The surprise decision to launch such a project was met with objections from numerous Al Jazeera staff members, with many saying that its launch would “irreparably tarnish the network’s brand and work”.
In an open letter to Al Jazeera management, staff members, including executive producers, presenters and correspondents wrote: “Media in the US is already polarised and the introduction of Rightly is not a solution but rather a deepening of the problem. “Those of us who work in the United States already face tremendous challenges, and our jobs will only be made more difficult now that we will be associated with promoting a political ideology,” the letter added. “This isn’t about politics, left or right, or diversity of perspectives … This is about journalism and continuing the network’s moral mission of uplifting marginalized voices, communities and stories. Rightly is a betrayal of that mission.” Last fall, the Department of Justice ordered AJ+, a US-based digital news network owned by Al Jazeera, to register as a foreign agent. In a letter sent to Al Jazeera, the DOJ said that the network, which produces short videos for social media, engaged in “political activities” on behalf of the Qatari government and thus needed to be subject to the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Al Jazeera said AJ+ was independent and should not need to register. Axios reported that Rightly staff members who worked on the show were given little warning that it would wind down. One staff member who worked on the show said it was explained as “a budgetary decision”. Brad Polumbo, a policy correspondent at the Foundation for Economic Education, who worked on Rightly, confirmed to Axios that it had closed. “I had a great experience there,” he said, adding: “It’s disappointing that it was cut short but we’ll still have that work we did as part of our portfolio and to be proud of going forward.” Michael Weaver, Al Jazeera’s senior vice-president of business and development and growth, said that the company was still evaluating the Rightly brand. “We’re constantly evaluating everything we put on the air,” he said, without specifying what products might be produced in the future from the brand.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/al-jazeera-rightly-conservative-media;politics
2731;2731;2731;2731;2760;2760;US and Russia to hold talks on Ukraine in potential sign ‘diplomacy is not dead’;2022-01-19;['Julian Borger', 'Patrick Wintour'];['Nato', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news'];The US and Russian foreign ministers will hold talks in Geneva on Friday in a development that a US official said suggested that “perhaps diplomacy is not dead” in the efforts to fend off a new Russian attack on Ukraine. With the White House warning that such an attack could come “at any time”, the US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, will fly to Kyiv on Wednesday and Berlin on Thursday to consult with the Ukrainian government and European allies before the meeting the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. It comes as Nato also offered Russia a fresh round of talks. “The fact that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov agreed to meet on Friday in Geneva suggests that perhaps diplomacy is not dead,” a senior state department official said. “We will certainly know a lot more after that engagement on Friday.” At the end of last week, after three sets of discussions in Europe that produced no progress, a senior Russian official suggested that diplomacy could be at a dead-end. Since then tensions have continued to rise, with movements of Russian troops and heavy weapons westwards from the far east, and into Belarus. “We’re now at a stage where Russia at any time could launch an attack on Ukraine,” said the White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki. Nato was not notified of the Russian military exercises in Belarus, a US official said, noting that the troops were in “numbers beyond what we’d expect in regard to a normal exercise”. “What it represents is an increased capability for Russia to launch this attack – increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased routes,” the official said, questioning how much control Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko – weakened by popular opposition to his rule – had over events. “The question is: Where do their authorities at this point end and where do the Kremlin’s begin? And that is very uncertain.” “Russian military plans to begin activities several weeks before a military invasion is something we’ve been watching closely and our assessment has been that could happen anytime between mid-January and mid-February,” a senior state department official said. On Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, echoed US claims that there was a “significant Russian presence of intelligence operatives inside Ukraine” and that it was “absolutely possible” they were planning “incidents, accidents, false flag operations”. Nato has invited Russia to a fresh series of talks to discuss European security and arms controls as the alliance scrambles to avoid a possible Russian attack on Ukraine. “The main task now is to prevent a military attack on Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said after a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “We are willing to listen to their concerns but we will not compromise on core principles. We must remain clear-eyed about the prospects of progress but … will make every effort to reach an agreement.” A senior European official confirmed that the coming month is seen as the most likely time for a Russian offensive, if Vladimir Putin takes the decision to attack. “We all have the same assessment because it’s thought that the ground will be too muddy after mid-February,” the official said. “For a highly capable army, winter is actually very helpful.” Blinken will meet Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other senior officials in Kyiv on Wednesday. In Berlin, the secretary of state will meet with members of the new German coalition government as well as representatives of the “trans-Atlantic quad”, which also includes the UK and France. Those talks will be focused on preparing for the Lavrov meeting and working on a concerted response to any Russian attack. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has not said definitely if the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would be suspended if Russia does attack, and there are reports that the threat of cutting Russia off from the Swift international payments system may have been quietly shelved. A senior European diplomat said that no final decisions had been made on Swift. “The aim being to really hinder and restrict Russia’s access to the global economy, so all those things – access to capital, access to banking – they remain on the table,” the diplomat said. “They have varying degrees of difficulty and vulnerability, so we need to do a proper assessment of what the Russians might do in response to each and any of those measures, and then work out which one is likely to be the most effective taken in the round.” In Kyiv, Blinken is due to talk to US embassy staff about their contingency plans in the event of a Russian attack. “We are conducting normal contingency planning, as we always do, in terms of our embassy and US citizens in Ukraine,” a state department official said. “That is normal any time we see a security situation severely deteriorating, as we are seeing in Ukraine.” The US senator Chris Murphy, who has been holding talks with Ukrainian leaders on a congressional delegation visit to Kyiv, said: “I think Ukraine is ready. Ukraine is battle tested. “This is a country that knows how to fight, but my worry is that Putin is living in some hermit hole, having been convinced by a small set of bleary-eyed advisers that he’ll be greeted as a liberator when he heads for the Dnieper.” The talks in Geneva follow inconclusive meetings last week between the US and Russia, as well as a rare meeting of the Nato-Russia Council, where Russia tabled uncompromising demands about the future security architecture of Europe, including legally binding guarantees that neither Ukraine nor Moldova will be allowed into Nato. Moscow wants a pullback of Nato troops from close to the Russian border and an end to some intermediate nuclear weapons in Europe. The fresh invitation to talks from Nato may be a last-ditch attempt to show Putin that dialogue will give him substantive progress on arms controls that he can sell to a domestic audience, and that by comparison a military intervention represents an incalculable political risk for him. But Nato and Russia appear far apart on the agenda for the talks. Standing alongside Stoltenberg, Scholz said: “We all want stable and constructive relations with Russia. We have no interest in permanent tensions.” He added there were difficult considerations about how to sequence the issues in any talks with Russia. He also came under pressure to say whether he regarded the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany as a purely commercial contract. He implied the project would stop if there was an invasion by saying he stood by an agreement Germany signed with the US last year. The Stoltenberg offer came as the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, met her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow. Baerbock said it was hard to see the buildup of Russian troops as anything but a threat to Ukraine and that her country was prepared to pay a high price to defend its values. Baerbock also called for an urgent return to dialogue on the future of Ukraine through the Normandy Format, the four-way dialogue between Germany, Russia, France and Ukraine. Lavrov said he would welcome US involvement in the Normandy Format, claiming it was impossible at present to persuade Ukraine to examine the necessary issues, including the legal status of the Donbass, the separatist region within Ukraine. Lavrov defended the right of Russia to move its troops within its borders and demanded the promised written answers from both Nato and the US to Russia’s call for a rewriting of European security architecture including legally binding guarantees that neither Ukraine or Moldova will be admitted to Nato.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/nato-invites-russia-for-fresh-talks-on-europe-amid-ukraine-crisis;politics
2744;2744;2744;2744;2774;2774;Tory MPs openly discuss Johnson challenge as mood ‘turns dramatically’;2022-01-18;['Rowena Mason', 'Jessica Elgot', 'Aubrey Allegretti'];['Boris Johnson', 'Coronavirus', 'Conservatives', 'Conservative leadership', 'UK news', 'Gray report'];"The mood of Conservative MPs was hardening against Boris Johnson on Tuesday night, with open talk of how to oust the prime minister and who should succeed him as he gave a disastrous interview claiming not to have lied over Downing Street parties. A string of Tory MPs from various ranks and wings of the party said they believed there would be enough letters to trigger a leadership contest after the publication of the Sue Gray report into allegations of lockdown breaches, with some reports on Tuesday night that it could come sooner. Johnson was trying to shore up his support in the parliamentary party after it emerged a group of a dozen or so of the 2019 intake had met in the office of Alicia Kearns to discuss his future as prime minister. After the meeting – dubbed the “pork pie putsch” as Kearns’ constituency contains Melton Mowbray – one MP said there were about 20 letters, “some sent, some in draft”. There needs to be 54 letters submitted to trigger a confidence ballot against the prime minister, who met some of the new cohort on Tuesday evening. With MPs plotting his demise, Johnson emerged from isolation in No 10 to defend himself against claims from Dominic Cummings, his former aide, that he lied to parliament about believing a garden party in the first lockdown was a work event. The prime minister said “no one warned” him that that the 20 May 2020 “bring your own booze” party he attended alongside 30-40 staff was against the rules, and confirmed he had given his account of events to Gray. “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” he told Sky News. But Cummings claimed two officials warned the prime minister against holding a party. It is understood the former aide will also be interviewed by the Gray inquiry, which is expected to report in the coming week. In his interview, Johnson refused several times to rule out resigning and some Tory MPs believe he could agree to step down rather than go through a confidence ballot of the parliamentary party.
Tory MPs said colleagues increasingly believed Johnson was more likely than not to face a confidence ballot, probably after the Gray report is published. A frontbencher said: “The mood has turned dramatically. He’s in real trouble. And it’s not just the 2019ers panicking about their seats. It’s quieter older colleagues. Unless the report says something staggeringly good, we will have a challenge.”
Another Tory MP said: “It’s terminal. It’s turned from red hot anger to [a] cold, calculating sense of ‘How do we do this? And who are we supporting?’ … It’s a question of when, not whether. “Letters are coming from the left and from the right, from Brexiters and remainers, because what is slowly dawning on people is that there’s not a policy issue; this is a mindset, a modus operandi and culture that needs changing.” Christian Wakeford, a 2019-intake MP, became the seventh Tory to reveal he had submitted a no confidence letter on Tuesday. While Tory MPs said other letters were being prepared and saved as draft emails, some rebels urged colleagues not to submit them to the 1922 Committee before Gray’s report because Johnson could win a vote held too early. One Tory MP insisted Johnson “will not win a vote of no confidence as there is no incentive to support him”. “With Theresa [May], she had those who were frightened of what could come next. He does not have that,” they said, adding: “It’s a disaster if it’s triggered before the report comes out, it will be held immediately and then people will not want to be judge before the evidence is finalised.” Tories said parliament was full of talk about potential leadership campaigns, including by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who is believed to have the sharpest operation, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who is in Australia. Other names being discussed included Sajid Javid, Nadhim Zahawi and Penny Mordaunt, while there are also possible candidates from the lockdown-sceptic right, such as Mark Harper, Steve Baker and Esther McVey. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and former rival to Johnson for the leadership, gave an interview to PoliticsHome saying his “ambition hasn’t completely vanished” although claiming “it would take a lot to persuade me to put my hat into the ring”. Sunak gave only qualified support for the prime minister, saying he believed his explanation of events. But asked if the prime minister should resign if he lied to parliament, Sunak said: “I am not going to get into hypotheticals, the ministerial code is clear on these matters.” He then walked out of the interview as he was being asked whether Johnson had his unequivocal support. The backlash against Johnson has been driven partly by the public anger that Tory MPs heard in their constituencies at the weekend. One said activists were refusing to deliver leaflets for the forthcoming local elections because they are so demotivated. Many MPs also hinted in letters to their constituents that the prime minister may not be able to survive his in job. Sir Charles Walker, former vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, wrote to a constituent saying: “The prime minister and the party are severely damaged in the eyes of the electorate. It remains to be seen if this situation is recoverable.” Johnson, who will face a difficult prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, will attempt to change the national conversation by announcing the end of Plan B Covid measures. However, Keir Starmer is expected to stick to Johnson’s predicament over gatherings in No 10 during lockdown. In an interview with the Guardian’s G2, Starmer picked holes in Johnson’s claims to have been unaware of the parties in No 10. “Johnson’s now on his third defence. His first defence when we tackled him on this at the beginning of December was: ‘I’ve been assured there were no parties,’ and his second defence when the video came out was: ‘I’m furious there have been these parties; I’ve only just found out.’ And if the third defence is true, then obviously the first two are false – and that’s a major problem for him.” MPs said they still do not believe Johnson has enough awareness of how much danger he is in. One said allies of the prime minister including Conor Burns and James Duddridge asked Johnson at the weekend if they could help with a whipping operation on his behalf, to try to shore up support with MPs. “He didn’t take it seriously until that moment,” one MP said. “There has been no charm offensive on his behalf. The whips have done nothing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/boris-johnson-challenge-leadership-tory-mps;politics
2746;2746;2746;2746;2776;2776;Cabinet expected to approve relaxation of plan B Covid restrictions in England;2022-01-18;['Peter Walker'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"Boris Johnson is expected to instruct millions to return to workplaces across England as he tries to placate furious MPs with a review of Covid restrictions that could end all rules introduced to combat Omicron. The cabinet will meet on Wednesday morning to examine Covid data and review plan B restrictions imposed in December amid the rapid spread of the variant, with Johnson set to update the Commons later in the day. While an official statement said decisions remained “finely balanced”, ministers are widely expected to approve the end of current advice for people to work from home where possible and the use of vaccine certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums. This would happen from 26 January, the pre-set review point for the plan B measures. It is also possible, if considered less likely, that the cabinet could drop the final plan B restriction which mandates masks on public transport and in shops. This move in particular would please many Conservative backbenchers, especially those in the influential Covid Recovery Group.
In defending Johnson from calls to quit over claims he knowingly took part in lockdown-breaching parties, supporters have repeatedly talked up his decision to avoid stricter restrictions as Omicron spread, saying hospitalisation figures have since proved him right. But while total confirmed cases have started to drop slightly in recent days, albeit remaining near 100,000 a day nationally, the wave of infections has hit regions at different times, with the north of England nearer the peak than places such as London. The director of public health for one city in the north of England said they would be extremely wary at the idea of plan B restrictions being removed so soon. “It does feel too early, certainly in the north,” they said. “We’re still seeing real pressure in hospitals, and people being off work. The idea of dropping everything next week just doesn’t seem sensible. If we tell people they can all go back to the office, we’ll just get even more people off sick. “I personally thought we shouldn’t have lost masks when we did last year – it was too soon. Every time you take something away and try to reintroduce it, public support is lost. I just wish there was a bit more time, so we can feel slightly more comfortable. It’s not just Covid, but all the pressures on the NHS.” Another worry, they said, was the possibility of a wave of new infections affecting vulnerable people who had received a Covid booster some time ago, with the protection beginning to wane. While ministers have talked up the idea of an end of restrictions meaning Covid is moving from pandemic to endemic status, like seasonal flu, the public health director said this was premature. “We’re just not there yet,” they said. “You don’t see cases rising in the way we have in the last few weeks if something is endemic. It’s got to be a much more stable position.” More widely, ministers are looking at phasing out all remaining Covid rules in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test, backed up by fines. This and other provisions, such as the requirement to give details to NHS Test and trace, are due to expire in March and could be allowed to lapse.
A No 10 statement setting out the plan for Wednesday’s decision noted that case numbers are still high, with 17,000 Covid patients in hospital in England. A government spokesperson said: “Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced. Plan B was implemented in December to slow the rapid spread of the extremely transmissible Omicron variant, and get more jabs in arms. “The Omicron variant continues to pose a significant threat and the pandemic is not over.

An investigation launched last year by the regulator, Ofwat, and the Environment Agency, is a chance to put things right. But there are worrying signs that this opportunity to shine a light is in danger of being missed. The refusal by the Environment Agency to reveal which 2,000 sewage treatment works in England are being looked at, and whether this will lead to delays in dealing with new complaints, raises questions about its commitment to openness. That the investigation is happening at all is due to huge efforts by campaigners. Concern over sewage dumps has been rising in response to water companies’ failure to tackle a longstanding problem that increased extreme weather, due to climate change, is expected to make worse. Discharges of untreated waste into the sea or rivers are supposed to happen only in exceptional circumstances, to reduce flood risk. Over recent years, it has become clear that rules are being routinely flouted by an industry that puts profits before environmental stewardship. At the same time, the Environment Agency’s record for punishing breaches has sharply declined following budget cuts. A report from a committee of MPs last week drew attention to the poor condition of rivers and called for a step change. Last summer, Southern Water was fined a record £90m for pouring between 16bn and 21bn litres of raw sewage into protected coastal waters for financial gain. It was the worst environmental crime in the Environment Agency’s 25-year history. Yet the House of Commons last year stopped short of imposing a legal duty on water companies to stop releasing raw sewage, after ministers rejected a Lords amendment. The nine privatised water companies, which are regional monopolies, are instead obliged to make only “progressive reductions” in the amount they pollute. Now the approach of the Environment Agency to requests for information from the campaign group Fish Legal suggests an unwillingness to hold the industry publicly to account. Not every company has the same repulsive track record as Southern Water. But the problem is systemic and cannot be blamed on one weak or unscrupulous board of directors. Over 11 years, £16.9bn has been awarded to water company shareholders in dividends, while debt has rocketed to £48bn. Bosses are rewarded for failure: Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, was awarded £1.9m in bonuses in 2020, a year when the company poured untreated waste into waterways on nearly 61,000 occasions. It doesn’t have to be like this. Scottish Water is publicly owned, charges less, and since 2002 has invested nearly 35% more, per household, than privatised English water companies in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed to limit pollution. Welsh Water is also non-profit. The English industry’s dismal track record makes renationalisation the obvious answer. In the short term, the bodies with responsibility for regulating water must toughen up. A five-year plan from Ofwat, expected soon, must put much stronger emphasis on environmental protection. And when the public seek information about which water companies are failing, they must be given it.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/18/the-guardian-view-on-water-pollution-come-clean-on-sewage;environment
2791;2791;2791;2791;2822;2822;Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s glee at general’s Covid diagnosis sparks outrage;2022-01-18;['Martin Pengelly'];['Fox News', 'Coronavirus', 'US news'];"The rightwing Fox News host Laura Ingraham has stoked outrage by announcing that the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff had tested positive for Covid-19 – and applauding as she did so.
One critic called the host a “merchant of death”. Another said he was “not sure when hate became a Christian value”. Gen Mark Milley became a target of rightwing anger after extensive reporting showed how he worked to contain Donald Trump at the end of his time in power, keeping US armed forces out of domestic affairs. Milley has also defended the teaching in military institutions of critical race theory, an academic discipline which conservatives have turned into a profitable election issue. On Monday, Ingraham introduced a section of her show called Positively Boosted, in which she gleefully recounts which vaccinated public figures have tested positive. Clapping and smiling, she said: “Triple-vaxxed joint chiefs chairman Mark Milley, our favorite Mark Milley, tested positive for Covid yesterday. “And who else? Gen David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, also positively boosted.” Earlier, a spokesman for Milley said the general was “experiencing very minor symptoms and can perform all of his duties from the remote location. He has received the Covid-19 vaccines including the booster”. A spokeswoman for Berger said: “The performance of his duties will remain unaffected.” More than 850,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, the vast majority unvaccinated. Federal authorities have repeatedly said that breakthrough infections are possible, particularly from the Omicron virus variant. Nonetheless, like other public health measures, the Biden administration’s armed forces vaccine mandate has become a target of conservative anger. On air on Monday, after a brief discussion of reports of a senior Vatican official also testing positive, Ingraham said: “We certainly hope they’re all healthy and fine. But stop pushing your mandates.” Amid widespread criticism, Kim Masters, an editor-at-large for the Hollywood Reporter, said Ingraham was “absolutely disgusting and so are [Fox Corporation chairman and chief executive] Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch for giving her a platform”. “These monsters are merchants of death,” Masters wrote. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America Magazine, said: “Laura Ingraham is often described as someone in favor of ‘Christian values’. “But the last time I checked, we’re supposed to love our enemies, not celebrate when they get sick. Jesus had compassion for the sick; he didn’t laugh at them. Not sure when hate become a Christian value.” Others pointed to Fox News’ own strict vaccination requirements for staff. Ingraham also made news on Tuesday with an interview with Northern Virginia magazine in which she said she was not yet ready to back Trump for president again. Asked about online criticism, she said she did not read it, adding: “I’m in a job where controversy is just part of the daily routine.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/18/fox-news-laura-ingraham-covid-mark-milley-outrage;politics
2792;2792;2792;2792;2823;2823;Welcome to the baffling world of local government | Letters;2022-01-18;['N/A'];['Local government', 'Politics'];"“Please, someone, explain,” pleads Adrian Chiles at the end of his article on how local democracy works (I believe in local democracy – I just don’t understand it, 13 January). On the basis of two years’ experience as a local parish councillor, I can tell him that in the case of parish councils, “it doesn’t”. In those two years, at the end of which I resigned in utter frustration, I learned that our parish council has virtually no powers or decision-making authority with respect to anything of significant importance. Almost all matters of significance are the responsibility, and within the jurisdiction, of someone else: planning and housing (borough council and central government); roads and road safety, including local speed limits (county council and central government); education/schools (education authority and central government); health and social care (health trust, county council and central government); crime, policing and public safety (police and crime commissioner, and the home secretary); bus service (county council, bus service providers and central government); flooding (county council). In its election manifesto in 2019, the Conservative party wrote: “Our new Towns Fund will help communities make sure their towns are safe to walk in and a pleasure to be in … Above all, we want the town’s future to be in the hands of the people who live there.” The reality, however, is that during its first two years in office, the central government has sought to increase its control over decision-making, at the expense of the authority of local government, in almost all of the areas of governance that I have listed above. Philip C Stenning Eccleshall, Staffordshire • Like Adrian Chiles, I too believe in local democracy, but find it baffling – and I have the advantage that for the past nine years I have either been the parish clerk or a parish councillor. The division of responsibility between town and parish councils, the local authority (usually a county council outside large cities) and central government is confusing and illogical, with too many decisions being made in London that would be far better made locally. In general, your local parish or town council usually has a good idea of who does what. So if you have a problem but are baffled by local democracy, I suggest you contact a local councillor, who should be able to point you in the right direction. Alan Jordan Vice-chair, Middridge parish council, County Durham • In the 1980s, and before the national curriculum, things were very different in some secondary schools. As parish, district, county, parliamentary and EU elections heaved into view, my social studies department concentrated on the structures, constituencies and policies according to the printed manifestos of the political parties. Students lapped it up, particularly the opportunity to write their own manifestos for a particular election. Many young people today are bamboozled by the structures or why it should matter to them. This suits the Tories perfectly. Having no political knowledge inclines young people not to vote. David Handley Gargrave, North Yorkshire • In my village here in France, it is the mayor you go to for all problems. So simple.

2807;2807;2807;2807;2838;2838;‘A ticking timebomb’: Australian doctors use social media to call for sugar tax on soft drinks;2022-01-18;['Sarah Martin'];['Health', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Sugar', 'Sugar', 'Food'];"A new campaign targeting the 2.4bn litres of sugary drinks consumed by Australians each year is being launched by the Australian Medical Association as it steps up its calls for a sugar tax. The “sickly sweet” social media campaign, launched on Wednesday, highlights the role sugary drinks play in Australia’s obesity epidemic, with the average 375ml can of soft drink containing between eight and 12 teaspoons of sugar. AMA modelling suggests a tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar – meaning a can of Coke would cost 16 cents more – would reduce sugar consumption via sweet drinks by 12-18%.
Frequent consumption of sugary drinks is linked to poor dental health and illnesses associated with obesity such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA says Australians drink the equivalent of 960 Olympic-sized swimming pools of sugary drinks each year. The association’s president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said what was once a special treat had become an everyday product fuelling addiction and major health problems. “It’s a staggering figure, and we think Aussies need to know what they are consuming and the impact it can have on their long-term health,” Khorshid said in a statement to mark the campaign launch. “Sugary drinks are a ticking timebomb for the nation’s health and we urge Australians to choose water whenever they can.” The AMA is pushing Australia to follow the UK’s lead and introduce a tax on the sugar in the drinks – but only those that have no nutritional benefit. This would be all non-alcoholic drinks containing free sugars – excluding 100% fruit juice, milk-based drinks and cordials. The AMA modelling on such a tax suggests that sugar consumption could be reduced by up to 43,804 tonnes a year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The tax excise is in line with World Health Organization recommendations for retail prices to increase 20% to have a meaningful health effect. Rosemary Stanton, a visiting fellow with the School of Medical Sciences at the University of NSW, said she had been calling for sugar taxes since the late 1960s, and while some progress had been made, it was slow in the face of resistance from the drinks industry and sugar farmers in Queensland. She said targeting sugary drinks made sense as they accounted for more than 50% of sugar consumed in Australia. “I don’t believe that people need to give up every grain of sugar, but 52% of the free sugars [consumed] come from beverages, so it is by far the biggest thing,” Stanton said. Jane Martin, the executive manager of the Obesity Policy Coalition, said that more than 50 other countries had introduced similar sugar taxes. She said not only were they working to reduce sugar consumption, but manufacturers were reformulating recipes to reduce the amount of sugar in products. In the UK, a tiered levy on sugar in soft drinks resulted in sugar levels in lemonades, colas and other soft drinks falling by 44%, with many companies taking out sugar to avoid the tax. Martin said sugary drinks, including slurpees that were targeted at kids, were cheap to make and had high-profit margins for manufacturers, but there was little awareness of the amount of sugar being consumed. “There’s so much pushback from the sugary drinks industry. They are making a huge profit out of this, and they don’t want that profit to be impacted, but it is profits over health right now,” she said. “Isn’t it time really that we put the health of Australians first and not the profits of sugary drink companies.”
The AMA says previous modelling estimated that such a targeted tax would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obesity by about 2%, leading to annual healthcare savings of between $600m and $1.73bn. It also estimated that the tax could, over a 25-year period, result in 16,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer cases of stroke. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has previously ruled out a sugar tax after the 2020 Australian of the Year, ophthalmologist James Mueke, made it a key focus of his time in the role. “We don’t think that driving up the price of household goods for families is the way of achieving this particular outcome,” Hunt said at the time. The Australian Beverages Council opposes a sugar tax, claiming there’s not enough evidence it would reduce obesity. “While sugar can play a part in poor diet, the causes of overweight, obesity and associated chronic disease are highly complex, and the key determinants include, but are not limited to, interactions between genetic, metabolic, cultural, environmental, socioeconomic and behavioural factors,” the council claims.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/a-ticking-timebomb-australian-doctors-use-social-media-to-call-for-sugar-tax-on-soft-drinks;health
2813;2813;2813;2813;2844;2844;If diplomacy fails with Russia, we all lose. Biden must not abandon talks | Chris S Chivvis;2022-01-18;['Christopher S Chivvis'];['US news', 'Joe Biden', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Ukraine', 'World news', 'Europe', 'US foreign policy'];"Biden came to office aiming to focus his foreign policy on the needs of the US middle class. Ending the pandemic, rejuvenating the nation, addressing climate change and competing with China were top priorities. Russia was not. After an initial series of measures designed to punish Vladimir Putin for his chemical-weapons attack on Alexei Navalny, cyber-espionage, and meddling in US domestic politics, policymakers opted to pursue stability and predictability in the US-Russia relationship.
The crisis over Ukraine now threatens to derail this aim and distract from Biden’s broader agenda. It would be tragic if, after having been through the painful process of withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration is now pulled deeper into the crisis over Ukraine. But the risks are growing by the day. Biden has so far taken a balanced approach that combines active diplomacy with a threat of sanctions and support to Ukraine if Russia invades. A formidable cast of hawkish critics – from DC thinktanks and Washington Post columnists to former members of the National Security Council and national intelligence directors – however, find this approach too soft and are charging the president with appeasement. They want the United States to get more involved, including militarily, in hope of deterring a Russian invasion. The very limited results of last week’s talks, combined with the cyber-attack on the Ukrainian government websites and news of possible Russian preparations for a false flag operation in Ukraine all intensify the pressure. Frustration and anger in the face of Putin’s frank disregard for human life is natural and healthy. A war in Ukraine would also erode international law and norms that favor the peaceful resolution of conflicts, with negative repercussions for the United States. But it’s wrong to make the Ukraine crisis into a totemic issue for the whole international order. With tensions already so high, accelerating the deployment of anti-aircraft, anti-armor, or other weapons to Ukraine has more of a chance of hastening Putin’s march toward war then slowing him down. For such deployments to be effective, they would probably need to be accompanied by US military advisers, greatly increasing the risk of direct US-Russia conflict. Ukraine deserves western support, but we shouldn’t forget that isn’t a Nato member. Instead of trying to deter Putin with military measures, the United States should make every effort to keep last week’s diplomacy going. The current negotiating agenda focuses on a follow-on to the moribund treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and resurrection of elements of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. While desirable, these alone are almost certainly not enough to keep Russia in the talks. In truth, it’s hard to say what will, but every diplomatic option needs to be on the table to forestall a Russian invasion. Russia’s insistence that Nato formally close its door to all future enlargement is unrealistic, but so are any hopes that Ukraine might someday join the alliance. Staunch resistance of several allies and Ukraine’s internal obstacles to meeting the requirements make this undeniable. Biden should be ready to signal to Putin that he is willing to explore creative solutions that would acknowledge these realities. It would be an extraordinary irony if Ukraine were to lose its independence as a state over the unfillable principle that it has the right to join an alliance that does not really want it. Any inkling of diplomatic accommodation of Russian demands of course risks bringing a firestorm of domestic and foreign criticism down on the president. High-level diplomacy with the Russian autocrat is especially hard given the way the Democrats attacked Trump for his embrace of Putin, a man Biden once called “a killer”. Then there is the risk that Putin rebuffs the offer publicly and invades anyway, leaving the Administration hanging in the wind and seemingly lending weight to the charges of appeasement. But if diplomacy fails, Russia will soon invade, and everyone will lose except perhaps Presidents Putin and Xi. Faced with an invasion, Biden would have no alternative but to act on his threats, sanctioning Russia, and providing assistance to Ukraine. Over time, Nato nations would be forced to spend more on defense, including for land-based military capabilities with little relevance to strategic competition with China. China and Russia would draw closer together, accelerating a troubling trend toward the hardening of geopolitical fault lines, circumstances that recall the run-up to the first world war, and which Biden has expressly said he wants to avoid. None of this would be helpful to Biden’s aim of serving the needs of the American middle class.

2823;2823;2823;2823;2854;2854;Brighton bee bricks initiative may do more harm than good, say scientists;2022-01-18;['Sarah Marsh'];['Bees', 'Brighton', 'Housing', 'Insects', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'UK news'];An initiative in Brighton aimed at helping protect the bee population could do more harm than good, scientists have warned. The council in Brighton has passed a planning condition that means any new building more than five metres high will have to include swift boxes and special bricks with holes known as bee bricks. They will provide nesting and hibernating space for solitary bees. However, scientists have warned that such a move will not make any real difference for biodiversity, with some arguing that it could make matters worse for bees if the holes are not cleaned properly and attract mites or encourage the spread of disease. The idea was first raised in 2019 by councillor Robert Nemeth, and the condition was attached to all planning permissions after 1 April 2020. Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, said he had tried a bee brick out and that the holes were not deep enough to be “ideal homes for bees” but “are probably better than nothing”. He added: “Bee bricks seem like a displacement activity to me. We are kidding ourselves if we think having one of these in every house is going to make any real difference for biodiversity. Far more substantial action is needed, and these bricks could easily be used as ‘greenwash’ by developers.” Sebastian Worms, a graduate student from the University of Louvain in Belgium, said that the bricks were more educational tools for children and could have a negative impact if they were too big and not cleaned enough. “To help bees it would be better to introduce more flowers,” he said. Adam Hart, an entomologist and professor of science communication at the university of Gloucestershire, said that sometimes “well-meaning interventions can have unwanted consequences”. “It would be good to have much more research on all of these ‘bee hotels’ so bees can get the maximum benefit from people’s desire to help them,” he said. Not everyone was in agreement that the bricks were a bad idea. Francis Gilbert, a professor of ecology at the University of Nottingham, said that bee bricks did not need to be cleaned. “The mites will leave after one to two seasons and then the bees will recolonise,” he said. “There will be beneficial microbes in the holes as well, so they should not be cleaned. So bee bricks are an unequivocal good thing.” Lars Chittka, a professor in sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University, said that bees “naturally possess hygienic behaviour that would allow them to mitigate the risks at least to some extent, or that they would assess the holes’ states before using them, which should to some extent counterbalance the risks that come with such long-term nesting opportunities.” He added: “It might well be that the Brighton project provides an opportunity to study the risks and benefits on a reasonably wide scale, and over an extended period – say five years. But I would certainly recommend not copying this project across the country before the long-term benefits and risks are explored.” Nemeth, who is also a beekeeper, said: “There’s a well-known saying in the beekeeping world that if you ask 100 different beekeepers a question then you get 101 different answers. “It’s going to take some years yet to establish the degree of effectiveness of bee bricks but it’s heartening to know that studies are under way. What is definite though is that carrying on with the status quo of ignoring nature in many new-build properties is a biodiversity disaster of the highest order.” Bees in Britain There are about 270 species of bee in Britain, just under 250 of which are solitary bees that live alone, although often nest close to one another. Solitary bees in Britain are highly diverse, and so are their nesting habits. Most British species nest in the ground, excavating their own nest. The honeybee is probably the best-known bee. They live socially and are led by a queen and serviced by male drones and female worker bees. The bee population is thought to have declined in the UK since the 1970s. For example, the number of managed honeybee hives in England dropped by 50% between 1985 and 2005, and 67% of common widespread moth species have declined since the 1970s. Since 1900, the UK has lost 13 species of bee, and a further 35 are considered under threat of extinction. The decline in population is thought to be because of changes in land use, which has led to habitat loss. Other issues affecting bees include disease, pesticides, pollution and climate change. One of the best ways of helping bees is thought to be by planting flowers rich in nectar.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/brighton-bee-bricks-initiative-may-do-more-harm-than-good-say-scientists;environment
2825;2825;2825;2825;2856;2856;Paco Gento, Real Madrid legend and six-time European Cup winner, dies aged 88;2022-01-18;['Sid Lowe'];['Real Madrid', 'La Liga', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"When Paco Gento arrived in 1953, he thought Real Madrid were too big for him but that was nowhere near as big as he would make them. He joined a club that had not won the league in two decades, since before the civil war; by the time he retired 18 years later, it was the biggest, most successful in the world and he had set a record still unmatched half a century later and likely never to be beaten. Nicknamed La Galerna, the Gale, after the wind that tore through the Cantabrian coast like he tore through defences, Gento died on Tuesday, aged 88. In a career spent almost entirely at Real Madrid he won 12 league titles and six European Cups. No footballer can match that; only two clubs have won more and one is the institution he helped transform, where he was the honorary president.
Gento might not even have been a Madrid player for long. At the end of his first season, the club’s president and patriarch Santiago Bernabéu was minded to transfer him to Osasuna. Raised in the village of Guarnizo, where his family tended to livestock and chicken and he played barefoot with “balls” made of paper or stuffed with feathers, where he listened to Atlético on the radio, Gento had signed for Madrid at 18. “Too young,” he later admitted. He had only played a handful of games for his nearest club Racing Santander, one of them while still underaged at 17, forcing them to forfeit the match and leaving him having to wait to restart his career. The contract to join Madrid was signed hidden away in a garage somewhere to avoid furious fans in Santander and for a while they were not much easier on him in Madrid. The club had seen something that supporters could not yet. “The whole thing was too big,” he said shortly after retiring. “Just their name, the atmosphere, my isolation, my reserved character, the shyness, the fans who had a go at me and rightly so, all meant I walked a bitter road. I lost sleep over the criticism. It made me think that they would transfer me to a team in the provinces.” Alfredo Di Stéfano, who had arrived the same summer, had other ideas, telling Bernabéu that Gento was “untouchable”. There was something there, he was sure. And so it proved. “The lad was an introvert, he came from a small town and he felt out of place,” Di Stéfano recalled. “In the second year he became the best left winger in the world.” Gento would cite a game against Barcelona, where his opponent Josep Seguer asked whether he was ever going to “get off your bike”, as the moment it really started, and then it never stopped. In 1954, Real Madrid won the league for the first time since 1933. The following season they won the inaugural European Cup, the first of five in a row and a run unrivalled by anyone. Gento was there for all of them and still there in 1966, a veteran now when a team made up only of Spaniards won it again. He also lost two finals. The third European Cup was the one he would remember most fondly, scoring an extra-time winner against Milan. The players were exhausted, Di Stéfano telling him: “It’s down to you.” That remark clearly had an impact on him which said something about a personality entirely without presumptuousness, about his profile, and yet also about his significance, the trust they had in him. “His speed was terrifying,” his teammate Ignacio Zoco said. “It was impossible to stop him and as fast as he went he could stop in a metre while the other guy keeps running, skidding past trying to put the brakes on. He’s out the game and Gento’s going the other way.”
This was probably the greatest forward line of all, a team that had Di Stéfano, Puskas, Kopa, Didí, Rial, and Canario, yet Puskas wrote of how their “plan was simple: we knew in Gento we had the fastest thing on two legs”. He was too fast for everyone, which had included him at first — he would run out of pitch and Di Stéfano would plead with Héctor Rial not to release him too soon as the rest could not catch up. But the control came, driven by a quiet determination to improve, to emulate and learn without ever considering himself a star, to serve. He did that better than anyone, and the trophies came too of course. The club he thought too big became bigger than anyone else because of him. “Don’t worry sunshine, you’ll be as big as your teammates,” Bernabéu assured him once, and Paco Gento was.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/paco-gento-real-madrid-legend-and-six-time-european-cup-winner-dies-aged-88;sports

They are neither as fast and reactive as Twitter, nor as popular and mainstream as a TV panel show. The secret of a good one, then, is largely down to personality. And it’s this that has propelled Andy Zaltzman’s The Bugle for a decade and a half. Originally co-hosted with a pre-megastardom John Oliver, each week Zaltzman pulls apart the news (with help from one of a rotating band of guests) in a manner that is often absurd or angry but never smug. Given the state of topical comedy in general, that last quality is particularly miraculous.
The Daily Zeitgeist
The miracle of The Daily Zeitgeist, meanwhile, is that it is daily. And while you might assume that filling a podcast with topical gags every 24 hours is the fastest way to be driven to either madness or despair, that happily isn’t the case here. Hosted by Jack O’Brien, co-founder of the comedy site Cracked, The Daily Zeitgeist is smart enough to realise that all days are not created equally. Some days O’Brien and his guest can prattle on entertainingly for more than an hour; on quieter days they wrap up in as little as 15 minutes. It makes for a refreshingly fat-free listen. Page 94: The Private Eye Podcast
If, like many (or perhaps just me), you have grown bored of Have I Got News for You, you should welcome Page 94 into your life with absolute glee. In truth, calling it a comedy podcast is a stretch: recent episodes have covered topics such as the sewage-dumping scandal, Covid and dodgy mini-umbrella funds. Episodes become available monthly, which means that all involved have the time and space to get all their ducks in order before shooting them down. The result is less Have I Got News for You and more Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, which is better. The Skewer
The Skewer has been described more as a “river” than a podcast, and it isn’t hard to see why. Created by Jon Holmes, it is a hostless collage of news, songs and dialogue, smashed together to reflect whatever has happened over the last few days. It’s a bit like Cassetteboy, and a bit like Chris Morris’s Jam, and the sheer amount of work that goes into creating a new episode sounds genuinely backbreaking. Fortunately, once you’ve attuned yourself to its weird rhythms, The Skewer becomes gently hypnotic. Amazing. Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!
And then there is this, NPR’s long-running, Peabody award-winning weekly current affairs quiz. Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me! has a huge and loyal listenership, and for good reason. It is incredibly sharp and perceptive, and rarely gets snagged up in surface level one-liners. It also attracts some legitimately great guests: Stephen Fry, Martin Short, Ilana Glazer and Chance the Rapper have all stopped by in recent months to join the fun.

One thing I would have changed The schedule change made it understandable in this instance – and the twilight period does make for a stunning backdrop – but one day-night Test match per Ashes series is plenty. The 2023 Ashes series will be … a golden chance for Australia to claim a series win in England for the first time since 2001 unless the hosts can perform a handbrake turn on their flatlining form. Mark Ramprakash Player of the series If you asked any of England’s batters which bowler they would not want to face it would be Pat Cummins, who in his first series as captain was fast, accurate and led his team excellently. Breakthrough player I’ve been massively impressed by Cameron Green. Technically he looks a very sound right-hand bat who can play long innings at the highest level and as a bowler he is tall, strong, hostile and unsettles players with pace and bounce. Best moment England’s highlight has to be Mark Wood getting six wickets in Hobart. He’s such a great character, who brings the team energy, enthusiasm and a point of difference. His first three overs in the final Test went for 30 and his resilience, the way he stuck at his task and came back to earn his reward, is a lesson for all cricketers.
One thing I would have changed I would rewind to the first morning and get England to bowl first. If I’m allowed a second change, I’d also have played Anderson and Broad. The 2023 Ashes series will be … very hard to predict for England and by then they may have lost Jimmy Anderson, but we will be more competitive. Barney Ronay Player of the series Scott Boland, a man having the time of his life against the most joyless opponents imaginable, a glorious and instructive note of contrast. Breakthrough player Cameron Green, who can be basically anything from here, genuine all-rounder, giant swooping eagle-man predator in the gully and a cricketer of real grace. The numbers. The numbers are going to be ridiculous. Best moment For Australia: first ball of the series. Also, everything else that followed. For England: n/a.
One thing I would have changed Complete systemic restructure of professional game, abolition of the ECB in favour of body driven by engagement not profit, quota of annual ringfenced free-to-air TV, serious national investment in public facilities, genuine, no-bullshit 10-year plan to re-engage cricket in schools and lost parts of the demographic. Nobody gets to call themselves “chief executive” or “managing director” (lol) or draw vast personal bonuses. The 2023 Ashes series will be … very different. This is a low. Details matter. Chris Woakes hooping it around at Edgbaston, one or two semi-functional batters and the root and branch machine will be packed up in the shed for the next three years. Andy Bull Player of the series Pat Cummins. Just pips Mitchell Starc, who had a superb all-round series. Cummins took 21 wickets at an average of 18, led his team brilliantly, and did it all without whining, snarling, sledging or posturing. Breakthrough player Cameron Green. With all respect to Scott Boland’s Edwardian bowling average, Green looks utterly formidable. The idea of how good Australia could be in the next 10 years now they have a genuine all-rounder is a little terrifying.
Best moment Cummins and Starc at the MCG. The way Starc bowled Rory Burns with the first ball of the series is the moment people will remember, but his spell with Cummins on the second evening at the MCG was as good as Test bowling gets. One thing I would have changed Everything? The one thing that would have made the most difference in the short term would have been a few proper warm-up games. Even that wouldn’t have saved England. The 2023 Ashes series will be … either a new low for England or a landmark on the upslope from this tour. It depends entirely on the decisions the management make in the next couple of months. Jonathan Liew Player of the series Travis Head. How different might the series have been without his momentum-shifting hundreds in Brisbane and Hobart? Well, probably not that different. But still, a towering effort. Breakthrough player Turns out the bowler of the series was an 83mph seamer in his thirties. Unhappily for England it was Scott Boland, Australia’s most spectacular Ashes debutant in a generation.
Best moment The first ball. Who would ever want to forget the ferocious noise at the Gabba, the searing pace of Mitchell Starc, the thrilling clunk of shattered stumps? Well, probably Rory Burns. One thing I would have changed England’s preparation. Poorly drilled teams play desperate cricket and England’s capitulation did immeasurable damage to the Ashes brand. Two first-class games should be a bare minimum in future. The 2023 Ashes series will be … largely unaffected by Covid, riotously entertaining and probably an England win with a new-look team. Life moves pretty fast, you know. Tanya Aldred Player of the series A last-minute call-up to the captaincy, Pat Cummins did everything with grace, was the series leading wicket-taker and one end of an electric spell of fast bowling that wonderful Melbourne evening. Breakthrough player Cameron Green. He bangs the ball in with unerring accuracy, fields like an angel at gully and by the end was unfurling divine cover drives that defy his 2m height and wingspan. Best moment Jonny Bairstow’s hundred and Usman Khawaja’s two would be up there, but for Ashes-defining momentum, it has to be Starc’ toppling Burns with the first ball of the series.
One thing I would have changed Chosen to bowl at Brisbane. England’s batting morale never recovered from being 11 for three in the first half hour of the series, while a jaunty bowling performance might have stayed that death spiral. The 2023 Ashes series will be … pimped for all its worth. Cummins will be photographed in the royal box at Wimbledon and England will be better with a Dukes in their hand and the clouds on their back. Geoff Lemon Player of the series Scott Boland. Sure he didn’t play the first two, but featured so dramatically from then on. Averaging 9.5 with the ball is like averaging 120 with the bat. Old school. Breakthrough player Also Boland, but he deserved the main gong too given his returns were so far ahead of everyone else’s. Beneath the radar, but every time he bowled, wickets came.
Best moment Marnus Labuschagne dancing off to cover, getting bowled behind his legs and ending up flat on his face. Also, Stuart Broad repeatedly having the celebrappeal shot down – then declining to review. One thing I would have changed England’s batting. The coaches for England’s batting. The system that produces England’s batting. The 2023 Ashes series will be … not as bad as this one. Surely? Won’t it? Simon Burnton Player of the series Cameron Green. Only one Englishman scored more runs than him and only one took more wickets – plus they were often important runs (his partnership with Travis Head in Hobart turned the game) and important wickets (70% were top-five batters). Just 22, he is quite the prospect. Breakthrough player Not long before his 33rd birthday Scott Boland’s breakthrough was both late and ludicrous, his figures in the second innings of his debut Test in Melbourne – four overs, seven runs, six wickets – reading like some kind of practical joke.
Best moment The first ball of the first match sensationally set the tone for a miserable campaign for Rory Burns individually and the England team as a whole. One thing I would have changed For all the pain involved this series may come to be seen as important and even beneficial for England. However, ideally I wouldn’t have watched any of it, read anything about it or spoken to anyone with any knowledge of it. The 2023 Ashes series will be … an unhealthy obsession for all of English cricket and general distraction from more useful stuff.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/ashes-2021-22-our-writers-end-of-series-awards;sports
2858;2858;2858;2858;2889;2889;Mastercard fined £31.5m over illegal UK prepaid cards cartel;2022-01-18;['Hilary Osborne'];['Financial sector', 'Credit cards', 'Credit card fees', 'Banks and building societies', 'Borrowing & debt', 'Money', 'Business', 'Regulators', 'Local government', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Benefits', 'Law'];Five payment companies including Mastercard have been fined a total of more than £33m for operating illegal cartels when providing prepaid cards for local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people. The companies were found by the Payment Systems Regulator to have broken competition law by agreeing not to compete with each other for the authorities’ custom. The regulator said that by acting in this way, the providers may have denied the councils access to cheaper products, and vulnerable people may have missed out on better quality services. The cards in question were used to distribute welfare payments to vulnerable members of society, such as the homeless, victims of domestic violence and asylum seekers. Benefits payments or emergency funds could be uploaded to the cards and used to pay for goods and services without the holder needing access to a bank account. The PSR launched an investigation in October 2017 and carried out dawn raids on premises in February 2018. It found evidence that between 2012 and 2018 five companies – Mastercard, allpay, Advanced Payment Solutions (APS), Prepaid Financial Services (PFS) and Sulion – were involved in a cartel, although some did not participate for all of that time. The cartel was organised against the backdrop of the National Prepaid Cards Network, which was sponsored by Mastercard and brought together public sector bodies that were potentially interested in prepaid cards and programme managers. The five parties arranged for the programme managers not to target or poach each other’s customers, and colluded on the allocation of potential business contacts that came in via network events. Between 2014 and 2016 there was a second cartel involving APS and PFS, with the companies agreeing not to target each other’s public sector customers when a contract was up for renewal, including through a tender. Despite the rule-breaking uncovered by the investigation, vulnerable card recipients would still have received their full benefits, but councils may have paid higher fees than in a competitive market, and there was no incentive for providers to improve the scope of the services. Chris Hemsley, the managing director of the regulator, said: “This investigation and the significant fines we have imposed send a clear message that the PSR has zero tolerance for cartel behaviour.” He added: “This case is particularly serious because the illegal cartel behaviour meant there was less competition and choice for local authorities. This means they may have missed out on cheaper or better-quality products which were used by some of the most vulnerable in society.” Mastercard, which was fined £31.5m, said in a statement: “Mastercard is committed to upholding all regulatory and legal standards and we apologise that the actions of two former employees resulted in the standards expected of us not being met in this instance. “We have taken this issue very seriously and have put further controls and training in place to ensure it cannot occur again, while working with the PSR to settle this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/mastercard-fined-315m-for-uk-prepaid-cards-cartel;business and economy
2864;2864;2864;2864;2895;2895;‘We are worried’: how Reading hit crisis point on and off the pitch;2022-01-18;['Ben Fisher'];['Reading', 'Championship', 'Football League', 'Football', 'Sport'];"A club statement when Reading supporters are desperately seeking greater transparency from the hierarchy would ordinarily be greeted with open arms. Only the seven paragraphs published on Saturday – when some fans were on the motorway back from Middlesbrough – posed more questions than answers. Hours after conceding a 95th-minute goal that condemned Reading to a fourth defeat in five matches, the club confirmed Liam Moore had been stripped of the captaincy and the owner, Dai Yongge, effectively offered the under-pressure manager, Veljko Paunovic, the dreaded vote of confidence. It capped a miserable week for Reading, who suffered a record-breaking 7-0 home defeat by Fulham last Tuesday, three days after being dumped out of the FA Cup by sixth-tier Kidderminster. Save for Andy Carroll’s equaliser at Boro and his spectacular disallowed goals against Fulham – an overhead kick and a preposterous chest-and-volley from outside the box – the only reason Reading fans have felt compelled to get off their seats recently is to vent their anger. The bad news is Carroll’s contract expired on Saturday.
“Mr Dai is fully supportive of the manager and his decisions and understanding of the hard few months we have endured both on and off the pitch,” Reading said in a statement that started by saying Moore had made clear his desire to leave in recent months. In 2018 Moore signed a new five-year contract now worth about £35,000 per week, making him one of the club’s highest earners. “Incredibly shocked by the statement,” he said on Instagram, accompanied by 18 face-palm emojis. There has also been infighting among supporters and the fear is the situation could sour further. One win from their past nine matches, coupled with a six-point deduction for breaching the English Football League’s profit and sustainability rules, has left them three points above the Championship relegation zone. The alarming run gives Derby survival hope despite a 21-point deduction. It is a similar story to Derby in that exorbitant spending has been a key factor in Reading’s demise from play-off finalists five years ago to the prospect of lining up in the third tier for the first time since 2002. Reading’s 2019-20 accounts show a wages-to-turnover ratio of 216%. “If they had got to the Premier League, the promised land, as they say, all of these problems would have gone away,” says one source. “Aston Villa managed to get up just in time. The owner has gambled, ploughing money in, but it has backfired.”
Home crowds have plummeted and Star (Supporters’ Trust at Reading) asked to urgently bring forward a biannual meeting with the chief executive, Dayong Pang, and finance director, Bryan Stabler, to address a “perceived lack of direction and connection with the fanbase”. The meeting is scheduled for Friday. “We are concerned and worried,” says the Star board member Roger Titford. “Before the situation becomes irretrievable, we need some kind of oomph and change. The fans have to be able to see key characters around the place and relate to them … We have an absent king.” The Chinese owners since May 2017, brother and sister Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li, speak little English and are based in Hong Kong. They previously tried to buy Hull City and owned KSV Roeselare and, until the club ceased to exist, Beijing Renhe. Pang, appointed in November 2020, said Yongge watches every game but “does not like publicity, and much like a lot of owners in football, is reluctant to communicate with supporters directly”. In a recent meeting the club said “thankfully, the manager is a great communicator”. Yongge’s last direct communication with supporters was in November, in a statement that addressed the six-point deduction. He said his “determination to succeed has not diminished but has amplified”. A recent survey of 257 supporters by the podcast The Tilehurst End found that 83.5% wanted to hear from Yongge. People with knowledge of the workings of the club have been left scratching their head at everything from how Reading have allowed key assets such as Omar Richards to leave on free transfers to starting recent games with a teenage midfielder at right-back and a 20-year-old at left-back because both first-choice full-backs are at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana. An injury crisis has not helped but the striker Lucas João, a £5m signing, returned to the squad last weekend.
The academy graduate Richards joined Bayern Munich in the summer. Reading received £8m for Michael Olise after Crystal Palace triggered his buyout clause but players such as Joe Rodon, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins were each sold to Premier League teams by other Championship clubs for at least double that. This summer 13 players are set to be out of contract, including the top scorer, John Swift. “When Nicky Hammond was the director of football we would buy cheap and sell dear,” says Titford. “Now it is the other way around. We bought Sone Aluko and Sam Baldock for the best part of £10m [from Fulham and Brighton in 2017 and 2018 respectively] and they both left on free transfers.” Recruitment is a significant issue. The four-man football board comprises Paunovic, Pang, Stabler and the academy manager Michael Gilkes but sources say the agent Kia Joorabchian has influence in that area. “All of the club’s recruitment seems to go through one person,” claims one agent. Another tells of how his client was approached for the managerial vacancy, only for Reading to lose interest when it became clear that Joorabchian would be sidelined.
Questions have been raised about Joorabchian’s influence in the club more generally as sources claim he acts as an informal adviser to the owner. He was described by Pang at a meeting with Star in October as a “personal acquaintance of Mr Dai” although he does not have an official title at Reading and Stabler said Joorabchian had not been paid any money as an agent. Reading have been contacted for comment. Joorabchian said it was false to suggest he has influence at the club. Last season’s seventh place looks more of an anomaly by the day. This week is pivotal with home games against Luton and Huddersfield on Wednesday and Saturday respectively. The owners have invested substantially in players and staff – Paunovic is their fifth manager in less than four years – and in a £50m training facility because of their craving for success. Now they badly need points.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/jan/18/how-reading-hit-crisis-point-on-and-off-the-pitch-championship;sports
2878;2878;2878;2878;2909;2909;THG shares slide as it misses profit margin forecasts;2022-01-18;['Julia Kollewe'];['THG', 'Business', 'UK news'];"Shares in THG have fallen sharply after the online shopping group warned profit margins for 2021 would come in below expectations and the early part of 2022 would be more challenging compared with the same period last year when global lockdowns fuelled sales. The company, founded and run by Matthew Moulding, announced on Tuesday that margins for 2021 would be 7.4% to 7.7%, against estimates of 7.9%, but should recover this year. Its shares fell 9% after the update, to 169p, well below the float price of 500p in September 2020. Manchester-based THG (formerly known as The Hut Group), which runs beauty and nutrition websites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein, made record annual sales of £2.2bn in its first full year as a public company, up 37.9% on 2020 and helped by acquisitions. Sales grew 27% in the fourth quarter to £711.7m. Moulding has pinned his hopes on the growth of Ingenuity, a division building direct-to-consumer websites for other companies. It increased sales by 42.7% to £57.4m, making it the fastest-growing division between October and December. THG warned that the early part of 2022 would be more challenging because of the tough annual comparison and record commodity prices within the nutrition division. It expects revenue growth of 22% to 25% this year, including £108m to £112m sales from Ingenuity. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The only way THG is going to win back the market’s favour is if it delivers better than expected figures consistently for at least two or three quarters. Unfortunately, its latest update doesn’t pass the test as it flags margins are slightly below expectations. “Under normal circumstances, a business delivering the level of growth seen in THG’s latest update would be applauded by the market. Sadly, THG has shot itself in the foot thanks to the way it has behaved as a listed company since joining the stock market. And that means only something spectacular will lift the share price.” THG has been through a torrid 12 months on the stock market after its £4.5bn flotation turned out to be the biggest London stock market debut since 2013. Its shares, which had soared after the group floated, slumped more than 70% in 2021. The drop cost its investors, among which Moulding is the biggest shareholder, about £6.9bn in paper losses. Moulding has alleged the company’s shares have been unfairly targeted. THG handed over a dossier of data to the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial watchdog, last week after observing irregular trading of its shares. Moulding has claimed hedge funds colluded in a “pretty aggressive short attack” on THG’s shares last year. The shares were affected in November after it emerged that BlackRock, the retailer’s largest institutional shareholder, was halving its stake. Moulding and the business have attracted criticism for his role as both executive chair and chief executive, which is against best corporate governance practice. The board also signed off a pre-flotation deal that saw Moulding acquire THG’s offices, warehouses and leisure facilities, before immediately becoming the company’s landlord by leasing those buildings back to the company for an annual rent of £19m.
“Failure to deliver the level of detail about the business desired by investors, questionable corporate governance standards, and comments by chief executive Matt Moulding that he wished he’d never floated THG all amount to bad practice as far as investors are concerned, and they’ve voted with their feet which has left the share price languishing well below its IPO price,” Mould added. Moulding said on Tuesday the firm’s achievements in 2021 included the opening of its 1m sq ft UK technology campus. It hired 3,000 people last year, mostly in the UK. “Despite challenging conditions, we have scaled revenue and expanded our business model, particularly THG Ingenuity, well ahead of expectations given at our initial public offering 16 months ago,” he said. “The new year has started well, and we remain confident in delivering our strategic growth plans during 2022 and beyond.” Moulding told analysts: “Beauty tends to be one of the last things that people would stop spending on. In nutrition the move towards healthier living is very much still there.”.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/thg-shares-profit-sales;business and economy
2885;2885;2885;2885;2916;2916;How many more babies must die before England stops jailing pregnant women? | Rona Epstein;2022-01-18;['Rona Epstein'];['Prisons and probation', 'UK criminal justice', 'Law', 'Society', 'Women', 'UK news', 'Pregnancy'];"In the past three years, two babies born inside English prisons have died. In September 2019, a woman, now known as Ms A, gave birth alone in her cell at HMP Bronzefield and the baby died. In July 2020, a baby was stillborn at HMP Styal. Prison will never be a safe place for pregnant women, so why are our courts still sending them there? Geraldine Brown, Maria Garcia de Frutos and I set about trying to answer that question. Our research into pregnancy in English prisons (there are no women’s prisons in Wales), published this week, has convinced me that imprisoning pregnant women is disproportionate, cruel and simply unnecessary. Most of the 22 women who responded to our survey were in prison because they had been recalled by the probation service, which means that at the end of a prison term they were placed under probation supervision for one year, but then breached their probation conditions so were sent back inside. Some of these “breaches” included a missed probation appointment, changing address and shoplifting (in this case, committed by a woman who was 30 weeks pregnant and was homeless, living in a car park – she was returned to prison for 11 weeks). Two women were in prison on remand, awaiting their trial. The most common offence was shoplifting. Four were there for drug offences. Other offences included fraud, perjury, robbery and affray. Five of the women were sent to prison at a very late stage of pregnancy: three at 36 weeks, one at 35 weeks and one at 30 weeks. Sending pregnant women to prison is unnecessary. Multiple countries, including Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia already have laws to prevent pregnant women going to prison. It is time for the UK to follow their example. English courts can and should use alternatives to imprisonment for pregnant women. If they were given community orders instead, the probation service would help them to access support, training, education and counselling at women’s centres, which offer support in a non-punitive setting. This kind of support is proven to be effective in helping women turn around lives that were previously chaotic. Non-punitive residential options, along the lines of therapeutic communities such as the Jasmine Mother’s Recovery in Plymouth and Phoenix Futures in Sheffield, should be created and sustained across England. I spent two days at Jasmine with the mothers and staff, and saw the nursery full of babies. The work they do is life-saving. It is accepting, non-judgmental and trauma-informed. This is what pregnant women in the criminal justice system need. In this all-female setting, women find protection from domestic violence, they care for themselves and for each other, for their unborn child, and for the baby once born. They receive highly skilled peer-mentoring and group counselling, which has proven to be effective in treating addiction. Out of court disposals are another alternative that police forces can use. They divert women from the criminal justice system, and, with the help of women’s centres, help them deal with difficult issues with their lives and avoid conflict with the law.
The law must change. Whenever a pregnant woman is in court, a protocol should be activated to alert the court to issues concerning the need to protect pregnant women, mothers and their children. There must be absolutely no committal to custody on remand (which means they are held until they appear in court), or sentencing of a pregnant woman without a full assessment of dependent children or pregnancies by way of a bail information report or a pre-sentence report. Level Up, Birth Companions and Women in Prison are campaigning to change sentencing laws so that no pregnant woman will be sent to prison, and have launched a petition calling for Dominic Raab, the justice minister, to change sentencing laws. The starting point must be that no pregnant woman should be in custody. If custody is decided upon, the reasons must be stated and justified in open court. The mother whose baby died in Bronzefield prison was there on remand. This vulnerable young woman – 18 years old, eight months pregnant and unwell – was remanded in custody awaiting trial, and it was her first time in prison. After her baby had died, she was granted bail. Why was remand in custody ordered in the first place? No court decision should endanger the life of an unborn baby.

2896;2896;2896;2896;2927;2927;I have a wonderful fiance, but my libido has vanished – will it ever come back?;2022-01-18;['Pamela Stephenson Connolly'];['Sex', 'Life and style', 'Relationships', 'Mental health', 'Health'];I have a wonderful partner, and we’re getting married next year after three years together. We live together, and both work quite intense jobs. I’ve always been quite a sexual person, but recently my libido has fallen off a cliff. It’s like I don’t even have sex organs any more, which is a bit frightening. My partner has a high sex drive and I worry he is unfulfilled, despite saying he doesn’t mind. I think he takes it personally, but I love him very much. We are often not in the house at the same time and keep quite different hours because of his job. I have had a traumatic year, with a few bereavements and family illness, and wonder if this has affected my sex drive. My question is, how can I get it back? Bereavement and trauma are two fairly common reasons for lowered libido. This is normally temporary, but you need time to recover and heal. Help your partner to understand your lack of desire is not about him – ask him to be patient. And try not to let your anxiety about your libido escalate, as that could make things worse. Any kind of loss can lead to depression, and it could be worth seeking some therapeutic help if you don’t feel like yourself pretty soon. Like anxiety, depression is another likely culprit when libido drops. Many people have become depressed as a result of the losses of our time – lockdowns, health issues, curbs on our freedoms, financial struggles and job losses – and sexual problems often follow. Mental and sexual health can never be taken for granted. Now more than ever, we must find ways to soothe, nurture and sustain ourselves. This too shall pass.

2900;2900;2900;2900;2931;2931;Scott Morrison rebukes George Christensen for ‘dangerous messages’ on vaccinating children;2022-01-18;['Sarah Martin'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian politics', 'George Christensen', 'Coalition', 'Australia news'];"Scott Morrison has urged parents to ignore the “dangerous messages” of government MP George Christensen who suggested children should not get vaccinated against Covid. The prime minister on Tuesday rebuked the controversial Nationals MP and called on parents to instead listen to the “world’s best regulators”. Morrison has been under pressure to rein in Coalition MPs who consistently undermine the government’s health advice after Novak Djokovic was deported partly because his presence could “foster anti-vaccination sentiment”. “I strongly disagree with the message sent out by Mr Christensen regarding children’s vaccinations,” Morrison said in a statement. “It is contrary to the official professional medical advice provided to the government and I urge parents to disregard his dangerous messages in relation to vaccines.”
Morrison said vaccinations were the country’s “primary weapon” against the Covid-19 virus. He noted more than 90% of Australians aged over 16 were now fully vaccinated. “If you are not vaccinated against the virus you are more likely to experience severe illness and die. Getting vaccinated saves lives,” he said. “This includes five to 11-year-olds who are provided with a special children’s vaccine that has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. These are the same medical experts who approve all other vaccines for children in Australia. They are the world’s best medical regulators. “These are the experts that have the knowledge, accountability and experience to provide the credible and reliable advice that parents need to make important decisions about their child’s best interests.” Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, also urged parents to “listen to the experts” in the wake of Christensen’s remarks, while the health minister, Greg Hunt, said he “plainly” disagreed with the Queenslander. “Get your children vaccinated, please bring your children forward,” Hunt said on Tuesday. “Vaccinations save lives. I would flatly, plainly disagree with anyone who said that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Kelly said people should take the advice of commonwealth and state chief medical officers and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi), which was among “the best experts on immunisation in the world”. “We are of one voice – it is very important for children, now down to the age of five, to be vaccinated, and so please go ahead with that, and listen to the experts,” the chief medical officer said. In an attempt to promote his podcast, Christensen flagged he would “break the internet” with his call not to vaccinate children. On his Facebook page, Christensen said the podcast episode was “too hot” and would be censored by the tech giant. “I can’t even show you the title but I can tell you every parent should listen to it,” he said. The “Do NOT Vax Your Children” episode features an interview with Dr Robert Malone who claims to have invented mRNA technology but has reportedly been banned from Twitter for violations of its Covid-19 misinformation policy. Christensen, and several other Coalition MPs, have become vocal critics of the government’s vaccination program – campaigning against mandates and raising concerns about adverse events.
Hunt, who like Morrison has this week rejected suggestions of a double standard over the treatment of Djokovic, said on Tuesday the government was “pro-vaccination”. “Wherever people have said things that are anti-vax, we disagree with them, whether that is people in our own movement, I disagree,” Hunt said. “Frankly, the anti-vaxxers aren’t just losing the debate, they’ve lost the debate. We’re at a 95% national 16-plus vaccination ... and it’s the Australian public, the Australian medical workforce, in partnership with local, state, territory and federal governments that have achieved that. So we’ll just keep going and we want that number to go higher.” According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, evidence from clinical trials and real-world experience from overseas indicates that side-effects most commonly seen in the five to 11 age group were “mild and temporary”, similar to the safety profile in older populations. In clinical trials of over 2,000 children, most side-effects were reported in the first two to three days after vaccination, with the most common being a sore arm (70% of children), headache (25%) and tiredness (25%).
In the US, where 8.7m doses have been administered to children in this age bracket, reports of more serious effects following vaccination were “extremely rare” with 100 reports from the 8.7m vaccine doses. Myocarditis – which is an inflammation of the heart – was also very rare in this age group with 11 mild cases from more than 8m doses. Kelly said the real-world experience gave Australian authorities additional assurance about the safety of the vaccine for children. “We have the advantage of watching multiple millions of children of that age group of five to 11 with the first and the second doses in the US [and] they have not seen a single issue in terms of severe safety signals,” he said. “We were looking very closely at that and so that’s a real reassurance that real-world experience, plus the TGA tick and Atagi in terms of safety and efficacy. [Vaccines] do work … particularly against severe disease in children the same as they do in adults.” More than 379,000 child vaccines have now been administered in Australia with Hunt saying that this number was expected to top 500,000 in the coming days.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/scott-morrison-rebukes-george-christensen-for-dangerous-messages-on-vaccinating-children;health

On the same day as the sale went through, I was assured by SSE that, despite all appearances, my meter was a normal one, and that it would not cut out over the Christmas holiday. Needless to say it wasn’t a standard meter, and soon cut out due to a lack of credit. I was forced to spend hours and hours over Christmas trying to get our gas supply to work so we could have heating and hot water. I was offered a prepayment card issued at PayPoint shops as a way to get my supply turned back on. The shop I was sent to couldn’t issue me with one – another did, but the card wouldn’t load. SSE insists that it cannot help unless I am present, forcing me to remain in an unheated house with no hot water and no way of cooking. MG, Evesham We are getting a lot of complaints about Ovo, which bought SSE’s retail customers last year, and famously advised customers this week to do star jumps, eat porridge and cuddle pets to keep warm. It seems its administration is not what it should be. It’s completely unacceptable for the company to leave a customer for almost two weeks without heating in winter. Had the situation been different, someone could have come to serious harm. After I sent your case to Ovo’s head office, it swiftly sent out an emergency engineer who cleared the meter and added enough credit to get the heating on.

2923;2923;2923;2923;2955;2955;Gambling killed my husband. We must stop this predatory industry claiming more lives | Annie Ashton;2022-01-18;['Annie Ashton'];['Gambling', 'Society', 'Mental health', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Advertising'];"This time last year, my husband Luke and I had everything we wanted: each other, a lovely house and two wonderful children. Three months later, this life was shattered. On 22 April 2021, Luke took his own life. About two years before his death, Luke developed a gambling disorder. He started gambling with friends on a Saturday, placing bets at a local bookies while watching Leicester City, his football team. At the time, I didn’t think it was dangerous – I had no idea that gambling kills so many people. Soon, Luke began to bet online. He opened multiple accounts, taking advantage of “free bets” – aggressive marketing offers used by online bookmakers to lure people into gambling. From there, he was encouraged to bet on sports, like horse racing, that he knew little about. It didn’t take long for him to get into a lot of debt and start chasing his losses. If you knew Luke, you’d find it hard to comprehend that he gambled. My husband was sensible and careful with money. He would save whenever he could, and bills were always paid on time. As a warehouse manager at a local family printing firm, he often found ways of saving the company money, something he was held in high regard for. I only became aware he was in trouble after I noticed he was struggling to pay for cinema trips or meals out. Gambling on a phone is very isolated, and it took me a year to understand he was gambling so much. We had just sold our house, so luckily we could pay off the debts he had accumulated and, much to my relief, Luke closed his gambling accounts. This seemed enough. Luke had never had issues with gambling before and I had no reason to think he would again.
But in 2020, Luke was furloughed because of the pandemic. He began gambling again in secret, reopening his old accounts. I remember him often commenting on how relentless the marketing emails he was getting were; he was concerned about the impact they would have on people who were already struggling with money. Naively, I thought this meant Luke could stop gambling when he wanted to – like the GambleAware slogan: “When the fun stops, stop.” Three weeks after his suicide, the police gave Luke’s phone back to me. It was then that I realised his gambling disorder had returned. His relapse was so rapid that I still cannot believe it was never picked up by these gambling companies who – at the start of the pandemic – had promised to do more to protect vulnerable customers like Luke. On one account he reopened during the pandemic, the pattern of his gambling was obviously harmful. He took advantage of a free bet offer, deposited money, lost money, was immediately advertised another free bet offer, and the cycle would begin again. It is not in the gambling industry’s interests to stop people developing gambling addictions. It spends £1.5bn a year on advertising to bring in customers to get hooked on its products for profit. Some 60% of its profits come from from 5% of customers who are already problem gamblers, or are at risk of becoming so. And they are huge profits – the UK industry is worth about £14bn. These companies know a staggering amount about their customers – in some cases they will know if someone earning £30k a year has gambled £60k in a few months, and do nothing to stop it. They track their habits and patterns and vulnerabilities online to find out when best to advertise to them and what kind of emails they are most likely to open. They could, if they wanted to, use this information to help people, to block their accounts; but often they use it to drag them further into addiction. When people like my husband try not to gamble, they are targeted more aggressively. One gambler who got his data back from an online gambling company and shared it with the New York Times found that as someone who had given up gambling, he had been profiled as a customer to “win back”. How do these gambling companies get away with it? Because they can. The entire industry is fuelled by a money above all else mentality that is devoid of morality.
In a 2021 report, Public Health England estimated that there are more than 409 gambling-related suicides in England every year. That is more than one life lost every single day. That is why I am campaigning for “Luke’s law” – to ban gambling incentives such as “free bets”. Luke found that being bombarded with ads from that 24-hour bookies and casino in his pocket made it a problem that became impossible to escape. Banning these incentives may go some way to alleviating the misery that gambling companies cause families like ours with their predatory actions. The gambling lobby is very powerful – just look at all the MPs who get paid off with tickets to sports games to speak in its favour. But unlike so many who caution against change to gambling regulation, I am not on anyone’s payroll. I would give anything for this catastrophe to not have happened to me and my family. It has been traumatic and the fight is draining, but I do not feel I have a choice. The government is currently reviewing gambling legislation – laws that were drawn up before smartphones. This is a real chance to make changes that could benefit everyone – not just the few who are making money from misery. We banned tobacco marketing; we can do the same for gambling. My children will never see their father again. But I hope that by getting Luke’s law passed, he may have saved others from falling for the same fate. It gives me some small solace, and I hope it gives our children that too among their grief.

2947;2947;2947;2947;2979;2979;Tuchel hopes Manchester City omission helps Mount regain top form ;2022-01-17;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Chelsea', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Football', 'Sport'];"It takes a brave person to drop Mason Mount. Frank Lampard once said that Mount’s eyes would burn whenever he left him out and Thomas Tuchel saw something similar when he named the Chelsea midfielder on the bench against Manchester City on Saturday. “It’s within Mason’s character of being polite and respectful, so there is no harm,” Tuchel said. “But I get the eyes. I get the look. I know the look.” It is nothing new as far as Chelsea’s manager is concerned. After all Mount made no attempt to hide his displeasure after starting on the bench when Tuchel’s tenure at Stamford Bridge began with a goalless draw against Wolves a year ago. The England international was not afraid to take it up with Tuchel, who was pleased to see such a spirited response from a player who would go on to play a pivotal role in Chelsea winning the Champions League.
For Tuchel, that hunger is something to appreciate. He loves Mount’s personality and has made him a key part of his side. There is trust between the pair. Tuchel knows that Mount will carry out tactical instructions and, while the 23-year-old still has plenty of room for improvement, few of his teammates in Chelsea’s attack can match his level. Even so, this has not been the easiest of campaigns for Mount. He has scored seven goals in all competitions, but he has looked jaded at times. The exertions of helping England reach the Euro 2020 final have taken a toll and sometimes it is hard not to feel that Mount, who has played 34 times for club and country this season, needs a rest. It certainly seemed that way when Chelsea reached the Carabao Cup final by beating Tottenham last Wednesday. Tuchel was not happy with Mount’s performance – he was on his case from start to finish – and he decided to go in a different direction against City, with Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic asked to support Romelu Lukaku. “We were opting for runners,” Tuchel said. “We thought we could break the line more with Hakim as a left foot on the left side and going for Christian on the right side because of the arrival of Christian in the box. He is a bit more of a runner than Mason.” The plan malfunctioned. Ziyech, Pulisic and Lukaku rarely combined and Chelsea’s title hopes were all but over when Kevin De Bruyne gave City the lead. Would Mount, who sparkled when Chelsea beat City in the Champions League final, have made a difference? Maybe not. He has gone eight games without a goal and has been average since Christmas. Mount should start when Chelsea visit Brighton on Tuesday, but he has not been the same since Ben Chilwell suffered a season-ending knee injury. The left wing-back had a great understanding with Mount, who is at his best when he is part of a smooth collective.
“I think he’s also missing Reece James,” Tuchel said. “Reece, N’Golo Kanté and him were so strong together. When you turn, you know without even looking he will come now, or I will go and get the pass and he will come, so I will be here.” Chelsea are striving for those connections. Mount, whose game is not about individual moments, needs them. Above all, though, he needs to be back on the pitch. “I felt Mason not like in the 100% zone, where he is untouchable, which he normally almost is,” Tuchel said. “He’s not happy about it, but it will not last long because everyone loves Mason – me included.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/tuchel-hopes-manchester-city-omission-helps-mount-regain-top-form;sports

The Premier League side beat off competition from Benfica among others for the 21-year-old, who made his Portugal Under-21 debut in November last year.
The Wolves manager, Bruno Lage, sees the former Sporting youth academy player as one for the future but with the potential to have an impact this season already. A contract until 2026 has been agreed with an option for a further year. With add-ons the deal could reach £4.2m. Chiquinho has three goals and three assists in 15 top-flight appearances in Portugal. He is lightning fast but is likely to take some time to get used to the more physical nature of the Premier League. “It’s a big stadium and I feel a lot of fears because it’s a big team, but I will do my best for the club and enjoy playing here,” said Chiquinho. “I’m a very fast player and I do my best in the pitch. I like to do one-on-ones, and score goals. “There’s a lot of good Portuguese players in Wolves, and I have been inspired by them. I will also take a lot of advice from them, so it’s good. “I want to achieve all I can because it’s a big opportunity for me. What I can do, I will do, so if I can score 10 or 20 goals, and if I can get six, 10 or 20 assists, then I will do.” Wolves are eighth in the Premier League, only six points behind West Ham in fourth and with two games in hand. Lage’s side have hit a rich vein of form lately and are unbeaten in their five past games in all competition.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/wolves-agree-deal-to-sign-winger-chiquinho-from-estoril-for-29m;sports
2962;2962;2962;2962;2995;2995;Arron Banks may have been ‘used and exploited’ by Russia, court hears;2022-01-17;['Haroon Siddique'];['Arron Banks', 'Brexit', 'Russia', 'London', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Foreign policy', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'World news'];The Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr has told a court she believes the multimillionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks may have been “used and exploited” by the Russian government, as she defended her reporting. Banks, who funded the Leave.EU campaign group, is suing Cadwalladr for defamation over two instances in which she said the businessman was lying about his relationship with the Russian state. A judge previously ruled that the meaning of the remarks, made by the journalist at the Ted technology conference and in a related tweet, was that Banks lied about a secret relationship with the Russian government “in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding”. Cadawalladr has said that she did not intend to imply that Banks had lied about receiving money from Russia, only about the extent of his contacts with Russia. She is relying on the defence that her reporting was in the public interest. Giving evidence about her reporting at the high court in central London on Monday, Cadwalladr said: “Reflecting upon the evidence I thought it was possible he was used and exploited by the Russian government.” In her written evidence statement, she said she had obtained two intelligence files from an organisation contracted to undertake work countering Russian disinformation in Europe on behalf of a government agency, one file of which raised concerns about Banks’s Russian wife. Cadwalladr said the file claimed Katya Banks had entered Britain on a passport sequentially numbered to the passport of Katia Zatuliveter, a woman MI5 had claimed was a Russian spy and who had had an affair with the Portsmouth MP, Mike Hancock. Katya Banks was also alleged to have had a relationship with Hancock. The significance of the sequential numbers, according to Cadwalladr, was that the open-source intelligence organisation Bellingcat, while examining the 2018 novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, had identified two suspects in CCTV photos as Russian intelligence officers partly through evidence that the men’s passport numbers were only separated by three digits and had therefore been issued at nearly the same time. Cadwalladr said in her witness statement: “I found the suggestion that Katya Banks was linked in some way to Russian intelligence potentially credible. I also knew that the Kremlin had a track record in channelling money and influence operations via the wives of oligarchs. A specialist Russian investigator told me that they ‘always look at the wives’.” She said the other intelligence file detailed allegations of Arron Banks’s involvement in organised crime in South Africa, including money laundering and cigarette and diamond smuggling. Cadwalladr added that she was contacted by Banks’s former business partner in South Africa, Chris Kimber, who had owned diamond mines with the claimant and who said Banks had negotiations with Russian business people about investing in the mines, including from Russian state-owned firms. William McCormick QC, representing Banks, said Cadawalladr should have explicitly stated in all her reporting that there was no evidence of Banks being in receipt of Russian money but had failed to do so. Earlier, Banks, giving evidence, described Cadwalladr’s reporting as “hysterical”, claiming she was motivated by personal animus against him and dealing with conspiracy theories against him.

2964;2964;2964;2964;2997;2997;Boris Johnson lied about lockdown party, Dominic Cummings claims;2022-01-17;['Rowena Mason', 'Heather Stewart', 'Rajeev Syal'];['Boris Johnson', 'Dominic Cummings', 'Coronavirus', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Gray report'];"Dominic Cummings has accused Boris Johnson of lying after No 10 denied the prime minister was warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” party during the first lockdown. Johnson admitted to parliament last week that he attended drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 but claimed he had not realised it was a social gathering. The event was organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary (PPS), Martin Reynolds, who told people to “bring your own booze” – but No 10 denies that the prime minister saw the emailed invitation to about 100 staff. It has also denied allegations that two senior staffers warned Johnson not to go ahead with the drinks event, saying this was “not true”.
But Cummings, a former senior aide to the prime minister, wrote a new blog post on Monday challenging that account. He said he personally told Reynolds that the invitation broke the rules and claimed Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings said in his blogpost: “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” Sue Gray, the senior civil servant in charge of the inquiry into Downing Street parties, could make a formal request to interview Cummings, Whitehall sources confirmed. It is within the remit of the inquiry to approach former members of staff if their evidence might be relevant. No 10 staff had hoped that the inquiry, which is examining more than 15 separate allegations of illegal gatherings in Downing Street, would conclude this week. Because of the constant drip of new parties and developments, officials believe it may now report next week. The inquiry is expected to outline when each alleged party occurred, how many people were present and who was involved in organising them. It will also outline the regulations at that time, and could suggest whether each event appears to have broken the regulations at that time. The Gray report is not expected to recommend a criminal investigation. Cummings then said that during a discussion over the future of the cabinet secretary and Reynolds, he had said to the prime minister something like: “Martin’s invited the building to a drinks party, this is what I’m talking about, you’ve got to grip this madhouse.” Cummings added: “The PM waved it aside. I had told him repeatedly the PPS should be replaced, as had other competent officials who knew the whole structure needed a huge upgrade in personnel and management. ‘He’s MY guy, I don’t want you replacing him with YOUR person.’ (Yes, this says a lot.) I went home to bed at 3ish, still very ill from Covid.”
He claimed Reynolds had checked with Johnson whether the party should go ahead, the prime minister agreed it should and they both went to the party. Another former Downing Street staffer told the Guardian: “It is inconceivable: there is no way Martin would go ahead without checking with Boris. There is no way any PPS would. If two senior people come to you and say, ‘this shouldn’t happen’, you don’t then proceed with it without speaking to the principal.” Asked about Cummings’s latest claims, a No 10 spokesperson pointed to an earlier statement, saying: “It is untrue that the prime minister was warned about the [20 May] event in advance. As he said … he believed implicitly that this was a work event. He has apologised to the house and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” The party on 20 May has emerged as the most contentious event for Johnson out of all the allegations that lockdown rules were broken in Downing Street. With Tory MPs openly questioning Johnson’s future as party leader, there are worries among backbenchers about a drip-drip of further damaging revelations causing harm to the government’s reputation. • John Crace will join a Guardian Live online event about the No 10 lockdown parties and Boris Johnson’s future this Wednesday 19 January from 8pm to 9pm GMT.

The author had contacted police in Scotland in November after the tweet, which showed her Edinburgh house and revealed the address. The image showed activists standing outside the property with placards carrying slogans such as “trans liberation now”. However, Police Scotland said on Monday that no criminality had been established following inquiries. Rowling had said the photo made her a victim of “doxxing” – the act of publishing private personal information about an individual or organisation, usually online, to enable others to take action. “I have to assume [they] thought doxxing me would intimidate me out of speaking up for women’s sex-based rights,” she tweeted in response to the activists at the time. “They should have reflected on the fact that I’ve now received so many death threats I could paper the house with them, and I haven’t stopped speaking out. “Perhaps, and I’m just throwing this out there, the best way to prove your movement isn’t a threat to women, is to stop stalking, harassing and threatening us.” The campaigners deleted the photo the day after it was posted. They said the decision was made after they received “serious and threatening transphobic messages”.
In 2020, Rowling sparked controversy after taking issue with a headline on an online article discussing “people who menstruate” and said: “I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?” Critics accused her of being transphobic, an allegation Rowling strongly denies. After she published a lengthy essay explaining the development of her critical stance in sex and gender debates, the lead actors of the Potter film franchise, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all made public their support for transgender rights.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/trans-activists-will-not-be-charged-over-picture-of-jk-rowlings-home;entertainment and culture
2979;2979;2979;2979;3012;3012;Barrie Hesketh obituary;2022-01-17;['N/A'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Scotland'];"My friend Barrie Hesketh, who has died aged 91, was an actor, writer and artist who in 1966 co-founded the Mull Little theatre on the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides. Barrie and his then wife, Marianne, had moved to Mull in 1963 with their three young sons, and were running their home as a guest house. The after-dinner entertainment the couple provided proved popular and, as demand grew, they set about transforming the adjacent cowshed into a small theatre. For their two-person productions, Barrie found inventive ways to adapt classics. Repertoire included plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Strindberg and Shaw, specially commissioned contemporary work by the Scottish writer Iain Crichton Smith, and original material written by the Heskeths. The couple took their productions on tour, across Britain and Europe. Barrie was born in Erdington, Birmingham, the only child of Doris (nee Sutcliffe) and Donald Hesketh, but grew up in the Peak District, where his father ran the village shop in Flash, outside Buxton. Barrie attended Buxton college, excelling in art, then trained as an actor at Central School of Speech and Drama, in London. There, Barrie met fellow student Marianne Richards, and they married in 1954, a year after graduation. His career began in weekly rep, with Caryl Jenner Touring Productions and Manchester Library Theatre Company, and as an actor and presenter for Granada and ABC TV. In 1960 he accepted a position with the Scottish Community Drama Association, in the course of which a visit to Mull inspired the family’s relocation.
Among the audience on Mull one evening was the senior tutor at Churchill College, Cambridge, who was so impressed that he invited the couple to spend a term doing whatever they chose to enrich college life. I was an undergraduate there when they arrived in 1979. As a director Barrie was creative, playful, and generous with us, his student cast and crew. In 1983, the Heskeths were both appointed MBE. Following Marianne’s death from cancer in 1984, Barrie was again invited to Churchill College. It was then that he met Philippa Comber, a psychologist and the college counsellor, who became his partner. Having directed a final season on Mull, Barrie left the island in 1986 and joined Philippa in East Anglia. His focus shifted to writing: the autobiographical Taking Off (1997); a collection of unpublished essays, An Actor’s Take on the Psychology of Shakespeare; and plays including a monologue, The New Prometheus (1987), which he performed in New York, Berlin and Cambridge. Barrie and Philippa settled in Manchester in 1999. Communicating his love of Shakespeare, Barrie directed young actors at Altrincham Club theatre during 2003 and lectured in 2016 at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, in London. A talented and prolific painter, he was still at work in his 80s. When Parkinson’s disease and an associated dementia made daily life increasingly difficult, Barrie moved to a care home in Cheshire in 2018. There, in 2020, he and Philippa married. Barrie is survived by Philippa, his sons, Richard, Nicholas and James, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/17/barrie-hesketh-obituary;entertainment and culture
2996;2996;2996;2996;3029;3029;Caring for Covid face masks: bag it between wears and bin it when you’re done;2022-01-17;['Lucianne Tonti'];['Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style', 'Fashion', 'Coronavirus'];"Every time I leave the house, the refrain – phone, wallet, keys, mask – rattles around my brain while I search my bag for the essentials. Evidence that, despite how strange it felt to wear a mask way back in 2019, when we were worried about bushfire smoke inhalation, face masks have become firmly entrenched in our daily lives. Masks are proven to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission and help keep us safe at supermarkets and in between our table and the bathroom at restaurants, but they do need to be handled with specific care to remain effective.
Bag it up Most of us are quick to remove our masks when we sit down at a cafe, but Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales says you should wash or sanitise your hands before you touch your mask, and only handle it by the straps or ear loops.
When you’re not using your mask, rather than shoving it in your pocket or leaving it loose in your bag, put it in a ziplock or paper bag. If you have some disinfectant handy, you can give it a light spray before putting it away. Cloth no longer cuts it Although the “no touching” advice applies to both cloth and disposable masks, MacIntyre says that while cloth masks were fine for other variants, they “really do not cut it against Omicron”. This is because the Omicron variant is more transmissible, so a mask that fits and filters well provides much better protection. MacIntyre says it’s best to use P2 or N95 masks, or if these aren’t available, a blue surgical mask. In this video, occupational hygienist Kate Cole explains how to ensure you’re wearing your mask properly.
When to throw a mask out According to MacIntyre, there are two factors that determine when a mask should be thrown away. The first is obvious, if a mask is “visibly damp or soiled” throw it out. The other factor is the length of time you’ve worn the mask, which MacIntyre says shouldn’t be more than eight to 10 hours. Although this should be considered “a rough guide”, she says, that can be doubled in the case of “extreme shortages”.
How to dispose of a mask It should come as no surprise that disposable face masks are an environmental hazard. According to Dr Mohammad Saberian, a researcher from RMIT University, 6.8bn disposable masks are used across the globe each day. He says since disposable face masks are mainly made of non-biodegradable plastics, they could take 450 years to break down. The good news is, Saberian and his colleagues at RMIT have shown how disposable face masks could be recycled into road-making material. They suggest that once masks have been decontaminated they could be shredded and mixed with building rubble.
But Saberian says, “The main hurdle to recycling face masks and waste PPE is the lack of appropriate facilities and equipment in waste recycling facilities.” Face masks in Australia are put in the rubbish bin, collected with household waste and sent to landfill. Saberian says designated bins for face masks or waste PPE should be implemented, at least for busy locations like hospitals, aged care facilities and shopping centres. But MacIntyre says for now, you should make sure you dispose of masks in the rubbish bin: “Please do not litter or leave used masks lying around.” Caring for cloth masks
What about all the cloth masks we’ve begrudgingly collected? They are still better than wearing nothing, and need to be machine washed at 60C after each day’s use. That means if you are wearing cloth masks daily, you’ll need to have several on rotation. The founder of Maison Modulare, Chrys Wong, suggests machine washing “on a gentle cycle with like colours and like size articles” then using a tumble dryer, ironing or steaming the mask afterward, to provide further sterilisation.

We have known about the dangers of misinformation for years, and these are now being felt keenly by the huge numbers choosing not to be vaccinated. Emmanuel Macron’s approach of making life more difficult for the unvaccinated (Report, 4 January) makes my heart sink. Surely that will only feed the misinformation beast and validate the screams of “don’t trust the government”. There is great power in hindsight, of course, but it is apparent that governments had ample warning that misinformation would be a problem for vaccine uptake. It seems that misinformation has been dumped in the “too difficult, with insufficient political gain” box, and we are reaping the consequences. My father-in-law is unvaccinated by choice. I do not think he should be punished, nor do I think he deserves much sympathy. I simply wish that governments would offer a sensible and coherent strategy for tackling misinformation and mitigating its effects.

Afghanistan’s legal system was slow and often corrupt, but it offered women some hope of escaping abusers and seeing their tormentors jailed. Now she fears that some of those men, freed in a Taliban-orchestrated mass jailbreak last summer, want revenge.
My life was already affected by the Taliban long before they took over Afghanistan this summer. I only started school at 14, because they were in power in the 90s and did not allow girls to study. Once I could go to school, I graduated and went to university. I was appointed as a prosecutor to work on cases of domestic violence and abuse more than four years ago. I was promoted this summer to be chief prosecutor in this area, but my new position only lasted seven days. Friends were in my office to congratulate me on the new job when the Taliban entered Kabul. I’ve always been under threat because my job was to investigate men who were abusing women. Those who were convicted blame me for putting them in jail, and because the Taliban released all prisoners across Afghanistan, they are now free and hunting for me to take revenge. I left my home and I’m currently in hiding, although I’m five months behind on rent for this house. Life is getting harder and harder. I live here with two of my brothers, two of my sisters and my parents – it’s only one room here with no kitchen. My sister cooks in one corner. I have no idea what to do now, I can’t plan for the future. I had considered finding a taxi and working as a driver but the Taliban will not allow me to do it. I’m living in a nightmare. Threat calls started on the very first night after the fall of Kabul. Criminals started calling me, saying: “Where will you go now? Your system has collapsed. We’ll find you. We’ll behead you.” And other very frightening threats. I don’t go out. I’m so depressed these days that I wish for death. I sent requests to several countries. I got no reply from the UK and I have so far received only a registration code from Germany, which I’m not hopeful about. I thought we had international support and the foreign governments would not abandon us, but my nightmares came true. *The name has been changed for this article.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/my-nightmares-came-true-ex-prosecutor-of-afghan-womens-abusers;politics

The Hammers were 1-0 down after 54 minutes and Cissoko, who was responsible for the tackle that led to Spurs’ penalty, was sent off two minutes later for a second yellow card. But West Ham managed to claw back a point in the dying moments through a Kate Longhurst header in the 92nd minute. The comeback highlights the team’s progression as last season they could well have sunk being a goal and a player down. But the resilience displayed in the second half shows how far they have come under Olli Harder and the potential they have for the future. Sarah Rendell
Stanway leading Manchester City charge Georgia Stanway was in full ‘new year, new me’ mode against Aston Villa with a goal in both the opening and latter stages to secure a 3-0 away win. Stanway’s first was the result of a swashbuckling run through Villa’s midfield, making use of space in front of her to roll in City’s opener in the fifth minute - she made multiple attempts of the move during the match, to varying degrees of success. Villa found it more and more difficult to keep her quiet and it all became too much for Carla Ward’s defence in the 75th minute when Stanway ghosted her way to the far post, tapping in her fifth goal in three games. It’s unarguable that she is in fantastic form, making light work of Villa’s back four. Continue in this vein and Stanway will cement her status as the player leading City back to their best. Maryam Naz Arsenal try to buy their way out of their crisis Arsenal may have seen their weekend game cancelled because of Covid cases and injuries in opponents Reading’s squad but they have still been busy. The crisis-hit Gunners have collected just one win in five games since the start of December. Last week’s 2-0 loss to relegation battling Birmingham was a particular shock to the system. All is not lost though, Jonas Eidevall’s side remains in all four competitions and sits atop of the WSL table. There will be hope that the arrival of highly-rated Sweden forward Stina Blackstenius from Häcken and the defender Laura Wienroither from Champions League group opponents Hoffenheim will help stop the rot. Perhaps most important, however, is the return of influential centre-back Leah Williamson, who has been out injured since November, and the announcement that she has signed a new contract. Suzanne Wrack Manchester United and Galton on the rise Manchester United are believed to have missed out on the chance to recruit Blackstenius much to the frustration of fans. Marc Skinner’s squad is thin and the club are yet to announce any incoming or outgoing players. Yet with four back-to-back wins for the first time this season the current crop are showing signs that they have clicked with the way Skinner wants them to play. Five goals against a Birmingham team that secured a first win of the season against previously unbeaten Arsenal in their previous game is not to be sniffed at. Forward Leah Galton’s stock continues to rise with an assist and two goals in six minutes and United could take the advantage over Tottenham in the race for the third Champions League place should they beat them this weekend.

Leicester off the bottom despite lack of goals The Foxes won by a single goal against Brighton at the King Power Stadium, courtesy of Shannon O’Brien’s 54th-minute winner. They now sit in 11th position, with a brief reprieve from the WSL basement spot - but for how long? It’s clear that the lack of goals has been a running theme this season and it could come back to ruffle up their tails. This is a Leicester team that have only netted six times in 11 games – only the 2019-20 Liverpool side had scored fewer at that stage, a despairingly low three. Leicester’s shots on target have also been on the drop under the reign of Lydia Bedford and against Brighton they only managed three. They have won two out of three now but may need to score more to keep Birmingham behind them. MN
Will Chelsea’s big break hamper title hopes? Chelsea’s match against Everton was called off because off Covid cases and injuries in the Toffees camp. The postponement means the defending champions have not played a competitive match since mid-December and the elongated break could hamper their performances. They are in a prime position to take top spot in the WSL after Arsenal’s loss of form but the Blues have to be clinical and cannot afford to drop any points. If in the first leauge game back, scheduled to be against Brighton on Sunday, they are a little shaky or the cohesion that makes Chelsea so successful is missing – their chances of claiming the title for a third successive season could go up in smoke. Maybe their Continental Cup quarter-final against West Ham on Wednesday will get them up and running again.

3086;3086;3086;3086;3119;3119;Legal group challenges information blackout on sewage discharges in England;2022-01-17;['Sandra Laville'];['Rivers', 'Waste', 'Environment Agency', 'Environment', 'Pollution', 'England', 'UK news'];A campaign group is challenging what it says is an information blackout imposed by the Environment Agency on its investigation into suspected illegal sewage dumping in England. The inquiry began after water companies admitted to the agency they may have been illegally discharging raw sewage from treatment works into rivers and streams. The investigation involves more than 2,000 water treatment works, nearly a third of the total in England, and is likely to involve most, if not all, water companies. Fish Legal has asked the agency in an environmental information request for details of the treatment works being investigated, the time period the inquiry is examining and whether the inquiry would mean that the agency’s already delayed responses to pollution incidents would be delayed further. But the agency has refused to release any details on the grounds that there would be adverse harm to its investigation, despite strong public interest in the case. Penny Gane, the head of legal practice at Fish Legal, said it was trying to ensure a veil of secrecy was not kept over the operation and the impact of storm overflows by water companies. Historically, EA investigations have taken years. Southern Water was fined £90m last year for dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into protected seas, after a seven-year investigation by the agency. Gane said imposing a blackout on information relating to sewage discharges would hamper campaign groups and the public, who had brought to light the systemic abuse of the permit conditions under which sewage treatment works have to operate in the first place. “The concern is that nothing is going to be shared now for years and people who have been looking at the harms caused by sewage discharges will be unable to continue their work because the agency is using a blanket application of the ‘course of justice’ exemptions under the environmental information regulations, which will continue for years,” Gane said. In its response to Fish Legal, the agency said it could not disclose the information because it would have an adverse effect on their ability to investigate under exemption 12(5)(b). The agency acknowledged “the factor of public interest” was strong and said it would seek to provide an update when appropriate that did not undermine the confidentiality of the investigatory process. Fish Legal is challenging the refusal to release information and has requested the agency review their decision. MPs on the environmental audit committee said in a report on Thursday they were alarmed at the extent of sewage discharges, large spills and misreporting by water companies. They also cited evidence from Prof Peter Hammond, who revealed that the scale of illegal sewage dumping from treatment plants could be far greater than the amount reported to the agency by water companies. Hammond’s information came from requests under the environmental information regulations to the EA and water firms. “It is just this kind of information which we fear will now not be released,” Gane said. The Environment Agency declined to comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/fish-legal-information-blackout-sewage-discharges-england-environment-agency-investigation;environment
3093;3093;3093;3093;3126;3126;Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action;2022-01-17;['Guardian sport'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Premier League', 'Manchester United', 'Aston Villa', 'Manchester City', 'Chelsea', 'Watford', 'Newcastle United', 'Norwich City', 'Everton', 'Brighton & Hove Albion', 'Crystal Palace', 'Southampton', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers', 'West Ham United', 'Leeds United'];"1) Pulisic pulls off a disappearing act Expectations were high when Chelsea’s executives shook hands on the £58m deal that brought the much sought-after signature of Christian Pulisic, the man who the club’s director, Marina Granovskaia, hoped would “become an important player for many years to come”. Three years and 95 Chelsea appearances later, the American is yet to match that description and has too rarely given the impression that he might ever do so. At Manchester City he was a non-presence, seeing little of the ball and doing nothing with it when he did. City are about as tough as opponents come but big money demands to be repaid on big occasions. Pulisic has the talent and temperament to deliver in such fixtures – his elegant goal against Liverpool this month was proof of that – but too often he seems content to exist on the periphery of matches rather than bend them to his will. At 23, time is on his side – though the Chelsea hierarchy are not exactly known for their patience. Alex Hess Match report: Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea
2) Martial flare-up the mark of a club without a plan The dispute between Ralf Rangnick and Anthony Martial is the latest unwanted vignette in a Manchester United season heading for the annus horribilis file. After Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Aston Villa the interim manager claimed the forward refused to be part of the squad for the trip. Martial’s response was to vehemently deny this on Instagram. If United’s position on Sunday – offering no clarification – was a clear backing of Rangnick’s words, the real issue here is how the contretemps shines more light on an institution seemingly on a one-way ticket to the wilderness unless someone sorts it, soon. As a mid-season Mr Fixit this is not Rangnick’s concern. It is Richard Arnold, Ed Woodward’s replacement as United’s highest-ranked executive from 1 February, who must have a forensic and wide-ranging plan. For a blueprint, the 50-year-old should study Manchester City, who under Khaldoon al-Mubarak’s intelligent chairmanship, are the industry leaders. United are coming up to a decade since their last title, and the question is starting to become: when will the next one ever arrive? Jamie Jackson News report: Martial denies refusing to be included in squad 3) Watford’s new signings hit the ground running If there’s one thing guaranteed to fill fans of a relegation-threatened club with dread, it’s a frenzied splurge of unheard-of January signings. From the outside looking in, then, Watford’s activity over the last fortnight – which has seen the recruitment of Maduka Okoye from Sparta Rotterdam, Hassane Kamara from Nice, Samir from Udinese and Edo Kayembe from KAS Eupen in Belgium – seemed to have all the hallmarks of a doomed trolley-dash. Yet any such notions were quickly shown up as parochial nonsense during a battling draw featuring three standout debutants. The dynamic Kamara slotted in smartly at left-back, while at centre-half the Brazilian Samir showed his nationality was no barrier to him enjoying a good old-fashioned tussle with Chris Wood, who he kept quiet. But the visitors’ best performer was Edo Kayembe, who patrolled the area in front of the back four with poise and authority, and showed a nice eye for a defence-splitting pass. João Pedro’s equaliser kept Newcastle in the bottom three, and Watford out of it. Will the same be said for Watford’s January arrivals come the season’s end? Alex Hess
4) Norwich triumph in old-school tactical battle There were a few memorable details from Norwich’s victory over Everton at Carrow Road, including the pitch invader who furiously flicked the ‘Vs’ at Rafael Benítez, and the 20-year-old Adam Idah beginning to confirm some of his promise with a first Premier League goal for the Canaries. But the match was also a curiosity in that it saw two teams pair up against each other in 4-4-2 formations. Once a shape so quintessentially English it was assumed players could not adapt to any other, 4-4-2 is now largely adjudged to be antiquated. Watching Salomón Rondón alongside Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the Toffees, that verdict seemed fair; two big men standing around waiting for crosses like a pair of forlorn hitchhikers. For Norwich, however, it was more fluid and seemed a considered solution from Dean Smith to both a lack of cutting edge and the need to protect his full-backs. By the time the match reached 55 minutes with the Canaries 2-0 up, Benítez abandoned his experiment, going 4-2-3-1 in a desperate search for salvation. Despite Richarlison’s excellent overhead kick, however, it never arrived. Paul MacInnes Match report: Norwich 2-1 Everton 5) Uninspired Toon give Howe little to work with Newcastle have played 10 games under Eddie Howe, winning one, drawing four and losing five. The latest, a damaging home draw with Watford, emphasised the manager’s need for not only at least one new centre-half but a defensive midfielder able to shape and control matches. With the £25m striker Chris Wood virtually anonymous on his debut, Newcastle needed a wonderful solo goal from Allan Saint-Maximin to go 1-0 up but their longstanding inability to retain a lead soon resurfaced, permitting João Pedro to register an 88th-minute equaliser. It was a gut-punch for the St James’s Park crowd, though Howe may draw some consolation from the returning Paul Dummett’s intelligent marking of Emmanuel Dennis. Louise Taylor • Match report: Newcastle 1-1 Watford 6) Gallagher’s star continues to rise Conor Gallagher may have laughed off the comparisons to Frank Lampard but the loanee’s performances for Crystal Palace this season have been reminiscent of his parent club’s record goalscorer. Gallagher’s excellent strike against Brighton to cap off a brilliant team move means that he now has seven goals and three assists since moving to Selhurst Park on loan, but he insists his focus remains on this season. “Let’s be serious, I can’t be compared to someone like that,” he said. “Chelsea is one of the best teams in the world right now, it is a tough team to get into. I’m not really thinking about that at the moment, I’ll try and do my best for Crystal Palace. The way football is goals and assists gets you praise like I have been getting. I need to continue to perform, not just goals and assists. But I am happy with the way it is going so far.” Ed Aarons Match report: Brighton 1-1 Crystal Palace 7) A new home-grown hero at Villa Park The glamorous debutant who struck a late equaliser understandably took all the headlines at Villa Park, but there’s a fair argument that Philippe Coutinho was only his side’s third most impressive midfielder on Saturday. Emi Buendía, whose place looks most obviously threatened by the Brazilian’s arrival, put in a probingly creative display and showed enough flashes of link-up play with Coutinho to suggest that the two playmakers needn’t be competing for one position. But Villa’s star performer was Jacob Ramsey, who scored one and set up the other in a riveting all-action central midfield performance that would have had the manager furrowing his brow in approval. Ramsey has already started more games since Steven Gerrard took charge in November than he did over the whole of last season, and the early signs are that the new boss’s judgment is spot on. After losing the beloved Jack Grealish last summer, have Villa found a new local hero? If so, then he’s already got the perfect mentor. Alex Hess Match report: Aston Villa 2-2 Manchester United
8) Ward-Prowse hot of the tail of his idol The ball zoomed into the top corner like a tungsten dart but, as Ralph Hasenhüttl said, James Ward-Prowse’s preposterous free-kick from 30 yards out deserved to finish as more than a footnote to a frustrating defeat at Wolves. Last week the Brentford head coach, Thomas Frank, suggested Ward-Prowse could be the best free-kick taker on the planet and only David Beckham can better Ward-Prowse’s tally of 12 free-kick goals in the Premier League. His latest strike was surely his best yet, not that he basked in it for too long: the second the ball cannoned into the net, Ward-Prowse headed back towards the Southampton half, ready for the restart with six minutes left to play. “If there’s a stipulation that I have to beat his record in order to meet him [Beckham] then I’ll be looking to do that as soon as I can,” Ward-Prowse said last year. “He’s an absolute legend, a great of the game, a huge role model and inspiration for me even now, and I’m 27.” Ben Fisher • Match report: Wolves 3-1 Southampton
9) Relentless Raphinha is the jewel in Bielsa’s crown The London Stadium offered the latest proof that in Raphinha, Leeds have one of the best in the Premier League. Jack Harrison scored a hat-trick but it was the Brazilian’s passing and verve that cut West Ham’s defence to ribbons. Leeds had a fourth goal ruled out when an offside Rodrigo failed to get out of the way of Mateusz Klich’s shot, the ball having been laid on a plate by Raphinha after he had left Issa Diop with twisted blood. “We still have half a season left,” shrugged Marcelo Bielsa when asked where Raphinha’s future lies. A bidding war in the summer is certain for a player whose class is matched with a work ethic equal to any of Bielsa’s squad. Leeds, riven by injuries, were reduced to bringing on two Premier League debutants, Lewis Bate lasting just 43 minutes, but their star man inspired them to thrilling victory. John Brewin Match report: West Ham 2-3 Leeds 10) Liverpool clear first hurdle of Afcon month January has been long marked out as a danger-month for Liverpool because of the loss of two of the team’s much-lauded front three to the Africa Cup of Nations. To an extent, rightly so: Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané have averaged 52 goals between them in their four full seasons together. But it is also true that this campaign has probably been Mané’s patchiest in a red shirt, and a return of one goal in his last 10 outings means that his absence may not warrant the gloomy prognosis many have offered. It may even be a good thing: Sunday’s win featured goals from two of his ostensible competitors for a place in the team, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Takumi Minamino, while Mané himself has already found the net on international duty. Win-win? Perhaps – although a quick glance at Jürgen Klopp’s substitutes on Sunday (average squad number: 37) suggests that Liverpool might not want their big guns missing for too long.

3123;3123;3123;3123;3158;3158;‘It took four men and a fire extinguisher to get the tiger off him’: the tragedy of Vegas magicians Siegfried and Roy;2022-01-17;['Alexi Duggins'];['Podcasts', 'Magic', 'Culture', 'Stage', 'Wildlife', 'Animals', 'World news', 'US news', 'Las Vegas'];"Where do you start with a story that involves counter-terrorism police doing background checks on a tiger, has its roots in the mental health problems of Nazi soldiers, and features an investigation into whether a beehive hairdo can be used as a weapon? What’s more, weaving in and out of all of this, there are two German magicians in mullets and shiny suits seemingly capable of floating around in the air, one of whom nearly dies on stage after a white tiger bites clean through his neck. This was the problem facing Emmy-winning film-maker Steven Leckart, who had long felt that the extraordinary story of Siegfried and Roy, whose performances with exotic animals electrified Las Vegas, deserved a proper telling. The result is Wild Things, an eight-part podcast detailing how Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn rose to international stardom with a whole zoo’s worth of performing jungle cats, then had their live career effectively ended when a tiger called Montecore attacked Roy on stage, nearly killing him. “As a child of the 80s,” says Leckart, speaking via Zoom from his Los Angeles home, “Siegfried and Roy have always loomed large for me. And no one has ever properly examined their story – or the attack – in depth.” To do so was a mighty undertaking: over the course of 50 years, Siegfried and Roy performed 30,000 shows to 50 million people, generating over $1bn in ticket sales. Their act fused gigantic, mind-boggling illusions with the most exotic animals on earth, sparking an explosion in families coming to Vegas shows, at a time when bills were dominated by topless showgirls.
The duo suspended tigers above crowds on flaming disco balls and made elephants vanish into thin air. After their shows, they would hang out with their jungle cats in their suite at the Mirage hotel, before returning to their $10m Moroccan-style villa the Jungle Palace, or their 100-acre residence Little Bavaria, where German marching music played through concealed speakers. Their celebrity acquaintances included Michael Jackson (who wrote them a theme song), David Lee Roth (who gifted them goats) and Pope John Paul II (who gave them a fragment of Saint Francis of Assisi’s shinbone). In 1998, the then US President Bill Clinton joined them after a show, his secret service sharpshooters training their weapons on the tigers. A Saturday Night Live spoof had them introducing a special Night of a Thousand Tigers. “They were hyperbole manifested,” says Leckart. “Everything about them was bigger, was louder, was dialled up to 11, which is a deliberate Spinal Tap reference. But what kept them going for so many years was their incredible skill and the way they progressed their show.” Wild Things takes listeners through this journey, which has surprisingly sad origins in Germany. Both Siegfried and Roy’s fathers were violent, rage-filled alcoholics, scarred by years of fighting as Nazi soldiers. Roy’s lifelong love of animals started when he adopted a stray dog that protected him and his mother from his father’s fists. Siegfried sought refuge in magic, teaching himself tricks from books after watching an entertainer swallow razor blades in a town square.
The budding illusionists met as teenagers on a German cruise ship, where Roy worked as a bellboy after fleeing his family and Siegfried was a steward with a magic show in the evening. Unimpressed by the spectacle of rabbits being disappeared from hats, Roy decided to scale things up and get him a cheetah instead, so smuggled one out of a zoo. It marked the start of their signature fusion of magic and jungle cats. Legend has it that a furious captain kicked them off the ship, but Leckart tells a different story: “I heard that the captain was really mad about it, but the crowd loved it so much that he let them carry on.” In 1966, the duo’s big break came when Grace Kelly (AKA Princess Grace of Monaco) invited them to perform at her annual Red Cross gala in Monte Carlo. Their cheetah, Chico, fled through a celebrity-packed crowd, straight past Kelly and into the kitchens. When Siegfried nonchalantly jumped off the stage, the crowd assumed it was all part of the act. A standing ovation and newspaper headlines followed. Within a few years, they were regular performers in Vegas, before bagging a headline slot with the city’s first full-length magic show. Eventually, a rival hotel would poach them in a flamboyant stunt in which they were helicoptered in to sign a $57m contract. Their new venue had 1,500 seats and it sold out, twice a night, for a decade.
Listening to Wild Things – its first two episodes have just dropped – you do wonder: “Isn’t some of this cruel to animals?” We hear lively stories about the magicians removing baby tigers from their mother. A supposedly humorous anecdote involves a panther bursting a waterbed after it’s locked in a bedroom during a party, while a pacy anecdote about two tigers being stolen does rather skip over the fact that they had been left outside a deli locked in the back of a truck. This can’t all be OK, can it? “We do go – in depth – into the question of animal welfare and safety in a subsequent episode,” says Leckart. “What we uncover is not just shocking, but really disturbing.” Initially, though, Wild Things concerns itself with the 2003 tiger attack. By the time it happened, Siegfried and Roy had been performing alongside exotic animals for 44 years, repeating the same show every night for an entire decade. It was so routine that – as the cast left Roy on stage to deliver a spotlit monologue to seven-year-old white tiger Montecore – they knew every word and gesture that was coming. Or so they thought. Montecore bites Roy through the neck, slicing his vertebrae and severing an artery that cuts off the blood to the right side of his brain. He drags Roy about, coating the stage in so much blood that one onlooker says: “I’m thinking to myself, ‘He’s gone. He’s not going to make it, man.’ This was fucking hell on earth.” Another shocked voice says: “It took four men and a fire extinguisher to get the tiger off him.” In the ambulance, Roy manages to gasp: “Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore.” Soon he is flatlining in hospital and the Mirage car park is filling up with praying, weeping fans. Police enter the hotel to find drinks abandoned on tables and a stage still slicked with blood. So intense is the media spotlight that the police decide to use officers normally assigned to counter-terrorist cases. The question is: was the tiger attack a crime? And this is where the podcast, which had been compelling enough, really shifts into another gear. It would be unfair to give away its many surprises but (spoiler alert) Leckart’s team discover that the investigation entered truly bizarre territory, including animal activists, homophobes in the crowd, ultrasonic devices and a woman near the stage with a large beehive hairdo. Montecore’s background is probed, too.
“This is why we called the podcast Wild Things,” says Leckart. “We would just find new and wild bits of information at every turn. What’s even more bizarre is the separate investigation into animal cruelty by the USDA. The twists and turns of where that goes is bananas.” Roy was left partially paralysed on the left side of his body. He claimed that Montecore didn’t actually attack him, insisting that he had suffered a stroke and the tiger was trying to take him to safety. He continued to live with Montecore until the jungle cat’s death in 2014. To this day, there has been no widely accepted explanation of the incident, which led to the Mirage closing the show. Leckart, however, thinks he’s succeeded where the counter-terrorism detectives failed. “We absolutely solve the question of what happened with the attack,” he says. “We come to a very clear conclusion. My view on the cause changed throughout the making of the series. But you will not leave the podcast without forming an opinion on what happened.” Roy died of Covid in May 2020 at the age of 75. Siegfried succumbed to pancreatic cancer the following January. He was 81. Both had retired from showbusiness a decade earlier. Siegfried and Roy were the highest paid magicians Vegas had ever had and a statue to them now stands outside the Mirage.

First Gemini, the twins; then Cancer, the crab; and finally Leo, the lion. The chart shows the view at 2100 GMT on 17 January, looking east-south-east from London. The moon will be full and sitting just below the two brightest stars of Gemini: Castor and Pollux. The brighter of the two, and the star nearest to the moon, is the yellow-tinged Pollux, while the one above is the whiter but dimmer Castor. A day later, the moon will be smack in the middle of Cancer. Although with 99% of the moon’s visible surface still illuminated, it could be difficult to see the faint stars of the constellation. But the moon does make a straight line with two other bright stars. These are Procyon in Canis Minor, the lesser dog, and Sirius in Canis Major, the great dog. By Wednesday, the moon will be in Leo, poised between the orange-tinged glow of Algieba, and the brighter white light of Regulus. The view can also be seen from the southern hemisphere.

3135;3135;3135;3135;3170;3170;Lego sued over leather jacket worn by toy Antoni in Queer Eye set;2022-01-17;['Sian Cain'];['Queer Eye', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Netflix', 'Lego', 'Toys'];"An artist has accused Lego of recreating a leather jacket he made for Queer Eye cast-member Antoni Porowski without the artist’s permission, claiming that a toy jacket included in a Lego set based on the Netflix show is a “blatant copy” of his design. James Concannon, whose clothes have been regularly worn by Porowski on the popular program, filed a lawsuit against the Danish toy giant in a Connecticut district court last month. The designer, who is seeking damages, alleges that one of the outfits included in the set for Porowski’s figurine copies “the unique placement, coordination, and arrangement of the individual artistic elements” on the jacket.
In the lawsuit, Concannon alleges that Netflix had consistently asked him for his consent to show his clothes in Queer Eye episodes since 2017, which he gave. Porowski and Concannon later became friends, with Porowski sending Concannon the jacket to create a custom design for him in 2018. The following year, Porowski wore the jacket in an episode in the show’s fourth season. Concannon alleges that Netflix never sought his permission to feature the jacket on the show, but believed it was an oversight.
The lawsuit states that Concannon contacted Lego after seeing the toy jacket in the set, which went on sale last year. He claims that a customer service representative offered him the set, which is based on the show’s loft and retails at US$99.99, for his six-year-old son as a form of compensation. However, another company representative later told him that the company did not give away its products for free. Concannon alleges that when his attorney contacted the company, Lego’s lawyers admitted that it had intentionally copied his design but rejected his attempt to send a cease-and-desist, arguing that Concannon’s decision to give the jacket to Porowski meant that Netflix had an “implied license” to do what it wanted with the design, including allowing Lego to recreate it.

3144;3144;3144;3144;3179;3179;Saving Britney review – a Spears superfan breaks the ice;2022-01-17;['Anya Ryan'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Britney Spears', 'Music'];"Oops she did it again. Britney mania has got another millennial teenager obsessed. Still, Jean is a superfan with a difference. With 172 similarities to the popstar, and the ability to understand the coded messages hidden within her songs before anyone else, Jean is convinced she is the only person who can save Britney. Inspired by the New York Times documentary and the #FreeBritney movement, Saving Britney details the life of the celebrity from her early days in the Mickey Mouse Club to the present day by Shereen Roushbaiani who speaks as an American narrator into a plastic yellow toy microphone. Intersected with long monologue sections from Jean (also played by Roushbaiani), listing reasons why her life has been devoted to the singer, it gives an intricate insight into the mind of an engrossed enthusiast. But while the subject matter feels topical, the solo drama fails to keep us engaged. Roushbaiani plays the ADHD-diagnosed Jean with youthful confidence. Her 90s childhood bedroom has been transformed into a shrine to Britney. Decorated with a homemade collage dedicated to her on the back wall, it is clear that the star has been present for many of her defining life moments. During her sexual awakening with a female classmate, Britney’s famed kiss with Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards played on the TV. It was Britney who was there for Jean after her mum died. They even share a birthday – despite it being eight years apart.
But though Roushbaiani is full of energy, after 70 minutes watching her alone on stage, her performance becomes grating. Written by David Shopland, many of the lines are cringeworthy rather than naturalistic, and while she tries hard to get the audience laughing, most of her self-deprecating jokes fall flat. The crescendo is Jean’s realisation that, even with such an intense love for Britney, she also might be part of the problem that caused her collapse. But with her whole life fixation falling apart so quickly, this conclusion feels hurried. Britney is an idol to so many, but in this case Jean’s worshipping doesn’t quite land.

3151;3151;3151;3151;3186;3186;Sue Perkins’ Big American Road Trip review – a joyful insight into poky caravans;2022-01-16;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Travel TV', 'US news'];Am I alone in meeting news of a solo project by Sue Perkins with delight tempered by anxiety? Delight because I find her a very companionable companion on whatever televisual journey we are about to undertake together – warm, witty, and perceptive without ever veering into condescension or cynicism. And anxiety in case this means that she and Mel Giedroyc have fallen out. As a pair they were closing in on national treasure status during the Bake Off years and the sight of such enduring friendship – the powerful suggestion that once off camera, these two women now in their early 50s, could still enjoy being absolute idiots together – was, and remains important to me. So this is the new outing for what I shall – unless otherwise informed by eight independent sources – cleave to thinking of as the latter half of emotionally inviolate duo Mel and Sue. This time Sue is travelling across California and Colorado as the presenter of Sue Perkins’ Big American Road Trip (Channel 4), setting off from just outside San Francisco in a fairly basic one-person caravan to experience the great outdoors (the girl from Croydon is rightly awed by the sheer size and spectacle on offer along the Pacific Coast Highway) and to talk to people along the way who have, through choice or necessity, taken up #vanlife. It is mainly those who have taken up the nomadic life by choice who are responsible for the hashtag. Instagram is full of curated grids of (mostly) twentysomethings who have opted out of the rat race and headed out on to the open road and all the opportunities for personal growth and filtered sunset shots it offers. Perkins, fortunately/carefully/generously (delete according to taste and your own weary cynicism levels), finds representatives of the least performative strand of the movement to interview. First come sweet young couple Blix and Bess, who are such wholesome Americans that it is charming to watch them try to work out what to do in the face of a riff by Sue about pubic hair in communal showers. “We’ve gone down a conversational cul-de-sac of my own making,” says Sue, when she realises. The pair are disarmingly honest about their desire to see all the touristy places that they would never have been able to afford to visit in a traditional manner, but also insightful about the more intangible benefits itinerant life has brought. Blix noticed how long it took to relax into the fact that people were just being friendly, often trying to share knowledge and experiences with newcomers – “and I was the jerk rejecting their energy”. Near Yosemite, Sue meets Alexandria, who has garnered 300,000 online followers during her seven years of van living. She shows Sue how best to dig a poo hole. “It’s so small,” says Sue. “Which means I have supplementary questions.” The last third of the programme is dedicated to older campers, who tend to be those who began living a version of #vanlife because circumstances required it. The mood among the community that has cohered around Bob Wells, made famous by his appearance in the Frances McDormand film Nomadland, is quiet, careful and tinged with sadness. Sue doesn’t press them on their individual reasons for coming to this life but it is evident – particularly among the women – that the past casts long shadows and that to live without trappings is not always to be wholly free. The programme is a standard gentle travelogue format done well. A presenter who manages to be irreverent without being disrespectful, who can engage at the right level with any interviewee and ad-lib jokes whenever things might otherwise flag, is always a joy. A willingness to improvise a burlesque routine (alongside Bess, who is a dancer) as “Perry Menopause” is also to be commended. As a fellow south-east Londoner also with “a pelvic floor like wet plasterboard” I can only salute La Perkins and wish her well on her way through Colorado next week, which is – in all but the strictly geographical sense – just about the furthest place from Catford or Croydon there is.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/16/sue-perkins-big-american-road-trip-review-a-joyful-insight-into-poky-caravans;entertainment and culture

3189;3189;3189;3189;3225;3225;One hundred doctors locked out of Western Australia weeks before state reopens;2022-01-16;['Eleanor de Jong'];['Western Australia', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Australia news'];"One hundred doctors, including specialists, consultants and locums for remote areas, are locked out of Western Australia, with Mark McGowan’s government refusing G2G passes despite the entry of Covid-19 being mere weeks away. Since the spread of the Omicron variant in late 2021, the WA government has progressively shuttered entry from anyone entering from the eastern states, making it now close to impossible for anyone to enter WA, diplomats and state officials aside. As the reopening deadline of 5 February approaches, shutout doctors – who already have jobs and work contracts in the state but can’t get a G2G pass to enter – are warning the health system needs adequate time to prepare for the influx of Covid-19, and the state government should now grant all doctors a G2G pass as a matter of urgency. Heather* is a senior doctor who is in training to be a specialist and has had her application to enter WA refused three times in recent weeks. Her hospital job is expecting her to begin work in late January.
“I am a specialist-trainee – but there are also anaesthetists and consultants that are getting rejected and that’s extremely concerning,” said Heather, speaking to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity. “What I think is upsetting is these rejections are happening to the really essential doctors – people who are due at community clinics or in remote regions where their skills are absolutely critical.” With mortgage repayments to make and no clear outline for when entry will be granted, Heather is now looking at applying for locum roles in other states. “The state needs to decide should all doctors be allowed in as a group, or should we cherry-pick the specialists we need most – ICU, anaesthetists – and give them priority, with the rest having to wait,” Heather said. “The reality is every state is under a lot of health pressure, so it’s not a realistic excuse from WA to say the vulnerable communities need special protection. I am sorry but there are vulnerable communities in many other parts of Australia. The main difference with WA’s vulnerable communities is there is a much greater distance between Perth and the Kimberley, say.” According to a group chat viewed by the Guardian, around 100 doctors are in a similar position to Heather. All of them have jobs lined up, or are returning to senior roles they have held in critical and specialist areas for years. “In a [health] system that’s already understaffed makes perfect sense that we’re all having such trouble getting in …” wrote one doctor. “Especially with the border opening only a month away, the mind boggles.” “Yes, staffing at a crisis point without Covid,” wrote another. “I fear total collapse of the system when Covid arrives.” In a statement, McGowan’s office said the Office of the Chief Health Officer had received, processed and approved more than 130 applications for entry from health officials in January 2022. Mark Duncan-Smith, the WA president of the Australian Medical Association, said many doctors were gaining entry but the process was complex. “It’s a problem of process, not exclusions,” said Duncan-Smith, who said the AMA had assisted several doctors who had difficulties obtaining G2G passes, despite having employment contracts and letters of support. “They’re not being excluded, the problem is not in the approvals, these excluded people are having problems navigating the system. Should the system be simpler? Yes.” Western Australia’s opposition leader, Mia Davies, said it was “extremely concerning” that doctors who want to come home to WA “to work in our understaffed health system are not being granted exemptions”. “Immediate attention should be given to allowing these vital health workers to come into WA safely, as they will be key in bolstering WA’s hospital and medical workforce ahead of February 5,” she said.
“I’m sure a majority of West Australians would like to see common sense applied to safely bring these essential medical workers into the state to support us through this next stage of Covid.” Libby Mettam, an MP and deputy leader of the WA Liberal party, said any doctors facing difficulties entering at a time of critical health need for WA was “completely unacceptable”. “It is completely unacceptable that health workers, including doctors, are being locked out of WA when they could be assisting our under-resourced health system ahead of the border opening in less than a month’s time,” Mettam said. “Given WA’s health worker shortage and the inevitable influx of Covid in the community in less than a month’s time, the McGowan government should be doing everything to ensure these health workers can work here, which includes health worker exemptions.” WA is scheduled to open to Australia – and the world – at midnight on 5 February. The McGowan government announced the reopening date in December when the state’s double-dose vaccination rate hit 80%. However, in parts of the Kimberley and Pilbara the vaccination rate remains much lower, with some remote Indigenous communities not yet hitting 50%.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/one-hundred-doctors-locked-out-of-western-australia-weeks-before-state-reopens;health
3193;3193;3193;3193;3229;3229;Loos with views and porcelain thrones: what’s Australia’s best public toilet? – open thread;2022-01-16;['Rafqa Touma'];['Travel', 'Culture', 'Australia news', 'Cities', 'Life and style'];"In a small town in South Australia, the exterior walls of a public restroom are wrapped in vivid landscapes hand-painted on to tile. In the centre, a windmill stands tall above a river that spills into rolling, rust-coloured paddocks. Beside it, a bird nests atop a sign reading “Carrieton”. “It is a mural depicting the history of the town,” travel blogger Marion Halliday says. “You look at it and go, oh my God, that’s amazing. “Then you realise it is the wall of a toilet.”
Halliday, who is known online as Red Nomad, has spent almost 30 years travelling around Australia; her book Aussie Loos with Views documents the rest-stops. “Sometimes you just need the loo. You stumble across these quirky places in the outback where you think, there shouldn’t be a loo here, but there is. And it looks bizarre!”
The federal health department’s National Public Toilet Map displays the location of more than 19,000 public bathroom facilities across the country – a true gift in this pandemic, as Australians make plans to spend more time outdoors. Approved in 2000, the map came about “at a time when getting information on where there are toilets was almost impossible,” says Michael Radford, who worked on the map. “The longevity of the project is an indicator of how valuable it is.” With each bathroom location, information is included on accessibility features including baby care, sharps disposal and showers. As “standards for accessibility change,” so does the map, Radford explains. “Some toilets become too antiquated. Toilets might have a ramp, but doorways to the toilet are too narrow for motorised access.” So what makes a great public loo? A toilet so pretty you took photos? A room with a view? One you stumbled upon just in time? “No one has ever identified the most scenic toilet ever,” Halliday says. “But there’s certainly a few contenders.” One might be at Kata Tjuta, a group of rock formations in the Northern Territory. “There was an area where you can park, picnic, walk around and visit the toilet,” Halliday recalls. “I came out of the loo, and suddenly there are these beautiful red rock domes, a blue sky and outback greenery. I thought, this has got to be one of the most scenic views from a toilet ever.”
In Point Quobba, Western Australia, a narrow structure “you can only describe as a dunny” sits alone on a vast, sandy plane near the ocean. “It is a raised up toilet in this little wooden structure that faces out over some of the wildest seas I’ve ever seen,” Halliday says. “If you left the door open, which you’re probably not going to, you would be able to see a spectacularly wild part of the Australian coast from the toilet.” For Halliday, all a toilet needs to be memorable are the basics. “It has got to be clean,” she says. “And there has got to be toilet paper.”
But she says “it doesn’t necessarily have to be a flushing toilet”, explaining that water conservation efforts in rural Australia sometimes rely on composting toilets that “do the job”. Others might be in it for the architecture and design. In 2019, a public bathroom in western Sydney took out the Total Facilities annual Australia’s best bathroom competition. The luxe bathroom at the Westpoint shopping centre in Blacktown boasts warm wood and clean marble finishes, suspended greenery, unintrusive hand dryers and mosaic art that pays homage to the area’s history. Beyond the aesthetics, it has been heralded for its inviting parents’ room and dedicated space for people with carers.
Another beloved restroom in New South Wales sits on Rawson Pass near the peak of Mount Kosciuszko – the highest public toilet in Australia. Halliday describes the bathroom facility as “dug into the side of a mountain like a bunker”. On a Sydney beach, North Bondi Amenities is a popular modern outdoor toilet block bathed in natural light from skylights, with cascading greenery from succulents growing on the roof. Designed by Sam Crawford Architects in 2016, the concrete and terrazzo-tiled space elegantly suits the needs of a barefoot beachgoer needing to change into swimmers, take a toilet break or wait for the next bus in the shade. And in Wycliffe Well, a “quirky little roadhouse” between the NT’s Darwin and Alice Springs “claims to be the place with the most UFO sightings in Australia,” Halliday says.
Each building at the roadhouse caravan park and campground is painted with murals of extraterrestrial activity. Halliday calls this “the alien pit stop”. With celestial splashes of purple and blue paint, humanoid silhouettes and “Maliens / Femalians” bathroom signage, Halliday says “the toilets are specifically built for them”.

3195;3195;3195;3195;3231;3231;‘Like a lockdown’: in 2022, Australians are still feeling the fear and anxiety of Covid;2022-01-16;['Calla Wahlquist'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Infectious diseases', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"Ashleigh Cooper has spent the new year indoors. Around her, in the suburbs of Melbourne, Covid cases are soaring. It’s a story repeated in every Australian state, except Western Australia. Australia recorded more cases in the first two weeks of 2022 than in the previous two years combined. For most, the threat posed by Covid has eased – 92.4% of Australians over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated, and 18% have also had a booster shot. And the Omicron variant, which has ripped through the country since December, appears to result in a less severe illness, in most cases, than previous variants of Covid-19. Public health orders enforced by strict and punitive laws have been replaced by a mantra of personal responsibility. It is up to individuals to determine and manage their own risk. For the most vulnerable people, the only way to manage this risk is to retreat.
Cooper is disabled and immunocompromised. She went into self-isolation two weeks ago. “For me the risk is too high,” she says. “It is very strange to watch the rest of the world say ‘we will go out and it will be fine and we will get sick and it will be fine’. I would not be fine – I had my booster shot last week and was severely unwell for five days. I do not want to get Covid.” Guardian Australia spoke to more than 40 people about how they were feeling at the start of the third year of the pandemic. Many like Cooper have gone into self-isolation to protect themselves or a vulnerable loved one. Many others say they have chosen to go back into something resembling lockdown until their children can be vaccinated or until the outbreak peaks. Cooper says she felt significantly safer when Melbourne was in lockdown and finds the argument that people should “get over” their concern about a global pandemic “incredibly invalidating”. “We should absolutely acknowledge that [lockdown] was bad and a lot of people suffered, but a lot of people are also alive now because of it,” she says. “I know that I was safer.”
Also invalidating is the implication, from some public health messaging and public responses to death announcements, that a disease is less devastating if most of its victims are people who have pre-existing conditions. “Almost everyone has a pre-existing condition,” Cooper says. “What’s the price that we are willing to pay in order for people to be able to go and have brunch? “Are you willing to justify risking the health of vulnerable people for that privilege?” ‘Utter confusion about what we should be doing’ Most people who spoke to Guardian Australia are still recovering from the impact of long lockdowns and do not want a return to restrictions. They just want an indication from governments both state and federal that they will be supported and able to easily access tests and healthcare as the outbreak, and any new variants to come, rolls on. Martin Radzaj says he has found the start of 2022 to be the most difficult time in the pandemic because of the “utter confusion about what we should be doing”. He also feels the loss of the sense of collective action which, for some, underscored the long lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. “The thought of lockdown again is what is giving me a lot of anxiety and a lot of dread … it scares me,” says Melbourne man James Burke. Two years of mostly home schooling has given his youngest child, who started kindergarten in 2020, social anxiety, and his older child had a panic attack at the prospect of returning to face-to-face learning. “We paid the price [of lockdown], we bought the government time to build capacity in our health services. And they lost control in just two weeks.” The anxiety of past outbreaks has been replaced with anger at state and federal governments, and a growing sense of despair that the pandemic will not end, at least not any time soon. Hannah*, a vision-impaired support worker in Melbourne, says the 2021 lockdowns left her feeling “emptied out”. “I felt like half a person,” she says.
Like many who spoke to Guardian Australia, she focused on the vaccine rollout – when everyone who was eligible was double-vaccinated it would be OK. Then Omicron happened, the inevitable consequence of a lack of global vaccine equity, and the promise of a return to normal life has been pushed back once more. “It now feels as though it is going to define parts of my life trajectory where I was hoping it wouldn’t,” she says. “Two years [living in a pandemic] is very different to five years when you only get three good months every year.” Northcote woman Phoebe* is also feeling a sense of arrested development. The public servant, 25, contracted Covid along with 16 others at a house party late last month. She still can’t smell or taste anything and several of her friends remain unwell. “Some people are going to get chronic illness from that, and we are in our 20s,” she says. “Every single one of us was double-vaccinated as soon as we were eligible but we are not eligible yet for a booster. It just feels like there’s no plan and younger people are bearing the brunt of it.”
Phoebe says her social circle has split in two: those who have had Covid and are now feeling invulnerable for 30 days – despite warnings that earlier reinfection is possible – and those who are curbing social activities to try to avoid it. ‘Have we given up?’ Thomas Barbera says his friend groups have done the same, and it has caused some uncomfortable conversations. “People do not want to feel that you are judging them or saying that what they are doing is unsafe – and it is not inherently unsafe, they just have different risk tolerance and different priorities than you,” he says. Barbera says he is still struggling to come to terms with a health policy that expects and accepts that hundreds of thousands of Australians will get Covid, after two years where a handful of cases would send the city into lockdown. “Two years of having ‘get a test’ drummed into you and then suddenly people are told not to get a test unless they fit certain criteria … I found that really hard,” he says. “It felt like, have we given up?” His store of rapid antigen tests, bought in early December, has been slowly dwindling as he hands them out to friends who have been identified as close contacts. Almost everyone who spoke to Guardian Australia said they would feel more comfortable moving around if they had access to free, readily available rapid antigen tests. Australian government frontbencher Simon Birmingham told the ABC on Friday that demand for testing, from both PCR and rapid tests, had been “far in excess of what has been modelled in Australia and all around the world”. The Australian government has since ordered $62m worth of rapid antigen tests.
Kylie*, a midwife working in Melbourne hospitals, says despite difficulties with testing and high case numbers there is cause to be optimistic. “There are more women with the virus who are having babies, but unlike 2021 they are not gasping for breath,” she says. “In the past fortnight none of my patients have gone to ICU. So for me, right now, I am seeing the light.” Milly*, a young woman from Melbourne, says that two years of going in and out of lockdown has caused a downshift in her lifestyle that feels akin to being retired. “I have adjusted to living a more sheltered life and enjoy being in my house, running the same route, cycling the same loop, doing the Wordle, going to bed on time,” she says. “‘[The] big difference is I have no energy for or interest in working, just want to read books and chill. Took a while for the anxiety to die down to get to this point but now I don’t want to do anything else.”
Richard Chigwin is experiencing his third summer without customers. He owns a series of ecotourism huts in the New South Wales Blue Mountains and lost the 2020 summer holidays to bushfires and 2021 to coronavirus. 2022 was supposed to be different, but “It feels exactly like there is a lockdown. You are not even fielding inquiries – it’s school holidays in January, that’s not right.” As a sole trader, Chigwin wasn’t eligible for government support in earlier rounds. Other business owners say they are finding this summer more difficult than previous seasons because there was no financial aid available. A Victorian-based consultant told Guardian Australia they were still receiving commercial rent relief until this week. Now that has ended too. “Like everyone else, we just have to muddle through on our own.” Lydia Napoli also works in hospitality in NSW. “It’s a nightmare,” she says. “My husband is working overtime, heaps of chefs and [front-of-house staff are] unwell or close contacts, and there is no support. I’m double vaxxed and feeling like, what was the point? There’s still high chances of new variants. It’s all just exhausting.” Karen McVean, a Melbourne-based remedial massage therapist, has chosen a different approach. “As the Covid years continue we are losing our magical thinking it will go away and not be a changing burden to our life,” she says. “Personally, I feel better with accepting that Covid is an ongoing issue. How can I best get on with living my best life?”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/like-a-lockdown-in-2022-australians-are-still-feeling-the-fear-and-anxiety-of-covid;health
3215;3215;3215;3215;3251;3251;Where is Kazakhstan’s former longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev?;2022-01-16;['Shaun Walker'];['Nursultan Nazarbayev', 'Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"It is a question being asked with increasing urgency by intelligence services, multinational companies and most citizens of Kazakhstan: where is Nursultan Nazarbayev? Kazakhstan’s leader from 1991 until 2019, Nazarbayev has long been the arbiter of all business and political decisions in the central Asian nation, and the purveyor of an all-encompassing personality cult. In 2019, he handpicked a successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, while retaining power behind the scenes. The capital city, along with its airport and main university were all renamed after him. But since the worst unrest since independence broke out earlier this month, Nazarbayev has been silent and absent from public view. Official figures say 225 people died in the unrest and subsequent crackdown. Meanwhile, the man who personified Kazakhstan for so long has simply disappeared. Some said he was hiding out on the shores of Lake Geneva. Others suspected he had fled to Dubai. A few whispered conspiratorially that he may be dead. In fact, according to a number of sources, he remains in Kazakhstan, probably in the capital, Nur-Sultan, the city that bears his name. “My best information as of today is that Nazarbayev is alive, and furious negotiations are under way with Tokayev about the redistribution of assets, spoils and rents,” said a former western government official who is well connected in Kazakhstan. Tokayev, once a loyalist, has used the crackdown to strip power from his former benefactor and members of Nazarbayev’s family, some of whom are accused of using the protest mood in the country to unseat Tokayev and seize power. “The power struggle continues. There is no guarantee things will end smoothly,” the former western official said.
One source, claiming direct knowledge, insisted Nazarbayev is in China, but Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, a former minister and Nazarbayev adviser, said he believed his former boss was still in ~Kazakhstan. “Negotiations are ongoing, but it is clear the Nazarbayev era is over,” said Yertysbayev, adding that he blamed the recent violence on “reactionary and conservative forces from the Nazarbayev clan”. While Tokayev has not criticised the former leader by name, there are signs that the personality cult is over. A statue toppled during the riots has not been repaired; street signs for Nazarbayev Avenue that were pulled down in Almaty, the country’s largest city, have not been reaffixed. Authorities have arrested the former head of the security services, the Nazarbayev loyalist Karim Masimov, on charges of attempting to seize power. On Saturday, it was announced that two of Nazarbayev’s sons-in-law had been fired from their positions in key state companies. Other relatives are known to have fled the country. Many in the elite were now rushing to declare their loyalty to Tokayev, said one well-connected business source, adding that any purge would hopefully be limited to those in Nazarbayev’s family and inner circle. “Tokayev is a sensible guy and he knows how important the image of the country is. He will act smoothly and carefully. He will not spray bullets with a machine gun, he will pick people off accurately with a sniper rifle.” After the 2019 transition, it seemed Nazarbayev’s official status as “Leader of the Nation”, and his role as head of the powerful security council, meant his safety and revered status were guaranteed. Instead, the image that took 30 years to build has crumbled in the space of a few days. “Many people are moving from the Nazarbayev camp to the side of President Tokayev,” said Yertysbayev, who appeared to be engaged in exactly that manoeuvre himself, airing thoughts that would have been suicidal to utter publicly just a few weeks ago. “I think Nazarbayev didn’t watch the great film of Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather attentively enough,” said Yertysbayev. “There is no doubt that he is the father and founder of the Kazakh independent state, but he’s a living person and he has his minuses. And the biggest is his sentimental love for his family and clan. I think it’s unacceptable for a head of state.”
The pervasion of Nazarbayev family members and their associates through state companies and various money-making enterprises was something that others in the elite found grating, and is one reason why supposedly loyal figures have been willing to change their tune so quickly. The spectacle is likely to prove instructive for other autocrats in the region, notably the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, both of whom were rumoured to be considering the “Nazarbayev option” as a transition scenario. Putin, whose current term expires in 2024, recently signed a law that would enable him to remain president until 2036, but analysts had also touted a Nazarbayev-like “father of the nation” role that would allow him a safe and prosperous retirement from frontline politics while retaining ultimate control. Suddenly, that looks a less secure option. Putin has thrown his weight behind Tokayev, offering him the military support of a Russia-led alliance to help regain control. It is likely that he made this support contingent on a safety guarantee for Nazarbayev. However, Putin will also have noted the speed at which Nazarbayev’s supposed devoted supporters deserted the former leader. “It will be used as an argument that no transition is possible, other than a transition from the current president to himself,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. In Kazakhstan, people are waiting to see whether Nazarbayev will ever appear publicly again, and whether Tokayev will fully disown his predecessor, resurrect the personality cult or simply remain silent. “We’ve had lots of small signals, but we are still waiting for the big one,” said Vyacheslav Abramov, the editor in chief of the vlast.kz news website.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/where-is-kazakhstans-former-longtime-leader-nursultan-nazarbayev;politics
3216;3216;3216;3216;3252;3252;Why we’re falling in love with romance novels all over again | Claire Armitstead;2022-01-16;['Claire Armitstead'];['Romance books', 'Books', 'Culture', 'UK news', 'Fiction'];"In the days when I took small children on resort holidays, I’d make a point of reading at least one of the novels on the bookshelves. Some of them were terrible: frowsty clogs-and-shawls sagas, saucy doctors and nurses fantasies and oh so many dogeared Dan Browns. But that’s how I got to know about Danielle Steel, Marian Keyes and Julia Quinn, to name just three. And guess what? They’re still there, hugging the top of the sales charts, and helping to drive a 20% increase in fiction sales over the pandemic year. By far the biggest rise was in “romantic fiction and sagas”, sales of which leapt by 49% to nearly 6m. Even though that’s only a third of the number of “crime, thriller and adventure” novels devoured over the year, it adds up to a lot of fluttering hearts. And, given that in literary rather than sales terms, “romance and sagas” is another way of saying women’s fiction, while crime, thrillers and adventure are three genres with universal appeal, rather than just finding their readers from one half of the population, those figures seem all the more astonishing. So what is going on? The sales blurb for the latest from Marian Keyes points succinctly to one answer: “Fed up of being a grownup? Get away from it all …” However, the Irish author has long been promoted out of the ghetto of genre fiction and treated as a national treasure, and her novels have never been simple exercises in escapism. The best known of them, Rachel’s Holiday, threw serious drug addiction in the way of its happy ending. I discovered it in Corfu in the year 2000 and secretly enjoyed it rather more than the novel I’d brought with me – Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, which would go on to win the Booker. I’ll definitely be reading Keyes’s sequel, which is due out next month.
On the other hand, I’d completely forgotten about the American romance author Julia Quinn until the series based on her books, Bridgerton, popped up on the TV. But yes, I was seduced by the dazzling Regency confection of The Duke and I – the first of the series – during an unseasonably wet break, in the early 2000s, when one or other of us kept having to take to bed. The forgettability of romantic fiction is part of the point: it’s like a holiday romance with no strings attached, or the fleeting treat of newspaper-wrapped fish and chips on the pier with the sunlight on your back. And sometimes that’s just what every reader needs. Interestingly, the only two fiction categories that declined in value to publishers during the year were “short stories and anthologies” and “horror and ghost stories”. It may be that the previous year’s sales were bolstered by a handful of high-sellers, but my unscientific take is that the former are too much like hard work, while – frankly, in this of all years – who needs more horror? We have, though, needed books to read in bed. Though I’ve never been a fan of Mills & Boon (a publisher that has become a genre all of its own), I can see the appeal of its fanciful capers of bounty hunters and fugitive billionaires when lockdown has driven you back under your duvet and your fantasies are constrained by living in a household of bored and depressed others. Mills & Boon efficiently parcels its romance into six categories: modern, medical, historical, heroes, true love and desire. And even before the pandemic, a Mills & Boon novel was said to be sold every 10 seconds somewhere in the world. Undoubtedly, more prosaic issues have also contributed to this boom, not least that the bestsellers are sold through supermarkets, which remained open, while all else was forced to close. With fewer things to distract them, and fewer ways to spend their money, perhaps the British buying public turned to what was literally on the shelf in front of them. But there’s a serious point here about the place of books in popular culture. A wise colleague of mine once said, if the book was invented today it would be hailed as a piece of technological genius. It’s cheap, fits in a bag, doesn’t run out of battery and can easily be passed from hand to hand. It’s also surprisingly indestructible. Fun fact: there are still as many as 2m individual medieval manuscripts in existence – although I don’t know whether the mass-produced pulp airport novel would endure so long. Time will tell.

His wife was shot dead. He fled to Pakistan but has no legal status there and is living in a mosque while seeking treatment for recurrent cancer. He worked for the United Nations and other international organisations including the former UK Department for International Development (DfID). Until 2016 he also worked for Adam Smith International on British government-funded projects.
In September, my wife went to the house of one my relatives with another family member to collect some of our belongings – she was three months pregnant with our first child. They went at midnight, so they wouldn’t be seen or recognised. But someone must have reported them, because early in the morning the Taliban came to the house and started shooting. She had been asleep, and when she came out to see what was happening, one of the Taliban just shot her in the head. Three days later, she died in hospital. After she died they detained the other family member for a few days and said: “We won’t release you until you say where Asif is.” I worked with the United Nations and other international organisations including DfID for over 14 years. When I took on a senior role with Adam Smith International, often I was one of the only Afghans in leadership meetings. I travelled a lot around all the provinces for work, which made me a bit high profile, and I was implementing systemic reforms against corruption. There was a Taliban mullah in my home province who used to call me and ask for cash, for phone credit for his fighters. [In Afghanistan, under the now-fallen republic, many organisations and people paid off the Taliban for security.] He used to call me “bacha angrez” (son of the British) when I refused, saying I was not even Afghan. He called 10 or 20 times, but I always rejected their requests, because I never thought the Taliban would take over, I never thought I needed to take care of these people. Even when the Taliban took over, I was very confident that I wasn’t at risk, because I was not corrupt and I did nothing wrong. But in early August I found out that the mullah had asked people to find me at any cost. So I left my house, and contacted my former employers, told them these people wanted to kill me and they sent me the [UK government’s] Afghan relocations and assistance policy link. I applied the same day, and a few days later I got an email asking about my dependents. I replied straight away, but I never got any more calls or any response, and on 27 August the evacuation finished. In those 10 days I moved house four times, then when there were no more flights I decided I had to leave Afghanistan, at any cost and by any route. I came to Kandahar province where smugglers had made a hole under the border fence with Pakistan. We crossed and walked for around four hours, barefoot, so our shoes wouldn’t make a sound. It was then my wife went to the house to collect the belongings – she wanted to join me and had applied for a visa. It was a love marriage. We never thought they would attack her. She had two surgeries but passed away later in the month. I cannot go back. Family and friends all tell me when the Taliban see you they will not wait for one minute to kill you. But here I have no legal documents, I can’t go to the guesthouse, I can’t rent a room, this is really the problem. And doctors told me the cancer has returned. Sometimes I stay with friends. When I see there is no place, I go and pass my night in a mosque. The UK is not accepting us, I can’t go back to Afghanistan. So what to do? We were wrong to work for the UK. *The name has been changed for this article.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/the-taliban-shot-my-wife-in-the-head-ex-uk-government-contractor;politics
3260;3260;3260;3260;3296;3296;Widow of Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill reveals how she was ambushed by bereavement;2022-01-16;['Vanessa Thorpe'];['Gang of Four', 'Music', 'Bereavement', 'Culture', 'Life and style'];"It truly was what the film industry now calls a “meet cute” scenario. When writer Catherine Mayer first bumped into her future husband, the guitarist and songwriter Andy Gill, they were both guests at the sort of wild house party that usually crops up on the pages of bestselling fiction or the script of a romcom. “It was not a meeting I was going to forget,” Mayer says. “It was the 1990s and it was held at the very flash Islington home of an architect where one of the walls was the glass side of a swimming pool. I saw Andy at the buffet; this incredibly handsome man in a frock coat and white jodhpurs who was eating trifle with his hands from a bowl because there was no cutlery. I laughed then and we kept on laughing all the time we were together.”
Gill, who died almost two years ago of suspected coronavirus at the age of 64, was a cult figure to many and a founding member of the post-punk band Gang of Four. Stranded now by the loss of the man she married in 1999, Mayer is still painfully adjusting to life alone. “Some days I feel like a beetle on its back, too full to get up. Grief commonly manifests as an emptiness, but I suffer from the opposite problem. Love for Andy, with nowhere to go, fills my chest, leaks from my eyes, bubbles in my throat,” Mayer writes in a raw new account of the cruel aftermath of the death and of the rupture at the centre of the band, which will be published next month. But that night in Islington it was all before them. Gill led Mayer up to the roof terrace of the party house in Corsica Street and sang “beautifully” to her. A week later they went out on a proper date and were with each other from that day on. After he died, Mayer found herself mired in a bitter legal row over the band’s legacy. Lawyers, go-betweens and incendiary documents are her corrosive inheritance. It does not make mourning any easier, that is for sure, she says. “Andy had often tried to inveigle me into taking an interest in the music industry, but I always resisted. I loved the music, but I certainly never loved the industry,” she says. Tawdry visits to cramped, mucky tour buses, filled with a grim fug and the inevitable creative tensions, did nothing to win her over to life of the road. And besides, Mayer, a successful journalist, activist and author, had her own hectic career to handle. Next month, on the second anniversary of Gill’s death, the paperback edition of Good Grief comes out. It is a book she wrote with her mother, Anne Mayer Bird, about the bereavements they have both recently suffered. But this time there is a significant new chapter that tackles the fractured relationship between her late husband and the founders of Gang of Four, and chiefly with his beloved old schoolfriend, singer Jon King. In the new pages, Mayer candidly explains her decision to ask King not to attend Gill’s memorial, although she is clear it was not a ban. King had left the band in 2011 and the two musicians had not spoken for around a decade.
“I know some people will see this as a music feud,” says Mayer, “but I really see it as a sad love story. A tragedy. Andy always loved Jon and that makes what has happened between them, and to the story of their band, so distressing.” The dispute has been reignited by the band’s latest box set, which Mayer felt was revisionist and devalued the later work of Gang of Four, both in its other iterations and also in its briefly reunited form, back with bassist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham in 2005. It was with this lineup that the band initially won acclaim in 1978. With an urgent, disruptive and ultimately highly influential guitar sound, they were never likely to be regulars on Top of the Pops. Mayer is now a reluctant “keeper of the flame”, a part that widows of admired artists are often called upon to play. She was pleased, she says, to learn the band are to tour again in March in a lineup that will include “brilliant” bassist Sara Lee. It is some of the first band members’ recent decision to remove the North America rights to the band’s early music from Warner Bros – a move that had upset Gill and to which he was opposed – that has left the lasting damage. “I had wanted to help with their planned new box set. But when I finally saw it, the sleeve note begins by saying the band did its best work between 1977 and 1981. I knew Andy would have disagreed vehemently.” Mayer adds that she is often asked how she knows what Gill would have thought of it: “I reply, well, I, and the others who were around him at the end, heard nothing but that from him.” Gill was so inflamed by the back-catalogue switch that he persuaded Mayer not to inform King just how ill he was, and not to allow hospital visits. She tells the full story now in her new chapter, she says, largely for the sake of music history and because she feels a weight of responsibility. Aside from handling Gill’s funeral and financial affairs, Mayer also shouldered the task of finalising The Problem of Leisure: A Celebration of Andy Gill and Gang of Four, the double album of cover versions that Gill was devoted to organising in his last months and which came out last spring, with a cover design by his friend Damien Hirst. This all had to be done on top of Mayer’s writing, and her role as co-founder and president of the Women’s Equality party and co-organiser of its annual festival. “I thought I was going to punch anyone else who said to me ‘it’s good to keep busy’, but there was never any question I would finish the album. You do the only thing you can do for the person who has gone,” she says with emotion.
Providing a clear account for posterity is not the only aim of her new chapter, though. Mayer also believes that many deaths are followed by “terrible and unexpected arguments” that can ambush the bereaved and which no longer have a hope of resolution. Festering issues are suddenly magnified, although they are often proxy arguments for the real emotions at work underneath. She sees Gill’s band as a real family, born of the long friendship between Gill and King that began at Sevenoaks school, where they were also friends with illustrious British film-makers Adam Curtis and Paul Greengrass. The wider family of the band has been supportive through Gill’s illness and death, Mayer reports happily. John Sterry and Thomas McNeice, respectively the band’s singer and bass player in the last decade, were always at hand. “They’re much younger, but they have been in on it all for a long time now and they still check up on me. Adam Curtis and his partner, Tessa, are also nearby.” A death, especially an early death, frequently prompts some jostling for position among the bereaved. Yet Mayer notes wryly that the status of the mourning wife is sacrosanct. “One thing about being the widow, nobody ever questions your right to grieve. But actually, I’ve been struck by how utterly devoted lots of young men also were to Andy. Soon after he had died, someone anonymous got hold of my number and rang me up in grief. It was intrusive, yes, and not great timing, but in fact I felt and continue to feel that the misery of people who did not know Andy is authentic.” • This article was amended on 16 January 2022 to clarify text referring to a legal dispute involving Mayer.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/16/widow-of-gang-of-four-guitarist-andy-gill-reveals-how-she-was-ambushed-by-bereavement;entertainment and culture
3275;3275;3275;3275;3311;3311;Panic as Kosovo pulls the plug on its energy-guzzling bitcoin miners ;2022-01-16;['Daniel Boffey'];['Cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'Kosovo', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Technology', 'World news', 'Energy', 'Europe'];"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency. From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices. “There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities. The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide. The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government. The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades. There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale. But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh).
Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs. Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”. “We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.” Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry. In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. “It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel. Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?” Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective.
Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware. While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain. “There are a lot of people who have invested in crypto mining equipment and it’s not a small investment,” cryptoKapo said. “People have even taken out loans to invest and the impact now is very bad on their lives.”";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners;business and economy
3287;3287;3287;3287;3323;3323;Royal or otherwise, sex abuse stories have a grim familiarity in the wielding of male power  | Sonia Sodha;2022-01-16;['Sonia Sodha'];['Prince Andrew', 'UK news', 'Society', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'US news', 'Ghislaine Maxwell'];"Things are not looking good for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the Queen’s second son formerly known as His Royal Highness. Last week, a judge in New York rejected his attempt to get the sexual abuse lawsuit Virginia Giuffre has filed against him thrown out. Giuffre is suing him for damages, claiming that she was forced to have sex with him three times in 2001 by the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and his sex trafficker accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, allegations that Andrew denies. The royal family responded by announcing that he has been stripped of his military honours, royal patronages and the use of his HRH title. Any praise for the monarchy for depriving him of his titles is misplaced. The royal family left it until the last possible moment to act. Andrew has brought them into far graver disrepute than Prince Harry, who lost his titles for what, by comparison, is the laughably inconsequential transgression of walking away. The raging debate about the consequences for the monarchy is a distraction from the sexual abuse allegations at stake and accountability for the men complicit in the crimes of Epstein and Maxwell. It should not take a man of Andrew’s obviously questionable character to expose the absurdities of a constitutional hereditary monarchy in a modern democracy. Strip away the yachts, the private jets and the glamorous locations from Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes and what is left is a depressingly familiar story of sex trafficking: vulnerable women and girls, some as young as 14, abused by men who feel entitled to their bodies and so do not bother to ask themselves why these girls are at their disposal. There is little to separate these nameless but powerful men and the men who visit seedy brothels housing girls who have been trafficked and exploited, or who get off on online violent porn in which women are hurt and abused. All may lighten their consciences by telling themselves it is all consenting, but who are they kidding? Andrew has been implicated in the crimes of his friends since Giuffre alleged several years ago that he sexually assaulted her three times when she was 17, in London, in New York and at an “orgy” on Epstein’s private Caribbean island. The judge’s decision last week means that he may well find himself being deposed to give evidence to a New York court. Everyone is owed due process, Andrew included, but he must face some extremely inconvenient truths. After hosting Epstein and Maxwell at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, he invited them to his daughter’s 18th birthday party even after Florida police had issued an arrest warrant for him. He chose to stay with Epstein in New York in 2010 after the latter had already been imprisoned for sex offences with children, in a residence where Epstein kept a “massage room” where he abused and photographed girls. Andrew had previously stayed in Epstein’s Florida house, where the financier had on display a photo of himself with a semi-naked prepubescent girl in a sexualised pose; one witness claims it was “full” of nude pictures of women and girls and that there were naked girls by the pool when Andrew was visiting. Despite Andrew saying he cannot remember meeting Giuffre, there is a photo of them together in Maxwell’s London house, where she says he assaulted her, with his hand around her bare midriff. Witnesses have put them together on more than one occasion; one says he saw Andrew kissing a topless Giuffre by the pool. Andrew has not yet been able to produce any evidence that he took his daughter to a party at Pizza Express in Woking on the day Giuffre says he assaulted her in London or of the medical condition that he says casts doubt on her account that he sweated profusely while with her in a nightclub. US prosecutors say that he has refused requests to assist their investigations into Epstein and Maxwell.
Faced with allegations like these, men like Andrew have various strategies. One is to cooperate with the authorities, to tell the truth and refrain from throwing mud at a woman who, before she turned 18, was the victim of sex trafficking and sexual abuse by two of your acquaintances. Another is to do anything to undermine your alleged victim. The guilty cannot do the first and so often resort to the latter playbook, drawn on by powerful men such as Harvey Weinstein who feel entitled to use women decades their junior for their own sexual gratification. Andrew’s former spin doctor tried to suggest that the photo with Giuffre was doctored. His lawyers have deployed every tactic possible in submissions on his behalf: accusing Giuffre of being a gold digger seeking a “payday at his expense”; arguing that despite being a child when she was trafficked, she is more offender than victim; accusing her of making unintelligible and vague revelations; arguing that the New York law under which she is bringing the lawsuit is unconstitutional; claiming Andrew was protected by a clause in Epstein’s 2009 financial settlement with Giuffre. Some of these arguments have already been tossed out by the judge. And there is always the implicit warning from men like Andrew or, in a different abuse-of-power context, Bill Clinton: undermine me and you undermine the institution, handing victory to republicans of one sort or another. The intended result is to jack up the price that women such as Giuffre must pay for seeking accountability to unbearable. It is no coincidence that the only living person to be serving time in prison for her terrible crimes is Epstein’s female accomplice, Maxwell: what of the men who helped themselves to the vulnerable women and girls they trafficked? Those men wield a great power – the threat of ruined reputations, of hounding by tabloid – in service of their own protection. We may never know which of the rich old men who fraternised with Epstein, flew in his jet and enjoyed his hospitality were complicit in his crimes. But all hail Virginia Giuffre for her bravery and tenacity in the pursuit of justice. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/it-takes-courage-to-what-virginia-guiffre-is-doing;politics
3349;3349;3349;3349;3386;3386;No friendly politician is too obscure for insecure China, not even Barry Gardiner | Nick Cohen;2022-01-15;['Nick Cohen'];['China', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Hong Kong', 'Taiwan', 'Uyghurs', 'Xinjiang', 'Xi Jinping', 'Politics'];"The Chinese Communist party appears utterly deluded. Hasn’t it learned in its 100-year history that some politicians aren’t worth buying? Wasting its money, or rather the money of the subjugated Chinese people, on Barry Gardiner, of all MPs, seems more silly than sinister. Why bother? If you’ve never heard of him, Gardiner is an unremarkable Corbynista, who has continued the far left’s tradition of excusing anti-western dictatorships. The Labour MP took £420,000, a large whack even by the lax standards of Westminster, from Christine Ching Kui Lee, an influence-peddler MI5 said had “established links” for Beijing with British politicians.
Suddenly, Gardiner had to find excuses for himself rather than a regime that is terrorising the Uyghur people, occupying Tibet and crushing democracy in Hong Kong. He said he didn’t know Lee had links to a hostile foreign power – presumably, he thought she was rewarding his stand on renationalising the railways. And in any case he had been “critical of the Chinese government on many occasions”. This was news to the journalists who recorded the revolting moment when Gardiner was in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and deplored on the BBC, “the escalation of violence between protesters in Hong Kong and ordinary people in Hong Kong”, as if the threat to “ordinary people” is not a dictatorial superpower that stamps their rights into the dust. But when Gardiner said he was a “very poor investment” from a Chinese point of view, he was right, and he brought back my original question: why bother? The answer is that, as Xi Jinping turns China from a one-party state into a one-man imperium, everything matters. No detail is too small to sweat. No sympathetic politician too obscure to ignore. With opponents, Xi demands a gangster’s respect by unleashing retaliation out of all proportion to the original offence. China explodes at trivial examples of opposition a stable superpower would have the self-confidence to ignore. If you want to know why Muslim countries stay silent about the persecution of fellow Muslims in Xinjiang or why scientists were so quick to dismiss the theory that the Covid pandemic began with a leak from a Wuhan lab, look at China’s willingness to use overweening force to secure conformity with the party line. Filippa Lentzos, of the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King’s College, London, was describing Covid scientists when she said they did not talk about lab leaks “because they feared for their careers [and] their grants”. But she might have been describing businesses and governments, too. Last year, I heard the Czech politician Zdeněk Hřib explain to the leaders of European cities how he had learned the hard way why they should not allow Chinese technology in their infrastructure or have any dealings with the organs of the Chinese state. He discovered when he became mayor of Prague in 2018 that the city had committed itself to supporting Xi’s one-China policy, as part of an apparently harmless twinning agreement with Beijing. Hřib abandoned the policy because he was a liberal who did not agree with forcing Taiwanese people into a communist state against their wishes. In any event, he thought it ridiculous for a central European city to take a position on conflicts in the far east. China reacted as if he had declared war. It banned cultural contacts. Czech oligarchs with Chinese interests hired hack journalists and PR shills to attack him. Miloš Zeman, who was then the Czech republic’s Trumpian president, warned him and Prague of “unpleasant consequences”. Today it is Lithuania’s turn. China is blocking imports and threatening multinationals with punishments if they do business with the tiny Baltic country, solely because it trades with Taiwan.
We should bother, not out of admiration for this government’s apparent policy of committing British forces to fight alongside the US in a war over Taiwan, but because of what China is doing to Britain. The Chinese embassy showed why when it responded to the spying claims by accusing the security service of “smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK”. Muslims, Jews, Chinese people and others undoubtedly worry about blowback when global politics turns national attention towards minorities. But in this instance there is no greater intimidatory threat to Chinese people in the UK than the Chinese Communist party. Or, for that matter, to Chinese people in China. Within hours of the Gardiner story breaking, a contact who works for the pro-democracy movement told me that, even after they have found asylum in the UK, Hong Kong activists communicate through encrypted apps because they worry about what could happen to them here and to their families in China. Just before Christmas, two activists who dared to speak publicly described their “never-ending fear” to the New Statesman. You could see why they were frightened. Anonymous spies had offered £10,000 on the Chinese social media platform WeChat for their work or home addresses. Meanwhile, universities, so quick to atone for the slavery of the past, show little concern for modern-day slavery in Xinjiang as they hoover up Chinese money. They say they want safe spaces to protect students from the tiniest of micro-aggressions, and yet allow the Chinese state, via its on-campus Confucius Institutes, to keep tabs on Chinese students and their teachers. The government should close them, as the Swedish government has, and act to build the UK’s resilience against dictatorial enemies. But there’s the rub. It’s not just that the collapsing Johnson administration is incapable of taking serious measures. Even when the Tories were in their pomp, they showed no inclination to damn the sources of corruption. Honourable MPs and whistleblowers have warned for years that the openness of the City, the libel law, estate agency and indeed the Conservative party to dubious Russian money undermined national security. Last summer, I wrote that all the professional services a dictatorship could want was on open sale in the capital, and warned that if Putin’s allies did not worry ministers, they “should reflect on what will happen when the Chinese Communist party realises what London has to offer”. No worthwhile reforms followed, for a reason I should have grasped at the time. Worthwhile reform is impossible for as long as the Conservatives remain in power. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/15/no-friendly-politician-is-too-obscure-for-insecure-china-not-even-barry-gardiner;politics

Guy Opperman, the pensions minister and MP for Hexham, said Johnson should stay in his post, but was critical of the rule-breaking. Johnson has continued to face criticism, including from those on his frontbench, after admitting to attending a “bring your own booze” garden party in No 10 on 20 May 2020, which he says he understood to be a “work event”. Opperman and his wife Flora’s newborn twin boys, Teddy and Rafe, died the following month. Speaking to BBC’s Politics North programme, the Tory MP said: “I feel pretty emotional about this because in May 2020 my wife and kids were unwell and they went to hospital. I was not able to go there to support them. And I’ve got constituents who couldn’t go to the care homes, to funerals, who were obviously obeying the rules, and quite clearly in No 10 at that time there were a number of people not behaving appropriately. I feel pretty emotional that I wasn’t able to support my wife and kids.” Another Tory MP, Ian Levy, said he had been unable to see his relative due to the restrictions. The Blyth Valley MP said in a statement online: “My own family was affected by this – unable to see my wife’s mother when she was dying in a nursing home. “I understand the real anger at reports that those in power were not abiding by the rules. The public deserves better than this.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/minister-whose-newborn-sons-died-in-pandemic-criticises-no-10-parties;politics
3377;3377;3377;3377;3414;3414;Mother who gave birth to stillborn son while in Covid coma urges people to get vaccine;2022-01-15;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Pregnancy', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'UK news', 'Infectious diseases', 'Health', 'Science'];"A mother whose baby was stillborn while she was in hospital with Covid-19 has urged people to get vaccinated to save themselves the “agony” of becoming seriously ill with the virus. Rachel, 38, from Bilston in Wolverhampton, who did not wish to use her surname, was so unwell she did not realise she had given birth to her son Jaxon, at 24 weeks, in August, and was in a coma and in hospital for three and a half months after contracting the virus. She had gone to get her vaccine while pregnant, but was discouraged by guidance at that early stage of the rollout advising expectant women to perhaps not have it. She said she and her family were “devastated” by the death of her baby, and urged everyone eligible to take up the offer of jabs. She told PA: “I did initially go to get the vaccine, but at the time the advice was not to have it. “I thought I’d have the vaccine when I’d had the baby, but it wasn’t meant to be.”
Earlier this week the government launched an advertising campaign encouraging expectant mothers to get vaccinated and boosted, after data had previously shown the vaccine to be safe in pregnancy. The Department of Health and Social Care cited statistics from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System which showed 96.3% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms between May and October were unvaccinated, a third of whom required respiratory support. In December, the UK’s vaccines watchdog made pregnant women a priority group for vaccination after research showing they are vulnerable to more serious illness and pregnancy complications if they are infected with Covid-19. In November last year, experts warned that while uptake of the vaccine among pregnant women was improving, they were worried about some groups shunning the jabs, including younger women, those in the most deprived areas and women from black and minority ethnic communities. Rachel, who thanked staff at both New Cross hospital’s integrated critical care unit (ICCU) and Glenfield hospital in Leicester for their care, said it was “really important” everyone had their vaccines. “I would say take [the vaccine] – it’s a two-minute thing that can save months of agony if you end up like I was,” the bereaved mother said. Speaking about her loss, she said: “I didn’t actually know I had given birth. I was on drugs so they wanted to tell me when I wasn’t sedated, and the obstetrician informed me a few days later. “My emotions were disbelief – one minute you’re having a scan and a gender reveal, naming the baby and getting excited, and then there was this sudden loss. “I was only able to see him once. Normally I’d have been able to spend a lot more time with him and to hold him. But I didn’t get to do that because of the circumstances.” She said things have been difficult for her partner and her 18-year-old son. “We’re all devastated at our loss,” she said. “We were all very excited at this new life, then we were left with nothing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/mother-who-gave-birth-to-stillborn-son-while-in-covid-coma-urges-people-to-get-vaccine;health
3383;3383;3383;3383;3420;3420;Austerity-hit council defends its ‘high-risk’ investment strategy;2022-01-15;['Richard Partington'];['Local government', 'Energy industry', 'Austerity', 'Business', 'Investing', 'Economics', 'UK news'];"In an ideal world, Cathy Mitchell wouldn’t have to spend her time worrying about a £1bn-plus investment portfolio. The former barrister and deputy leader of Warrington borough council would usually have her mind on schools, adult social care and bus services, with the investments looking after themselves. But things are far from normal for the Cheshire borough or its book of assets: one of its flagship stakes – a 50% share in stricken firm Together Energy – is reportedly on the verge of going up in smoke. Warrington has followed councils across the country in ploughing cash into commercial schemes in the hope of generating returns that can offset a decade of Conservative austerity. However, critics say the Labour-run council has taken the high-stakes strategy too far: putting public money into risky ventures in property, energy and finance – including some firms backed by super-rich Tory donors. “I would rather not be involved in investments as we have better things to do,” says Mitchell, who is the council’s portfolio holder for corporate resources. “But as long as we aren’t funded properly by the government, I don’t feel we have much choice.” Warrington’s energy supply gamble is close to backfiring as Together Energy prepares to appoint administrators. It is the latest among almost 30 small providers to face collapse amid the surging wholesale gas prices that are contributing to the UK’s cost- of-living emergency. The company declined to comment.
The council’s investments since 2019 – made with the aim of earning a return and tackling fuel poverty in one fell swoop – have brought it more than £50m of exposure in debt, equity and guarantees to Together, which is based 200 miles away in Clydebank. While it is unclear how much Warrington could lose, it is thought to be less than the headline figure suggests. Mitchell says she can’t comment on a live situation, but insists protections are in place, and that appropriate governance checks were made before investing. “It’s not the council running it; it’s a proper energy company,” says Mitchell. “They’re industry professionals with a lot of experience. We used external advisers and ran an internal workshop where we got all other [political] parties involved [before investing]. We were very careful about the investment.” Her critics beg to differ. The stake in Together Energy is just one of many deals done by the town known for its rugby league club and former wire industry. They include shares in a bank, loans to a giant online retailer, and property ranging from shopping centres and business parks to solar farms in Hull, York and Cirencester. Andy Carter, Conservative MP for Warrington South, worries that the council has bitten off more than it can chew. “It didn’t have to do this,” he says. “Other councils in the north-west have far more meagre levels of borrowing and operate in a different way. It’s a decision taken by councillors to adopt what I think is a really risky strategy, and some of those risks are now coming home to roost. “I’m not saying councils shouldn’t do any borrowing. To do [it] here and there to make strategic investments in your community is a good thing. But Warrington has taken it to an extreme level.” Undeterred, councillors last week approved a fresh £37.5m loan, this time to affordable housing developer Auxesia Homes. Backed by European firm Matter Real Estate and Gary Metcalf, a property developer who was briefly owner of Chester City Football Club, Auxesia specialises in homes for services personnel and NHS workers across the north-west. Critics say this should have been more closely scrutinised. “Have any lessons been learned from the council’s Together Energy investment?” asks Tory councillor Ken Critchley. “One has to ask why the normal providers of finance to private businesses are not providing these loans.”
Elsewhere the town has a 33% stake in business bank Redwood, which is controlled by multimillionaire Tory donor David “Spotty” Rowland and his son Jonathan. Another Tory donor, Matthew Moulding, billionaire owner of the Hut Group (THG) has been granted a loan worth more than £150m by the council. The loan is secured on the online retailer’s vast distribution site on the outskirts of Warrington. Halfway between Manchester and Liverpool, Warrington is linked to both by the world’s first intercity railway and has motorways on three sides. This brought the town a warehousing boom in recent years – though it started in 1987, when Ikea picked Warrington for its first UK store. Mitchell says most of the investments are backed by physical assets, so Warrington is protected against defaults, and that the council is investing in local employers that create much-needed growth and jobs. A spokesman for Redwood declined to comment on the bank’s owners, but said it had loaned £133m in the town and wider region since its launch four years ago. Mitchell says investing is necessary to fund services and represents “Labour values in action”. She adds: “It’s difficult to avoid Conservatives when you’re dealing with these sorts of businesses. Sometimes you have to deal with people who you’re not on the same page with.” Warrington has never been short on ambition. Its town hall is an elegant Georgian mansion, and the opulent gates outside it were originally created for Queen Victoria. It achieved a sad fame, however, in 1993, when an IRA bomb killed two young boys. After years of decline, the town has pumped £130m into redeveloping Time Square into a publicly owned market and cinema complex. A similar investment in nearby Preston won plaudits for being “municipal socialism” in action. Andrew Burns, associate director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents public accounting professionals and sets standards, says Warrington’s approach is not new. Birmingham started a bank more than a century ago under Neville Chamberlain, he says, while noting growing demands for local financial autonomy to “level up” Britain’s poorer areas. But while he agrees that there are questions about how far Warrington is pushing it, he adds: “The ultimate test is the local ballot box. If people don’t like what they’re doing, they can vote them out.”
In the pursuit of investment returns, Warrington has built up a debt pile worth £1.6bn. And that is due to rise to £2.3bn within two years, putting the council on track for debts worth more than 400% of operating revenue. With interest rates rising to tackle soaring inflation, higher borrowing costs could heap more pressure on the local authority. Warrington has mostly borrowed through the Public Works Loans Board, a Treasury agency which allows local authorities to borrow at low rates – close to those enjoyed by the UK government. However, along with councils including Aberdeen, Lancashire and Guildford, it has secured funds from global bond market investors. Moody’s, the credit ratings agency that monitors the council’s finances on their behalf, has noted that Warrington has a “high-risk appetite”, but a track record of budget delivery. Local authorities across the UK have come under severe strain during the pandemic as income collapsed and pressure on services increased. Ministers had to intervene in the cases of Northamptonshire and Croydon, which issued section 114 notices – meaning they could not meet their obligations. Last March the National Audit Office warned that 25 councils were on the brink of insolvency. Opposition leaders question whether Warrington should be allowed by central government rules to take such a high-risk strategy. “It’s been a little bit like the wild west,” says Carter. “Anyone can go in and borrow, and do what want to do with it. That’s certainly been the case with Warrington.” A government spokesperson said councils were restricted from borrowing to invest for yield, but that they were ultimately responsible for their own investment strategies, adding: “We have been clear that councils should not put taxpayers’ money at excessive risk in pursuit of commercial income.” Warrington’s other MP, Labour’s Charlotte Nichols, who represents the north of the town, admits the debt burden is a problem. “Of course it raises concerns, especially from people who don’t think the council should be in the business of investing,” she says. “Ultimately, I agree with that assessment, but I don’t see credible alternatives being offered. The government needs to cough up or councils like ours will be forced into finding other sources of revenue.” Mitchell says there would be worse dangers for Warrington if the council stopped investing. It has had to find £173m in savings since austerity began in 2010, equivalent to 60p in each £1. “This is about trying to protect people. What does it look like if you instead cut services for children at risk of harm, or for vulnerable people who need care in their home?”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/15/austerity-hit-council-defends-its-high-risk-investment-strategy;business and economy

In no area of repertoire, it seems, is Williams not at ease as well as expert. Recent Schubert song cycles (with pianist Iain Burnside) and English repertoire stand out in his varied discography. Now, with Vignoles as an ever idiomatic and responsive partner, he has turned to French song. Opening with the sensual mystery of late Fauré – four songs, including Reflets dans l’eau and Danseuse – the duo steer gracefully to atmospheric ballads by Debussy’s friend André Caplet, spiky Arthur Honegger miniatures and Ravel in Spanish mood (Don Quichotte à Dulcinée). Williams’s own idiomatic, semi-declamatory Verlaine settings, Les ténèbres de l’amour (1994), form an effective bridge to more Honegger, Poulenc and, in perfect conclusion, Debussy’s Beau Soir.
• Ennio Morricone, orchestrator, conductor, trumpeter but above all composer of scores for more than 400 films, died in 2020, aged 91. Had he stopped his cinema career after The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) or The Mission (1986), he would still be famous, his music plundered, borrowed, recreated in every genre from hip-hop and reggae to jazz and classical. A new album, Ennio Morricone: Cinema Suites for Violin and Orchestra (Arcana), conducted by his son Andrea Morricone, invites us to enter the dreamlike atmosphere of his scores as music alone, those haunting theme tunes given subtle orchestration and new colour. Performed by his longtime collaborator, violinist Marco Serino, with the Orchestra Haydn di Bolzano e Trento, it features arrangements Morricone had made since the 1980s, revising them late in his life. The process was interrupted by his death and finished, in tribute, by Serino. A must for film music devotees but interesting, too, as a testament. • The BBC Philharmonic’s concert from Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall, conducted by Ludovic Morlot, with Carolyn Sampson (soprano), explores the idea of home and away: Copland’s Letter from Home, Betsy Jolas’s Letters from Bachville, Dutilleux’s Correspondances and Dvořák’s Symphony No 9, “From the New World”.

Today’s fishy recipes are quite traditional, especially the suquet, which is a real feast and the type of dish that’s perfect for a special occasion. They’re much lighter and quicker than meat stews, but they’re still incredibly warming and good for scooping up with a spoon. Bean and clam stew (pictured above) Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr 20 min Serves 4-6 1kg clams 1 tbsp fine sea salt, to clean the clams (see method) 75ml extra-virgin olive oil 5 garlic cloves, peeled and diced 2 onions, peeled and diced 1 leek, white part only, chopped 1 green pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh diced 1 red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh diced 1 bay leaf 2 dried chillies, finely chopped 200ml white wine 1½-2 litres prawn stock (or shellfish or fish stock) 500g dried haricot beans, soaked overnight in cold water Sea salt and black pepper ½ bunch chervil, chopped, or dill or tarragon Check with your fishmonger whether the clams have been cleaned – if not, you’ll need to do so yourself by putting them in a bowl of cold water with a tablespoon of fine salt and soaking for 40 minutes. Gently move the clams around in the water every 10 minutes: the salt water makes them expel any sand. Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Once it’s hot, add the garlic and onions, and saute, stirring, for 10-12 minutes. Add the leek, fry, stirring, for five to six minutes, then add the peppers, bay leaf and dried chillies, and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until really soft and sweet but not coloured. Pour in the wine, cook until the liquid has evaporated, then add the stock and the drained beans. Half-cover the pot with a lid, and leave to cook very gently for about 45 minutes, until the beans have soaked up lots of the stock and are nice and soft; if at this stage the beans are still a little hard, add extra water and carry on cooking until they soften. When the beans are done, season the mix, then drain the clams and add them to the pot. Half-cover the pan again, and cook the clams over a medium heat for three or four minutes, until they open (discard any that do not). Stir in the chervil, then taste and adjust the seasoning and serve with lots of bread for mopping up the sauce. Suquet (fish and potato stew)

In a mortar, crush the parsley, garlic and nuts with a drizzle of olive oil until you have a rough paste, then set aside. Now start on the stew. Pour the oil into a large pan over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until slightly golden. Add the chopped tomatoes and saute, stirring every now and then, for about 10 minutes more, until the mix reduces to a paste. Add the saffron, pimentón and picada, cook, stirring, for a minute, then add the wine, brandy, sherry and pastis, and cook until all the liquid evaporates. Add the potatoes, stir for a minute, then add the stock and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Add the chopped fish, half-cover the pot, and leave to cook for five to seven minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning accordingly. Meanwhile, in a medium frying pan, fry the bread slices in a drizzle of olive oil until golden on both sides. Remove from the pan, rub one side of the toast with the halved garlic and serve alongside the hot stew. • The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

3435;3435;3435;3435;3472;3472;‘They want to make an example’: Cuba protesters hit with severe sentences;2022-01-15;['Ed Augustin'];['Cuba', 'Protest', 'Americas', 'World news'];"One Sunday last summer, 18-year-old Eloy Cardoso left his mother’s house on the outskirts of Havana to collect an Atari game console from a friend. He’d stayed at home the previous day, while the largest anti-government demonstrations since the revolution had ripped through Cuba.
The authorities had managed to quell the protests in most of the country overnight, but not in La Güinera: unrest was still raging in the humble and normally calm neighbourhood, and Eloy walked out into a bloody brawl. Shops were smashed and looted, party supporters wielded clubs, police wrestled with youths, and one man was shot dead. Amid the tumult, Cardoso began to throw stones at the police. He was arrested a few days later, and at a closed trial earlier this week he was sentenced to seven years in prison. The trial is one of scores currently playing out across the island, as, six months after the demonstrations, Cuban courts have quietly started imposing draconian sentences on the protesters who – sometimes peacefully, sometimes less so – flooded the streets last summer. Though the state has a history of issuing stiff sentences to organised political dissidents, the punishments now being meted out are unusually severe. “They want to make an example of him,” said Cardoso’s mother, Servillia Pedroso, 35, holding back tears.
Because her son is at college, police initially told her he would get a “second chance” charging him with “public disorder” and telling him he would get away with a fine. But in October, the charge was upgraded to sedition: in other words, inciting others to rebel against state authority. Since December, more 50 people in La Güinera have been sentenced for sedition, according to the civil society organisation Justicia 11J. Most are poor, young males. Justicia 11J said more than 700 people were still being detained following July’s protests, with 158 of those accused of or already sentenced for sedition. Earlier this week one man in the eastern province of Holguín was sentenced to 30 years. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said detainees have faced summary proceedings without guarantees of due process or a fair trial. “Prosecutors have pushed for disproportionately long sentences against people who were arrested in the protests. In addition, many people stand accused of vague crimes that are inconsistent with international standards, such as ‘contempt’ which has been consistently used in Cuba to punish those who criticise the government,” she said. “The state is trying to send the message that there are dire consequences to rebelling against the government,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington. “The fact that the government feels under and is under unprecedented threat – not just from increased US sanctions but from the pandemic and the global economic situation – makes it less willing to tolerate any type of dissidence.” Trump-era sanctions contributed to the food and medicine shortages people were protesting against. The sanctions also slowed vaccine production, aggravating a Covid surge that was sweeping through the island at the time, and contributing to the fury. But many protesters also wanted freedom from Communist rule.
Economic complaints are a constant in La Güinera: it’s hard to afford shoes and medicine. A schoolbag costs 2,500 pesos – more than half a teacher’s monthly salary. “I’m sure that if it wasn’t for the economy, none of this would have happened – but the economy never improves,” said Yusniel Hernández, 36, a teacher turned taxi driver, who said a dozen friends had been incarcerated for throwing stones and assaulting police officers. Analysts say the government is using exemplary sentencing to snuff out any further protests because it is bracing for further economic hardship. As sanctions have hardened, a longstanding siege mentality among the leadership seems to have ossified in recent years. The fact that the Biden administration reversed its policy of normalisation with the island after July may be another contributing factor. But the pain from the crackdown is palpable. “None of these kids were activists, they don’t belong to any organisation,” said Migdalia Gutiérrez, 44, whose son, Brunelvil, 33, has been sentenced to 15 years. “If someone has nothing to do with politics, and you are accusing them of political stuff, then you are making them political prisoners,” she added.
Her nextdoor neighbour, María Luisa Fleitas Bravo, 58, lives in poverty. The roof of her kitchen, living room and second bedroom collapsed when Hurricane Irma struck in 2017. The state provided her with the breeze-blocks she needed to rebuild, but four years later the cement still hasn’t arrived. Her rotting wood ceiling is covered with plastic sheets secured by clothes pegs, but it still leaks when it rains. Her unemployed 33-year-old son, Rolando, was sentenced to 21 years for attacking a police officer during the protests (a charge he denies). Pedroso has been running a small online campaign to free her son. But shortly after she and seven other local mothers made a video demanding justice , she received a visit from the police, who informed her that the video was being shared on Facebook for “counterrevolutionary” ends. She has since been questioned by state security, and told that if she takes to the street to protest for her son’s release, she could be charged with public disorder. Pedroso, a housewife, had applied for a job at Havana’s international airport, to work in immigration. The job was all but in the bag, she said, until she was asked about her son during a final check-up interview. That was September. She hasn’t heard back since. “Nobody who has a child accused of anything can work in the airport,” she said, before adding, with a touch of gallows humour: “In fact, yes: they can be accused of murder, but not of counterrevolution.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/cuba-protesters-sentences-sedition;politics

3454;3454;3454;3454;3491;3491;Streaming: The Tragedy of Macbeth and the best Shakespeare on film;2022-01-15;['Guy Lodge'];['Film', 'William Shakespeare', 'Culture', 'Drama films'];"With Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth and Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story remake both hitting cinemas last month, the long list of Shakespeare adaptations on film – direct, loosely inspired or otherwise – grew a little longer still. Yet despite a solid shared foundation, most Shakespeare on film is as easily forgotten as any old am-dram production: films with a vision to match that language and storytelling are rare and special. The Tragedy of Macbeth, which landed on Apple TV+ this week, certainly has a vision, with its bare modernist design and high-contrast monochrome cinematography, though Coen’s rendering of the play itself is muted and overly composed. In the ranks of movie Macbeths, it lacks the visceral fury of Roman Polanski’s 1971 version (Amazon) or even Australian director Justin Kurzel’s recent, Michael Fassbender-starring adaptation (2015; BFI Player), which divided critics with its slash-happy approach to the text but enthralled me with its blood-and-grime vigour.
Anyone taking on Macbeth has to contend with the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa’s Throne of Blood (1957; BFI Player), which mightily moved proceedings to the samurai realm. Kurosawa’s liberties with the narrative shift and reignite familiar stakes, while there’s dreamy horror to its imagery. It isn’t just the most thrilling filmed version of the Scottish play, but possibly the best Shakespeare film, full stop. Challengers for the title include Kurosawa’s two other, very different stabs at Shakespeare: the ravishing epic sensibility of his King Lear adaptation, Ran (1985; BFI Player), couldn’t be further removed from the lean, noir-esque cruelty of his 1960 Hamlet spin, The Bad Sleep Well (BFI Player), but both prove how fluidly these tales translate to distant cultural contexts. Bollywood, too, returns to the Shakespearean well frequently: 2003’s Maqbool (Apple TV+) is yet another thrusting, vibrant redo of Macbeth.
Calling Kurosawa the Bard’s greatest screen interpreter might have rankled with Laurence Olivier, the stately classicist who sort of appointed himself Shakespeare’s official conduit in the 1940s. Decades on, the actor-director’s Shakespeare films are a mixed bag. The Oscar-laden Hamlet (1948; Apple TV+) is handsome but a bit stiff, though his Henry V (1944; Amazon) still leaps off the screen with iridescent colour and fury, while his Richard III (1955; Google Play) contains possibly his most vital, sinuous screen performance. The less said about Olivier’s blackface Othello the better, particularly with Laurence Fishburne’s dynamite performance as the Moor available to view in Oliver Parker’s 1995 film (Google Play). Still, Orson Welles’s brooding, carved-in-marble film of Othello (1951; Amazon) remains the play’s best screen outing. Welles’s magnificent Chimes at Midnight (1965; Apple TV+), meanwhile, remains as academically adventurous as any film-maker has got with Shakespeare, weaving together elements from multiple plays, leading with Henry IV Parts I and II and Henry V. That trio also provides the very loose, wayward spine of Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho (1991; Chili), the wonderful queer road movie that finds tender heartbreak in the tragedies. Back on the traditionalist bent, Kenneth Branagh took Olivier’s mantle with wildly inconsistent results. His four-hour Hamlet (1996; Amazon) is his directorial masterpiece, textually complete and shot with mad kineticism. But the more novel achievement, perhaps, is 1993’s Much Ado About Nothing (Apple TV+). Far less frequently attempted than the tragedies, Shakespeare’s comedies have an odd tendency to wilt on screen, but this glintingly sunlit all-star romp is the very model of how to get it right: spry and sexy and actually funny, performed with palpable exuberance.
Only Gil Junger’s 10 Things I Hate About You (1999; Amazon) – in which The Taming of the Shrew is ideally relocated to the battleground of 90s high-school courtship, with irresistible results – comes close. Less hyped at the time, it’s now as essential and beguiling a Gen X artefact as Baz Luhrmann’s swirling, swooning Romeo + Juliet (1996; Disney+). Or Derek Jarman’s radical, radiant The Tempest (1979; BFI Player), a film perfectly suited to the category-resistant oddity of the play itself. Jarman treats it as equal parts romance, tragedy and comedy, and his film is a beautiful alien object in itself. All the world may be a stage, but the best Shakespeare films stray far from it.

Herself (Picturehouse) The Irish actor Clare Dunne writes herself the role of her career as a young mother fleeing spousal abuse to build (quite literally, as it turns out) a new life for herself and her daughters. The compelling grit of her performance must contend, however, with Phyllida Lloyd’s frequently overblown, faux-inspirational direction. The Man Who Sold His Skin (Studio Soho) Somewhat surprisingly nominated for an Oscar last year, this luridly absorbing Tunisian art-world satire effectively repurposes a macabre old Roald Dahl premise – in which a man has a valuable artwork tattooed on his back, making himself a walking collector’s piece – for our age of migrant exploitation. Nightmare Alley (Signal One) A well-timed Blu-ray reissue, given that Guillermo del Toro’s fine remake is out later this month, Edmund Goulding’s riveting 1947 noir remains a startlingly black-hearted work even by the standards of the genre, blending icy underworld corruption with the whirling freakery of the American carnival scene. • This article was amended on 17 January 2022 because an earlier version of the Throne of Blood caption gave the Japanese name for the film but misrendered it as the actor’s name, and omitted the name itself, Toshiro Mifune.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/15/streaming-the-tragedy-of-macbeth-and-the-best-shakespeare-on-film;entertainment and culture
3472;3472;3472;3472;3509;3509;Covid global report: Omicron alert in southern Chinese city bordering Macau ;2022-01-15;['N/A'];['Coronavirus', 'China', 'Asia Pacific', 'Infectious diseases', 'Brazil', 'Australia news', 'US news', 'Americas'];The southern Chinese city of Zhuhai has suspended public bus routes after announcing it had detected at least seven cases of the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant there and warning residents not to leave the city. The coastal city, which borders the gambling hub Macau, said late on Friday that Omicron had been detected in one mildly ill and six asymptomatic patients, after mass testing due to a case in a neighbouring city. China is battling a spate of coronavirus outbreaks, including several from the Omicron variant, as it steps up vigilance against the virus ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Millions of people across the country have been ordered to stay home in recent weeks, with scores of domestic flights cancelled and factories shut down. Zhuhai officials have asked that residents avoid leaving the city “unless necessary”, with those who do required to show negative Covid test results within the past 24 hours. The city had launched mass testing for its population of 2.4 million people on Friday after a Covid case was detected in neighbouring Zhongshan earlier in the week. China reported 165 new cases on Saturday, down from 201 a day earlier. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance for Americans on masks, recommending wearing “the most protective mask you can” while stopping short of advocating nationwide usage of the N95 type. The CDC clarified on its website “that people can choose respirators such as N95s and KN95s, including removing concerns related to supply shortages for N95s”. Americans should “wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently”, the CDC added. It said it wanted to encourage Americans to wear masks – “it is important to remember that any mask is better than no mask” – rather than push them only to wear the highest-grade face protection, but also explicitly said that respirators are best while “loosely woven cloth products provide the least protection”. It said the revised recommendations “reflect the science on masking, including what we have learned in the past two years” since the start of the pandemic. The US is tallying about 1,800 Covid-19 deaths and 780,000 new infections daily – the most in the world – as well as record levels of hospitalised patients. The Omicron-related surge appears to be slowing in areas that were hit first, including states in the north-east and south, according to a Reuters analysis. In western states, the number of new cases climbed 89% in the past week compared with the previous week. Australia has likely neared the peak of its Omicron wave, authorities said on Saturday, while warning daily infections would linger near record levels for the next few weeks after more than 100,000 cases were reported for a fourth straight day. Having limited the spread of the coronavirus through tough restrictions earlier in the pandemic, Australia is suffering record caseloads from Omicron. Most parts of the country have shifted to a strategy of living with the virus after they reached high vaccination rates. Modelling from some states “leads me to believe that we are close to the peak of this wave in terms of cases”, said Paul Kelly, the chief health officer. Infections have dipped over the last three days while the rise in hospitalisations in worst-hit New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, has slowed slightly, official data showed. Most states are dealing with record hospitalisations from the Omicron wave, with authorities saying unvaccinated younger people form a “significant number” of admissions in Australia. Brazil’s health ministry reported 112,286 new cases in the past 24 hours and 251 Covid-19 deaths. Brazil has had 22,927,203 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 620,796 according to ministry data.

3476;3476;3476;3476;3513;3513;Tim Dowling: I fall asleep thinking about the impossibility of each of the repairs I am facing ;2022-01-15;['Tim Dowling'];['DIY', 'Family', 'Homes', 'Life and style'];"It is the season of things coming off in your hands: drawer knobs, door latches, cupboard handles. Everywhere is disintegration and fatigue, down to the very metal. Reach out, turn it, pull it towards you, and it’s yours. On Monday evening the youngest one snaps off the brass latch handle while trying to open the front door. He shows me the piece, shorn away by the force of his grip. “It’s not like I even pulled that hard,” he says. “How do we get out?” I say. We jam a screwdriver into the gap and find that with practice we can lever ourselves free. On Wednesday the cylindrical chrome wand that turns the kitchen tap from hot to cold comes loose from its socket while I’m washing up, screw threads somehow stripped. Nothing I do will make it stay, so I leave it in a saucer on a nearby shelf. The next day the youngest one pulls the handle off the back door, for good measure. “I guess I don’t know my own strength,” he says, presenting me with the remains. “Did you get bitten by a spider or something?” I say. I lift my glasses to examine in detail the grainy peaks and valleys of the fracture, a microscopic landscape contoured along unpredictable lines of tensile stress. “I was just trying to let the cat out,” he says.
“The thing is, the back door was our emergency exit in the event we lost the front door screwdriver,” I say, holding the handle to the light. “What is this, zinc?” I fall asleep thinking about the impossibility of each of the repairs I am facing. Some things, once sundered, cannot be rejoined. There is no such glue. Later I am woken by a loud, tearing crack. I run downstairs to the kitchen to find the dog in a state of distress, wearing the cat flap like a skirt. The front door lock mechanism is, it transpires, under warranty. A repairman arrives after the weekend and fixes it in a matter of minutes. By the time I get there to watch him work, he is gone. Everything else is my problem. These are questions, I realise, not of practical skill but of very precise online ordering. Measure twice and cut once, say DIY experts. I say: order the exact same handle and use all the old screw holes. Unfortunately there is rather more to know about door handles than I imagined. They come sprung and unsprung, for regular or multipoint locking systems, and there is no such thing as a standard size. The manufacturers are also curiously resistant to branding: nowhere on my handle can I find a mark to say who made it, even after taking it to bits. I spend two days educating myself, plus a further afternoon taking precise measurements, before I’m confident I’ve tracked down a suitable replacement. With a tremendous rush of satisfaction, I press Confirm Order. That evening I find my wife looking at new cat flaps online. “Don’t do that without me,” I say. “Why not?” she says. “Did you want to choose the colour?” “We need one that’s big enough for the dog, but small enough for the existing hole,” I say. “We need, in short, the exact same one.” “This one looks the same,” she says. “We do not go by looks,” I say. “I’ll get a tape measure.” On Friday afternoon my handles arrive. It feels like my birthday. I shred the packaging in excitement, pull out a handle and examine it closely: anodised silver, double sprung, multipoint compatible. Then I look down into the box. When my wife next passes through the room I have my head in my hands. “Wrong, all wrong,” I say. “Looks OK to me,” she says, poking the handle. “You have no idea,” I say. “Please don’t tell me,” she says. I call the number on the invoice. After many minutes, a voice answers. “Shelley speaking. How may I help?” it says. I tell Shelley my name and reference number. “The ProLinea, was it?” she says.
“Yes,” I say. “But I ordered the model with the 240mm backing plate. This is the 220.” There is a long silence at the other end. “Oh no,” says Shelley. “That’s not good.” Shelley, I realise, is the only person in the world who understands what I’m going through. She knows exactly how misaligned my screw holes are. “I’m sorry,” I say. “It’s not your fault,” she says. “I’ll get the right one out to you, but it won’t get processed now til Monday.” “That’s fine, Shelley,” I say. But I know that she knows I am crushed.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/tim-dowling-i-fall-asleep-thinking-about-the-impossibility-of-each-of-the-repairs-i-am-facing;business and economy
3494;3494;3494;3494;3531;3531;‘I like to live in the present’: Antonio Conte leaves his Spurs future uncertain;2022-01-14;['David Hytner'];['Tottenham Hotspur', 'Antonio Conte', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Antonio Conte has refused to offer assurances over his future at Tottenham, saying his focus was purely on the present and nothing later because “later could be too late”. The manager, who signed only a 20-month contract when he succeeded Nuno Espírito Santo in November, is keen to upgrade his squad during this month’s transfer window, having repeatedly described it as not strong enough. Conte has applied not-so-subtle pressure on the chairman, Daniel Levy, with a string of messages about what he feels he needs and the one he delivered on Friday took in the apocalyptic fears of the club’s fans. They are terrified that Conte could quit if he is not backed by Levy with signings.
There is no suggestion that Conte would be ready to walk out in February if he did not get what he wanted – the summer window could be a different story – although he remained in the mood to be provocative. “Honestly, I like to live in the present and not to think a lot for the future,” Conte said, when asked whether he could guarantee he would still be at the club after the January window and the one that followed in the summer, whatever happened. “It’s important to live in the present, to try to improve the situation ... because the present is now, the future is later. And later could be too much late for us. We have to be focused on the present. Then we will see.” Conte was pushed on the subject and he did say that he was enjoying his time at Spurs and had a “good relationship” with Levy and the managing director of football, Fabio Paratici. Conte added: “I want to work, I want to improve this team and, I repeat, we have to be focused on the present because, for sure, I want to improve, we want to improve.” Conte tends to be more outspoken, more political, leading up to and during a transfer window and there is no doubt that he is manoeuvring from a position of strength. He is a proven winner, whom the Spurs support consider themselves fortunate to have, especially after the failed tenure of Nuno, whereas Levy has precious little credit in the bank with some of them. On the other hand, if history has shown us anything it is that Levy does not like to be strong-armed.
Spurs’s recruitment has been underwhelming since 2016-17 – the season when Conte first came to England to manage Chelsea – and, of their purchases who have cost more than £10m, perhaps only Lucas Moura and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg have been successes, although hopes remain high for Cristian Romero. It is a major reason why Conte has complained that the club have slipped from contenders to what he calls a “middle” level. He is desperate for them to get their next signings right, to see his own ambitions matched. “Yes, for sure,” Conte said. “I don’t lose my ambition and this must be very clear. I like to fight for something important. I don’t want to lose my will, my desire. Otherwise I will go against myself. I have to be the same person in every moment.” Conte has cut an increasingly frustrated figure of late, despite his positive record in the league – five wins, three draws and no defeats. He has lamented the squad’s lack of depth, the gap to the top teams and, when asked whether he realised the scale of the task at Spurs would be so big, he started laughing.
“I decided to accept this job because to work in this environment, to work in a modern club, is good for every coach,” Conte said. “As you know very well, when you’re outside, you can imagine the situation. Then, when you are inside the situation, you can understand every aspect very well.” It feels unlikely that when Conte was persuaded to take the role, he was led to expect a squad overhaul in January. He sidestepped a question on this, saying that because he had not yet lived through a transfer window with Spurs, he could not comment on what they had to spend. Conte said: “I enjoy working at Tottenham because I found a fantastic environment, amazing stadium and fantastic training ground. For sure we have to bring the level of the team [up] to the same level as our infrastructure.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/antonio-conte-leaves-tottenham-future-uncertain-spurs-transfers;sports
3521;3521;3521;3521;3559;3559;A Tory party mired in scandal can’t fix the NHS – but a Labour government can | Keir Starmer;2022-01-14;['Keir Starmer'];['NHS', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Labour', 'Politics'];"The next Labour government will build a new Britain based on security, prosperity and respect. To do that, we must renew the very foundations of our country. That will begin with renewal of the health service. The NHS must be resilient, able to meet the challenges of the future, and focused on prevention as well as cure. It must be there to protect us in the future, rather than requiring us to protect it in the present. It is to the country’s great misfortune that at this crucial time we have a Conservative government yet again mired in scandal, led by a prime minister who is out of control, out of touch and out of ideas. Senior cabinet ministers are spending their days plotting how and when to dispose of him. Precious time is being wasted on the latest internal psychodrama of the Tory party instead of sorting out the mess they have made. Nowhere is that mess more profound than in the health service. Twelve years ago, the Tories inherited a strong NHS from Labour. Waiting times were the shortest on record. Today they are the highest since records began. Across the country, people are struggling to see a doctor, get the care they require or have a much needed operation. The claim from the government benches that all the NHS’s ills are down to Covid is simply not true. Waiting times were on the rise long before the virus showed up. Life expectancy had stalled. We went into the pandemic short of 100,000 staff in England and with patients unable to be discharged from beds. Lockdowns were necessary to stop the NHS falling over – but the reason it was in such a perilous state was because the Tories had made it so. Without a great renewal, the NHS will continue to be vulnerable to new variants and new viruses. That, in turn, will leave the country vulnerable. This is unsustainable. Lockdowns come at enormous cost to people’s lives and health, and the country’s economy. Being forced into a hokey-cokey of restrictions will only do more harm in the long term. Instead we must fix the damage the Tories have done, to make the NHS more resilient again. That means investing properly. Labour would get waiting lists down by getting staff numbers up: recruiting, training and – crucially – retaining the staff we need. We would treat care workers with respect by giving them real job security and rewarding them properly. And we would transform social care to give older and disabled people the support they need to live the life they choose. Our focus will be on the sort of renewal that has only ever been possible under Labour governments. Just as the Blair government refocused the health service on outcomes, we would switch the focus from simply treating illnesses to preventing them. When I was director of public prosecutions, hardly a case came across my desk where early intervention couldn’t have turned lives around before they unravelled. The same is true in health.
Achieving this sort of change means rethinking how the healthcare system works. It will require us to focus on the patient rather than just the system, the community as much as the community hospital. If we are to keep people well and at home we must strengthen those services that in turn strengthen entire communities, such as adequate mental health provision. The NHS needs to be properly funded but, simply throwing money at the problem isn’t the answer. Instead, we need to think radically about how the NHS can deal with the challenges of the future. We would be forensic with investment. Technology has the potential to transform how we live and manage our lives, while also reducing pressures. It will be possible to get early warnings about diseases we may be vulnerable to. “Hospital at home” systems will allow patients to track and report their conditions, with remote supervision. Tackling the immediate crisis, future-proofing the NHS and shifting our focus to prevention is all part of Labour’s new contract with the British people. It will provide the security that comes with knowing the health service will be there for you and your loved ones when you need it. It will increase our nation’s health and wellbeing, giving us all the chance to prosper. And it will provide people with the dignity and self-respect that come with being able to have control over your own life. The Tories don’t get any of this. They think it’s enough for the NHS to merely survive. Under Labour, the NHS – and Britain – will once again thrive.

3535;3535;3535;3535;3573;3573;Ranieri says Watford are ‘ready to fight’ while Eddie Howe looks to Wood;2022-01-14;['Louise Taylor'];['Watford', 'Newcastle United', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Claudio Ranieri did not need much time to consider the question. “I’ve had a lot of experience but I’ve never faced a week like this before,” said Watford’s manager. “It’s an extraordinary situation.” The 70-year-old had just been asked whether he had been involved in a run of three games in seven days more pivotal than his latest team’s assignments at fellow relegation strugglers Newcastle on Saturday, Burnley on Tuesday and at home to Norwich next Friday.
“The next three games are very, very, important,” said the man who led Leicester to the title in 2016 yet has latterly presided over six straight Premier league defeats at 17th-placed Watford. “But we are ready for the fight. I believe in my players, I believe in this team and, sooner or later, results on the pitch will tell me: ‘Claudio you are right.’” As Ranieri boarded Watford’s flight from Luton to the north-east on Friday, Eddie Howe was hoping his own judgment would be similarly vindicated. When, a little over a week ago, Newcastle’s manager completed Kieran Trippier’s signing from Atlético Madrid it became apparent the England right-back shares an agent with Chris Wood and that the Burnley striker’s contract contained a £25m release clause. On Saturday Wood is expected to make his Newcastle debut and Howe must trust the most expensive 30-year-old signing in Premier League history makes an instant impact against visitors likely to be bolstered by Emmanuel Dennis’s attacking skills. If Howe is heartened by the absent quartet of first-team stalwarts Ranieri has temporarily lost to the Africa Cup of Nations, Newcastle’s manager will not be overjoyed that an administrative error denied Dennis the chance to represent Nigeria in Cameroon. Instead Watford’s £3.6m, 24-year-old signing from Club Brugge last summer is expected to pass a fitness test en route to St James’ Park, where Dennis hopes to add to his eight league goals in 17 club appearances this season. Given that Wood managed only three in 18 league games before departing Burnley, the sense that Newcastle have overpaid, if not panic-purchased, seems heightened. But that £25m fee could seem a bargain if Howe’s team leapfrog opponents two points and two places above them.
With Newcastle having won only once all season – against Burnley – and been knocked out of the FA Cup by League One Cambridge last weekend, it remains a big if. Yet for all Ranieri’s characteristic 100-watt optimism, not to mention the prospective return of the recently sidelined Ben Foster in goal, Watford are hardly in top form either. The Italian’s less than impressive record of two wins and 10 defeats since succeeding Xisco Muñoz meant it came as no surprise when the 15th manager at Vicarage Road in the past 10 years was asked this week whether he feared the sack. Far from taking offence, Ranieri smiled beatifically at the journalist interrogating him over Zoom. “The club believe in me, don’t worry, I have had assurances,” said a man without a victory since the 4-1 deconstruction of Manchester United in late November. “I speak with the board, with the chairman, with everybody, every day and we are all together – it’s fantastic. “I have a lot of experience and I say we will be safe. My experience tells me we are a very good team. Sooner or later, results on the pitch will show us who we really are.” Howe almost certainly needs Ranieri to be wrong, if his own side are to survive. Although Leeds and Everton – coincidentally Newcastle’s next two opponents – could conceivably be dragged into the relegation skirmish, the consensus suggests three of the current bottom four are Championship-bound. “We need wins,” Howe said. “We can’t survive on draws; that won’t be enough.” Much on Saturday could hinge on not only the performance of Watford’s former Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko – still a divisive figure on Tyneside – but the potential impact of Watford’s trio of bargain January signings: Hassane Kamara, Samir and Edo Kayembe, a left-back, centre-half and defensive midfielder, acquired from Nice, Udinese and Eupen respectively.
Newcastle’s recent Saudi Arabia-led takeover dictates that Howe – actively seeking two central defenders, a left-back, a midfielder and another forward – is shopping in a very different market. He may find that working for enormously wealthy owners is ultimately unlikely to be any less demanding than working for Watford’s infamously ruthless and controlling Pozzo family. “It’s a unique, delicate and very complex situation,” Howe said. “Newcastle does have a huge pull in many different ways but our league position isn’t one of them. Persuading top players to join a relegation fight is not an easy sell.” Lose to Watford and it will become infinitely harder.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/ranieri-says-watford-are-ready-to-fight-while-eddie-howe-looks-to-wood;sports
3553;3553;3553;3553;3591;3591;Arron Banks’s lawsuit against reporter a freedom of speech matter, court hears;2022-01-14;['Haroon Siddique'];['Arron Banks', 'UK news', 'Brexit', 'Russia', 'Newspapers', 'Media', 'National newspapers', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Foreign policy', 'Politics', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'The Observer'];The libel action brought by the multimillionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks against the Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr should concern “anyone who cares about freedom of speech in this country,” a court has been told. Banks, who funded the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign group has brought a defamation action against Cadwalladr over two instances – one in a Ted Talk and one in a tweet – in which she said the businessman was lying about his relationship with the Russian state. On Friday, the first day of the trial at the high court, in central London, Gavin Millar QC, representing Cadwalladr, said: “What my client said, she was legally entitled to say as part of a discussion about matters of the highest public interest.” Those matters were listed as campaign finance, foreign money and the use of social media messaging and personal data in the context of the EU referendum. Millar said Cadwalladr’s claims in the April 2019 Ted Talk were not new and had been covered by both her and other media organisations in the two preceding years without prompting legal action. He said the claim against her personally was an “attempt to stymie her investigative journalism about him and make other investigative journalists wary about pursuing theirs”. At a preliminary hearing in 2019, on the meaning of the remark about Banks made by Cadwalladr at the Ted technology conference and a related tweet, Mr Justice Saini concluded an average listener would have understood that: “On more than one occasion Mr Banks told untruths about a secret relationship he had with the Russian government in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding.” Millar said Cadwalladr did not intend to allege that Banks had received funding from the Russian government. In written submissions, he also claimed that, at the time of her comments, Banks had “no meaningful reputation” to be seriously harmed because: The digital, culture, media and sport committee had found that he had misled parliament in respect of his relationship with Russian officials and had sought to hide the same. There had been widespread publicity about Banks’s relationship with the Russian state and “his dishonesty and prevarication in respect of that relationship”. Leave.EU and Banks had been the subject of enforcement action by both the Electoral Commission (EC) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in relation to their activities during the referendum campaign. He said Cadwalladr’s reporting represented “public interest journalism raising issues going to the heart of the integrity of British democracy” which materially contributed to the investigations by the EC and the ICO and for which she also won an Orwell prize and was shortlisted for a Pulitzer prize. On Friday, Banks was questioned about his connections to Russia. Asked about why he had previously suggested the Russians had invited him to a meeting with its ambassador when it was actually initiated by Andy Wigmore, Banks denied it was because the former explanation was more palatable, saying he had simply misremembered. He used a similar explanation for not previously remembering he had met the Russian ambassador more than once. In his written witness statement, Banks said Cadwalladr’s remarks had led to comments to his sons by fellow students and a teacher about their father and that someone had thrown a glass of water over him accusing him of bullying the journalist and selling his country down the river. He said she had given an impression that he was “a traitor to this country and to the democratic process. That crosses the line.” His barrister, William McCormick QC, claimed Cadwalladr’s defence was “extreme” and “wholly unrealistic” in that it would enable her to continue to publish false statements complained of. “To suggest this is issued in bad faith simply to stop her reporting is a complete misconception,” he said. The hearing is expected to last four days.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/arron-banks-carole-cadwalladr-libel-trial;politics

Late last year there remained a sense that the former coach of City’s men’s under-18s was on borrowed time but, suddenly, no one is underestimating Taylor when he talks about stealing Chelsea’s crown.
“We want to win the league,” said Taylor before Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa. “We just need to stay in the hunt.” City finished second to Chelsea last season but their start to the new campaign was disrupted by injuries to key players, several of whom travelled to the Tokyo Olympics. When Taylor’s team lost four of their first 10 fixtures he seemed on the way out but the recent return to fitness of his England defenders Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton after long-term knee and ankle problems respectively has transformed City’s landscape. Last Sunday they won 6-0 at previously high-flying Brighton, their third straight league victory, and they sit fifth, nine points behind the leaders, Arsenal, but only four in arrears of Tottenham, occupants of the third and final Champions League position. “I think we’re in a good place,” said Taylor. “Confidence is high and I wouldn’t want to put limits on what we want to try to achieve. We just need to stay in the hunt. If we can do that, who knows what can happen?” The return of Bronze and Houghton also represents good news for England as they limber up for hosting this summer’s Euro 2022 with a four-team tournament also involving Canada, Spain and Germany next month.
Neither player has featured for the Lionesses since Sarina Wiegman became manager but Houghton is not thinking about reclaiming the England captaincy just yet. “My first focus over the next few weeks is to get my form and confidence back for Manchester City,” said the 33-year-old, who has signed an extended contract. “It’s just about playing well for City and then everything else will take care of itself.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/resurgent-manchester-city-still-have-sights-on-wsl-title-says-gareth-taylor;sports
3570;3570;3570;3570;3608;3608;Talking Horses: Up For Parol can get backers out of jail in Lanzarote Hurdle;2022-01-14;['Greg Wood'];['Horse racing tips', 'Horse racing', 'Sport'];"The 66-1 success of Boreham Bill in last season’s Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton Park was a skinner for the bookies but this has generally been a good race for punters since the trip was extended in 2007, with lightly raced, improving hurdlers holding a clear edge over more experienced handicappers. Marie’s Rock, Gelino Bello and Green Book all arrive with the right profile for Saturday’s renewal, and represent big-name stables that have sent out a Lanzarote winner within the last six years.
Jamie Snowden’s Up For Parol (2.40), though, has as strong a chance as any and seems to have crept in slightly under the radar at around 8-1. Like several recent winners of this race, Up For Parol had an underwhelming stab at chasing earlier in the campaign, but put up a career-best on his return to hurdles at Haydock in December and is just 6lb higher now. He has yet to race over this trip but is bred to improve for the step up and won a three-mile point-to-point in Ireland as a four-year-old. Warwick 1.18 Two comfortable wins have seen Brave Seasca take a 16lb hike in the ratings but he had plenty in hand at Ascot last time out and a swift hat-trick is likely. Kempton 1.32 Foxboro might well have won but for a last-fence mistake at Wincanton in December and he should go close off a 1lb higher mark here. Warwick 1.50 A 5lb penalty is unlikely to be enough to stop Threeunderthrufive notching up a fourth win from five starts over fences. Kempton 2.05 All four runners go to post with a serious chance but Eldorado Allen has consistency on his side and showed up well behind First Flow at Huntingdon last time.
Warwick 2.25 A top-class renewal of this Grade Two novice hurdle with Stag Horn, rated 103 on the Flat, marginally preferred at around 9-2 to back up a successful hurdling debut at Hereford in December. He won with something to spare there and has been gelded since. Warwick 3.00 After 452 days off Padleyourowncanoe made a solid return to action over hurdles last month. Dan Skelton’s runner had promising course form over fences for Colin Tizzard in 2020 and should go well at around 7-1. Kempton 3.15 More negatives than positives for several of these, so perhaps the veteran Double Shuffle, who has an excellent record over track and trip, may be up to repeating his win in this race – off a 1lb lower mark – last year. Warwick 3.35 Sporting John was only fourth when sent off at 5-4 at Cheltenham last time but the first two home there have franked the form since and he remains on a fair mark based on his win in November.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/14/talking-horses-up-for-parol-can-get-backers-out-of-jail-in-lanzarote-hurdle-horse-racing-tips;sports
3592;3592;3592;3592;3630;3630;Government in dispute with ‘VIP lane’ firm referred by Tory peer;2022-01-14;['David Conn'];['Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'Politics', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Society', 'Public services policy', 'Michelle Mone'];The government is in dispute over millions of surgical gowns supplied by the PPE business awarded £203m contracts via the fast-track “VIP lane” after a referral by the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, it has emerged. The health minister Edward Argar broke with more than a year of secrecy over the surgical gowns supplied by the company, PPE Medpro, telling Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, this week that the government was “in mediation” with the company. Previously, the last solid information provided about PPE Medpro’s products was in December 2020, when the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: “The gowns delivered by Medpro have not been distributed to the frontline.” DHSC sources said then that the gowns – delivered by PPE Medpro under its second contract, for £122m – were still being “evaluated” to ensure they met safety and quality standards. The Guardian recently reported that Lady Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, appear to have been secretly involved in the business of PPE Medpro, despite their repeated denials that they had any “role or function” in the company. The government revealed in November that Mone had originally referred the company in May 2020 to the office of her fellow Conservative peer Theodore Agnew, a minister responsible for procurement in the Cabinet Office during the pandemic. Agnew referred PPE Medpro to the VIP fast-track process for politically connected firms, and within weeks the DHSC awarded the company contracts totalling £203m. The VIP lane was ruled unlawful by the high court this week, after a challenge by the Good Law Project, with Mrs Justice O’Farrell ruling that it breached the requirement to treat potential suppliers equally. Argar refused earlier this month to tell Rayner whether the gowns supplied by PPE Medpro had been used, saying this was “commercially sensitive”. Asked by Rayner to clarify how this was deemed to be the case, the minister provided his answer on 11 January, saying: “The information is considered commercially sensitive as the department is currently engaged in a mediation process with PPE Medpro concerning their products, which involves confidentiality undertakings.” Mediation is a method of resolving contractual disputes to avoid litigation in the courts. Anthony Page, a director and the sole registered owner of PPE Medpro Ltd in the UK, who works for Barrowman in the Isle of Man, confirmed that mediation was ongoing over the gowns, saying via a lawyer that “a dispute was raised many months after delivery”. The lawyer said: “Our client vigorously defends its position in relation to the supply of the gowns that were supplied on time, at a very competitive price and fully in accordance with the contract.” He said the face masks supplied by PPE Medpro – under its first contract for £80.85m – “was all carried out without any challenge whatsoever at any time”. Rayner said: “This government has wasted millions on crony contracts doled out through the VIP lane, which the high court found was not just dodgy but outright illegal. “No wonder they are desperate to cover up the facts. But hiding behind the cover of commercial sensitivity just won’t wash with the public, whose money they were spending. We need to know if this PPE was actually used to protect NHS staff and what the government is doing to recover taxpayers’ cash if any of it was not.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “All PPE must undergo rigorous checks so they meet the safety and quality required. The department is undertaking work across the entire portfolio of PPE contracts to identify all instances of supplier non-delivery or product quality failure, and to recover the costs of undelivered or substandard PPE.” The spokesperson clarified that this referred broadly to all PPE, “not specifically to Medpro”, and declined to answer questions about the mediation or the PPE Medpro products, saying these details were “commercially sensitive”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/government-dispute-vip-lane-firm-referred-tory-peer-michelle-mone-ppe-medpro;politics
3602;3602;3602;3602;3640;3640;France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap;2022-01-14;['Jillian Ambrose'];['EDF Energy', 'Business', 'France', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money'];The French government will force EDF, the state energy giant, to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year. The company lost a fifth of its market value on Friday after the French government set out plans to cap rising energy bills, which include forcing EDF to sell electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors to rival home suppliers at well below the current record high market prices. The move underlines pressure on governments across Europe to help households squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been accused of being “missing in action” over soaring energy bills. He has been in talks with MPs and companies to agree a package of measures to soften the blow of the national energy crisis, but no decisions have been made. In Spain, the government introduced a windfall tax on electricity generators and gas producers that are able to profit from the record market highs to help keep home energy bills low. In Germany, the government has slashed a surcharge on bills used to support renewable energy schemes, which will instead receive extra state subsidies drawn from higher carbon taxes. EDF also told investors that its nuclear power generation for the year ahead would be about 10% lower than initially expected due technical problems at a handful of its nuclear reactors. The French government, which faced fierce public protest against fuel price hikes in 2018, has already cut some electricity taxes to help slow the rise in home energy bills at an estimated €8bn cost to the state. Governments across Europe are under pressure to intervene in the energy market to protect households against an unprecedented surge in wholesale market prices, driven by a global gas supply crunch that has lifted markets to all-time highs. Under the French government’s new measures, it has kept a tight lid on the regulated price that EDF is allowed to charge for its nuclear electricity, which will rise to €46.2 per megawatt-hour, from €42/MWh, despite a record surge in electricity market prices across Europe in recent months. EDF said the plan could hit its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by between €7.7bn and €8.4bn based on market prices in December and January. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but has offered no details on this. The nuclear power giant also told investors that its reactors would generate less electricity than expected this year. This is because of a string of faults at five of its nuclear plants which will require downtime to undertake maintenance work. EDF estimates that it will generate 300-330 terawatt-hours this year, down from 330-360 TWh previously. The company’s share price tumbled from €10.35 at Thursday’s close to €7.92 on Friday morning.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills;business and economy
3611;3611;3611;3611;3649;3649;The ultimate sex tape scandal: how Pam and Tommy’s stolen video shook the world;2022-01-14;['Zoe Williams'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Lily James', 'Pamela Anderson'];"By Christmas 1995, it was moderately common knowledge that a “sex tape” existed of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, privately filmed on their honeymoon that year, after a whirlwind 96-hour romance. As the star of Baywatch, Anderson was so globally famous that other, also famous TV shows had storylines about her. Lee, the Mötley Crüe drummer, was also extremely well known, mainly as a sex, drugs and rock’n’roll poster boy, partly for mooning whenever he went on stage. Their union, and its impact, was a molecular chemistry kind of affair; like oxygen and hydrogen, each, alone, was a powerful element, but combined they were altogether more culturally powerful – her eroticism slightly neutralised by marriage, his trouble-seeking rendered a bit safer beside her all-American (actually Canadian) smile. Let me unpack that a bit: it was the 90s. Women, even if they were gay, and definitely not if they weren’t, didn’t ogle or sanction the ogling of other women’s breasts. Men who took drugs and had tattoos didn’t get asked to endorse sports brands. The highly anticipated forthcoming Disney+ bio-series, Pam & Tommy, shows Lee in a much more unflattering light than he was seen in his heyday, but he was never thought of as a peach.
The show is a sumptuous affair, lingering on every luxurious detail of their Malibu mansion, Lee’s tattoos, Anderson’s cartoon beauty, but don’t mistake it for wealth porn (which is, of course, TV gold at the moment). His personality, her rather winning denial and inching disillusionment, tell a tense story. It’s ostensibly a caper about the sex tape and its fallout, but the simmering volatility – of Lee but also of almost everyone – creates a suspense deeper than the presence of all these celebrities would have you expect. The sex tape, plus a load of guns and jewellery, were stolen from Lee’s safe at home just before Halloween 1995. By Christmas, it was in a Daily Mail year-in-review round-up, so everyone knew about it, but nobody had seen it. Fair play – it wasn’t until 1996 that the couple even realised the tape was missing – but there was more going on. In ways that wouldn’t become clear until much later, this was a period of tectonic shifts: from old media to new; from old to new versions of celebrity, privacy, image and brand; and from old norms around sex, porn, exhibitionism and voyeurism to new ones that still aren’t settled. A lot of what used to make sex sleazy was in the detail. The lines between normal and kinky, clean and dirty, were drawn by the conventions of consumption; if this thing you were buying was nice, you’d be able to buy it in a nice place. Likewise, to watch this sex tape, you’d have had to send $59.95 to a Canadian T-shirt company in New York, who would then send you a VHS via Amsterdam. Or if you happened to be in the US, you’d have to know a guy who knew the guy who’d scammed the original thief, who would sell a copy straight into your hands for $175.
None of this was the kind of thing respectable people did. You would look dim if you hadn’t heard about the sex tape, but to say you’d seen it, well, you’d at least need a reason. The same couldn’t be said of sex tapes that exploded five or 10 years later – Kim Kardashian’s was leaked in 2007, Paris Hilton’s in 2003. There are so many circumstances under which you might have seen those: someone could have ironically linked to them on a chat forum, or you were just browsing. The point is, you wouldn’t need a reason. You could buy anything, anywhere, and often not even for money. In sex terms, the fundamental collapse brought about by the internet age isn’t so much of privacy or the right to be forgotten (as EU law has it), but in a shared consensus around what sexual decency actually is, who’s allowed to have it, who’s allowed to watch it, who’s exploited by it, who’s enjoying it. The truly amazing thing is how many years have passed without bringing us any closer to a new resolution. The Pam and Tommy story is astonishing in part because of their naivety. The series, starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan, is based on a 2014 Rolling Stone article, Pam and Tommy: The Untold Story of the World’s Most Infamous Sex Tape, which that details how, once they discovered the tape was missing, they sought to contain the leak. They sent heavies round to harass people they suspected of the theft and brought doomed lawsuits against distributors, as if the old rules were still in place and nobody could distribute your film unless you’d signed a release form. This isn’t a dumb-celeb story; their naivety was echoed across culture, subculture and the law – a sincere belief even among pornographers that if you hadn’t signed off on a film, you could prevent it from being seen.
It was a first-world problem, sure, but there was genuine crisis in the years that followed about the value of celebrity: if you couldn’t control your own content, you couldn’t monetise it, and if you couldn’t monetise it, what actually was it? Enter Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, with a thought experiment. They didn’t personally release their tapes, and threatened lawsuits to prevent distribution, but both ultimately went on to profit from the notoriety, having understood that the rules had permanently changed. If you don’t own the content but still own the identity, flip the equation, so the content is not rationed and the identity becomes obliteratingly large: rather than guard your privacy, show everything. The funny thing about those sex tapes is that they don’t really work as pornography – Hilton’s is very fey, Kardashian’s is all random camera angles. But they’re not supposed to; they’re not really about sex but the body as a means of production: what can it sell? There was considerable debate in the early 00s around whether Hilton and Kardashian were the puppets or puppet-masters of the new age: in retrospect, I think it was misogynistic. If Mark Zuckerberg had done it, nobody would have asked if someone else were pulling his strings; though arguably, there would have been no mileage in him being naked. So there’s that. Anderson and Lee’s video had a distinctive mood, in that it felt private; it was made by two people, for each other, in an age in which mass accidental distribution wasn’t on the horizon. Later, when sex tapes became more common, the question was always whether they’d been released cynically by the subject or somehow finagled by dishonest means. There was a manosphere subset who were always questing after the original Anderson/Lee experience, who didn’t want to be consumers but peeping toms.
When the great nude-dumps of the 10s came along, first in Celebgate in 2014, then in the Fappening of 2017, it was no accident they were posted on 4chan, image board of choice for the incel and other far-right misogynist movements. These were naked pictures, mostly of female actors, obtained without consent via a breach of iCloud security, and the point was that they were of stars you wouldn’t typically see naked: Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton. Many of the women depicted denied the authenticity of the images. The whole business was about more than naked bodies – which, let’s face it, by the middle of the last decade, you could find anywhere – it was about sticking it to women who wouldn’t put out. The Fappening was basically a metaphor for the incel identity; men who experience sex not as participants but as thieving observers, despised, marginal, illegitimate. Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee had two sons before divorcing in 1998. A detail that reads like a pub-quiz curiosity is that Anderson went on to marry Rick Salomon – the other party in the Paris Hilton sex video – in 2007. They got an annulment a year later, but remarried in 2014, divorcing again the year after that. (Arguably, Anderson is just very into nuptials; she managed a marriage, an annulment and another marriage to someone different during 2020, which I think puts your sourdough successes to shame.) Regarding her and Salomon, though, it seems likely their sex tapes were an absolutely seismic, defining event for both of them, which gave them a huge amount in common. As interesting as it is, to watch privacy mutate into exposure, self into image into brand, sex into advertorial, it is monumentally asymmetrical: to the many, a curiosity; to two people, essentially the rest of their lives. It’s a reparation the world wide web will never be able to make: to rectify or even acknowledge the scale of that impact, when a billion eyes all turn to glance at the same thing at once.

3621;3621;3621;3621;3659;3659;Six Nations countdown: six England squad dilemmas for Eddie Jones | Robert Kitson;2022-01-14;['Robert Kitson'];['Six Nations', 'England rugby union team', 'Eddie Jones', 'Owen Farrell', 'Manu Tuilagi', 'Rugby union', 'Sport', 'Six Nations 2022'];"England name their squad for the Six Nations championship on Tuesday. With the 2023 Rugby World Cup just over the horizon, here are six key questions for Eddie Jones to resolve. 1) Should Owen Farrell be rushed back? Sporting life can be extraordinarily harsh. A touch of Covid, the rise of Marcus Smith and, most recently, ankle surgery have combined to make Farrell’s future a matter of some debate. Even if Eddie Jones’s captain, now 30, is instantly back on it when he returns for Saracens this month, the management will be conscious of what happened this time last year. Exhibit A will be Jones’s ill-fated decision to keep faith with some rusty Saracens that helped Scotland win at Twickenham for the first time since 1983. Once bitten, twice shy? With Courtney Lawes having impressed as a stand-in skipper, Farrell’s captaincy is also less essential than it was. Given Smith’s autumn promise, it would be a retrograde step not to start the Harlequin at 10. That leaves three options for Farrell: shift him to centre, stick him on the bench or save him up for later in the tournament. If Manu Tuilagi is fit then he and Henry Slade are currently the best English centre combination. But who would not want Farrell’s warrior example, iron will and match-turning goal-kicking? On a dark, cold night in Murrayfield, there could be a case for the bench option. 2) Who starts at No 8? Let’s state the glaringly obvious. The best No8 in this season’s Premiership has been Alex Dombrandt of Harlequins. Those who still consider him a flighty risk clearly did not watch the Big Game at Twickenham just after Christmas. It is not just the way the 24-year-old pops up in all the right places, it is the depth of rugby intelligence when he does so. His attacking angles are beautifully chosen, he holds his depth to make sure he can surge on to the ball and his understanding with Smith appears telepathic. Yet Jones, of late, has picked Tom Curry at eight with Dombrandt on the bench, preferring the defensive excellence of Sam Underhill alongside Lawes in the back row. Against Scotland though, England will need more ball-carrying oomph and Dombrandt’s breakdown skills will also be useful – which is tough on the dynamic Sam Simmonds, Billy Vunipola and, potentially, Underhill. But now is the time for Jones to look forward, not back. 3) Does the scrum need rebooting? In all the excitement surrounding England’s breathless 27-26 win over the world champion Springboks in November, it was possible to gloss over the second-half travails of England’s scrum and maul. Admittedly their propping stocks were diminished by Covid and injury, propelling Sale’s Bevan Rodd into the spotlight, but England have not been ruling the set pieces with the iron fist that Jones is seeking. It would also be stretching it to say Kyle Sinckler and Will Stuart have been ripping it up at club level, even if scrummaging is never a one-man operation. The two standout English-qualified Premiership props just now are probably Joe Marler and Dan Cole but will Jones fancy recalling the latter four months shy of his 35th birthday? Harlequins’ Will Collier would hold an end up but is he going to win a World Cup? This is also a big Six Nations for Matt Proudfoot, England’s scrum coach. While Proudfoot helped South Africa to 2019 World Cup glory his CV is not without its leaner patches. He won four caps for Scotland via his Dumfries-born grandmother without tasting victory and also endured a nasty bout of Covid just prior to the 2021 Six Nations when England finished fifth. He will be keen for a more upbeat start to 2022.
4) What if Tuilagi is not ready? It invariably seems to be touch and go with Tuilagi. All that hard work to make the team in the autumn and he lasted just eight minutes against South Africa before his hamstring went. This time he is aiming to prove his fitness against his old club Leicester on 30 January, just six days before England are due at Murrayfield. Already it feels worryingly tight – the timescale, not the hamstring – unless Jones is truly desperate. This might, as previously mentioned, re-open the door for Farrell or potentially an alternative 12. The Gloucester centre Mark Atkinson has been around numerous blocks, will fancy second-guessing his clubmate Chris Harris in Scotland’s midfield and has a deft kicking game. Failing that, Jones could slide Slade to 12 and keep faith with Joe Marchant, who was influential against South Africa, or quietly recall the criminally underrated Saracen Alex Lozowski. Jones has already picked 20 different centre pairings during his tenure and a 21st may be brewing. 5) Is there any uncapped X factor out there? Flip back to this time last year and who were the squad’s exciting, fresh-faced newcomers? Step forward Paolo Odogwu and Harry Randall who, for assorted reasons, did not play a minute of Six Nations rugby between them. As a result we still don’t really know whether they have “it” or not. It was a similar tale with Louis Lynagh last autumn. This time expect Wasps’ bullocking Alfie Barbeary to be there or thereabouts when the squad list is unveiled. So prodigious is his ball-carrying strength that the 21-year-old has been encouraged to switch from hooker to the back-row and he also loves a challenge, as underlined in his club’s last-ditch stand against Leicester last Sunday. The time has also come for England to identify their preferred choices at scrum-half and on the wing and then stick with them. If Alex Mitchell and Adam Radwan are to be World Cup squad members, now is the time to trust them more.
6) Will Scotland be too good regardless? It is worth stressing that this year’s championship will be as competitive as a sack of hungry ferrets. England fans may also recall Storm Ciara, which made the corresponding 2020 fixture even trickier. Without a costly misjudgment from Stuart Hogg, which delivered the five-metre scrum platform from which Ellis Genge scored the game’s only try, England might now be travelling north having not defeated their hosts in the Six Nations for five years. Scotland’s team-sheet will be well stocked with Lions and last year they won in both London and Paris. In the past England have been ambushed by something they failed to see coming but those days have long gone. And Jacob Rees-Mogg has already written the home side’s pre-game team talk.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/six-nations-countdown-england-squad-dilemmas-for-eddie-jones-rugby-union;sports

Speaking before the day-night fifth Test, Harrison expressed a desire that “fantastic” Joe Root remains as England captain and though Chris Silverwood, the head coach, was not afforded the same endorsement, a consolation victory in Hobart and a 3-1 scoreline in Australia would apparently represent “a better story”.
Ashley Giles, the director of men’s cricket, and Mo Bobat, the performance director, are compiling a report on the tour but Harrison insisted they were “not marking their own homework”. This document will be submitted to the ECB’s cricket committee, chaired by Andrew Strauss, with recommendations then going to the governing body’s board. But Harrison, who said he drew satisfaction from England simply completing the tour given the various pandemic-related logistical headaches, has also suggested a wider review of the English game that asks “broader strategic questions” should also result from a 12-month period that returned a record nine Test defeats. “Our priority is Test cricket,” Harrison said. “We want to be successful at white-ball cricket, of course we do. But we absolutely need to be successful at Test cricket.
“It feels like this is a moment to reset the importance of red-ball cricket in our domestic schedule and for us to recalibrate how we play first-class cricket in the UK. It’s a brilliant opportunity for us to come together as a game and really sort that once and for all. “There’s been plenty of debate around this, and sometimes the ability to effect change on something as complicated as our schedule is when you have a performance-related issue. And we have one now. “Let’s have the right balance of red and white ball. Let’s look at when we play red-ball cricket. There is a debate about whether we play more red-ball cricket through the summer. Let’s find a way to be able to do that. “We are trying to replicate conditions in Test cricket as much as possible. We do it really well in the white-ball game. We are currently not doing the right thing with respect to red-ball cricket. We have seen that play out over the last 12 months.”
This Damascene moment will surprise many given English cricket’s apparent shift towards the white-ball formats under Harrison’s watch, not least the creation of a new short-form tournament, the Hundred, that has been placed on top of an already bulging county summer. The 50-year-old said he did not accept this interpretation of the ECB’s priorities, however, stressing the volume and scheduling of domestic formats was down to the Professional Game Group, which is made up of county chief executives. There is also the issue of the international calendar, which has seen a fixture pile-up caused by pandemic-related postponements and seen mental health shoot up the agenda due to quarantine periods and so-called “bubble” environments.
Even if Covid-19 abates, the International Cricket Council has agreed a new broadcast deal with white-ball World Cups every year, while a similar squeeze on windows comes through the expansion of the Indian Premier League from eight teams to 10. Harrison added: “Less fixtures? Domestically, that’s certainly a debate we need to have. Internationally, when we get out of the immediate aftermath of the wake of Covid, we’ve got to look at how we manage fixture workloads.
“This is something that the chief execs committee at ICC need to tackle in the round. With an additional few weeks of IPL every year and a World Cup every year ... it is a difficult challenge for world cricket. “I don’t think we’ve lived through a year of a 72-match IPL and a World Cup in the same year. 2022 will provide that and it’ll be interesting how we manage workloads.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/ashes-defeat-a-brilliant-opportunity-to-reset-domestic-game-says-tom-harrison;sports
3655;3655;3655;3655;3694;3694;Emotional labour is an important term – but I mostly use it to get out of things | Emma Brockes;2022-01-14;['Emma Brockes'];['Language', 'Gender', 'World news'];"Like a lot of people, for many years I said yes to things I didn’t want to do. This was a combination of conditioning – it pays to be “nice” – vague fear of missing out and basic conflict avoidance. Without giving it much thought, it seemed to me there was no easy way to turn things down without causing offence or running against the grain of my own personality. Hostage negotiators and people in business presumably had workarounds for this inhibition, but whatever their tactics, they weren’t available to the rest of us. All we had, growing up, was the maxim “Just say no” – a slogan so useless it became a universally recognised and decades-long joke. A lot has changed since then. In the past 10 years, a language has developed, mainly from social justice and feminist movements, but also from academia, to describe latterly opaque states of discomfort and the right we have to resist them. Chief among these are terms reaching to describe the more intangible end of labour inequality. If the term “sexism” was popularised in the late 1960s to frame basic double standards between men and women, modern iterations seek out more subtle disparities. Years before the phrase “mental load” took off, I recall a friend describing, via thousands of words, how her husband was “very good” at doing 50% of the childcare, while relying wholly on her as his line manager. (The example she used has stayed with me: he would, she said, “gladly” take the kids to a birthday party at the weekend, but it wouldn’t occur to him in a million years that they had to turn up with gifts, which needed buying and wrapping.) The phrases that evolved to address this imbalance are good, and they work. In fact, “mental load” and its adjacent term, “emotional labour”, work so well, they have been absorbed into common usage and promptly lost much of their original meaning. Emotional labour was, apparently, coined in the 1980s in academia to describe service industry jobs requiring the faking of a cheerful demeanour. It doesn’t mean that now. With trigger-happy application, you can bolt that phrase on to almost any situation, conversation or obligation you’d rather not be involved in, and back out feeling gloriously wronged. I say this without judgment. I do it all the time. My favourite, and by far the most useful, of these newish locutions is the phrase: “I’m not comfortable with that.” It’s just brilliant. It can get you out of almost anything. It hints at some unspeakable trigger event, and as such forestalls most pushback. It also has in its favour that particularly American brand of officiousness that evokes my other favourite word, “boundaries”. One can ditch disagreeable people left, right and centre these days via use of the word “boundaries” while escaping any feelings of guilt. I am not being mean: I am merely protecting myself from your inadequate boundaries. It’s clear that this get-out-of-jail-free card is not how the language was intended to be used, although I’m inclined to think – possibly delusionally – that even in diluted form, the net result is still good. Being able to politely back out of something without tying yourself in knots is useful, particularly for women socialised to comply. Feeling less responsible for other adults’ unruly emotions is a good thing, too. Common use of these terms is also an expression of individualistic self-advancement that has little or nothing to do with the power imbalance the language was created to address. Real-world application of academic language is notoriously sloppy, and can lead to bizarre inversions; this is no different. And yet, once you start, it is almost impossible to stop. You don’t even have to say the words, you just have to think them. A small example that I’m still trying to process. A while ago, I received a very long and angry email from a woman who accused me of slighting her. The offending interaction had occurred two years earlier, and while her email seemed unreasonable, she was clearly upset and I was, in the first instance, alarmed. I’m not obliged to engage with everyone who demands it; on the other hand, the distress was real, and perhaps I could assuage it if I spent enough time on the reply. Dithering, I forwarded the whole thing to a friend, who took one look at it and made a summary judgment. “She’s asking you to do emotional labour,” he said, and bingo: I was off the hook. Not only off the hook, but righteously indignant: I’m not replying; she’s a vampire; case closed.

3656;3656;3656;3656;3695;3695;Lana Del Rey’s greatest songs – ranked!;2022-01-14;['Alexis Petridis'];['Lana Del Rey', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Culture'];"20. Summertime Sadness (2012) Apparently inspired by the suicide of a friend and remixed by Cedric Gervais into that rarest of things – a party-starting Lana Del Rey banger – Summertime Sadness was a hook-laden highlight of her second album Born to Die, later becoming a key text in the #prettywhenyoucry “sad girl” aesthetic Del Rey inadvertently spawned. 19. High By the Beach (2015) High By the Beach sounds superb: shimmering organ, exhausted-sounding washes of synth, a trap rhythm that seems to have been sapped of all its swaggering machismo. It perfectly fits the song’s mood of weariness, an early sign of its author’s wariness about her celebrity: “I can’t survive if this is all that’s real.” 18. Blue Banisters (2021) There was a time when Lana Del Rey singing about riding a tractor in Oklahoma would have seemed no more likely than Lana Del Rey doing a cover of the Hokey Cokey, but here we are. Even by her more recent standards, the music here is minimal, which only adds to the song’s mood of creeping disquiet.
17. Norman Fucking Rockwell (2019) It’s hard not to be cheered by the lyrics of Norman Fucking Rockwell: after umpteen songs in which she pledged undying fealty to some appalling-sounding character, it offers the sound of Lana Del Rey telling one of them where to get off in pleasingly direct terms. Also: fantastic chorus. 16. Wild at Heart (2021) It was probably only a matter of time until Lana Del Rey named a song after a David Lynch movie – Lynch’s 80s collaborations with singer Julee Cruise have clearly been a major influence from the start. Wild at Heart is a striking, hazy imagining of a world without Lana Del Rey in it: a fantasy of escape from celebrity.
15. Terrence Loves You (2015) Lana Del Rey’s favourite song from Honeymoon, apparently because it was “jazzy”. It’s jazzy in the sense that a torch song is jazzy, but – beyond the parched, reverb-heavy guitars that recall Mazzy Star – the most obvious influence is John Barry’s Theme From Midnight Cowboy, echoed in the lovely descending vocal melody. 14. Lust for Life (ft the Weeknd) (2014) Like Dory Previn’s Mary C Brown and the Hollywood Sign, Lust for Life is haunted by the 1932 suicide of failed actor Peg Entwhistle: like the relentless pulsing synthesiser in the background, the allusions to it add a dark undertow to what initially sound like bullish assertions of strength from Del Rey and Abel Tesfaye: “We’re masters of our own fate.” 13. Hope is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have – But I Have It (2019) A cynic might suggest that, from its title to its lyrics (“24/7 Sylvia Plath”, “spilling my guts with the Bowery bums is the only love I’ve ever known”), this is a song that teeters on the verge of self-parody. But it’s hard to be cynical while it’s playing – just a piano and voice, it’s the model of elegant simplicity. 12. National Anthem (2012) The height of Lana Del Rey in Stepford-Wife-as-pop-star mode, National Anthem pitches her blank vocal delivering satirical sex-and-materialism lyrics – “Money is the reason we exist, everybody knows it” – against jarring musical euphoria: a skyscraping chorus, a string arrangement with a hint of Bitter Sweet Symphony about it.
11. Mariners Apartment Complex (2018) With its song titles borrowed from Neil Young and its lyrical nods to Joni Mitchell, Norman Fucking Rockwell! is an album immersed in Laurel Canyon’s late 60s singer-songwriter scene, an inspiration that finds its fullest expression on Mariners Apartment Complex, a beautifully sullen, icy update of said scene’s folk-based style. 10. West Coast (2014) The first evidence of Ultraviolence’s sonic shift – aided by Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys – into more guitar-driven territory: the initial riff is equal parts Blondie’s Atomic and the Beatles’ And I Love Her, the lyrics a tribute to a mythologised California, the sudden slowing of tempo that announces the chorus is fabulous. 9. Black Bathing Suit (2021) Lana Del Rey’s lockdown song, which captures something of the lockdown experience by being impressively scattered. The lyrics leap without warning from posturing (“Let me show you how bad girls do”) to tearily confessional (“I’m not friends with my mother”), the music from exquisitely controlled – the tempo shifts in the chorus – to unravelled and chaotic. 8. White Dress (2021)
Tellingly, Lana Del Rey’s songs have gone from fetishising fame and success to yearning for a life without either. A distant spiritual cousin of Joni Mitchell’s For Free – which she covered – White Dress breathily suggests she was happier as a waitress or unknown singer: ironically it’s set to the kind of irresistible tune that sent her Chemtrails Over the Country Club album to No 1. 7. Love (2017) An ambiguous ode to youth: the lyrical message is be-young-be-foolish-be-happy but the tone of the vocal coolly indifferent, there’s something noticeably ominous about the music. How you take it probably depends on how old you are, but there’s no arguing with the power of the tune, or the sweet reference to the Beach Boys’ troubled ballad Don’t Worry Baby. 6. Ride (2012) Released in the aftermath Born to Die’s success – and appended to the album’s deluxe Paradise Edition – Ride was produced by Rick Rubin and drenched in strings, but beneath them lurks a supremely classy country-soul song: for someone whose vocal abilities were mocked early on, Del Rey’s octave-leaping performance is nervily powerful. 5. The Greatest (2019)
Shortly after the release of Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Lana Del Rey shared a cover of Rolling Stone with Elton John. You can hear his influence on The Greatest, a gorgeously elegiac song that could have made it on to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: its everything-is-screwed mood – “I want everything to feel like it used to” – however, is pure Trump-era America. 4. Brooklyn Baby (2014) Self-baiting autobiography, or bitchy hipster character assassination? It isn’t clear, and perhaps it doesn’t matter: just luxuriate in Brooklyn Baby’s swooning melody, the lovely moments where the beat drops out, leaving just Del Rey, a trebly guitar and the buzzing of an amplifier. Lou Reed was meant to sing backing vocals, but died the day of the session. 3. Young and Beautiful (2013) By some distance the best thing on the star-studded soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby, Young and Beautiful is Lana Del Rey at her most haunting. Co-opted by rather than commissioned for the film, its saga of fleeting youth and celebrity fits its story perfectly, the melody is exquisite. 2. Venice Bitch (2018) Nearly 10 minutes long, Venice Bitch hypnotises the listener for its entire duration. It shifts, subtly, from tender folk rock – replete with references to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 album Déjà Vu – to a heady swirl of synthesiser and guitar feedback, to a refrain based on Tommy James’s Crimson and Clover. It’s expansive, experimental and enveloping: a triumph. 1. Video Games (2011)
With Lana Del Rey a constant, influential presence in pop over the last decade, it’s easy to forget how striking her first appearance was. She’s written umpteen fantastic songs since, but Video Games is the kind of once-in-a-career song that stops you dead in your tracks: the slow building strings, the funereal beat, the lyric’s unsettling combination of romance and dread, the glassy-eyed vocal, the sense that it was utterly unlike anything else happening in pop at the time. As introductions to a new pop phenomenon go, it may well be the best of the past 20 years: the passing of time has done nothing to dim its potency.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/14/lana-del-reys-greatest-songs-ranked;entertainment and culture
3659;3659;3659;3659;3698;3698;Experience: I live in the 1990s;2022-01-14;['N/A'];['Life and style', 'Interiors', 'Design', 'Homes', 'Spice Girls'];"I was born in 1998, at the tail end of the decade I love. Titanic was in cinemas, Britney Spears released … Baby One More Time, Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls and Apple released the bright turquoise iMac computer. I was too young to appreciate those things, but my first home in Mansfield was full of 90s decor. I loved the fun of it. The hallway was decorated in tongue and groove wood panelling, with green and terracotta wallpaper. We had a tangerine kitchen with bottle green appliances, and my bedroom was covered in suns and moons. Homes weren’t decorated for Instagram then. People were less self-conscious and weren’t afraid to experiment. I moved house about 15 times during my childhood but anything that harked back to the 90s felt like home. As a teenager, I enjoyed discovering discarded 90s memorabilia in car boot sales and charity shops. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s and came out as gay at 15. I was often painted as different, so toned down my interests. But in the sixth form, I encountered other people with eclectic tastes, so I started having fun and dressing in Levi’s 501s, silk shirts and baggy Sweater Shop and Kangol jumpers – the quintessential 90s uniform. I’d built a collection of 90s tech at home. Dad gave me a Kenwood hi-fi for my 14th birthday – he’d got it for £40 in an online auction. I bought the debut 1998 iMac for £50 on eBay, and an old Sanyo TV after seeing an ad for it in the newspaper. I use them all, although the functionality of the computer is limited. I sourced every Now That’s What I Call Music CD from 1990 to 1999 from record stores, charity shops and eBay, and collected hardback interior books from the decade, including Laura Ashley catalogues for £2 each. I am now an illustrator and much of my work is inspired by the 90s. Two years ago, my boyfriend, Matthew, and I moved into a cottage with my parents in Bakewell, Derbyshire. Mum and Dad gave me free rein over decor. I gave Mum a full Laura Ashley bedroom with pale pink and white floral bedding. The kitchen has 90s yellow appliances, like the ones my gran had. In the living room, there is a CD tower with albums from Blur, the Cardigans, Dubstar and Steps. A Spice Girls calendar hangs on the door and we have an old VHS player. I watch my Vicar of Dibley box set on it. I drive an old blue Austin Metro and recently bought myself a project car, a 1984 beige Toyota Carina, to do up.
Matthew wasn’t interested in the 90s when we started dating, but after three years together, my interest has rubbed off on him, too, and we share clothes. Everyone in our small village knows me because of how I dress. When I go into Manchester or Sheffield, I blend in more, especially now the 90s are popular again. I used to get looks that suggest I’ve dropped in from another planet. It’s great to see the resurgence but it’s forced up prices, which is annoying. I saw a shirt I got for £1 in a charity shop bin years ago selling for £60 in a vintage shop. During lockdown, I shared videos of my home on TikTok. I wanted to bring nostalgia and joy during a miserable time. People messaged me saying it reminded them of the homes and relatives they loved; others have offered to send me memorabilia. I’ve met friends online who are into different decades and we send each other charity shop finds. I have one friend who is obsessed with the 70s; I’ve sent him Pyrex glasses and a candlewick bedspread.
Socially and politically, we’ve come a long way since the 90s. As a gay man, it’s not a decade that would have been easy for me but I’m happy enjoying its legacy. It still holds relevance. Watching the Free Britney case was upsetting: I like to watch Top of the Pops reruns from when she’s a teenager and it’s sad to think how bad it became for her. But I’ve loved seeing the big comebacks, such as Steps and the Spice Girls. I don’t take my interest too seriously. I have a smartphone, I use the internet, but my personal taste has expanded into a lifestyle I find fun. When people ask me why I do it, there is no other reason than it brings me joy. Isn’t that enough? • As told to Deborah Linton Do you have an experience to share?

3661;3661;3661;3661;3700;3700;English clubs dominate international transfer spend in 2021 with £1bn outlay;2022-01-14;['Paul MacInnes'];['Transfer window', 'Premier League', 'Fifa', 'Football', 'Finances', 'Sport'];"English clubs spent more on international transfers than those of any country and completed seven of the 10 biggest international deals in 2021, according to new data from Fifa. Fifa’s Global Transfer Report, which excludes domestic deals, also shows that clubs in England sold the most players and recouped the most transfer fees too, as the financial dominance of the country’s football in the world game was confirmed, despite an overall drop in transfer spending.
The report shows that $4.86bn (£3.5bn) was spent worldwide in 2021 in recruiting footballers, falling by as much as a third from the record totals set pre-pandemic in 2019. Nearly 88% of transfers did not involve a fee. English clubs’ spending fell too, from $1.627bn in 2020 to $1.386bn last year. At more than a quarter of all spending, however, it was more than $400m higher than the second-highest spenders, Italy. Romelu Lukaku’s £97.5m transfer to Chelsea from Internazionale was the biggest international deal of 2021, with Jadon Sancho’s £73m move from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United second. Raphaël Varane, Ibrahima Konaté and Martin Ødegaard also feature, but included in the top 10 global deals were some signings who have barely registered in the Premier League to date: Amad Diallo, who joined Manchester United from Udinese, and Bryan Gil, who signed for Spurs from Sevilla. As a transfer within a domestic league, Jack Grealish’s £100m move from Aston Villa to Manchester City does not feature.
Tammy Abraham’s move from Chelsea to Roma was the fifth-biggest international move of the year, evidence of English football also being able to recoup money through sales. English clubs took more money in transfer fees than any other country, recouping $548m of the money they spent, and they sold or loaned more players than any other country too. English clubs sold or loaned 885 players, with Manchester City top of the global list with 41, and Wolves also appearing in the top 10, with 30. Fifa’s report shows the vast majority of transfer revenues stay at the top of the game. There were 2,230 transfers that commanded a fee in 2021 (and 15,838 that did not). The top 100 commanded more than 50% of all fees. The overall picture was quite different in the women’s game. In 2021 the international transfer spend grew by 72.8% on the year before, albeit to a total of $2.1m – a level very different to the men’s game. There was also a substantial growth in the number of players transferred, the 1,304 international deals up by a quarter on 2020.
Although English clubs were lower down the list of spending in the women’s game, the WSL recorded the biggest international transfer in 2021, when Hanna Bennison joined Everton from Rosengård.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/english-clubs-dominate-international-transfer-spend-in-2021-with-1bn-outlay-fifa;sports

Save the Cinema (Sara Sugarman, 2022), 10.55am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere A true story ripe for dramatic treatment, Sara Sugarman’s guileless drama follows the fight to save the Lyric in Carmarthen in the early 1990s. Hairdresser and youth theatre leader Liz Evans (a warm performance by Samantha Morton) rouses the opposition, including Jonathan Pryce’s retired teacher Mr Morgan, when the council plans to replace the cinema with a shopping centre. There’s light villainy in the shape of venal mayor Tom (Adeel Akhtar), a dash of Hollywood glamour and a gently reiterated message about the importance of community and local heritage. Simon Wardell Planes, Trains and Automobiles (John Hughes, 1987), 9pm, Comedy Central Who needs a straight man when you have talents such as Steve Martin and John Candy riffing off each other? In John Hughes’s superb comedy, the two are thrown together on a frantic, weather-impeded trip from New York to Chicago as they race to get home in time for Thanksgiving. Martin’s advertising executive Neal (superior, quick to anger) and Candy’s travelling salesman Del (genial, accident-prone) are the perfect odd couple in a film that bears comparisons to Midnight Run for its smartly plotted twists and characterful humour.

Denzel Washington is a magnificently brooding Macbeth, while Frances McDormand embraces the dark side as his lady – a role she was born to play. Their regicidal plot is worked out across austere locations in crisp black-and-white imagery reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. In an inventive touch, Kathryn Hunter plays all three “weird sisters” while eloquent support comes from Bertie Carvel as the doomed Banquo and Alex Hassell as an intriguingly shifty Ross.

Four parents meet in a church to talk about an incident several years earlier when the teenage son of one couple murdered the other pair’s son in a school shooting. Fran Kranz’s intense film is an ostensibly simple drama, theatrical in its single-setting, real-time setup, but shot in intimate closeup and red raw emotionally. Martha Plimpton and Jason Isaacs, as the victim’s mum and dad, and Ann Dowd and Reed Birney, playing the killer’s parents, give devastating performances. Running the gamut of grief, they ask hard questions – how much do you really know your children? Are you to blame for their actions? Is forgiveness possible after such trauma? – and find no easy answers. Wednesday 19 January, 3.20am Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Witch
In 1630s New England, a none-more-pious father, William (Ralph Ineson), is banished from his Puritan settler community and takes his family to farm on the fringes of a forest. There, his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) gives birth to a son – but while her eldest child Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy, in her first starring role) is babysitting, the boy is abducted by a witch. Based on true accounts from the time, the debut film from Robert Eggers is a gloriously nightmarish horror, imaginative and brutal, as dark forces – and mutual suspicion – overwhelm the family. Sunday 16 January, 12.55am, Channel 4 *** Pig
In Michael Sarnoski’s deft drama, Nicolas Cage plays Rob, an Oregon forest-dwelling loner whose beloved pig – source of the truffles he sells – is abducted. Distraught, he heads into Portland with his young business contact, Amir (Alex Wolff), to find the lost porker. It’s the perfect recipe for a revenge thriller a la Point Blank – but this is the usually 11-on-the-dial Cage turned down to a two. Rob’s past in a quasi-criminal world of high-end dining, fight clubs and foodie philosophy is revealed slowly, with Cage simmering away nicely. Sunday 16 January, 10.35am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
The most celebrated in a wave of turn-of-the-millennium wuxia movies (a martial arts genre originating in China) that wowed western audiences, Ang Lee’s 2000 film still stands up. From vivid green bamboo forests to the dust-yellow Gobi desert, it’s an adventure of relentless visual splendour, as skilled swordspeople (and unconsummated soulmates) Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh seek a mysterious thief. Could it be the imperial governor’s soon-to-be married daughter (Zhang Ziyi)? Forbidden romance and kung fu action in one stylish package. Monday 17 January, 6.40pm, Great! Movies *** Nobody
Ilya Naishuller’s deeply silly action thriller is redeemed by the surprisingly convincing casting of Bob Odenkirk as the lead character. His mild-mannered Hutch, family man and ground-down office worker, reluctantly brings his brutal past in black ops back into play when his house is burgled and he falls foul of a Russian mobster. The Better Call Saul star adds several new skills to his CV, particularly in a superb close-quarters fight sequence on a city bus. Friday 21 January, 12noon, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** A Hero
This involving Iranian drama deservedly won a major prize at Cannes last year for its director, Asghar Farhadi. Amir Jadidi’s sign painter Rahim, an ambiguous smile forever flickering on his face, is in prison for non-payment of a debt. While on temporary release, he’s given a handbag containing gold coins found by his secret girlfriend. After returning it to the owner and being publicly feted for the selfless act, he discovers that no good deed goes unpunished, as his little white lies – told to simplify matters – put him into a hole he can’t dig himself out of. Friday 21 January, Amazon Prime Video *** Munich: The Edge of War
We are in prime Robert Harris territory here. The author’s interest in the second world war and the spy game is served well by Christian Schwochow’s film of his novel, as George MacKay’s fictional civil servant Hugh Legat crosses paths with real figures, principally Neville Chamberlain. Revolving round the prime minister’s dealings with Hitler on the eve of the conflict, it’s a stirring tale of derring-do and political manoeuvring, with Legat and his old friend, German foreign office official Von Hartmann (Jannis Niewöhner), trying to expose Hitler’s belligerent ambitions.

A strategic approach and fearless technique have led the engineering graduate and former DJ not only to make sporting history but find success as a black athlete in a historically white sport. He counts among his mentors Dudley ‘Tal’ Stokes, one of the members of the men’s bobsleigh team whose journey from the Caribbean to the mountains of Alberta became the subject of a hit Disney film. “Qualified Olympics baby” read the message on Alexander’s Instagram account less than seven years after he was first exposed to skiing on a trip to the Canadian resort of Whistler. Alexander says he saw those racing down the slopes that day as “almost like superheroes putting on these skis and just disappearing,” but he took up the sport that winter and, after falling 27 times on his first descent, never looked back. Alexander is the child of a Jamaican father and an English mother. Raised in Wellingborough outside Northampton, he had a working class upbringing. “My mother, my father and my brother have spent the most part of their working career either in factories or driving,” he said. “None of the three of them finished high school with any decent GCSEs or O-levels.” Alexander however was acknowledged as a gifted child and earned a scholarship to a private school before studying first physics then engineering at Imperial College. A parallel life as a DJ in first the UK and then internationally saw him earn a residency at America’s Burning Man festival and he has also worked in finance in Hong Kong. A motivational speaker, Alexander bills himself as a “reinvention expert” and has used skills learned in his other careers to develop his pursuit of skiing success. “I’ve been to 67 countries, I’ve spent a lot of my life on the road,” he told Olympics.com. “I’ve always loved to travel and a big part of my previous role as a DJ was getting myself out there marketing myself in the right way, figuring out ways to get into venues, clubs and festivals that I wanted to perform at. I never hired the services of a manager or agent as a DJ because I wanted to do it my own way.” He built a support network that included Stokes and the American skier Gordon Gray, who called Alexander’s technique “terrible” but observed his lack of fear would give him a head start in competition. He devoted himself entirely to his sport, basing himself in Austria, but building a strategy to enter the Jamaican Olympic team after a visit to the last games in Pyeongchang. He went on to use his analytical skills to discover from data held by the International Ski Federation what times he would have to reach if he was ever to qualify, with some routes to Olympic qualification spots left open for countries without a history of winter sport success. “I’ve totally nerded out on that database,” he said. Alexander will become only the 15th athlete ever to compete for Jamaica at a Winter Olympics. The first were the bobsleigh team of 1988 who qualified, crashed out of competition, finished in last place and entered into history. “You’re going to have to have the determination to suffer and to struggle but to have pride and power,” is Stokes’ advice to the former UK Garage DJ. “That’s the attitude you’ll need.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/benjamin-alexander-the-former-dj-remixing-the-spirit-of-cool-runnings-winter-olympics;sports
3687;3687;3687;3687;3726;3726;Somebody Somewhere review – Bridget Everett anchors endearing comedy;2022-01-14;['Adrian Horton'];['US television', 'HBO', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];"Somebody Somewhere, a spiky and endearing seven-part HBO series created by and starring the comedian, actor and singer Bridget Everett, begins in the quiet aftermath of loss. Sam, a 40-something woman played by Everett, is struggling to adjust to life in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas (also Everett’s hometown), where she returned a year prior to take care of her beloved sister Holly during an illness.
Six months after her death, Sam works as an unenthusiastic grader of standardized tests and sleeps on Holly’s couch; she still can’t bring herself to touch Holly’s bed. Sam is a void, turned inward and speaking little, a fuck-up to everyone other than a sympathetic coworker and former high school classmate, Joel (Jeff Hiller), who remembers her as a “big fucking deal” in their show choir days (hence the BFD title of the first episode, written by co-creators Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen and directed by executive producer Jay Duplass). Quiet is not how one would describe Everett, a fixture on the New York comedy scene as a bawdy, thunderous performer of alternative cabaret (signature ribald songs include titties, what I gotta do to get that dick in my mouth? and keep it in your pants song). HBO has billed Somebody Somewhere as a “coming-of-middle-age” story and that’s pretty accurate – both for Sam, reeling from the loss of the only person who seems to have understood her, and for the 49-year-old Everett, in her first leading series role after years of bit parts (perhaps most famously on Inside Amy Schumer).
Everett’s stage persona is larger than life – her operatic voice, her libido, her body and especially her boobs, with which she has been known to motorboat audience members. Sam, by contrast, is a repressed, unconfident alter ego of the brash performer, a fictionalized vision of what might be, had Everett not left the “Little Apple” for the big one, or was tampered down instead of emboldened. Sam lumbers between her snooty sister Tricia’s (Mary Catherine Garrison) house and her parents’ farm, stuck and unsure, dressed down in oversized clothes, alone. She is a singer at heart and the author of Everett’s own dirty songs, but afraid of the grief music will expose. Sensing her potential, Joel, a gay Christian with his own complicated relationship to his hometown, invites Sam to his “choir practice” – a deceptively titled celebration of music and queerness and a haven for the town’s misfits. The first episode’s climactic scene, as with half the episodes of the series, is a moving musical number: Sam, with Joel’s coaxing, embraces the stage for the first time in years. The moment, played to convincingly high stakes by both Everett and Hiller, cements the two central romances of the series: Sam’s re-embrace of singing, and thus her more honest self, and the tender, tart, altogether winning friendship between her and Joel at an age when most adults seem to eschew making new platonic confidantes. Both relationships are a joy to watch blossom, even if they’re not always the most exciting. One’s enjoyment of Somebody Somewhere depends somewhat on your threshold for backseat plot – there are buried resentments and secrets, tense conversations and occasional blowups, but little external conflict or antagonism. For the most part, everyone on the show (even Tricia) is a good person at heart doing their best, trying to communicate and making small realizations along the way. Though filmed in Illinois, the show’s many interstitial shots of cornfields and a cutesy college town street (Manhattan is home to Kansas State University) effectively conjures a midwestern town: warmhearted, a little sleepy, unassuming and full of characters if you know where to look, such as Sam and Joel’s friend Fred Rococo, the master of choir practice ceremonies played by the New York drag king, Murray Hill. The main draw, though, is Everett, whom I would watch do anything after imbuing Sam with this much bruised charisma. For all her walls, which Everett never lets us believe are anything but shaky and ill-fitting, Sam has an undeniable and magnetic maternal side – not in the sense of literally having kids, whose absence leaves Sam feeling judged by her town’s faith and family milieu, but in caring for others. She is a disarming, unvarnished support for her teenage niece Shannon (Kailey Albus), the person who convinces her father Ed (an excellent Mike Hagerty) to convince her alcoholic mother Mary Jo (Jane Brody) to give rehab a try. When she lashes out at Joel after a particularly painful afternoon at the receiving end of Tricia’s judgments, it only takes a day for her to make amends with self-effacing vulnerability. “I don’t think I’m really friend material,” she says. Joel disagrees, as do I. Welcoming Sam – wounded and warm, subdued and obnoxious, finally open to new friends – into your life for seven half-hour chapters is a breeze, as natural as Sam’s final command of the karaoke mic. Somebody Somewhere is on HBO in the US and Foxtel in Australia, and on Sky Comedy and NOW from 1 March.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/14/somebody-somewhere-review-bridget-everett-anchors-endearing-comedy;entertainment and culture
3702;3702;3702;3702;3741;3741;‘I need to not be violent to myself’: Big Thief on pain, healing and their intense musical bond;2022-01-14;['Marissa R Moss'];['Big Thief', 'Pop and rock', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Folk music'];"It is early afternoon in downtown Nashville, and the party is already going strong. Bachelorettes in pink cowboy hats are flowing, mask-free, in and out of the honky-tonks. The members of Big Thief, though – Adrianne Lenker, Buck Meek, Max Oleartchik and James Krivchenia – are sitting outside the Ryman Auditorium like dots of oil floating atop the water. No one seems to notice that one of the US’s best bands is scattered around a patio table a few hours before their show tonight, just yards above the 24/7 bacchanal. “There’s a pigeon-keeper up there,” says the band’s frontperson Lenker, leaning forward in her chair in a horse-print shirt, jeans and a bandanna, her gaze fixed on a small skyscraper. She points, and the rest of the band follows her finger to a group of birds on top of a building, furiously in motion. “They’re flying in circles, so there has to be a cage up there. They only do that when there is someone conducting them.” There is no conductor in Big Thief, nor do they move in circles – but they do stay in formation. Since the release of their debut album Masterpiece in 2016, they have been one of the most prolific working bands as a collective and individually, flying free of music industry best practices (two competing and equally brilliant albums, UFOF and Two Hands, were released in 2019), Instagrammable perfection, or any sort of pomp and circumstance, with Lenker’s intricate and vulnerable lyrics leading the way in songs that traverse indie rock and folk. When they take to the Ryman stage later, they will do so without big displays or sets, raw and unfiltered in front of a closed stage curtain. They have two Grammy nominations and have graduated to big venues, but would rather talk about the marvel of human consciousness than accolades, discussing the process of creating art as if they’re astronomers not just content to find the next star, but eager to unveil a whole unseen universe.
Everything that makes Big Thief work could be the undoing of any other band. For one, Lenker and Meek are divorced – they met and started the group together in New York in 2015, and were married young. Bassist Oleartchik lives a world away in Israel, and each band member has a vibrant set of solo interests that overlaps rather than competes with Big Thief itself. During the pandemic alone, Lenker released two solo albums, Songs and Instrumentals, guitarist Meek had one, Two Saviors, Oleartchik worked on his jazz material and Krivchenia released an ambient album and sat in on drums for numerous projects, including Taylor Swift’s Red (Taylor’s Version). “The alchemy of all those things is what makes Big Thief Big Thief in the first place,” says Meek, who wears all black and smiles as if he’s known you for ever. “So we’ve all honoured that, and each other, I think.” Their new 20-song album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You comes, in title, from that interconnecting continuum: it’s taken from a line in Anything, from Lenker’s album Songs, further narrowing the distance between what is hers and theirs, as if that even matters. They got here by engaging in a non-stop battle against the ego. “We don’t let ourselves be the cliche of the rock star,” Oleartchik says. “It can feel like that – you’re on stage, people are screaming – but that’s where you can get lost in yourself.” Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You doesn’t try to fit neatly into a box that further defines the Big Thief sound, whatever that may be, or grasp at bigger rock stardom. Sometimes, its songs beautifully meander without a chorus (Certainty), or the music melds perfectly with the feel of the lyrics, though not specifically the meaning. There are mentions of potato knishes and elbows (Spud Infinity) and microwaves (Dried Roses) that would have made John Prine chuckle, and lines that kick you in the gut with their brilliant simplicity: “I wanna live for ever till I die,” Lenker sings to a country romp.
“Maybe I’m delusional, but I don’t think we’ve ever made anything because someone else expected us to. If anything, it’s the opposite,” Meek says, turning to Lenker, who is rubbing a bottle of water against her forehead to help cure a headache. “You write the songs because it’s a form of survival. You’re my favourite songwriter on Earth, and we’re definitely my favourite band on Earth. We are the vessel for music that doesn’t exist that I want to hear.” This comes across as enthusiastic joy, not ego, and the music sounds like he feels it, too. “You are my favourite songwriter!” Lenker responds – this love-in is more heartfelt and less corny than it might read. But Lenker had a lot of excavating to do to find this happiness, and when the pandemic hit, everything rushed to the surface once the crowds grew quiet. “I had gone through marriage and divorce,” Lenker says in a separate Zoom call later, alone in a hotel room with her dog. “We had to try to transform our relationship, to let it die and be reborn, all while being on the road in proximity to each other. And holding space for other people through our art, writing about it and singing about it together on stage. He’s like family now, which I think is a testament to the love that we do [still] share.”
Big Thief were in the middle of a European tour when the pandemic hit in March 2020; they had been on the road incessantly for three years, and Lenker had started a new relationship, with the musician Indigo Sparke, which came to an end early in quarantine. “My heart,” she says, “was broken into smithereens.” All of a sudden, it seemed like her body started to “purge everything out”. Her sister and solo album co-producer Phil Weinrobe both had to remind her to eat on a daily basis, and she came down with shingles and multiday migraines, ending up in hospital in Brooklyn before retreating to her sister’s cabin in western Massachusetts. She worried something might really be wrong medically, until it became clear that it was the grind she had been engaging in since she was a little girl, and the trauma that came with it. “I realised it wasn’t about this thing with this person,” Lenker says, “it was about old trauma manifesting in current life.” She doesn’t say specifically what that trauma was (though she has spoken elsewhere about how difficult her childhood was), but the breakdown of the two romantic relationships “triggered this whole thing inside of myself, and I was living in a state of self-abandonment. I’m not going to perpetuate that cycle but in order to do that I really need to not be violent to myself. And that’s not something that just happens overnight.” Lenker was born in Indianapolis, raised in a cultlike Christian sect that her parents eventually distanced themselves from, and she started writing music before she was 10; her first album, Stages of the Sun, came in 2006 and shows the origins of her penchant to incorporate country or folk textures into her work, even though others around her seemed to think she was more destined for pop stardom. Lenker, clearly, was uninterested in that. After attending Berklee College of Music in Boston on a scholarship and moving to New York, Lenker met Meek in 2015, who was playing in, as he puts it, “a crazy ragtime swing band”. Meek, from Texas and appropriately well-schooled on singer-songwriters such as Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, made a perfect busking partner for Lenker in the early days. Oleartchik was a jazz player and son of Alon Oleartchik, a popular Israeli musician and member of 70s breakthrough rock band Kaveret, while Krivchenia, born in Minnesota, was established on the punk scene. Once the foursome formed Big Thief, everyone committed fully to the collective.
Krivchenia, who produced Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You, presented the concept to the band one morning over a continental breakfast at a hotel in Copenhagen before the pandemic, typed up and printed in the hotel business centre. The idea was that they would go as a group to four locations – upstate New York, Topanga Canyon in California, the Arizona desert and Colorado mountains – with four different studios and four different engineers, each with a sonic goal in mind. “Before he finished we were all like: oh my God, yes,” Oleartchik says. Krivchenia really believed in the concept, but he also didn’t want to upset the power balance in the band – or the lack of one, really. “There’s a communal thing with this band where all opinions are very important,” he says. “I just wanted to check my ego to make sure I wasn’t positioning myself in any sort of role.” Mostly, he wanted the band to help create some time, some freedom from a ticking clock. “It’s like sex,” Lenker says of recording, laughing lightly. “If you feel pressure to make love well and you only have an hour to prove yourself, forget about it!” Lenker’s songs are a grounding force of Big Thief, never meant to lead definitively one way or the other, though extremely revealing at the same time. “Her writing is more complex than, ‘it’s her nature album or it’s her breakup album’,” Krivchenia says. “She wants to leave space for people to add their own meaning,” Oleartchik adds. Her bandmates talk about her songwriting so she doesn’t have to; she doesn’t enjoy deconstructing her own work in that way. She’d rather stay vulnerable with the songs, so she can stay vulnerable on stage.
Sometimes Lenker will be chatty during a set. Other times, she will say nothing at all. “Sometimes,” Krivchenia says, “Adrianne rambles for five minutes and we are like: let’s do a song, we’re getting cold back here!” She is so resistant to cultivating a performance or persona over an authentic shared experience that she gets emotionally worn down and can “feel like a flat piece of cardboard” after a night or two of touring. “A huge part of our craft is trying to come into this radical acceptance of what is happening, and our imperfections and idiosyncrasies,” Lenker says – Big Thief’s music voices a constant yearning to heal, and her own process is ever-evolving. Recently, she shaved her head to confront her insecurities about her face and beauty. “I’m still on that journey, and it may be a lifelong one … We have quirks, and we ride with them. Hopefully people in the room can feel a wave of inspiration to embrace exactly how they are in the present moment, happy or odd or chaotic. I think we need more of that in the world.” Meek remembers something that Krivchenia told him at a show in New Orleans a few nights earlier as they gathered in a huddle. “You said: ‘Remember to keep saying yes,’” he says. “So that whole night I kept reminding myself that: just keep saying yes because it’s so easy to say no. Even if you play the wrong note. Just go: ‘Yes! I played the wrong note! Yes!’” “It’s like an improv skit,” Krivchenia says, “Saying no fucking kills the skit.” “And, suddenly,” Lenker cuts in, “you’re creating something.” Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You is released on 11 February on 4AD.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/14/big-thief-on-pain-healing-and-their-intense-musical-bond;entertainment and culture
3712;3712;3712;3712;3751;3751;Hillsong escapes fine after denying youth camp with dancing and singing was ‘a festival’;2022-01-14;['Sian Cain'];['Hillsong Church', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Health'];"Hillsong church will not be fined by police over a New South Wales youth camp where congregants were filmed singing and dancing, despite the state’s health minister saying the event was “clearly in breach of both the spirit and intent” of public health orders. The church apologised on Friday for “giving any perception that we were not playing our part to keep New South Wales safe” after footage of its annual youth summer camp near Newcastle provoked widespread outrage amid the state’s Covid case numbers. They faced paying fines up to $55,000. NSW police said officers had attended the event and spoken with organisers, but would not issue a fine. “Following discussions with organisers and after consultation with NSW Health, no infringement will be issued,” acting assistant commissioner Peter Glynn said in a statement on Friday. The church confirmed it had been instructed by NSW Health to “cease congregant and student singing and dancing” at the camp, and had immediately done so. However, the church continued to deny that the camp, which runs until Sunday, had any similarity to music festivals, which are explicitly banned both indoors and outdoors until 27 January under an amendment to the NSW public health order. Religious services are exempt, but footage of maskless congregants dancing to pop music at the camp has angered many at a time when festivals and concerts are being cancelled. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
“It is important to clarify that the current youth camps we are holding are not music festivals,” Hillsong said, claiming the camp was “low risk as described under current guidelines”, because it was held outdoors, with sports activities and no alcohol, and the roughly 200 students attending were all “part of the same social network”. “These camps have a Christian focus and include worship services. Over a three-day duration, the percentage of time spent singing is minor. However, we regret giving any perception that we were not playing our part to keep NSW safe and we sincerely apologise to the community at large,” the statement said. Earlier, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said that the event was “clearly in breach of both the spirit and intent” of the public health order. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he was “incredibly disappointed” by the scenes and said the church should be fined if it was found to have breached the order.
The independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said it was “a music festival, no doubt”. “No doubt it will also top off with a super-spreader [event],” Lambie told Channel Nine’s Today show on Friday morning. “Newcastle had a super-spreader [event in December] go around from a nightclub. What is the difference? Because they don’t have a drink in their hand? Are you kidding me?” Earlier on Friday, Perrottet said that the state government would tighten regulations if Hillsong escaped a fine due to a “loophole”. “But I don’t want to do that because that means that it will capture a whole lot of other organisations that are doing the right thing … I’ll take the advice in relation to the legal teams at NSW Health and if they are in breach, which is what the information I’ve received from the health minister is, then a fine should be issued,” he said. Musicians have been particularly outspoken about the footage, with several big names forming a protest supergroup called Thrillsong. After the Hillsong footage was widely shared, artists including the Jungle Giants, What So Not, Art vs Science, CC:DISCO!, Illy, Lime Cordiale, Montaigne and Peking Duk came together to protest against the ban on live music while religious services and sporting events are allowed to continue. “We firmly support measures to protect our fans and communities and to safeguard our healthcare workers. We simply ask that if rules are made, they apply to everyone equally,” they said in a joint statement. “We need to be in this together.”
Electronic artist Chris Emerson, who performs as What So Not, said he was actively seeking out religious and sporting venues for Thrillsong to perform in, to highlight the double standards. “We are very seriously looking with legal teams into whether we have a cause for discrimination against the NSW government,” he said. “We’ve also got a lot of time on our hands, and a lot of spirit, so we’ll willingly get together and perform some sort of religious ceremony as Thrillsong if that is the only way we can play. “I’d love everyone to be singing and dancing, it is just so frustrating when people not in the music industry are given permission to run these events when people in the industry are complying with really expensive regulations and doing everything right. Music festivals have been targeted, while a church gets to put on a music festival.” Sam Hales, guitarist of the Jungle Giants, said they just wanted one rule for all live events. “No one wants to cancel cricket or the Australian Open or religious events. We just want to be at the table; we want to be considered alongside sport and the church,” he said. “It’s really hard to see tens of thousands of people at a sporting event, all yelling, no social distancing. A band can play to them, but three doors down at a venue, the same band would have their gig cancelled. That’s the new discourse – music doesn’t happen any more, sports and religion does. “We need to start spotlighting all these double standards. It doesn’t make any sense and it is getting silly.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/hillsong-denies-youth-camp-dancing-and-singing-was-a-festival-as-police-investigate;health
3719;3719;3719;3719;3758;3758;Burmese flee bombardment as junta ‘makes example’ of city of Loikaw;2022-01-14;['Rebecca Ratcliffe', 'Min Ye Kyaw'];['Myanmar', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"Nan and her family had just one hour to gather their belongings and prepare to flee their home. A charity had offered to drive them away from Loikaw, the capital of eastern Myanmar’s Kayah state, to relative safety. She considered staying behind, with the plants, dogs and pigs that she had raised, but knew she had to leave. Since last week, Loikaw has seen intense fighting between groups opposed to last year’s military coup and the armed forces, which have launched airstrikes and fired artillery. An artillery shell had dropped near Nan’s fence, terrifying her cousin’s children, who ran to hide under their bed. “It was so loud,” she said. “My grandma was shocked and sweating, we had to give her medication to calm her down.” Other homes in Nan’s neighbourhood have been hit. The UN estimates that half the population of Loikaw have been forced to leave their homes, and that almost 90,000 people from Kayah state, formerly known as Karenni state, are displaced. Estimates by local media and a rights group are far higher, suggesting up to 170,000 people in Kayah, more than half of its population, have left their homes. Almost one year since the military seized power in Myanmar, the junta faces widespread and defiant opposition to its rule, and to the heinous violence it has inflicted on the public. Alongside a peaceful protest movement, people across the country have resorted to taking up arms, sometimes with support from established ethnic armed organisations. The military is now battling armed groups on multiple fronts. This includes in Kayah state, where it has been met with strong opposition, and has in turn launched brutal crackdowns. In December, more than 30 people, including children, were killed and their bodies burned in a massacre on Christmas Eve. On 7 January, a day after fighting intensified, Nan, 26, left her home along with her grandmother – who was in ill health – her parents, cousins and their children. The drive to Shan state, where they sought refuge, would normally take three and a half hours. Instead, it took the family three days. Fighting forced them to stop and take shelter on the way, only for the attacks to then become so close that there was no option to move again. “They continuously launched behind us as we moved forward,” she said. Ba Nyar, a spokesperson from Karenni Human Rights Group, said the situation was the most severe he had seen in the state and that 170,000 people are displaced. Many had sought refuge in Buddhist temple compounds, schools and community halls, he said. But people were struggling to access food or basics such as blankets or makeshift roofs to provide shelter at night, he added. After the recent escalation in fighting, the military has stopped all trucks coming in and out of Loikaw, cutting off supplies, said a volunteer at a refugee camp where about 100 families are sheltering. According to a report by the independent outlet Myanmar Now, the military has also cut off electricity to several areas of Loikaw, halting water supplies and wifi coverage. More than 650 houses and other civilian properties, including churches, monasteries and schools have been burned down or destroyed in Kayah state since May 2021, according to reports cited by the UN. This week, the UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, Tom Andrews, called on the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to “immediately halt the air and ground attacks that junta forces have unleashed on Loikaw”, to lift the blockade of those seeking to escape and allow access for those seeking to provide aid and shelter. The UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, said it was gravely concerned by the escalating conflict and condemned the killing of at least four children across the country, and the maiming of others over the past week. Among those injured are a 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy from Loikaw, who were hit by heavy weaponry “following intense airstrikes and mortar attacks”, according to Unicef. Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said the military had “clearly decided to make an example of Loikaw, hitting it with indiscriminate artillery and aerial bombardment that puts civilians at serious risk of grievous harm”. “Humanitarian assistance is urgently needed, and NGOs, UN agencies and donors should bend over backwards to get assistance to displaced persons who require it,” he said. Few remain in Loikaw. One resident who is still in the city said there was shooting on Wednesday evening until 9pm, and that three military helicopters were seen in the sky. “I have to stay very quiet inside my house for my safety and eat what I have,” he said. “I gave everything else to my family.” He stayed in the city to watch over the family home, but will leave if fighting worsens. “I think we can still leave, but there are many military soldiers hiding on the roads,” he said. Nan’s family were stopped twice at checkpoints before they eventually reached relative safety in Shan state. Her grandmother, who had heart problems, died before they arrived. Nan believes it was the shock and trauma caused by the sound of the firing of artillery shells.
Even as the family tried to pause their journey to hold a funeral for her at a nearby town, they were again forced to leave immediately due to worsening violence. Residents from the area were also forced to flee. Nan has considered returning home. As she drove past the mountains at the back of a truck, she longed to go back. “If my parents are safe, I’d like to go back there even if I have to move from one place to another when fighting takes place in the town,” she said. “I miss home so much.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/burmese-flee-bombardment-as-junta-makes-example-of-city-of-loikaw;politics
3723;3723;3723;3723;3762;3762;‘Hanging vulnerable people out to dry’: Covid stretches rural Australian health services to breaking point;2022-01-14;['Natasha May'];['Rural Australia', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];"Jim Goldsmith has had no visitors in the long-stay section at Coonamble Multi-Purpose Service since the Thursday before Christmas. It was the day he turned 79 and his wife Pam’s Covid-19 test came back positive. At the end of 10 days of Covid-19 illness, Pam received medical clearance from NSW Health. But she still needed to show a negative PCR test result to see her critically ill husband of 52 years. Eight days after she took the PCR test on 5 January, Pam still had not received the results.
Enquiring after her results a week after she took the first test, Pam was told to come and do another PCR test at the Coonamble MPS on 10 January and the results would be fast-tracked. She had not received the second test results by Friday either. This is the reality of a sluggish health system in regional and rural Australia, where Covid-19 PCR and rapid antigen tests are hard to access and there are long delays receiving results. It is separating families and exacerbating issues within stretched health services. Their daughter Kim Goldsmith wants to know who is responsible because she fears many vulnerable people like her father have been hung out to dry. “Despite Omicron being rampant in Coonamble, Dad still hasn’t had his booster. I’d love to know who’s responsible for this. It’s hanging vulnerable people out to dry,” Kim said.
Jim contracted necrotising fasciitis, a flesh-eating bacterial infection, in his neck on 4 December 2020, which required multiple surgeries over several months to remove all the affected muscle, and subsequently 24-hour care. Kim Goldsmith says her mother has been going to the MPS every day for several hours because the service was so short-staffed they relied on her to feed him through a Picc line (peripherally inserted central catheter). “The nurses at the hospital had become so reliant on Mum being there to feed him and take care of him that when she didn’t turn up, she’d turn up later and discover he hadn’t been fed for two hours beyond the allocated time,” Kim Goldsmith says. The late feeds, according to Kim, cause complications in his digestion.
Because of Jim’s diabetes, he also has failing eyesight and can’t read and struggles to see things on TV. “It’s a pretty lonely existence,” Kim says. Before the Omicron outbreak, Jim was allowed day releases on a semi-regular basis where family members could take him home for the afternoon or out for a drive, allowing him to get out and see the country, occasionally run into somebody and have a yarn. “It was like getting close to what the old life had been. And he absolutely hated going back to the hospital every afternoon.” Since the latest Covid-19 outbreak Jim is no longer allowed day release, and families can only nominate one approved visitor. “Now it’s only Mum and even she can’t get in,” Kim says. The family is especially concerned, she says, as her father has struggled with mental illness ever since he became ill. In the last few days Jim has developed an infection on top of his critical illness, which Kim Goldsmith says is the second time her father’s condition has deteriorated with an infection as a result of an extended period of isolation. During the winter lockdown in western NSW, Pam was unable to see Jim for six weeks until the lung infection he developed saw him moved to palliative care. Kim says they told her mother “he hasn’t got long … you’ll be able to come and visit.” “Mum was able to suit up and come and go in and spend two hours with him and then all of a sudden he got better and they put him back into long-stay and back to no visitors,” Kim Goldsmith says. “You’ve literally got to be dying to have any social stimulation in the situation,” she says. Following Guardian Australia’s media enquiry, Pam Goldsmith has been given permission to see her husband regardless of the outcome of the PCR test as long as she follows normal Covid-safe protocols going through the hospital on Friday 14 January. Kim Goldsmith says her mother isn’t sure if the drugs kicking in had helped or the knowledge of her visit the next day, but Jim’s voice sounded better than it previously has. In a statement to Guardian Australia, a Western NSW Local Health District (WNSWLHD) spokesperson says the safety of patients and people living in residential care is at the centre of infection and control guidelines. Currently, visitor access is restricted at Multi-Purpose Services in Western NSW Local Health District to one visitor per visit. “PCR testing and proof of a negative result is not a requirement to visit aged-care residents at Multi-Purpose Services. Visitors are screened and risk-assessed on entry. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 or anyone who has been identified as a close contact in the previous 14 days are not permitted entry to facilities,” the spokesperson said. “WNSWLHD is looking into the circumstances with staff and the Goldsmith family, and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.” The spokesperson said WNSWLHD healthcare teams were dedicated to providing the best care possible for patients and aged-care residents and staff were doing everything possible to maintain social and family connectivity, while also protecting the safety of patients, residents and staff. “The furloughing of staff to comply with isolation requirements, annual leave across the holiday period, and the impact of Covid-19 on vacation and childcare arrangements have all placed pressure on staffing availability, however the WNSWLHD has maintained continuous service delivery at all facilities across the District. “Pathology providers are working tirelessly around the clock to ensure Covid-19 tests results are returned as soon as possible. Testing capacity across NSW remains under enormous pressure. The high rate of positive PCR tests has required a more time consuming approach to the way the laboratories confirm the test samples. We thank the community for their patience,” the spokesperson said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/hanging-vulnerable-people-out-to-dry-covid-stretches-rural-australian-health-services-to-breaking-point;health
3755;3755;3755;3755;3796;3796;Met police won’t investigate alleged No 10 lockdown party;2022-01-13;['Sarah Marsh'];['Metropolitan police', 'Health policy', 'Coronavirus', 'Civil service', 'Boris Johnson', 'Cressida Dick', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Gray report'];"The Metropolitan police will not investigate alleged parties held at Downing Street in apparent breach of lockdown rules unless an upcoming inquiry finds evidence of criminality. The force said it did not normally investigate breaches of coronavirus regulations “long after they are said to have taken place”. The senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating allegations of parties held at Downing Street while the UK was in lockdown due to Covid-19. The force added that if this showed criminality took place then the police force would “reconsider” its stance. On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, admitted attending a gathering at 10 Downing Street on 20 May 2020, during the height of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. An estimated 100 people were invited, with about 30 believed to have attended. Johnson said he was there for 25 minutes. When the event took place, parties were banned and people were not able to see friends or family, even those unwell in hospital.
A spokesperson for the Met said the force was “aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the health protection regulations at Downing Street and Department for Education on various dates and has received correspondence in relation to this reporting”. It added: “The Met has ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office in relation to its inquiry. If the inquiry identifies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence it will be passed to the Met for further consideration.” An inquiry announced by the prime minister and led by Gray will also look into a party allegedly held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events. Several dozen people – a mix of civil service and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. The Met has previously been criticised for not taking action and “deferring to the powerful” against parties that took place. The Good Law Project has already started legal proceedings over the Met’s refusal to investigate reports of the Christmas party on 18 December 2020. The campaign group said that in letters between it and the Met, police said they had “relied on the government’s assurances that no rules had been broken” and “there would have been no point in interviewing No 10 staff about the parties because they would have refused to answer questions that exposed them to a risk of prosecution”. Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “You can have the rule of law, or you can defer to the powerful. But you can’t have both. Cressida Dick’s cat will know that multiple criminal offences were committed. It shames the Met, and ultimately all of us, that she refuses to investigate.” Police officers who saw laws broken while on guard duty at Downing Street would be expected to report it, the former Scotland Yard police chief Robert Quick said this week. He said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” Asked if officers could be told by their bosses to prioritise their protective duties and ignore the law, Quick said: “You could not give that advice to a police officer.” The Green party peer Lady Jones said the invitation to the May 2020 garden party, sent by Johnson’s top aide, Martin Reynolds, was troubling. “This garden party raises big questions for the Met police, as their officers must surely have monitored this gathering via their security cameras and been aware of the rules in place at the time,” she said. “The police are losing public trust with their attitude that there are lots of rules for us and no rules for Conservative ministers. Did Martin Reynolds consult with Met police officers about the Covid restrictions, or inform them of the event?”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/met-police-wont-investigate-alleged-no-10-lockdown-party;politics

I can empathise with his words as a previous cancer patient myself, and also as a frontline nurse, but I disagree with his judgment on “anti-vaxxers”. Those who have chosen not to have the vaccine do not all share the same mindset, and it is worth bearing this in mind before they are all excommunicated from society. My adult son is autistic and is unvaccinated by choice. His belief system may differ from most people’s, but as he is housebound due to crippling anxiety, hopefully he will not be much of a risk to himself or others. Let’s be civilised enough not to alienate him further. Of course, he might have chosen to forgo the Covid vaccine without the complexities of an autism diagnosis, but we cannot punish those who are fearful or those who wish to preserve their self-determination. There are other groups of people who take up hospital beds and who are judged as selfish by some due to lifestyle choices too. Where should we draw the line?

3793;3793;3793;3793;3834;3834;Brahms: Complete Songs Vol 1 – Opp 32, 43, 86 and 105 review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week;2022-01-13;['Andrew Clements'];['Classical music', 'Johannes Brahms', 'Culture', 'Music'];"Over the last decade and more, no Lieder recitals have given me more intense pleasure than those by the tenor Christoph Prégardien. Though he is now in his mid 60s, and his voice has inevitably lost some of its former bloom and flexibility with age, this Brahms disc, recorded in 2020, confirms that the sheer intelligence of Prégardien’s performances, his immaculate diction and the perfect weight and colour he gives to each phrase, still conjure revelatory interpretations from everything he sings. The collection sees the start of what Naxos plans to be a complete survey of Brahms’s songs. How much of the series will be allotted to Prégardien isn’t clear, but with Ulrich Eisenlohr as his partner, the communicative power and mastery of every nuance of this opening instalment make one hope that the pair will be regularly involved.
The four groups of songs cover almost a quarter of a century in Brahms’s development, from the nine songs of Op 32, completed in 1864, to the five of Op 105, which date to 1888. As Eisenlohr points out in his very thorough sleeve notes, the poems that Brahms set are rarely of the highest class – in that respect he differed in his approach to Lieder writing from his 19th-century predecessors, such as Schubert and Schumann; Gottfried Keller and Theodor Storm are probably the best known of the writers represented here. But each of these sets mixes and matches material from a variety of sources: Op 32, for instance, juxtaposes German translations of the 14th-century Persian lyric poet Hafez with poems by the early Romantic August von Platen-Hallermünde, while Op 43 includes a text from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, the folk collection that Mahler would later explore so extensively.
However lowly or mundane the words, though, Prégardien treats them with the respect he would give to a poem by Heine or Goethe, just as Brahms extracts every morsel of meaning in his settings. It’s fair to say that there is no intrinsically great music here; what we have, though, are outstanding performances of all 24 songs, each the product of Prégardien’s craft and his lifetime’s experience in this repertoire. This week’s other picks There is more outstanding Brahms from the clarinettist Michael Collins on the BIS label, with the two sonatas Op 120, which were written for his instrument just three years before the composer’s death. The release marks Collins’s 60th birthday later this month, and the sonatas provide a perfect showcase for his creamy tone and superb technical facility; Stephen Hough is the equally immaculate pianist. Their performance of the first sonata, in F minor, is intense and truly searching, that of the second, in E flat, lighter and more relaxed, while as a bonus they add Collins’s own “adaptation” of Brahms’s A major violin sonata Op 100, a more successful translation than one could ever imagine.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/brahms-complete-songs-vol-1-opp-32-43-86-and-105-review-masterful-and-revelatory-interpretation;entertainment and culture
3802;3802;3802;3802;3843;3843;Stephen Colbert on the pandemic: ‘If it were a movie, it would be Tenet’;2022-01-13;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Seth Meyers', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];"Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert attempted to sort through the bleak deja vu of Omicron winter in New York on Wednesday evening. “If this pandemic were a movie, it would be Tenet,” the Late Show host said. “It’s impossible to understand, and I just wish it would end, which turns out is the beginning.”
The host also reacted to a subtle shift in public health messaging in recent days, as the US reached record numbers of Covid infections: “They’re trying to make us get used to all of this,” Colbert noted. He pointed to testimony on Omicron’s transmissibility from the White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci on Tuesday: “Omicron will infect just about everybody.”
“Do you hear that? Being attacked for two years has clearly broken Dr Fauci,” Colbert said, imitating the doctor: “Rip off your mask, go to hot yoga, on the way home tug a hobo – I don’t give a vaccinated crap. We’re all doomed.” Fauci also said that those who have been vaccinated will “very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well”. “There are certain things I don’t want to equivocate on,” Colbert responded. “My life is one of them. You don’t want to hear a skydiving instructor say, ‘Jump from the plane! You will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well.’” According to experts, unvaccinated people are 10 times likelier to be infected with Omicron and 20 times likelier to die. “They’re also 50 times likelier to start a fight with a Kroger employee because the Mexican food aisle is in Spanish,” Colbert quipped. Seth Meyers
On Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped a rare interview appearance by Donald Trump on a mainstream media network, the US national radio network NPR. “For some reason, Trump thought it would be a good idea to call into NPR,” Meyers explained, “where he seemed to be caught off-guard” when pressed about his 2020 election lies by host Steve Inskeep. “Instead of listening to Trump’s answers mouth agape with no pushback” a la the Fox & Friends hosts, “Inskeep came prepared with basic facts to debunk Trump’s claims, and Trump clearly had no idea how to handle it,” said Meyers. “For starters, he didn’t even seem to know the details about how the interview was going to work,” asking Inskeep at the start if the interview was live (it was pre-taped). “He’s a former president calling into a well-known news program and he acts like he just got stopped on the street by Jay Leno,” Meyers joked. The interview came to an abrupt end when Trump hung up as Inskeep pressed the former president on his lies about the 2020 election. “You know it’s bad when Donald Trump, who will drone on endlessly for as long as you let him, willingly ends an interview before it’s supposed to be over,” Meyers noted. “When these deranged lies are subjected to even a modicum of scrutiny they collapse because they’re absurd on their face.” Jimmy Kimmel
And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also lamented “another virus” on the rise: “That big orange golfer who used to run the country.” In an interview with rightwing media company OAN, Trump confirmed he’d had the Covid booster and called Republican lawmakers who refuse to say they’ve been vaccinated “gutless”. It was a thinly veiled barb at Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, who stumbled over a question about his booster status on Fox News last weekend. DeSantis is expected to run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024, “and you know that makes Trump crazy”, said Kimmel. “Trump desperately wants credit for developing the vaccines, because he should want credit, but the dummies who follow him boo him when he says he got the vaccine. “And then you have characters like DeSantis who wants to have it both ways – he obviously got the booster but he doesn’t want to admit he got it,” Kimmel continued. “Which makes Trump, who did admit it, look like a wuss to the gators and chewing tobacco crowd. I mean, imagine being called gutless by Captain Bone Spurs.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/13/stephen-colbert-pandemic-tenet-trump-npr-late-show-recap;entertainment and culture
3831;3831;3831;3831;3872;3872;‘The system took my brother’: family demands answers in LA jail death;2022-01-13;['Sam Levin'];['Los Angeles', 'US prisons', 'US news', 'California', 'US policing'];"The family of Jalani Lovett, a 27-year-old who died in a Los Angeles jail last year, is demanding that the county sheriff’s department be held accountable and authorities release more information about the final moments of his life. Lovett died in solitary confinement in Men’s Central jail in downtown LA on 22 September. The county coroner released an autopsy report on Tuesday saying Lovett’s death was “accidental” and that he had fentanyl and heroin in his system. But Lovett’s mother and siblings, who have been fighting for months to get basic information from authorities about what led to his death, are left with major questions about the case. If Lovett died from an overdose, how did he access fentanyl while in solitary confinement? What were the actions of guards on duty that night, in a jail with a history of mistreatment? And why did it take so long for the coroner to produce the autopsy report, which the county sent to a reporter this week before the family obtained it? “I’m a grieving mother, but I’m also an angry mother,” Terry Lovett, 65, told the Guardian this week in an interview from her home in Oakland. She said the sheriff’s department, which runs the jail, had repeatedly ignored her family’s pleas for answers: “They have no regard for human life.”
“I want the truth to come out,” she added. “To me, this was murder. They killed my son.” Christian Contreras, a local civil rights attorney, filed a claim against the county on behalf of the family on Wednesday, the first step in a lawsuit, alleging “negligence causing wrongful death”, “deliberate indifference” in violation of the 14th amendment, an “inhumane killing” and more. A long wait for answers: ‘What are they hiding?’ Jalani Lovett, one of six siblings, grew up in east Oakland. He excelled at basketball and baseball as a teenager and won a poetry medal in school, his mother said. He was an aspiring rapper and a family man who was close with his nieces and nephews.
He ended up at Men’s Central jail in September 2019 for a second-degree robbery charge, and his mother said he had been held in solitary confinement in the months before his death. A sheriff’s spokesperson told the Guardian he was in a “one-man cell” and was not there for disciplinary reasons. Terry Lovett said a detective in the sheriff’s homicide bureau informed her on the morning of 23 September that her son “was found dead” in his cell at 10pm the previous night. The official added that authorities had found “drug paraphernalia” in her son’s cell, she recalled, but said the investigation was ongoing. The family received little information from officials in the following weeks, they said. One investigator initially told Terry it could take eight months for her to get an official report, she recalled.
About a month after the death, the family obtained photos from the coroner’s office showing Jalani’s body shortly after he died, which they believed showed signs of bruising and other possible injuries. Fueling their concerns further was a long history of scandals at the Men’s Central jail, with controversies including corruption and obstruction of justice cases and documented evidence of widespread abuse of incarcerated people. Jalani was housed in a section of the jail, the 3000 block, where guards have long been accused of being part of a “deputy gang” called the 3000 Boys, known for allegedly using excessive force. Vanessa Carter, one of Jalani’s sisters, said she talked had with her brother hours before his death and overheard him get into an argument with a guard, which also made the family suspicious. Combined with the photos and lack of information, the family questioned whether guards had beaten Jalani. Jalani’s official death certificate, issued a month after his death, listed his cause of death as “deferred”, meaning the medical examiner’s investigation was ongoing. It also listed the time of death as four hours earlier than what Terry was initially told, according to her records. The coroner’s report, released this week, noted he had a bruise on his neck and abrasions on his arms, but said there was “no external trauma” or “life-threatening injuries”. The report said deputies had found him unresponsive in his cell and issued Narcan and CPR. Lt Brandon Dean of the sheriff’s department told the Guardian that there were no signs Jalani had an altercation with guards, and that there was “nothing out of the ordinary” in his death. He declined to answer questions about how Jalani could have accessed fentanyl. Asked about the 3000 Boys, Dean declined to comment, saying it was not relevant to the case. The coroner’s report said the autopsy had been conducted on 28 September, one week after Jalani’s death. Contreras said he had filed a request for records in November, seeking footage, reports and the identity of the involved deputies, but had received no response. The coroner’s office sent the Guardian a copy of the autopsy on Tuesday before the attorney or Terry Lovett had seen it.
The family said they were skeptical of the coroner’s report. “There are too many inconsistencies. What is being hidden?” Lovett said after receiving the report. She said she planned to have an independent medical examiner review the records. ‘I want to stop this from happening to others’ Contreras lamented the lack of transparency in the case, which he said was common in jail deaths: “When someone in their own custody dies in highly suspicious circumstances, as opposed to meeting with the family and providing answers, the sheriff’s department advances further secrecy.” Carter, Jalani’s sister, said she believed deputies should face charges for her brother’s death: “They are supposed to ‘protect and serve’ and take care of people. We should not be scared of them, and they should be accountable for their actions, just like we are for ours.” She added that she wanted her brother to be remembered as a loyal family man who taught her son, now 14, how to walk and play basketball.
Ladell Dickerson, Jalani’s older brother, said that regardless of the cause of death, the county was to blame: “This is negligence. He was in their custody. He was under the authority of the sheriff. He was not in jail with a death sentence, but somebody in that jail either killed him or allowed him to die.” At a protest outside the jail on what would have been Jalani’s 28th birthday this week, Michelle Lovett, another sister, wished her brother a happy birthday, adding: “The system took my brother, but they will not take our right to know the truth.” Terry Lovett also lodged a complaint with the office of inspector general in November, but has not heard back. She said she was not confident that she would get justice for her son in LA county, but that she would keep fighting. She said she now spent most days trying to get information on the case: “I know I can’t bring my son back, but I want to stop this from happening to somebody else’s child.” In Terry’s final call with her son, Jalani was in a good mood, she said. He heard he would be transferring soon to state prison to finish his sentence. He was looking forward to leaving the jail, she said, and getting one step closer to coming home.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/jalani-lovett-la-jail-death;health
3838;3838;3838;3838;3879;3879;’It took months for the glass to leave her body’: making Memory Box and surviving the Beirut blast;2022-01-13;['Cath Clarke'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Beirut explosion', 'Lebanon', 'Middle East and north Africa'];"On 4 August 2020, a catastrophic explosion ripped through Beirut’s main port and into the city. In total, 218 people were killed. At the time, around 6pm, the artist and film-maker Joana Hadjithomas was in a cafe with a friend, around the corner from the studio she shares with her husband. The first thing she heard was a strange sound. “My friend and I just looked at each other. Instinctively, we went underneath the table. I curled up and protected my face.” As a teenager, she had lived through Lebanon’s civil war; taking cover was second nature, a survival reflex. Then came the massive blast. Afterwards, walking back to her apartment, she had no idea what was happening. An attack? An explosion? It was beyond comprehension. People were covered in blood; there was dust and rubble everywhere. “Wherever you looked, everything was destroyed. The scale was terrifying,” she says. In a state of shock, Hadjithomas had left her phone behind. When her husband, Khalil Joreige – frantic with worry – telephoned a couple of minutes later and a police officer answered, he feared the worst. Joreige tells the story with a shrug of helplessness, his face crumpling at the memory. The couple met as teenagers and have been working together ever since. Living between Beirut and Paris, they make feature films, documentaries, video projects and photographic installations (their art is in the permanent collections of the V&A in London and the Guggenheim in New York City). He seems serious, intellectual. She is warm, with a gift for intimacy; happy to chat about art, kids, anything. They have two children, Alya, 21, and Ramzi, 11.
When we meet, it is a little more than a year since the blast. The buzzy creative neighbourhood where they live and work, Gemmayzeh, was directly in the path of destruction. They lost friends and colleagues. Hadjithomas had minor injuries; her back was studded with little shards of glass. It is Joreige who tells me this: “It took months for the glass to leave her body.” Later, he explains that people of their generation snapped into survival mode during the explosion – moving away from windows, ducking under tables – just as they had learned as kids during the civil war. “Younger people went to the windows to film it; the young were hurt.” It is a horrible detail. But there were miracles, too. That afternoon, Joreige had wanted to stay late to work at the studio, which overlooks the port. But their kids pestered him into playing tennis in the mountains – “for the first time in 30 years”, he says with an expression somewhere between a grin and a grimace. Alya had recently flown back from England, where she is a student at University College London. She was meant to be quarantining; it was her last day, but she had snuck out of the apartment to play tennis. “They were lucky,” says Joreige. They left 30 minutes before the explosion. If he had stayed in the studio, if Alya had stayed at home … it doesn’t bear thinking about. “It’s not possible that nothing would have happened.”
Hadjithomas and Joreige are in London for a screening of Memory Box, their first feature film in nine years, shot before the blast. It is a gem, full of thoughtfulness and quiet intensity, following three generations of women in Canada. Maia (played beautifully by Rim Turki), a psychoanalyst, left Lebanon at the end of the 80s and never went back. She lives in Montreal with her mother (Clémence Sabbagh) and her teenage daughter Alex (Paloma Vauthier). The film opens on Christmas Eve, when a large box arrives from Paris, full of notebooks that Maia wrote, during the civil war, to a friend, who has recently died. Her daughter reads the notebooks in secret; her mother is terrified that they will unearth a dark family secret. There are also flashbacks to Lebanon in the 80s, where Maia (played as a teenager by Manal Issa) is rebelling against her parents, living each day with intensity, as if it were her last – which, of course, it might be. The film tells a personal story. In 1982, during the civil war, when Hadjithomas was 13, her best friend moved to Paris. “We were devastated. We promised to write to each other every day.” She smiles gently. “It was a very teenage promise.” But they kept it up. For six years, she wrote daily, filling notebooks, sometimes 40 pages in one sitting, and recording voice memos on cassette tapes. “It was like a diary. I told her everything. I think it kept me alive in a way, emotionally.”
After the war, she lost contact with her friend. Then, in 2013, the two women met for coffee in Paris and exchanged notebooks. Hadjithomas had the unnerving experience of meeting herself as a teenager. “This?!” she exclaims, burying her face in her hands. “This is who I was?” She didn’t recognise the girl on the page. Memory Box explores this gap between memory and history. The film has a beautiful, handcrafted feel, full of photos and art from the couple’s archive. Much of it is now gone. “Our artistic work is completely gone, blown away,” says Hadjithomas. Her husband nods: “Completely destroyed.” For weeks after the blast, they would come across their photos that had fluttered across the neighbourhood in the street, one time in a car park. Alya was 13 when the notebooks arrived, exactly the same age as her mum when she started writing. She begged to be allowed to read them. But the couple were adamant: no. It didn’t feel healthy. Especially not the bits about when they met, at 19. “No! No!” says Hadjithomas with mock-horror.
But these conversations gave them a good idea for a plot: a daughter learning about her mother, who has always been a distant figure to her. “Here, but not present,” is how Hadjithomas describes Maia. She has met many people like that, living with trauma. As parents, Hadjithomas and Joreige have agonised about how to explain their experiences growing up in wartime to their kids.

3840;3840;3840;3840;3881;3881;Team GB targets record-breaking Winter Olympics medal tally in Beijing;2022-01-13;['Sean Ingle'];['Winter Olympics Beijing 2022', 'Team GB', 'British Olympic Association', 'UK Sport', 'Sport politics', 'Sport'];"Team GB chiefs have set their sights on their greatest ever Winter Olympics medal haul in Beijing next month – and reiterated their support for British athletes who want to protest against human rights abuses in China. With just over three weeks to go before the Games begin, the British Olympic Association and UK Sport are targeting between three and seven medals, a tally that could take the team past the record of five set in Sochi in 2014 and equalled in Pyeongchang in 2018.
While conceding the Olympics in China will be “extraordinarily challenging”, due to a range of factors including Covid and human rights issues, UK Sport’s chief executive, Sally Munday, said that Team GB was determined to become “an even greater force in winter sports”. “Our intelligence tells us that British athletes have the potential to win between three and seven medals at the Olympics, and between five and nine medals at the Paralympics,” she added. “We have a young, dynamic, motivated team with real potential to excite and inspire the public.” Around 50 athletes are expected to be selected for the Winter Olympics, with the BOA also confirming that all will be vaccinated. Those challenging for medals will include the snowboarder Charlotte Bankes, the three curling teams and the men’s two- and four-man bobsleigh. Andy Anson, the chief executive of the BOA, confirmed that officials would support British athletes who wanted to use the Games to take a stand over human rights abuses or to raise awareness of the Peng Shuai case, although he urged them to alert officials beforehand. He said: “We’ve told the athletes all along that we’re very happy for them to express themselves but to be sensible and to ideally touch base with those if they feel that they’re doing anything at all controversial . “We are not the ones who are going to stop our athletes expressing opinions. But equally, we are the ones who are going to give them sensible guidance about local laws and what’s expected locally so that they don’t come up against difficult situations. So it’s a fine balance.”
Anson also indicated that he expected fans to attend the Winter Olympics – something that Chinese organisers are yet to confirm even though the Games open on 4 February. “I’m really pleased for the athletes that there will be spectators in China,” he said. “I think that will add a dimension over and above what we had in Tokyo that will make the Games exciting. I’m lucky enough, with Manchester United and as CEO of the ATP Tennis tour, to have been at live events out in China and to see the enthusiasm of the Chinese fans so that is a positive for the Games.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/team-gb-targets-record-breaking-winter-olympics-medal-tally-in-beijing;sports
3846;3846;3846;3846;3887;3887;Same-sex couple become first in Taiwan to legally adopt child;2022-01-13;['Helen Davidson'];['Taiwan', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Adoption', 'Children', 'Society'];"A married same-sex couple have become the first in Taiwan to legally adopt a child neither of them are related to, after they challenged local laws in court. Wang Chen-wei, Chen Chun-ju, and their daughter, nicknamed Joujou, were surrounded by press at the Taipei household registration office, as the couple formally signed adoption paperwork after a long battle. Clutching Joujou, her face hidden behind a hoodie, face mask and sunglasses, Wang and Chen told of their bittersweet victory. “I have everything now. I am married and just like heterosexual couples, we can have our own children,” Wang said. “But we were born to have and enjoy all of this, we are not a charity case. We shouldn’t have had to fight for it.” Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019, becoming the first jurisdiction in Asia to do so, but did not remove all inequalities for LGBTQI people. Full legislation rather than an amendment was passed. It includes a provision that allows someone to adopt a spouse’s biological child, but says nothing about adoption rights if neither partner is the biological parent. The provision does not exist in other marriage laws. The result is that in Taiwan any single person can apply to adopt a child, and any married heterosexual couple can apply together. But for married same-sex couple, the only option is to divorce and one of the couple adopts as a single person. They can then remarry, but current law does not allow the partner to adopt and be registered as a parent, leaving them without equal rights. “Gay adoptive families are forced to choose between children and spouses, and between adoption and marriage,” Chen and Wang wrote on Facebook shortly after signing the adoption papers.
Wang and Chen have been together for more than 16 years, and embarked on the adoption journey together. They delayed their marriage in order to complete Wang’s adoption of Joujou, and then took the case to court to have Chen recognised as a parent. On 25 December, the Kaohsiung juvenile and family court ruled that a child should not be discriminated against because of their parents status, and that the law did not expressly prohibit the adoption of adopted children. The ruling allowed Chen to adopt Joujou and be registered as a parent alongside Wang. Chu Chiajong, the director of advocacy organisation Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy, said the ruling was “brave”, in that the judge found his legal obligation was governed by the child’s best interest, and upon assessing Wang and Chen’s case, it meant the two parents were seen as equal under the law. “At the end of the day, someone finally acknowledged it’s all about a child’s best interests, not just about the rights of an LGBTI couple,” Chu said. “Now their daughter’s ID shows both parents name on it. It means she finally is legally under the protection of both parents, of both dads.” While the case has brought hope to LGBTQI couples hoping to start a family, it did not set a precedent and legal change is still needed, said Chu. But the solution is simple, Chu added: “We just need to fix one word in the same-sex marriage law, just the word ‘genetic’. If we get rid of that word it would allow LGBTQI couples to adopt.”
A bill proposed by the legislator Fan Yun has been stalled in Taiwan’s parliament for more than a year. “We are waiting for the submission … from the Ministry of Justice,” Fan told media on Thursday. Wang and Chen have always wanted two children but that is off limits until the law changes. Now they are married they cannot adopt, and if they divorced they would still have to go to court again to fight for dual adoption. “I hope that our first story of victory as a gay couple will serve as a foundation for the full practice of fair, equal treatment for other LGBT families,” said Chen.

3849;3849;3849;3849;3890;3890;Will Coutinho, the costly Barcelona misfit, show his worth at Aston Villa? | Sid Lowe;2022-01-13;['Sid Lowe'];['Transfer window', 'Barcelona', 'Aston Villa', 'Football', 'Sport'];"The most significant goals Philippe Coutinho scored as a Barcelona player were against them, which pretty much sums it up. On loan at Bayern Munich, where he had his most successful season since leaving Liverpool for €160m, he got two in the 8-2 humiliation of the club that owned him then and despite all their efforts to the contrary still own him now. That night in August 2020 he raised a hand to apologise for what he had done. Seventeen months later, he has left again. As for what he has done, most supporters would say: “Nothing much.” The only thing anyone in Catalonia regrets about Coutinho’s departure to Aston Villa this week is that it took too long. Actually, that’s not entirely true: they also regret that there will be no return, except his. At the end of the season, he will probably be back. At which point, they will try to get him to leave again. It was hard enough to bring him in; it proved equally hard to move him out. He has gone only on loan, Villa – who are at home to Manchester United on Saturday – paying 65% of his salary, but at least he has gone. The most expensive signing in Barcelona’s history may have been the worst.
All of which might sound unfair, even cruel. And it probably is: there has been something uncomfortable in watching the treatment of him at times, in that glimpse of vulnerability and rejection; in the feeling that while there is certainly culpability, circumstance, culture and context conspired against him; in watching the good moments slip from view, lost to some collective amnesia. Because there have been goals for Barcelona too: 26 of them plus 14 assists in 106 games is not a terrible return. He scored the opener in a clásico, setting Barcelona on course for a 5-1 demolition of Madrid. He scored in a Copa del Rey semi-final and provided a goal and an assist in the final, helping them complete a double in his first season. He was not playing when they collapsed and were knocked out the Champions League in Rome, so that could hardly be held against him. Had he been there, who knows, maybe they would have won a treble. Which he did with Bayern. There was something about him scoring in Lisbon that expressed that the mess is not of his making. And yet those two Bayern goals may well be the most telling image of his time as a Barcelona player, precisely because they were symbolic of how damaging the whole thing has been: self-inflicted, literally and metaphorically an own goal. A portrait of the regime of the former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, a metaphor for the whole crisis and how they got into a situation like this. None of the goals Coutinho scored for Barcelona, forgotten too fast, leave an impression as lasting. Which may be unfair, but a sort of melancholy clings to his story, to him.
This ending, which may not even be the end, expresses it. Barcelona were so desperate to sign Coutinho that having failed to get him in the summer of 2017 they came back again at Christmas, and for a combined cost with Ousmane Dembélé that the club’s finance director had said would be “irresponsible”, a sackable offence. Their most expensive player leaves for nothing, and even managing that ended up feeling like an achievement. Above all, it was a necessity. When Coutinho signed Barcelona made much of how he had made a “financial effort” to come, which is what clubs too often say and which proved ironic. Tied to a salary of about €15m a year after tax, for the past three years they have been as desperate to give him away, but the same salary that made moving him on so important, pushing him towards the door before other players equally deserving, also trapped him. Everyone knew that they had overspent when he arrived, which is rarely a good start, but the signing made sense. Xavi Hernández, Barça’s current manager, was among those who thought his style compatible with the Camp Nou. But if he said so then, from the outside, four years on, now inside, he doesn’t entirely see it. The sporting director judged him the “ideal replacement” for Andrés Iniesta, which may have been part of the problem just as the price was. Iniesta’s position was not his, nor exactly was Neymar’s.
The technical quality was there though, as was the physical capacity brought from England, at least for a while. So too was the welcome – Luis Suárez collected him from the airport – and the first six months were good, a point that at this juncture feels worth making in his defence: he got nine goals and seven assists in his first 22 games. Yet he could not play in Europe and when he arrived Barcelona were a long way clear in the league, their success not really seen as his. By the end it felt almost as if he wasn’t really there. He was hit by injury and, it seemed, insecurity. Ernesto Valverde had to find a place for him, which wasn’t easy. There was little point in someone else “being Messi” when they had Lionel Messi. Messi and Suárez were relieved of some responsibility to press; accommodating another one wouldn’t work. Attempts to find another role were not always reciprocated. Instead of a determination to rebel against his fate, fight for that role, there was a hint of inhibition. Coutinho was well-liked and those who trained with him saw things – just not often on match days. The club’s culture did not help either. The second season started with four goals and an assist in the opening 10 league games, including that strike against Madrid, without Messi in the team. But there was just one of each in his next 26 La Liga appearances. Frustration grew among fans; whistles followed to which he was not impervious. When he scored against Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final, he put his fingers in his ears, vulnerability revealed. Which of course made it worse. Suárez said, tellingly: “The smallest thing you do – tiny, like Philippe did – is made bigger. The manager said it: ‘I’m surprised you’re talking about the gesture and not the great goal he scored,’ a goal that would have given him confidence. Sometimes you have to understand him. If fans want a player to perform, support him, because a player out on the pitch isn’t stupid. He hears it when he loses a ball and there’s this ‘zzzzzhhhhhiiii’.” The following season Coutinho was in Munich, the first rejection but maybe a chance for a return when Bayern decided not to exercise their right to buy, itself a comment on confidence in him. Sales were sought but not found, so he was stuck.
That said, if bound by circumstance, there was support back at Barcelona. Ronald Koeman, a new manager, called and said he wanted to play him in his position: as a No 10 behind Messi. There were two assists and a goal in the opening three league games. He scored in his first Champions League match too. And then there was … well, not much, Coutinho fading again. A meniscus injury meant he didn’t play a game after the turn of the year. He underwent three operations and spent nine months out. He was too expensive for this, for a club forced to lose the best player they have had. And, yes, Coutinho still being there while Messi wasn’t played its part in his public portrayal, however unjust that was. Again, they tried to move him on. Again, they failed. He talked about working to make people look upon him with “other eyes”. Messi’s departure offered opportunity too. Asked about Coutinho after an impressive display early this season, Koeman replied: “He’s a good footballer. It’s my job to get the best out of them and that starts with putting them in their position.”
“I have always believed in Coutinho,” Koeman had insisted but others didn’t – and, it sometimes felt, that might have included Coutinho himself. When he scored against Valencia in October, his first goal in a year, he said he had a “scar that makes me stronger” and a “desire to be the best I can be”. But at Barcelona, he never really was. Ten days later, Koeman was gone. Now Coutinho has gone, for a second time. “Since I came back I never had a run of four or five starts in a row to be able to be at my best level,” he said. Now, he may get them, another chance to have an impact in someone else’s shirt.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/13/will-coutinho-barcelona-misfit-show-worth-at-aston-villa;sports
3860;3860;3860;3860;3901;3901;It's baby boomers, not young people, who are more likely to be addicted to drugs | Tony Rao;2022-01-13;['Tony Rao'];['Drugs', 'Older people', 'Society', 'Alcohol', 'Alcoholism', 'Health', 'UK news'];"When I joined a community mental health team for older people 20 years ago, addiction wasn’t a central part of our work. One of our first referrals was for an alcoholic patient threatened with eviction. It was rejected – it wasn’t relevant to our service, or so I thought. But over the years the referrals combining social problems and addiction kept coming. We would bat the problems back to the GP, yet the same patients would be referred years later for depression and dementia. Their issues hadn’t gone away; if anything, they had worsened. It was a salutary lesson that led me to join forces with a group of professionals and delve more deeply into the problem of drug and alcohol addiction in older people. As we dug into the data, a pattern began to emerge of substance misuse among those born between 1946 and 1964: the so-called “baby boomers”. Their higher rates of addiction than in older or younger generations are coming home to roost, with implications for public health and clinical services.
New analysis of NHS figures shows that the numbers of older people using addiction services have pulled away from other age groups at an alarming speed. Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug, with the number of people aged 55 and over under the care of drug treatment services rising by nearly 800% over the past 15 years – the figure for the over-65s is more than 1,000%. This compares to a drop of more than 25% among 18- to 19-year-olds. But it doesn’t stop there. For alcohol, opioids, cocaine, crack and amphetamines, there has been a drop of more than 25% in the number of 18- to 19-year-olds under addiction services, compared with a rise of more than 200% in the 55-and-over group over the same timeframe. There are many reasons for this trend. Baby boomers had considerably more exposure to alcohol advertising in their youth, socialising without a drink was looked upon askance and there was a more permissive attitude to “recreational” drug use, with little awareness of the potential harms of drugs such as cannabis. As they have grown older, this age group has also cut down on its drug and alcohol use less than previous generations. Indeed, some people may even have cut down previously, only to increase their use during retirement. And their problems may be masked. One of my female patients presented with recurrent falls until, after a year, she told me that she was drinking half a bottle of whiskey a day. A male patient of mine complained of constant tiredness and poor sleep until he told me that he smoked cannabis four times a week. In this context, it’s encouraging that the figures suggest more older people are seeking help. I have been making sense of data on drug and alcohol use in older people for years and putting it under the noses of policymakers. Some of these efforts have borne fruit. The £25m Big Lottery-funded Drink Wise Age Well project provided an evidence base for what can be done to prevent, protect and intervene so that the physical, psychological and social harms from alcohol can be mitigated among older people. However, drug addiction in older people is still flying under the radar. In 2019, a letter from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, drew attention to the needs of an ageing cohort of drug users. The council recommended that a “particular focus should be the availability and knowledge of staff to address the complex physical and mental health issues of older drug users”. Yet in the second part of Dame Carol Black’s Independent Review of Drugs older people were conspicuous by their absence. We ignore the startling trend in treatment for drug and alcohol addiction among older people at our peril. Older people not only have distinct problems that reflect the physical and psychosocial consequences of ageing, but are also at risk of distinct mental disorders such as alcohol-related dementia. Looking to the future, truly integrated care will mean joining together public health and the NHS to rebuild addiction services. That will come at a cost, but one that will undoubtedly improve the lives and livelihoods of our invisible addicts.

LarboIreland I’ve been in about 80 movies already. I guess part of being an actor is there’s some immortality. That’s why people are interested in showbusiness, because you kind of live for ever. So maybe I would. It depends how bad the movies are. Was the bust up between you and Jean-Claude Van Damme staged for publicity? Granadapanda The one in Cannes was staged. It got a little bit heated … I think somebody pushed my ex-wife into somebody. I can’t remember, but it was Jean-Claude’s idea. He’s a showman.
How did they make you look like a giant in comparison with Stallone? LeaderOfTheFree I am taller than him [Lundgren is 1.96m (6ft 5in), Stallone 1.77m (5ft 9in)], so it’s all about camera angles. A lot of times, they put me on a box. When I come into the press conference in my uniform, I have lifts in my shoes. Stallone was clever to exaggerate the difference. Less talented actors would try to make themselves look bigger against the other guy, but he knew that, by building up the opponent, it made him look better at the end. Did you really hospitalise Sly while making Rocky IV? mrnobody74 I don’t know. He keeps talking about it, so maybe he’s right. He did go to the hospital, but I don’t know whether it was my punches or the fact that he was so overworked as the director, actor and writer. We shot those 15 rounds over two or three weeks, eight or 12 hours a day, so you’re throwing thousands of punches. If you don’t connect, it looks a bit fake, but it doesn’t mean you want to hurt the other guy. But there were no hard feelings. Did you use a stand-in? Hamble Back in the day, you had to do it all yourself: Rocky IV, The Punisher, Masters of the Universe, all the Expendables. I’ve jumped from a motorcycle to a truck; dangerous things I would never do now. Staying physically fit over the years has been nice. There aren’t many actors who can stay physically fit for a long time. Part of the game is trying to look fit, at least. Did your depiction of a Russian fighter gain you any respect in the Soviet Union? duffdawg I think so. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, Rocky and Universal Soldier came out on VHS and were the first western films Russians were allowed to watch. They don’t have that many international movie stars in Russia, so they’ve adopted me to some degree. Do you still follow Everton? What do you reckon this season? Vammyp I follow soccer a bit, but it’s difficult in America, because you have to be a diehard fan to find out when it’s on TV. I prefer the World Cup or the Olympics, when it’s a big deal. The Swedish ladies were pretty good in Tokyo, but lost [in the final] against Canada. Belgium had a good team – a lot of big guys.
Coleslaw or mayonnaise on a ham sandwich? Twatacus1 I would say mayonnaise. Hur ofta besöker du Sverige? Skulle du kunna flytta tillbaka till Skandinavien som oldie? [How often do you visit Sweden? Could you move back to Scandinavia as an oldie?] MissPiStorm I visit a couple of times a year. My fiancee [the personal trainer Emma Krokdal] is from Norway, so we’re both Scandinavian. My two brothers and two sisters still live in Sweden. My older half-brother has the same dad, then four of us have the same parents, of which I’m the oldest, so I am still in charge. When we were little, I used to direct my siblings playing soldiers, marching around in different formations. My dad was in the military, so I picked it up from him. They hated it, but were too scared to protest. I don’t know if I’d like to move back. I haven’t thought about it, but for now I like California. Los Angeles is where my job is and I like the lifestyle; it’s quite liberal, you can be who you want to be. People don’t care and leave you alone. The smaller the places, the more rigid the social structure, whereas everybody in LA is a bit of a freak, so I fit right in.
Do you remember how to determine the Reynolds number for a Newtonian fluid? DirtyOverThirty Oh, shit. No. It rings a bell way back in my head. Reynolds number has to do with flow characteristics, but I can’t remember exactly. I studied chemical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and got my master’s at the University of Sydney. Then I ran into the singer Grace Jones. We fell in love and moved to New York. I always wanted to act, so I decided to try it, but I never regret studying in college – making friends and the intellectual atmosphere. You take the things you learn with you. They have certainly enriched my life on another level, because acting is pretty limited. The love scene between Grace Jones and Roger Moore in A View to a Kill is really unusual. Do you agree? Leobatch I agree. I was there. She has a love scene with Christopher Walken and she has one with Roger Moore. Roger Moore was a practical joker. He always brought something into bed [scenes] to alleviate the tension, like a sex toy. I think he did the same with Grace, but she knew about it, so I think she brought something, too … I can’t remember what, but it was even more extreme and I don’t think he was ready for it. They have this S&M moment where they wrestle around, if I recall, but it was all in character. I think she did a good job there. Do you ever wear the ear necklace from Universal Soldier when you go out? TeeDubyaBee It’s in storage. The rubber ears are 30 years old, so they’re decomposed and even yuckier than before. Do you still play the drums? themurph100 Very seldom. I played a drummer about 15 years ago [in 2009’s Command Performance]. But I don’t have a kit, because, first of all, it takes up a large space. Second, everybody gets annoyed. I used to have an electronic one, where you just hear it in the headset. Maybe I’ll get one of those. Actually, it’s a good point. I miss it. I really should do it. It’s very relaxing and meditative.
Have you ever seen a ghost? ArthurSternom I haven’t seen one, but I think I heard one many years ago in Sweden. I was staying in this 18th-century manor house in the middle of winter with my half-brother and his dad, to go hunting. I woke in the middle of the night, got really cold, felt something in the room and got really scared. I usually don’t get scared. Then I heard this woman speaking on the phone in old Swedish or something, but I couldn’t really make out what was going on. There were no women in the house, but there was one of these old wooden phones outside in the corridor and all these pieces of luggage that used to be owned by my half-brother’s dad’s mother. She had killed herself in the room next to mine, but I didn’t know any of this until the next day. That was the first time I felt that there was something supernatural. I never went back to spend another night in that place. What was it like working with Brandon Lee in Showdown in Little Tokyo? KieranK1982 It was a pleasure. He was a good martial artist, a very good actor and very charismatic, just like his dad. It was very sad what happened. He would’ve been a huge star had he not gotten killed so early.
Do you ever imagine yourself as a much older actor, like Max von Sydow, Sir Patrick Stewart or Sir Ian McKellen? A Gan‑Dolph the Grey? Murdomania I’m starting to feel that way, because it creeps up on you. In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I play Amber Heard’s dad, this wise old king with a little beard and long hair. I don’t feel like a wise old king, but a lot of the fans watching that movie are maybe 10 or 15 years old. I’m 50 years older, so to them I am a wiser, older actor. It’s interesting, because it’s gone full circle. I got famous young, when I was 27. But I’ve had some hard times in my career. Luckily, in last four or five years, I’ve done Creed II, Aquaman, and I’ve just finished The Expendables 4. I’ve got some interesting scripts I’d like to direct. I’ve done so much action that I really enjoy working on characters more. I don’t miss running around on a motorcycle shooting people, or jumping from a cliff to a plane – I’ve done that. I think it’s more interesting to use maturity and experience as an actor. If you suddenly found yourself a young man in today’s world, what would you pursue? KitRey I had a lot of issues from my childhood that I had to figure out by becoming a fighter and then an actor. It was more like therapy for me. If I was a young man today, I would probably still want to persue acting and directing, but maybe have a chance to train without being thrown into it, which happened in my case. I got famous in one movie and then was suddenly starring in big movies, not really knowing what I was doing. I didn’t have much technique as an actor and I had to figure it out. So, I would probably pursue acting in a more serious way. • Castle Falls, directed by and starring Dolph Lundgren, is out now on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/dolph-lundgren-in-showbusiness-you-kind-of-live-for-ever;entertainment and culture
3865;3865;3865;3865;3906;3906;Covid? Never heard of it! Step into a carefree past: watch The Apprentice;2022-01-13;['Yomi Adegoke'];['Television', 'The Apprentice', 'Television & radio', 'Reality TV', 'Culture', 'Alan Sugar'];"Sometimes, change is the last thing you want. Yes, in the newfangled world of reality TV, you can now find innovative formats where dates are disposed of via a trapdoor or contestants woo each other without speaking the same language. But 2020 and 2021 were packed with enough plot twists to last a lifetime. This is why the return of TV staple The Apprentice is so welcome. After two years off air, almost everything in the world has changed, bar the show itself. As always, Alan Sugar takes on a crop of business hopefuls who are confident to the point of delusion (which is how one of them actually described themselves in the first episode). Even the first few minutes of its return were characteristically thick with quotables: “I am the EST of everything, which means I am the coolEST, smartEST and wickedEST in businEST”, assured one contestant. Fascinatingly, the opening episode took place as though the past few years didn’t happen. Bar the odd reference to the pandemic through Sugar’s bad dad jokes (“You don’t get furloughed, you get fired!”), you would be forgiven for thinking it had been shot pre-Covid. The economic uncertainty, the decimation of the high street and the remote-working revolution were things of neither the past nor the future. The strange time-machine energy was only exacerbated by the addition of the show’s first winner, Tim Campbell, stepping in for Claude Littner, and a contestant introducing the word “bouji” to her entirely baffled team. Watching The Apprentice in 2022 is an exercise in nostalgia, a televisual DeLorean to transport us to the simpler time of 2019. It almost feels like the suspension of reality is intentional. Why else would the first task have been to launch a luxury cruise line, after possibly the most disastrous period for the industry in recent years? While the two teams built their rival brands, in the real world, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that every US passenger cruise had Covid cases on board. Meanwhile, the UK is still reeling from the disaster of the Britain-registered Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined at Yokohama for a month in 2020 after almost a quarter of its 3,700 passengers were infected with Covid. But this is not a criticism. More often than not, TV is about the suspension of reality – it is why sitcom characters referencing the pandemic can be so grating. If we wanted to watch the news, we would do so. The idea that the boys’ team might encourage a post-pandemic boom in cruises with a logo that – as pointed out by Twitter users – resembled a Covid variant is surely a thing of fantasy. The girls gave them a run for their money in the ineptitude stakes, their cringe-inducing branding not much better than the boys’ anthropomorphic oil spill. It is a demonstration of the show’s commitment to representation; women can be just as belligerent and ridiculous as men, thank you very much. In these times, The Apprentice’s comeback should have felt irrelevant for an endless list of reasons, but the deja vu made it even more enjoyable than usual. At times, the show has appeared allergic to the future; Sugar’s declaration in the opening episode that “TikTok is becoming very powerful” sounded partly fearful. But this time the show’s lack of innovation has worked in its favour. For nearly 20 years, we have been regaled by its familiar, formulaic combining of egos and schadenfreude – and we probably will be for 20 more. If “keep calm and carry on” were a TV format, it would be The Apprentice, the ultimate pair of reality-show safe hands.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/13/covid-never-heard-of-it-step-into-a-carefree-past-watch-the-apprentice;entertainment and culture

3877;3877;3877;3877;3918;3918;Are You Listening? by Jenny Rogers review – putting the office into therapy;2022-01-13;['Gaby Hinsliff'];['Books', 'Culture', 'Life and style', 'Work & careers', 'Counselling and therapy'];"Hamish is a rich and successful entrepreneur, a man who seems to be winning at life. Yet secretly, he is falling apart. His second wife has left him, he’s stressed out of his mind and he has just mournfully realised that no matter how many trophy girlfriends or French chateaux he acquires, some other millionaire will always have a better one.
If you hate Hamish already, then you may be missing the broader lesson of this book, which is that unhappy working lives are just as complex and fascinating as the unhappy private lives they frequently mirror, and also just as deserving of attention. Hamish, it turns out, is now a happy social entrepreneur with an admirable sideline mentoring former care leavers and ex-prisoners into work. Jenny Rogers is a work coach, one of those professions that arouses instant scepticism in some, although the absorbing case studies she has collected in Are You Listening? suggest she is really more of an office shrink. The high-flying executives she is hired to help invariably start off presenting dry corporate dilemmas, but soon end up weepily confessing to some childhood trauma or hidden vulnerability, which turns out to be what is really driving their behaviour in the office. Time and time again, it becomes clear that the emotional baggage most people carry doesn’t just affect intimate relationships. Many of us end up lugging it into work, and dumping it on our colleagues, too. Her book is resolutely not a self-help manual for those in a difficult professional situation, although reading it may make you slightly more likely to identify the resident office psychopath. And while it contains some universal themes, Rogers’s generally well-heeled clients may not be all that relatable to the average office worker. But the stories are intriguing, told well enough to draw the reader in, and en masse contain some shrewd truths. The overall effect is rather like a middle management version of the psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz’s The Examined Life, which distilled a lifetime’s worth of conversations on the couch. If Rogers seems at times overly keen to highlight parallels between coaching and psychotherapy, that perhaps comes from a lifetime of people snorting in disbelief (as Hamish initially does) that “people actually pay you money for this”. But the sensitive process she describes seems worth taking seriously, not least for anyone who has experienced the profound daily misery that a bullying boss or dysfunctional team can cause. It’s also a useful reminder both that tricky colleagues may privately be grappling with more than meets the eye, and that ultimately it’s people that make a workplace tick. Managers sometimes criticise younger staff for wanting to bring what millennials call their “whole selves”, and previous generations might call “messy personal stuff”, to work. What this book elegantly exposes, however, is that there’s really no such thing as keeping it “strictly business”; that somewhere beneath even the stiffest of corporate stuffed shirts, there beats some semblance of a heart. • Are You Listening? is published by Penguin (£14.99).

3883;3883;3883;3883;3924;3924;Jim Harbaugh’s likely NFL return shows college isn’t what it used to be;2022-01-13;['Oliver Connolly'];['NFL', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"It was easy to scoff at the initial reports that University of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was considering a return to the NFL. In the normal cause of business, it looked like a well-timed (if obvious) leak on the heels of a successful season, a college coach looking to maximize his value and extract maximum dollars and influence out his school.
Not so fast. At this stage, Harbaugh returning to the NFL feels like a fait accompli. He has been linked with all of the head coach openings that have trickled out of the league this week, and has yet to issue any public denials that he’s looking to leave Ann Arbor. In case you’re in need of a quick refresher on Harbaugh’s time at Michigan: He returned to his alma mater as a conquering hero, a former Wolverines quarterback who turned into one of the most successful coaches – in college and the pros – of the 2010s; he had a reputation for heading to places that stunk and immediately making them great; he had previously taken the 49ers to within a play of winning the Super Bowl; things turned sour over the Niners potential rebuild; he was in high demand in the NFL; he rebuffed interest in favor of returning to his school. In his first couple of years back at school, Michigan were good but not good enough. Then they stunk. Then Harbaugh, at one time the highest-paid coach in the country, took a meaty pay cut. Then Michigan became really good, finally toppling bitter rivals Ohio State and making it to a first college football playoff – where they were boat-raced by eventual national champions Georgia. In the abstract, a coach beating the once-unconquerable rival and making it into the postseason would signal the start of something. For Harbaugh and Michigan, it seems like the end. Harbaugh’s anticipated return to the NFL – be it with the Bears, Raiders, Dolphins, Giants, or any of the open positions that have interest in the coach – is about more than one coach, one college, and one NFL team. It’s about a shift in the landscape of coaching at the highest level. There was a time when college coaching jobs ranked as the best in the country. Sure, college coaches would bounce up to the next level to test themselves, as much an ego play as anything else – a chance to see if they could really coach against the best of the best. But the expectations, the short tenures, the salary cap, the draft meant sustained success was difficult. Parity is legislated in the NFL; it’s equality by design. In college, the rich have always gotten richer. You recruit well. So you win. So you recruit even better. So you win even bigger. On and on the cycle rolls. Coaches were apt to stay where they could rack up wins and champions and accrue ever-increasing amounts of power. In the NFL, teams are designated one first-round pick a year. At the blueblood college programs, they’re consistently pulling in two or three future first-round picks a year in high-school recruiting, with a gaggle of second and third-round picks filling out the roster. In the good old days, once you had established a program, the thing could sit on cruise control for close to a decade; the season coming down to one or two games at the end. But times they are a-changin’. Athletes at the college level have been given some agency. Now, the playing body has some power. Athletes are now free to transfer schools, one time, penalty-free. They’re able to put their name in the ‘transfer portal’, to let other schools know they’re available and open for business. And it is indeed a business. The advent of Name Image and Likeness (NIL) in all its unregulated glory has led to a recruiting arms race. What was once covert is now overt: players are being paid full-time salaries to play collegiate football. The mechanics are goofy. Coaches cannot outright recruit a player based on NIL. A booster must set up an LLC and ‘license’ a player’s (or whole position groups) image.
Still: The implications have been immediate and gravity-altering. Bringing payments out of the shadows is what allowed Jackson State, an HBCU in college football’s second division, to attract the No 1 overall recruit in the country. The traditional powers continue to hoover up the majority of the talent, but the playing field has been democratized. If your school has a wealthy backer willing to hand over dollars to college students, you’re in The Game. Those jigsaw pieces taken together have changed the structure of the sport. Alabama built a dynastic program on principle that it was ‘fourth-and-goal every day’. Now, it’s free agency every day. A college coach is no longer spending whatever free time he can muster firing off texts to teenagers or flying across the country to check out the next biggest thing. He is re-recruiting the players already in his building. There is no legislation that could stop Bryce Young, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, from putting his name into the transfer portal tomorrow. He could offer his services to the highest bidder at the click of a button. That may be Alabama, it may not. The power that schools and the coaches that govern those schools once held over the players, their future NFL prospects and earning power, has eroded. The players gaining a modicum of power has loosened the grip of once dictatorial coaches. Every conversation, every decision is a recruiting pitch. Bench a player for his backup, he’s gone. Unable to pony up the NIL deal commensurate with your lineman’s value? He’ll see you at the class reunion. There’s a reason Nick Saban is suddenly all smiles; the talent will go where it’s fun and they pay. It will require a different style of coach moving forward, a different mindset. When asked about whether he had ever dreamed about taking the Miami job, new head coach Mario Cristobal, widely considered the nation’s top recruiter, shot back: “I don’t have time for dreams”. There was not a hint of jest in his voice. He was serious. Why take time for things such as sleep when there’s another deal to be struck with a three-star cornerback in Boca Raton? While you’re dreaming, Cristobal is ‘crootin. Once upon a time, with four-year scholarships and coaches able to block transfer requests from their athletes, a college coach could build for the long-term. It was the NFL that was a place that demanded immediate results. Now, college football is the place of upheaval; the NFL is where a coach can find some stasis. Sure, since the NFL expanded its playoff field 11 teams have failed to make the playoffs and 10 of those sides have made coaching changes (not strictly for on-field reasons). But – ah – guaranteed contracts; a set number of draft picks; a salary cap; the chance to sign your quarterback to a deal that means he cannot up and leave for a bigger offer in eight months’ time. No coach goes into a job assuming they’re going to fail. They think they’re going to succeed. And if you think you’re going to hit – that you can out-scheme opponents and find the talent needed to win – the NFL now offers an advantage over the college game. When you get done with work, you’re done with work. Player movement doesn’t really begin until the offseason – and it’s regulated. Those TikTok dances you’ve had to do in an 18-year-olds living? They’re out. Sleeping over at a kicker’s house to fend off your recruiting rivals? They’re gone, too. Team-building is streamlined. There are no backroom dealings with boosters. There have always been extremes between the college and professional ranks. It’s why so many of college football’s superstar coaches have flamed out in the pros. The broad outline was the same but the nitty-gritty required different skill sets. That divide is now growing. Those who could stomach the old way of doing things — their way of doing things – will soon start running for the hills now that the players have a say. One game requires a fresh skillset; the other a different entirely. Harbaugh will be the first to jump from the new lifestyle because he has the pedigree to do so. And while college coaches have had rough records when jumping to the pros before, that won’t stop NFL owners from offering big-time deals to try to lure away the next hot candidate. Now more than ever, they will listen.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/jim-harbaugh-nfl-comeback-rumors;sports
3921;3921;3921;3921;3963;3963;‘A banana, concrete – those are good gifts’: the recycling group turning strangers into friends;2022-01-13;['Emma Beddington'];['Life and style', 'Ethical and green living', 'Facebook', 'Social media', 'Social networking', 'Society', 'World news'];"Who on earth wants fish tank wastewater, chicken poo, tumble-dryer lint, loo roll tubes, “a plaster mould of a Komodo dragon’s foot” or half a broken toilet? No one, you might think, but the Buy Nothing community begs to differ: these are all real “gifts” snapped up by more than 5 million members worldwide, who give away their unwanted items in the local community. It’s living proof that “one person’s trash is another’s treasure”, as Alisa Miller, the administrator of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group puts it. Miller offered her daughter’s broken toy birdcage with little hope anyone would want it; it was snapped up by a local flower-arranging enthusiast, and filled with succulents and trailing plants. Her co-administrator’s son is the current custodian of a toy helicopter that has been played with by five Buy Nothing families to date. Members ask for what they want and usually get it: anything from household appliances, furniture and gardening tools to clothes and baby gear. There is nothing unique or original about giving and getting stuff for free. It’s a practice as old as humanity. The juggernaut giveaway network Freecycle was founded in 2003 – but what distinguishes the Buy Nothing project from Freecycle, Freegle, Olio and their ilk is that the emphasis is less on stuff, per se, and more on community. In what Buy Nothing describes as its “hyperlocal gift economies”, users are encouraged to let items “simmer” rather than giving them away to the first person who asks, perhaps suggesting they share a joke or provide a story explaining why they would like the item. In addition to “gifts” and “asks”, users are encouraged to post “gratitude”, with a message or a picture showing what a gifted item has meant to them.
That could all sound insufferably twee, but the thinking behind it is fairly radical. It’s a “social experiment”, explain the project’s founders, Rebecca Rockefeller and Liesl Clark, from their respective living rooms in Washington state, effecting a fundamental shift in our attitude to material goods by building a sense of community, and treating items as community-owned and shared. “If you come at it from an angle of joy and human connection,” says Rockefeller, “you’re more likely to inspire lasting change than when you come at it from telling people: ‘You have to do without this.’” Clark, 55, and Rockefeller, 52, bonded as “Freecycle renegades”, Rockefeller says. She was trying to give away things (twigs, nettles) that her local Freecycle moderator did not consider suitable gifts; both were looking for a deeper connection beyond an anonymous back-door drop or pickup.
“We wanted more of that dialogue,” says Clark. Her attitude was shaped by her experiences as a film-maker, exploring mortuary caves on the Nepal-Tibet border with her husband and children. The objects they found there had been used, exchanged, appreciated and transformed over centuries. “It helped me understand a little more the practical side of reuse and how an entire culture could thrive without any stores.”
“The stuff is one thing, but the stories that go along with it – the humour, the poignancy, the memories – those are the things we really want from each other,” agrees Rockefeller. Both, too, were shocked at the tides of plastic detritus that washed up on the beaches of their home on Bainbridge Island. “It led us naturally to ask what role do we play in this and how can we lessen our impact?” The pair started out with an in-person gift exchange in a local park at weekends; they launched the first Facebook-hosted group in 2013. I’m speaking to them surrounded by the debris of a minimal, but not particularly mindful Christmas: cardboard packaging, return labels and scraps of wrapping paper. It’s a time of year characterised for many of us by a sugar rush and guilt slump of conspicuous consumption. Buy Nothing offers members tools and approaches to counter that sickly consumption hangover, but “Buy Nothing” is the name, not the aim. There’s no expectation or even aspiration that users will somehow forge a fully cashless economy. Indeed, during the pandemic, Buy Nothing changed its rules to allow members to give gifts of cash. “Quite literally, that’s a lifesaving gift you can give another person in a lot of cases,” says Rockefeller. “This was never meant to be an exercise in purity: that doesn’t serve us well. What serves us well is flexibility. A banana, a chunk of concrete or $10 – those are all good gifts.”
She speaks from personal experience: when the first Buy Nothing group was established, Rockefeller was an unemployed single mother. “I was having to go through the US social services system – it’s horrible and it’s intentionally meant to make you feel horrible about yourself.” Getting food and clothes for her children through Buy Nothing gave her financial breathing space. “I had money to go and buy a cup of coffee or a book, which would have been 100% unreachable for me.” Of equal importance, she says, was being able to gift bread she had made or foods she had foraged, which allowed her to “get some dignity back”. “The services we can provide are gifts in themselves,” adds Clark. “Gifts of time” (babysitting, gardening, lifts) and “gifts of self” (social meet-ups, offers to become a workout buddy) are a key element of the Buy Nothing experience.
From that first Facebook group, the community has expanded to 7,000 Buy Nothing groups with, at the most recent count, 5.3 million users in 44 countries as diverse as Guatemala, Iceland, Oman, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. On a slow day, Clark tells me, it gains 1,500 members. The greatest concentrations of communities are in Seattle and New York. There is also a huge, dynamic Australian Buy Nothing network. According to Buy Nothing figures, the UK has 50 active groups and approximately 40,000 members. Although Buy Nothing is described by Clark as “an open-source model”, most local groups operate on Facebook, for which Buy Nothing provides guidance, training and ground rules. A healthy pattern of organic growth, with occasional viral spurts, accelerated during the pandemic. For Clark, physical isolation made people more aware of a deeper kind of isolation. “There’s this ethic of self-reliance, that you fill your house with all the things you need as a family – there you are against the world. But then the pandemic came along. We quickly came to realise how lonely we actually are as a result of not sharing. What we’ve observed is that if people couldn’t physically get together, they’ve been able to virtually connect through sharing items and services.” Inevitably, this kind of growth creates challenges. As groups “sprout” – the Buy Nothing term for when they reach the maximum recommended capacity of 1,000 members and split geographically – redrawn boundaries have at times perpetuated or reinforced historic racial and socio-economic barriers. These issues have on occasion been compounded by the Facebook group structure where considerable power lies in the hands of local administrators, deciding who can join and what they can post. Clark and Rockefeller have addressed Buy Nothing’s failings, including the “flaws and racism we as co-founders built into the original structure of this movement”, as they said in a June 2020 statement. An Equity Team now provides guidance to groups on how to develop an “actively anti-racist and anti-oppression policy”, including trying to use geographical group boundaries to create diverse sharing communities.
Miller worked hard to avoid creating a silo of privilege in south-east London when creating the community in 2019. “This area has got huge wealth inequality. It couldn’t be more diverse, and we intentionally wanted to make sure that we straddled those areas; that was a critical goal.” The newly launched Buy Nothing app is designed to swerve the structural potential for inequity of the Facebook group model. Here, users choose their own geographical limits and create their own communities: “hyperlocal”, “neighbourhood+” or “surrounding areas”. “I’m really hoping our app makes this more accessible [to people] who have been unable for a variety of reasons to connect with it on other platforms, so we get a more diverse set of voices,” says Rockefeller. There are personal costs to growth, too. A network of nearly 13,000 volunteer administrators keeps Buy Nothing functioning, assisted by a core staff of a dozen, all working from their kitchen tables and living rooms. Clark and Rockefeller have always been unpaid volunteers. “I work weekends, in the holidays, in the hours when you’re supposed to be sleeping,” says Clark, who was able to make money from film-making initially. “There’s certainly some joy in it, but it’s become unsustainable.”
Rockefeller has taken on part-time jobs over the years to support her full-time commitment to Buy Nothing. “My kids look at it as their sibling,” she says. “It’s not just me and Rebecca,” adds Clark. “The key volunteers are an incredible group of, basically, women, who are doing this unpaid labour and it’s not the model we want to promote for the world. We need to get a little more creative with this.” They hope that the app will also allow them to capture data on what Buy Nothing does to reduce waste and waste management costs, thereby potentially enabling it to raise funds from municipalities. “We’ve never been able to study how much waste is being diverted from landfill,” says Clark. “Imagine if any given community could access that information?” Moving from the germ of an idea to a global structure is challenging, but for Clark and Rockefeller, the impetus and the motivation is as strong as ever. I ask about their most memorable experiences with Buy Nothing. Clark describes how musical instruments were collected and delivered to victims of the 2018 fire in Paradise, California. As a community, they had enjoyed making music together. Their basic material needs were met by big charities, but they missed having this creative outlet.
For Rockefeller, it’s a source of great pride that her brother-in-law’s community group suggested Buy Nothing as a first port of call when helping refugees from Afghanistan settle in their town. “We’re building this tool that I really believe will have the power to help us, as individuals, to participate in our collective survival,” she says. Over in south-east London, members of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group appreciate the new friendships and the sense of local connection. “It’s culturally so different from any kind of other free stuff group out there,” says Miller. “I love giving back to the community and turning to it when I’m in need of something” adds Elif Koç. “I can spend what I’ve saved for charity and other meaningful causes.” Their group has shared camping equipment and loaned books to children; it has supported a victim of domestic violence and a refugee in setting up home and providing clothing for their families. It does feel like a gentle revolution – one houseplant cutting or power tool at a time. As one member, Sarah Wilde, puts it: “I really like the opportunity to quietly rage against the machine.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/13/a-banana-concrete-those-are-good-gifts-recycling-group-turning-strangers-into-friends;environment
3980;3980;3980;3980;4023;4023;The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s apologetic defence: so begins an era of political chaos | Editorial;2022-01-12;['Editorial'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'PMQs', 'Health', 'House of Commons', 'Politics', 'Gray report'];Once again the country finds itself paralysed by a crisis in the Conservative party. Tory MPs took a gamble on Boris Johnson’s personality in order to gain the benefit of his Brexit credentials. In 2019, Mr Johnson did lead his party to victory in the general election. But that bet has not paid off subsequently because of who he is: an incompetent rogue, disloyal to almost everyone but himself. His government has stumbled from crisis to crisis in recent months, wrecking its authority. Mr Johnson deals with scandals by hunkering down and waiting for the storm to blow itself out. That is the approach he adopted on Wednesday. After weeks of dodging questions, Mr Johnson offered an apology – and a defence – for spending 25 minutes at a boozy evening event in May 2020 for dozens of people in the Downing Street garden in breach of the law during the first Covid lockdown. However, the Tory leader used lawyerly phrasing to imply that he had, at the time, considered this to be work. This was not a plausible rebuttal, and will not wash with the public. Voters will surely only think that Mr Johnson was at an illegal No 10 garden party when their loved ones were dying alone in hospitals. The lockdown regulations were in place to protect the public and squash the spread of the virus in an unvaccinated population. There could not have been one rule for the public and another for the prime minister. However, voters have no immediate opportunity to evict Mr Johnson from Downing Street. If the prime minister’s apology is genuine, he should accept he broke the law. He almost certainly lied to parliament and deceived voters for weeks. There has to be a price. Labour and the Lib Dems have called for him to go. Mr Johnson is not someone given to resigning. The police could issue a fine. That would be a resigning matter for a prime minister. If Mr Johnson were secure in his job he might shrug it off. But he isn’t. Instead, the prime minister sought shelter behind the investigation by Sue Gray, a senior Cabinet Office official. This is perhaps because Ms Gray is unlikely to rule on Mr Johnson’s defence – that he “thought” the people drinking in No 10’s garden were at a work event. It is more likely that Ms Gray resigns because she thought Mr Johnson was not taking her inquiry seriously than the prime minister departs because of its findings. Mr Johnson can be turfed out of office by Tory MPs – and it is they who need an acceptable explanation for May 2020 to appease angry voters. The odds that Conservative backbenchers change their leader shorten as those of their re-election lengthen. While 15% of the parliamentary party could trigger a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson, he will be safe – for 12 months – if he has 180 MPs backing him. Many are in open revolt. A few hours after his statement, Douglas Ross, leader of Scottish Conservatives, called for Mr Johnson to resign. A senior backbencher, William Wragg, followed suit. The irony is that Mr Johnson was elected to put an end to an era of political chaos that began with the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, his shortcomings have ensured Tory rebellions will become part of political life. Factions now vie for party supremacy against a backdrop of post-pandemic rows over net zero and Brexit. Mr Johnson no doubt hopes to fight May’s local elections as Tory leader. But it is now clear that the prime minister grievously betrayed the trust of the nation at a time of national crisis. If he stays in Downing Street, it will only intensify the divisions in Britain over how to run the economy and manage the country.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-apologetic-defence-so-begins-an-era-of-political-chaos;politics
3984;3984;3984;3984;4027;4027;Festive boost for retailers adds to Bank of England’s inflation woes;2022-01-12;['Nils Pratley'];['Business', 'Retail industry', 'Centrica', 'Household bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Money', 'Utilities', 'Energy bills', 'UK news'];Retailers’ trading reports will roll in for a while yet, so there’s still time for losers to reveal themselves, but it was hard on Wednesday to find anybody who was unhappy with their Christmas lot or who is panicking about the year ahead. Sainsbury’s produced a £60m upgrade to its profits forecast alongside the usual excited blah about the “lowest ever” Christmas dinner and the “biggest ever” new year. Omicron clearly diverted a few quid from pubs and restaurants into supermarkets’ tills but the numbers were still strong on their own account. Meanwhile, JD Sports went for a £65m upgrade after enjoying a boom and Dunelm, the soft furnishings group, said profits would be “materially ahead” of market expectations. Over at Whitbread (not a retailer but Christmas also matters for the owner of Premier Inn, Beefeater and Brewers Fayre) Omicron killed any chance of a profits surprise but the group said it traded “significantly ahead of the market” in the UK. What’s going on? Aren’t all these companies meant to be fretting about the cost-of-living squeeze on consumers, unresolved supply chain hassles and the arrival of inflation in their energy and wage bills? There was a bit of that, but the general tone was that companies expect to cope. Whitbread predicts inflation in its sector to average 7%-8%, adding £1.4bn to its cost base, but thinks it will be able to “largely offset” the pressures via cost savings, increases in room rates and the benefit of being a large business. The tale was similar at Dunelm: a mix of price rises and better sourcing will “largely mitigate the impact of inflation on commodity costs and freight rates”. The outlook wasn’t spelled out as clearly at Sainsbury’s, which is simultaneously trying to parade its Aldi price-matching credentials on 150 core products while also passing on cost pressures (such as 5.3% pay increase to base pay) where it can. It can count on its regular 2% annual saving from efficiency gains but can also, say analysts, expect the pricing climate to become easier in supermarket-land. That, at least, seems to be what Jefferies’ analysts mean by “a more rational industry structure in the face of building input inflation”. Discounters will have a “reducing appetite” for ploughing profits into lower prices and the private equity-owned players (Asda and Morrisons) “seem to be displaying a growing focus on profit preservation”. In ordinary English, profits margins won’t get whacked because prices will go up. From the point of view of shareholders, it all sounds reassuring, even if much hinges on whether consumers achieve wage increases to protect their disposable incomes. But, given the current strength in trading, one cannot be surprised that retailers think they stand a fair chance of making price rises stick. For the Bank of England, though, it’s another setback to 2021’s idea that the return of inflation would be “transitory”. In the retail and hotel sectors, that’s not how life looks at the start of 2022. According to the revised central banking script, inflation should peak at 6%-ish in the spring and then fall. Well, maybe. One can also see how pressures could linger, or take far longer to reverse. Boardrooms aren’t hiding the fact: they are consciously adjusting for an inflationary environment. Higher gas prices could extend beyond 2024 On a similar theme, Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, the British Gas owner, is only making a safe prediction when he says gas prices could stay high for two years. For consumers, at least 12 months is virtually guaranteed already because of the backward-looking nature of the regulator Ofgem’s price-cap formula. The increase in the price cap in April, which seems likely to be set at about £2,000 versus £1,277 currently, captures wholesale prices that have rocketed since autumn. The following adjustment, to apply from October, will look at wholesale prices in the first half of this year, which futures markets say will remain high. Indeed, the current best guess is that £2,000 will be exceeded. Of course, the government and Ofgem can – and should – try to dampen the shock for consumers by various means, such as removing VAT, shunting green levies on to general taxation and deferring the costs of the many supplier failures.

For two of us, it was the second time this had happened. While waiting for our operations, the conversation in the ward had turned to Novak Djokovic and anti-vaxxers. They were scorned as idiots, and in Djokovic’s case as an entitled and privileged idiot – but all as deeply selfish and a danger to the community. Boris Johnson and the government have a lot to answer for, as they have acted disastrously all through this pandemic, pandering to these science deniers as well as to the Conservative party’s libertarians and to business interests – while acting irresponsibly themselves and with contempt for the rest of us. We need to argue and campaign for a “No jab – then no job and no entry into public spaces” policy. Anti-vaxxers need to face penalties for their selfish choices, which threaten the lives of others.

3999;3999;3999;3999;4042;4042;Novak Djokovic allows training to be observed as investigations continue;2022-01-12;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Tennis', 'Sport', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Australian Open 2022', 'Australia news'];"Novak Djokovic’s preparations for the Australian Open continued on Wednesday as the question of his presence in the country remained unresolved. Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, is still deliberating over whether or not he should revoke the world No 1’s visa. On Wednesday afternoon, Djokovic returned for his third practice session at Melbourne Park since he was released from immigration detention. With a small contingent of media present, Djokovic trained with the Australian youngster Tristan Schoolkate and worked through a series of drills.
He had previously ensured his practice was closed to onlookers, with the doors of Rod Laver Arena locked during his sessions and the live feed from the arena turned off. At the same time the Serb was on court, he published a statement on Instagram addressing the pictures of him attending an award presentation for children – “I was asymptomatic and felt good, and I had not received the notification of a positive PCR test result until after that event” – and an interview with French newspaper L’Équipe after he had tested positive for Covid-19. According to The Age newspaper in Melbourne, the Department of Home Affairs is investigating the various issues Djokovic addressed in his social media post – his incorrect Australia Travel Declaration, his reported failure to comply with Covid-19 rules in Serbia and questions about the date of his Covid test – in addition to Hawke’s investigation into his medical exemption. The reception from Djokovic’s colleagues continues to be mixed. João Sousa, a Portuguese veteran and longtime top 100 player, described Djokovic’s attitude as “a little selfish” towards his fellow players, a top 100 field that is now 97% vaccinated, according to the ATP. “I can put myself in his shoes and understand what he’s going through,” Sousa said, according to Bola Amarela. “I understand that it’s what he believes in, but it’s a little selfish towards his colleagues in the profession because many of us – not me – didn’t want to get vaccinated and we had to do it in order to play. It was the rules. It turns out to be a rule that Djokovic managed to get around.”
At a time when politicians have been roundly critical of Djokovic, a sympathetic voice has come in the form of Matt Canavan, a National party senator, who stressed the necessity of de-escalating the situation. “I don’t want to live in a world of strict bureaucracy when if we make a mistake on a form we are hauled off to jail. If there’s been an error or a lie, he needs to be questioned again and see how or why that happened,” he said. Meanwhile, the Women’s Tennis Association has addressed the deportation of Renata Voracova, the Czech doubles specialist who was detained by Australian Border Force and deported after Djokovic’s run-in with the authorities. “Renata Voracova followed these rules and procedures, was cleared for entry upon her arrival, competed in an event and then suddenly had her visa cancelled when she had done nothing wrong,” said the WTA. Unlike Djokovic, Voracova has placed blame on Tennis Australia and in a recent interview with AFP she said she expects compensation from the governing body.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/novak-djokovic-back-on-court-australia-open-investigations-continue;sports
4002;4002;4002;4002;4045;4045;If Boris Johnson is forced out, who might replace him?;2022-01-12;['Heather Stewart'];['Conservative leadership', 'Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'Liz Truss', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Jeremy Hunt', 'Priti Patel', 'UK news', 'Sajid Javid', 'Kwasi Kwarteng', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Coronavirus'];With MPs and the leader of the opposition calling for Boris Johnson to resign, speculation about who may take over is rife. Here are some potential runners and riders should the prime minister resign or be forced out. Liz Truss Despite being a former remainer, the 46-year-old foreign secretary is the darling of the Conservative grassroots, regularly topping the poll of party members carried out by website Conservative Home. Fans love her rhetoric, which is heavy on liberty, free trade and patriotism, and credit her with signing a slew of post-Brexit trade deals. She has a carefully honed public image, helped by lavish use of taxpayer-funded government photographers – including recently having herself pictured Margaret Thatcher-style, atop a tank. Rishi Sunak The chancellor, 41, was for some time regarded as the frontrunner to replace Johnson but his popularity has slipped of late among the Tory members who will make the final decision. Sunak is the son of Indian immigrants from east Africa – a doctor and a pharmacist – who sent him to Winchester, the prestigious private school. He worked in the City before entering politics and takes a markedly different economic approach to Johnson, favouring lower taxes and tougher public spending restraint. Sunak was criticised recently for being in California as businesses were crying out for help when the Omicron coronavirus wave sent restaurant and pub bookings plunging. Jeremy Hunt The foreign secretary, 55, lost out to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest by a clear margin but is still regarded as a potential contender if the job falls vacant again. Returned to the backbenches by Johnson, he has been scrupulously loyal, using his experience as a former health secretary to chair the health select committee. His South West Surrey constituency is among those being targeted by the Liberal Democrats, who believe traditional Tory “blue wall” voters are turned off by Johnson’s rule-breaking. By contrast, Hunt would be regarded as a safe pair of hands, though some colleagues fear he lacks political pizzazz. Priti Patel The home secretary is a controversial figures to many but her right-leaning views and very obviously tough line on immigration make her appealing to many among the Tory membership, as well as to like-minded MPs. An MP since 2010, Patel, 49, has held a series of ministerial posts but faced a two-year exile from the frontbench after being forced to resign as international development secretary for having unofficial meetings with Israeli officials. Brought back as home secretary by Johnson, he expended political capital keeping her in the job even after an official report concluded she had bullied officials. Paradoxically, while she in an immigration hardliner, the fact Patel has overseen a period in which there has been much coverage of unofficial Channel crossings by refugees and migrants could count against her. Sajid Javid The chancellor turned health secretary came a fairly distant fourth in the race to succeed Theresa May but is likely to fancy his chances of doing better this time. The 52-year-old former investment banker and MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 officially backed remain in the Brexit referendum but is not defined by that, and has a suitably robust Tory ideology which would appeal to many elements of the party, as well as a stirring backstory, growing up above the family shop in Bristol. Javid left Johnson’s cabinet in spectacular fashion in early 2020 after No 10 tried to impose a team of advisers on him but returned as health secretary in June 2021. His current role could count against him if there is a sense Javid has been influenced by the public health “blob” over Covid rules that are unpopular among many Tory MPs and party members. Kwasi Kwarteng The business secretary, 46, certainly has the free marketeer credentials to appeal to key elements of the Tory party and was a contributor, like Truss, to the 2012 tome Britannia Unchained, a handbook for post-Thatcherite Conservatives. The first black British Conservative to run his own government department, Kwarteng became an MP in 2010 but did not thrive in the Cameron years, waiting until 2018 for his first junior ministerial post. The east London-born Eton scholar is known as intelligent but with an occasional tendency to speak without properly thinking such as when, late last year, he suggested the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, should step down over the case of Owen Paterson. Nadhim Zahawi While his current job as education secretary is Zahawi’s first department-leading cabinet role, his prominence and popularity shot up during his year-long stint as minister for vaccines, overseeing probably the most successful project of the Johnson era. MP for Stratford-upon-Avon since 2010, Zahawi, 54, has a backstory perhaps more compelling even than Javid’s. Born in Baghdad, he and his Kurdish family fled Saddam Hussein’s rule when he was nine and Zahawi went on to have a private education in London. The co-founder of polling firm YouGov, Zahawi has also worked extensively in the oil industry, and is one of Westminster’s richest MPs, owning a significant portfolio of properties.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/if-boris-johnson-is-forced-out-who-might-replace-him;politics
4013;4013;4013;4013;4056;4056;Boris Johnson is doomed, but Rishi Sunak might not be the saviour the Tories crave | Martin Kettle;2022-01-12;['Martin Kettle'];['Politics', 'UK news', 'Boris Johnson', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'World news'];"Downing Street’s May 2020 bring-your-own-booze party has reignited the despair about Boris Johnson’s leadership that the remaining Conservative optimists hoped might disappear over the winter break. Now, though, the blaze has revived with a vengeance. Johnson’s apology to the Commons does not solve this in any way. The apology merely confirms what was already clear: an astonishingly insensitive breach was committed at the height of the first lockdown. This dereliction did not just feature Johnson as a participant: it was marked by his very character. His apology, with its continued pretence about a work event within the regulations, lacks either moral worth or political credibility. Conservative MPs are well aware their leader is a dodgy chancer. Some of them actively admire this. Others are happy to profit from it. Many loathe it while quietly despising themselves for permitting it. But the style works only while it succeeds. Most Tories had put Johnson on probation after his spectacularly disastrous December. The fresh explosion this week means they are now looking more urgently than before at the alternatives. Tory MPs find themselves on the threshold of a leadership change. Sue Gray’s report will be important in shaping the timing of the outcome, but her findings could be a lose-lose for Johnson either way. If Gray blames the prime minister, he will struggle not to be brought down directly. If she lets him off in some way, his authority will not suddenly be restored. Tory MPs hold all the cards. All of which explains why the party is moving towards its third leadership election in six years. The Johnson experiment seems to have almost run its course. It is a remarkable turn of events that Tory party members – demographically so deeply unrepresentative of modern Britain – should again be asked to choose the prime minister. Johnson was the first PM ever chosen in this way, and it has been a terrible precedent. Much should now be written about the candidates already quietly vying for the leadership. There they were, in a row beside Johnson along the frontbench as he tried to eat humble pie at prime minister’s questions: Liz Truss, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Sajid Javid and Michael Gove. All of them harbour hopes of climbing to the top of the greasy pole when Johnson falls, as fall he surely must now. Yet the key figure is the man who, rather conspicuously, wasn’t there at all: Rishi Sunak is the one to beat in this contest. Although he came just behind Truss in a recent ConservativeHome poll of party members, he was ahead of her in this week’s Sky/YouGov survey of members. Crucially, according to the Observer/Opinium poll over Christmas, he would do far better for the Tories in a general election than either Johnson or Truss. That finding will play massively in his favour among MPs. It needs saying that the ascent of Sunak would be remarkable. He would be the first person of Asian heritage, and the first person of colour, to become prime minister and to lead a major British political party. That would be another sign, if one were needed, of the immense capacity of the Tory party to adapt to social and cultural change. Other parties can only watch in frustrated envy. But there is much more to Sunak’s success, if it happens, than this. On my bookshelves stands a copy of the historian Robert Blake’s biography of the former Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law. With neat historical symmetry, Bonar Law emerged to become Tory leader 100 years ago – the Tory backbench 1922 Committee owes its name to the machinations that overthrew David Lloyd George and took Bonar Law to Downing Street. But it is the title of Blake’s book that matters. It is called The Unknown Prime Minister. It is a title that will soon have to be used again. Sunak may not have risen without trace, but his ascent has been unusually rapid. He only entered the Commons in 2015, succeeding William Hague as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire. He has only been a minister since 2018. He then raced up the ministerial ladder after being handpicked by Johnson (with some encouragement from Dominic Cummings) to succeed Javid as chancellor less than two years ago. Although Sunak has been chancellor during the greatest peacetime crisis of the modern era, he is extremely inexperienced. This is something that every Tory MP whom I contacted for this article remarked on. “The honest answer is that we really don’t know if he cuts it,” said one former cabinet minister. Others fear that Sunak, who is exceptionally wealthy, operates within his own bubble and is too close to Dominic Cummings, who is keen to destabilise Johnson. This is particularly important because Sunak’s popularity, which was very high when he was doling out public money to support the economy during the first phases of Covid, seems to be ebbing. The return of inflation, the imminence of the tax rises that he announced in the autumn budget and the expected big hike in energy charges from April are combining to make Sunak a less voter-friendly minister these days. For the most part, Sunak has gone along with Johnson’s willingness to spend. But the borrowing and taxation that have marked his chancellorship are not popular across the party. A significant minority of Tory MPs remain avid disciples of the small state, low taxation and privatisation of Margaret Thatcher’s era. Most of what Sunak has said since entering politics – to say nothing of his own wealth – suggests that he is broadly sympathetic to this approach too. We have probably all been in a position a bit like the one in which the Tory party finds itself. Something goes bang with your car. You get an estimate done at the garage, and the cost of the repairs seems eye-watering. Do you go ahead, throwing good money after bad? Or do you start thinking it would be better to get a more reliable new vehicle?
The answer is not to be dazzled by the brochures, and to think before you buy. Johnson’s looming failure may be very much his own doing, but its consequences will be felt right across the Tory party and beyond. The electoral coalition that Johnson created in 2019 may not outlive his fall. Sunak and Truss, the apparent frontrunners to succeed, would struggle to maintain the kind of appeal that Johnson achieved. The Tory party should not deceive itself about Sunak. Electing him would be an act based on hope rather than experience. Given that this is what the party also did in choosing Johnson, it is something of which they should be particularly wary.

4016;4016;4016;4016;4059;4059;Russia is orchestrating Europe’s gas crisis, says energy agency boss;2022-01-12;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Energy industry', 'Gazprom', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Business', 'Ukraine', 'Gas', 'Fossil fuels', 'Commodities', 'Energy', 'Environment'];"The head of the International Energy Agency has accused Russia of orchestrating Europe’s deepening energy crisis at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions by withholding up to a third of its gas exports. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, directly blamed Russia’s behaviour for the record-high energy market prices in Europe this winter that threaten to upend large parts of the European economy and plunge millions into a cost of living crisis. He said the historic low gas storage levels across Europe were largely due to Russia’s state-owned gas company, Gazprom, which has sent about 25% less gas than usual to Europe over recent months despite a surge in demand after 2020’s economic slump. “We believe there are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behaviour,” Birol said reporters on Wednesday. “I would note that today’s low Russian gas flows to Europe coincide with heightened geopolitical tensions over Ukraine.” The IEA’s most damning criticism of Russia’s energy policy to date has emerged after the Kremlin downplayed hopes of diplomatic solutions for the ongoing Ukraine crisis on Tuesday, before a meeting in Brussels between Russia and Nato’s 30 member states. This week Russian forces deployed along the Ukraine border conducted a live-fire military exercise involving 3,000 troops and tanks, in a clear rejection of US demands for a de-escalation in the region. At the same time, the world’s biggest supplier of gas has opted to keep a lid on gas exports to Europe where market prices have surpassed the all-time highs set in September to reach a new record last month. Analysts estimate that Europe’s gas prices could fall by half if Russia agreed to increase its exports by 20%. Gazprom has claimed it is meeting all its contracted exports to European companies. “The current storage deficit in the European Union is largely due to Gazprom,” Birol said. “The low levels of storage in company’s EU-based facilities account for half of the EU storage deficit although Gazprom facilities only constitute 10% of the EU’s total storage capacity.” Chris O’Shea, the head of the UK’s largest home energy supplier, British Gas, warned that prices were likely to remain high for at least another two years, based on the current outlook for global energy markets and the UK’s ongoing reliance on fossil fuels. “There’s no reason to think that energy prices will come down any soon — the market suggests that high prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years,” he told the BBC on Wednesday morning. “As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel, so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, there’s more demand for gas, but there isn’t an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly.”
The prediction could prove devastating for UK households, which face a cost of living crisis after a record increase in energy bills this winter due to the global gas crisis. The rising cost of fossil fuels has also led to record pump prices and may stoke rising inflation across the economy in the months ahead. O’Shea said it was “inconceivable” for the government and energy suppliers to fail to take action to protect households from rising energy bills, which could reach an average of £2,000 by April. He repeated the industry’s calls for the government to remove the 5% VAT rate from energy bills, shift green levies into general taxation and defer charges taken via energy bills to cover the cost of a string of recent supplier collapses.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss;business and economy
4017;4017;4017;4017;4060;4060;Lockdown taught me that time is precious – so why am I running out of it again? | Adrian Chiles;2022-01-12;['Adrian Chiles'];['Life and style', 'Work & careers', 'Family'];"There was a time not long ago when we had plenty of time; now there’s too much to do. Lockdowns dragged on for ever when we were in them but feel shorter as they edge further into the past. I have heard lockdowns described – often by the kind of people who protested they were unnecessary – as a middle-class luxury. This made me feel even worse about how much I was enjoying the whole experience while so many people’s circumstances made it unbearable for them. What I was luxuriating in was time. I had time to sit, time to read, time to cook, iron, doze, exercise, garden and all the other things I can never normally fit in. Once I had done all those things, and added in some new hobbies – darts, language learning, etc – I was at risk of running out of time all over again, ironically. But I wrested back control; I knew I had to because the preciousness of time had become clear to me. Now, though, despite my best efforts at buttressing, the dam has burst; the demands on my time have come flooding through. The watery metaphor is apt, surely, because inundated is the word we often use to describe our workload when it’s overwhelming us. There are so many people to see, jobs to do, places to visit; so much work to prepare for, stuff to write, food to cook. Please don’t think for a minute that I’m doing any of these things well. I’m not. I’m just doing more things worse. Each evening I retire to bed convincing myself, based on no evidence whatsoever, that tomorrow will be the day I finally get everything I need to do done – and done well. I set my alarm to go off ever earlier to give myself a little more, yes, time. Each morning starts promisingly enough with the compiling of a list of jobs. The task at the top of the list is attacked with some gusto and may even be completed. The next few tasks will be started but not finished, as time to get on with subsequent tasks seems to be running out. By midday, entirely new tasks appear on the list; by mid-afternoon several plates are spinning and smashing and being replaced; by late afternoon, the dozens of jobs under way are all unfinished and others haven’t been started at all; by early evening, defeat has to be acknowledged and the white flag is run up the flagpole. Exhausted, I spend a couple of hours expending what little energy I have left on self-flagellation. Then to bed, in preparation for the following day’s brave new dawn. I am told that one solution is to dispense with the mundane stuff and really prioritise. But the mundane stuff is my only refuge. The last couple of days have been typical. I am helping my brother with some building work. He would say “helping” rather than helping. At the same time I have had several pieces to write; hungry mouths to feed; shows to prepare for; and other unforeseen stuff seeping in by text and email. I was tasked to demolish a low wall but, after a couple of hits, got distracted by something, put the lump hammer down, and couldn’t find it again. I was switched to clearing-up duties but lost first one set of gloves then another. Going back into the house to look for some more, in my efforts to remove a wellington boot, I pulled a hamstring. I limped past the ironing board and saw that some needed doing. For the only time all day, dealing with one T-shirt, four handkerchiefs and several tea towels, the prospect of real happiness loomed. But my reverie was interrupted by my brother hammering on the window, enquiring, in industrial language, what on earth I was playing at, which was a fair question. And so, the ironing too remained unfinished. It’s time something changed.

4018;4018;4018;4018;4061;4061;Colbert on Omicron: ‘Kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas’;2022-01-12;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];"Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert observed another grim milestone in the two-year saga of grim Covid milestones for the US: on Monday, the US notched a record 1.5m new Covid infections due to the surge of the Omicron variant. “That is terrible,” the Late Show host said, “but kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas”.
The US also saw a record-breaking 145,000 Covid hospitalizations, with experts predicting a peak in the 300,000 range, though the CDC has offered a clarification on that statistic. Its director, Rochelle Walensky, estimated that 40% of the patients hospitalized with Covid are not presenting because of Covid symptoms, but coming in for something else and then having the virus detected. “OK sure, but even if people aren’t coming in for Covid initially, the hospitals are still overflowing,” Colbert noted. “That’s like saying ‘uh, technically, up to 40% of the people who drowned on the Titanic were already wet because they were in the bathtub when the ship went down, so not so bad.’”
Meanwhile, America’s resident Covid expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, finally reached the end of his rope with antagonistic Republican lawmakers on Tuesday. During a congressional hearing, the White House’s top immunologist called out the Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky for misleading and baseless accusations. “What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue, is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there, and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family with obscene phone calls, because people are lying about me,” Fauci said. “That’s just terrible. Dr Fauci should not be getting obscene phone calls from violent crazies,” said Colbert. “He should be getting them from lonely singles who saw his InStyle magazine cover.” Pointing to Paul’s campaign website, in which a donation tab is accompanied by a “Fire Dr Fauci banner,” Fauci also blasted Paul for “making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain”. “A pretty damning accusation,” Colbert said. “In response, Rand Paul sent out an email: ‘Dr Fauci tried to smear me by saying I’m profiting from the pandemic. Prove him wrong by donating $10, $20, or $100 today!’” Jimmy Kimmel
And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lamented pandemic fatigue, which has forced health officials to urge Americans not to catch Covid on purpose. “They have to tell us that? ‘Please don’t intentionally give yourself a deadly disease,’” Kimmel joked. “Here’s the thing: there are only so many doctors, and there are only so many nurses, and there are only so many hospital beds,” he added. “When everyone tries to get something all at the same time, it’s a disaster. Didn’t we learn nothing from the great toilet paper crisis of 2020?” In non-Covid news, the treasury department has predicted a “frustrating” tax season for the overwhelmed IRS, “which is a shame, because it’s normally so homey and warm”, Kimmel deadpanned. “It’s funny, you know, when the IRS is behind on getting their refunds to us, they take all the time they need,” he continued. “When we’re a day late paying them, they’re like ‘and which prison would you like to go to?’” According to the New York Times, the beleaguered department had fewer than 15,000 employees to handle more than 240m calls – that’s 16,000 calls per person – during the 2021 filing season that left over 35m unprocessed returns. “That’s why Trump never pays taxes,” Kimmel joked. “He knows how overworked these people are. It’s called being considerate.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/12/stephen-colbert-late-night-omicron;entertainment and culture
4021;4021;4021;4021;4064;4064;Royal Navy will fail without reform, says outgoing deputy chief;2022-01-12;['Ben Quinn'];['Royal Navy', 'Military', 'UK news'];The Royal Navy will fail without reform, the outgoing deputy of the service has said in a farewell message to personnel and civil servants in which he bemoaned what he said was as an inadequate status quo. V-Adm Nick Hine posted a candidly worded letter on Twitter in which he said change had to happen, and that he had sometimes despaired at the type of thinking around him. His time in the role corresponded with a period in which – as the Commons defence committee said in a report last month – spending on the navy and the wider military had been capped despite it facing changing threats and taking on additional responsibilities. “Please understand that the need for and, the value of change, is not a fantasy – if we don’t transform we will fail and we will lose. It is that simple,” he wrote, adding that he was also addressing “pedants and naysayers”. Those who had known him for a long time would know that his “big bugbear” was that “our great navy has lost its ambition”, he wrote. “I have despaired at times that collectively we had become self-censoring, risk-averse and lacking in curiosity, confidence and critical thinking skills. “We have these qualities but have allowed a rose-tinted view of tradition and a spurious belief that you can avoid risk by sticking to a failing status quo to avoid driving transformation.” The defence committee report identified a series a challenges the navy faces, including delays to crucial procurement programmes as a result of budget cuts, an increasing reliance on allies and successive governments prioritising of ships’ defensive rather than offensive capabilities. “When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines – well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities. This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities,” it said. “These significant challenges have not prevented the Navy delivering significant successes, most notably the commissioning of the two aircraft carriers and the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. However, they do raise concerns about the Navy’s ability to deliver the crucial transformations it has planned.” Boris Johnson selected the head of the navy as the next chief of Britain’s armed forces for the first time in 20 years in October, a choice intended to reinforce the UK’s post-Brexit switch in focus to the Indo-Pacific region. Downing Street also published an integrated review of defence and foreign policy earlier last year, a key feature of which was to call for a significant British re-engagement in the Indo-Pacific, which had been abandoned in the late 1960s. Sea power is seen to be at the heart of competing with China, which has the world’s largest navy. The UK signed a three-country pact with the US last month to supply long-range nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. A navy spokesperson, said: “Threats to the UK and our allies multiply every day and so it is critical the Royal Navy continues to transform to ensure that personnel and valuable resources are placed where they are needed most. “The government has made the biggest investment in the armed forces since the cold war. We will continue to modernise, ensuring we are ready to meet the future challenges.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/royal-navy-will-fail-without-reform-says-outgoing-deputy-chief;business and economy

I started playing with clay again, something I hadn’t done much since leaving art school decades before. I was in the studio when Grayson started his Art Club with Channel 4 and thought I’d make things and chip in. Many people contacted the show to share their artwork. Often, like me, they’d not picked up a brush for a long time, or this was the first time they’d attempted art. We heard so many stories about how people benefited from making things and the confidence they gained by getting better at it, I couldn’t help but be inspired to keep pushing myself as well. I’m pleased to report that I haven’t stopped making art since the cameras turned off and, even after lockdown eased, I’ve carried on. This summer a friend needed some abstract modern art to make her therapy centre seem a bit less clinical. How hard can it be, I thought, to get a canvas and chuck a load of paint at it? Turns out it is very hard indeed. Arranging shapes and colours so they somehow look right took me several months before I had six canvasses I thought might not be too terrible. Now the therapy centre has its canvasses, but I can’t stop. How to arrange paint and form so it looks right has become something of an obsession. You could call it a hobby if you like, but that word isn’t quite serious enough for me.
“Between work and sleep comes the time we call our own. What do we do with it?” asks Laurie Lee at the beginning of Humphrey Jennings’s 1939 film, Spare Time. This 15-minute film shows a montage of, among other activities, amateur dramatics, walking whippets, keeping pigeons, working on the allotment, playing in brass bands, singing in choirs, playing a fair bit of piano, putting on pageants, and going dancing. I wanted to know how people now spend that time between work and sleep and what they get from it, so I put a question out on Twitter to find out. Here is a random selection of replies: @wuthering_alice: “My knitting is very important to me – it kept me steady during a recent anxiety episode ... I also have a bit of a thing for growing pumpkins. I marvel that something so big comes from a tiny seed.” @saraheley: “Learned Polish ... it woke up my brain from rather a long fog. It improved my memory. It made me realise how much humans love to connect ...” @TobyMalcolm: “I spend most of my evenings in the world of virtual aviation flying all over the world in my flight simulator ... My cats love it too.” @agnesvirtually: “Playing the violin’s my cerebral and spiritual practice. I feel sight reading does me better than crosswords ...” @Andromeda: “I started learning piano five years ago as a distraction from a scheduled heart op. Since then I’ve played every day. It’s a calm place in my head.” @Helenus_: “Got a lifelong passion for archaeology and now I’m older I’m getting even more obsessed. Enriches your life wherever you go ...” @katywayne: “Horse riding: the best therapy... The only time I think about nothing else in my life except the horse and my surroundings.” @tuppenybunch: “My passion is running a local litter-picking group. I love meeting new people and cleaning up the community.” The variety of different activities we do is huge. We collect everything from Viennese glass to found shopping lists, we educate ourselves about things as diverse as front crawl or Chinese calligraphy. We knit, we fish, we fellwalk, we still do amateur dramatics and we practise and get better at it. It’s good for us to get better at something and learn new things. It makes us feel more in tune with our bodies, more engaged with our minds and more connected with our world. And I was warmed and moved by what everyone who replied to me got from their passions, obsessions, pastimes and, yes, hobbies. And I think probably the most important thing we get from these things we love doing but, do not have to do, is purpose and meaning. It’s harder to get depressed when you feel you have those two things in your life. Sometimes we make the mistake of believing we must be good at something to do it, luckily that was not the attitude of the community choir I joined. I didn’t make great improvements in my singing, but I loved being part of a joint effort and I made some good friends.
I expect Observer readers are familiar with the concept of “The Comfort Zone”. There are some things we feel confident about, some we are hesitant about trying. Far outside our comfort zones are goals we might find attractive but don’t dare to approach. Maybe 2022 is when we dare? Not all in one leap, but in increments by doing the thing we are merely hesitant about as a stepping stone. When you do something in one area, say, learning to ride a bicycle competently, the surprising thing is that it invariably improves overall confidence in other areas, too. Perhaps after learning to ride a bike we might try a unicycle, then hang-gliding? Or learning Arabic, or whatever it is that appeals. We tend to think stress is bad, but there is such a thing as good stress. This creates positive stimulation, pushing us to learn new things and to be creative, but not so overwhelming that it tips us into panic. Learning things causes us to form new neural connections and the more of these we have is probably for the better. If a part of your brain were to, God forbid, die off, the more neural connections you have, the sooner other parts of the brain could link up to go around the damaged part. So let’s get learning, make neural connections and gain new satisfaction from pastimes, skills, interests and erudition. Do something new, or build on something you’ve already got. As Lee narrated at the end of the Jennings film: “Spare time is a time when we have a chance to do what we like, a chance to be most ourselves.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/31/go-on-i-dare-you-philippa-perrys-advice-for-a-fulfilling-new-year;entertainment and culture
4064;4064;4064;4064;4107;4107;Grace Mirabella obituary;2022-01-12;['Veronica Horwell'];['Vogue', 'Fashion', 'US news', 'Magazines', 'Media', 'Diana Vreeland', 'Condé Nast'];"Grace Mirabella’s 17 years as editor of American Vogue, the core publication of Condé Nast’s magazine empire at its most expansive, are usually evaluated as a successful business intervention. She took the magazine from a circulation falling towards 400,000 in 1971 to rising above a million and half in 1988. Fleeing advertisers returned with such big budgets that her hefty September issues required the US Post Office to make special delivery arrangements. But Mirabella’s lasting value to fashion was her belief that the US had its own style of glamour, and that its major creators deserved international acclaim for what a Mirabella favourite, Bill Blass, called “a certain nonchalance”. She had seen as a wartime teen how good women looked when dressed for hard work, and wrote that she arrived on Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, in the early 1950s at the same time as sportswear; by the end of her Vogue tenure, US ready-to-wear, much of it based on that sportswear tradition, was part of the global uniform, and American brands had opened stores in Paris, London, Milan and Tokyo. In the royal court-like atmosphere of the leading glossy, the ascent of Mirabella, who has died aged 92, had been unlikely. She was not journalistically ambitious, having been forwarded from an entry-level position at Saks Fifth Avenue to Vogue to check the “must list” of merchandise sent by advertisers to be included in editorial shots. She briefly escaped to fashion PR in Rome, but Vogue drew her back, though to limited advancement; she wrote the shopping column threaded through the opening pages, edited sportswear, and was looking for a job elsewhere when Diana Vreeland, who arrived as editor in 1963, clomped down the corridor and invited Mirabella to be her personal assistant. Mirabella had a schoolgirl crush on Vreeland and was for eight years the practical operative behind her boss’s fantastical features by, for and about the rarefied world of the Beautiful People; she did all the menial tasks, down to trying on accessories for Vreeland to inspect. Despite her devotion, Mirabella did not share Vreeland’s view of fashion as performance art for the very few, preferring easygoing clothes for the many. Her other mentor, Alexander Liberman, editorial director of Condé Nast, commended her to the company’s chairman Si Newhouse, who needed Vogue for its secure revenue (from ads and newsstand sales more than subscriptions) and a solid identity so that he could extend into new publications. Vreeland’s pzazz supplied neither, and in 1971 Newhouse deposed her abruptly. Mirabella was on a fashion shoot a continent away when the phone call appointing her to editor-in-chief came. Most Vogue staffers were amenable to Mirabella’s democratisation project, but there was hostility outside the company, accusations that Newhouse was taking the magazine middle-class, that Mirabella was an unconnected nobody from Newark, New Jersey, who had soon redecorated Vreeland’s red lacquer shrine of an office in neutrals. She had never hidden that she was the daughter of a Cuban-rum salesman and gambler, Anthony Mirabella, and a migrant from Italy, Florence (nee Belfatto); she first began working while at high school to help pay her father’s debts, and was proud of her degree in economics from Skidmore College. However, Mirabella’s magazine agenda of wearable American clothes, shown on healthy models, including, at last, black women on the cover, and her introduction of sections on health, fitness and cosmetics, and skincare from laboratories rather than magical cauldrons, happened to be fashionable. The campaign against smoking that she began after her marriage in 1974 to the surgeon William Cahan, who specialised in lung cancer, was confined by the ad department to occasional issues that did not have ads from tobacco clients. But modes always move on. The publisher Hachette launched a US version of Elle magazine in 1985, with young fashion mixed with other features for the MTV generation, and Newhouse envied its big initial success. In actual fashion, there was a revival in extravagant haute couture, with celebrities to flaunt it. Newhouse wanted that, too. “My favourite subject is women and theirs is glitz,” Mirabella shrugged. When she complained to Liberman that she was still shut out of the business side of publishing where the real decisions were taken, he told her: “Women are cheap labour and always will be.” He had a new protégé, Anna Wintour, brought in as creative director. On 28 June 1988 Mirabella heard third-hand about an announcement on a television programme that reported Wintour was replacing her. That was the way in Condé Nast, and in retrospect she merely said: “Name the editors who weren’t fired like that.” Within two days, Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation had offered her a magazine to command, under her own name. Mirabella, aimed at over-30s, launched well but its fashion-plus-features formula had already been pre-empted by the more youthful Elle. Readers, then ads, waned; corporate suits pushed the disheartened Mirabella out of decision-making and she left in 1996. In her payback memoir, In and Out of Vogue (1995), she wrote of Newhouse and Liberman: “They are in the communications business but they don’t know how to communicate,” but she confessed herself that she had never spoken again with the revered Vreeland after her fall from power. Cahan died in 2001. Mirabella’s two stepsons, Anthony and Christopher, survive her. • Grace Mirabella, magazine editor, born 10 June 1929; died 23 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/12/grace-mirabella-obituary;entertainment and culture
4065;4065;4065;4065;4108;4108;Rory Kinnear: On the day of No 10’s lockdown party, I buried my sister;2022-01-12;['Rory Kinnear'];['Coronavirus', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Without wishing to sound like an episode of Poirot, I remember well what I was doing on the evening of 20 May 2020, when more than 100 people were invited to a BYOB party in the prime minister’s garden, “to make the most of the lovely weather”. While they recovered from an “exceptionally busy period” with, it might be presumed, laughter, companionship and their own bottles of wine, I was at my house. Like them, I, too, had a glass of wine, although I had drunk it by myself. I had then gone for a walk around my block where I had bumped into a friend out on his “daily permitted exercise”. We spoke a little, at a distance of more than two metres. He offered his condolences. I thanked him and returned home, alone. 20 May 2020 was the day I buried my sister. Like those assembled with their bottles in Downing Street, I, too, had broken the government’s existing guidelines, implemented to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, in a familiar garden. After my sister Karina’s funeral, I had gone to my mother’s house. It was a baking hot day and, while the circumstances didn’t really allow me to “make the most of the lovely weather”, the sunshine did permit me and my other sister, Kirsty, to sit in our mum’s garden, at the state-appointed distance from each other, and recall the many joys, as well as strains, that Karina’s life had brought. There were three of us in the garden, from three separate households, one more than was permitted. It might not have been exactly to the letter of the law, but we reckoned it was the least our grief would permit. Luckily we could remain physically, if not emotionally, distanced from each other. Karina had died of Covid and we felt we should take the best precautions possible to prevent the disease’s spread. We sat at three different points in the garden, on familiar garden furniture in the most unfamiliar of circumstances. We didn’t hug, didn’t allow ourselves any of the consolation of physical touch: we thought it would be safer that way. Physical contact was, after all, what they had instructed us to avoid. For 48 years my mother had fought to keep her disabled daughter happy and alive. For 48 years, whenever Karina had been ill, my mother had slept in hospital chairs for weeks on end, gone days without sleep, sacrificed her own health for Karina’s wellbeing, driven by a love that only a parent can know. And now Karina was dead. And we couldn’t hug each other. It was bleak, yes, but then it was a time of incomparable global uncertainty. An unparalleled, unifying swathe of sadness had devoured us all. Pain like ours was tearing through families the world over. So, in some ways, it felt like we were all in it together.
A couple of hours earlier, we had driven in separate cars to the cemetery in which my father is buried. Two gravediggers stood by a fence as we watched six strangers, wearing masks and latex gloves, lower Karina’s coffin into a freshly dug plot adjacent to his. A priest, somewhat concealed behind another gravestone, invited me to speak. I attempted to hold back tears as I gave thanks for the extraordinary role Karina had played in our family. A tinny speaker played Abba’s Thank You for the Music, the lyrics a little drowned out by the rustle of the willow tree above. We threw some earth on her coffin, got back in our separate cars and went back to my mum’s for a slice of chocolate cake on disposable plates. I had brought my own. Our story was just one of thousands similar happening up and down the country. We were, we consoled ourselves again, all in it together. That evening, as I walked alone, the streets were piercingly quiet. How sad it all is, I thought, how devastatingly sad. And yet, what consolation there is in seeing and hearing these manifest absences; silences that speak of self-denial and mutual respect. The sepulchral pallor that my corner of London had been bathed in was the result of a shared commitment to rules, designed by them, to keep us, our loved ones and our wider society safe. I walked past my neighbours’ houses; friends numbed by screentime and family dynamics, unsure how long this would all last, no access to society beyond their phones, windows open to mitigate against that lovely, lovely weather. I couldn’t help but feel grateful that my community was taking the deaths of people such as my sister as seriously and profoundly as I was. Their confinement spoke of a silent but wholehearted sympathy for families such as mine. They knew, they felt too, that we were all in it together. Well, not all of us, it turns out. Not them. Just under two miles separates my corner of London from the garden of Downing Street. I am, today, haunted by the tinkling of those glasses there on that sun-drenched night, the echoing of their thin laughter, the stifled chuckles as they practised their imagined denials and, most perniciously, the leadership that encouraged it to happen. Their actions feel like direct assaults in the face of my family’s, and all of our shared national, tragedy. To me, and I’m sure many others, the revelations of the manifest and repeated failures of those in power to understand, empathise or show solidarity with what the people of this country experienced during that time have released from the body politic a stench so toxic that I can’t see how they will be able to put it back in the bottle, no matter how desperately they try. They can’t point the finger anywhere else this time, can they? After all, they brought the bottle themselves.

4081;4081;4081;4081;4124;4124;TechScape: Inside the rise and fall of Politics For All;2022-01-12;['Jim Waterson'];['Media', 'X', 'Internet', 'Technology', 'Social media'];"If you want to understand how a group of teenagers with no journalistic experience created one of the most influential political social media accounts in the UK, then ask Travis Wright. The 18-year-old spent most of last year helping to build Politics For All which, before it was banned by Twitter last week, gained 100,000s of followers including cabinet ministers, celebrities, and sports stars.
By day he was studying multimedia journalism at a sixth form college in rural Suffolk but when lessons finished he was writing breaking news tweets that were being shared by cabinet ministers and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker. The trick Politics For All used to go viral was simple, he said: “You’d follow a tonne of journalists. And you’d see a tweet here or there and you’d say: ‘That’s good, I’ll take that’.” If you aren’t an obsessive follower of UK political news or – like most of the world – don’t spend much time on Twitter, then you might be wondering why we’re writing about the closure of a single news aggregation account. But there’s two essential issues in the parable of Politics For All: How real political influence can be rapidly gained on Twitter – and how this influence can be very rapidly lost, all at the whim of the social network and with little transparency. Climbing the social ladder Essentially, if Twitter is the place where the UK political news agenda is shaped, then Politics For All was the loud foghorn in the corner of the room. It was reaching tens of millions of people a month with its emoji-laden tweets where everything was treated as breaking news. It could shift narratives with a keen eye for highlighting details that other people had missed. And it also understood the fastest route to success on Twitter: aggressively stealing the work of mainstream journalists and rapidly repackaging it in a provocative format that takes advantage of every flaw in the site’s algorithm to maximise engagement with audiences. Or as another of the account’s former administrators put it: “We just looked at Twitter a lot. People think it was a massive organisation but it was basically ripping off people. The idea was to be first to nick it.” Politics For All was registered in 2019 by Nick Moar, a teenager from Bath, who clocked that the tactics used to cover football transfer news on Twitter – providing a one-stop rapid aggregation service of mainstream outlets with limited context – could be applied effectively to politics news. (Just to underline how its later success was mildly preposterous, the account’s username was actually @PoliticsForAli – with the “i” written in upper case – because someone else had already bagged @PoliticsForAll. This inevitably lead to a lot of speculation about who was Ali and why he wanted all this politics news.) Following a few early viral tweets, the account began to pick up momentum in early 2021. By the end of the year it had 450,000 followers and far more interactions than many mainstream news accounts. Its tweets were getting more than 80m views a month. The model was simple. When Moar or one his team saw a news story they felt would go viral, it would be rapidly shared with three 🚨🚨🚨 emojis, often rephrasing the original story to be more shareable. After waiting a few minutes to maximise engagement on the tweet, a link to the original source would be added – often to the annoyance of the full-time journalist who might have spent weeks doing the reporting but was getting less credit. Chris Lochery, one of the authors of the delectable media gossip newsletter Popbitch, memorably called Politics For All a “hungry little content piggy” after it tweeted out three of his stories in the space of an hour. It was essentially a modern twist on the traditional tabloid news model. Wright said Moar instinctively understood how news websites are full of information that might interest younger audiences – but this info is often hidden in dull news stories that are excessively long: “Some of the Times articles were really long-winded but he would find that nugget in the 12th paragraph that would make it go viral.” Potential admins – almost entirely teenagers and university students wanting to break into the media industry – would message the account and ask to be involved. A few test tweets later and they’d find themselves added to a WhatsApp group with fellow (essentially unpaid) staff and often given control of the main account, with the ability to tweet to hundreds of thousands of people. It was chaotic, unstructured, and somehow worked. Click, click… boom! Politics For All was often accused of leeching off the work of others and spreading disinformation with its framing of news stories. But talk to the individuals involved and they say the account was essentially a creation of Twitter’s own incentive structure. The challenge for the young men who ran the account – and it was almost an entirely male team – was to crack Twitter’s algorithm and maximise engagement, which would lead to more power and followers, which then led to further engagement. Many journalists get a thrill from pressing publish on a story they know will be big news. Wright found a similar level of enjoyment from aggregating other journalist’s stories on Politics For All: “It was just that buzz from clicking the button and typing a few words and just seeing the likes go up, seeing the retweets go up, seeing the follows go up.” This rapidly growing influence brought some issues, with the government increasingly concerned about what the teenagers were posting. One message posted in the admin WhatsApp group showed Moar had received complaints from a Downing Street adviser who was upset that the government had not given a right of reply to one of the Politics For All tweets. The admins were told it was “Carrie related”, a reference to the prime minister’s wife. The site also struggled to monetise, with admins given token payments of £50 when small sums of advertising cash arrived. Moar took a part-time job writing tweets for the right-leaning Spectator magazine and there was growing speculation about the service’s stated political impartiality. Ironically, multiple admins said Moar had actually been a Labour party member. (He declined to comment for this newsletter.) Wright was eventually asked to leave the service in the autumn. Shortly afterwards the account made some messy attempts at original reporting, including tweeting insider documents from the Salisbury rail crash without appropriate context. “They had a lot of power and they didn’t understand how to wield that power, it’s like a child like having all the candy,” said one former admin. “It provided a service but the service obviously altered and it felt slightly toxic. Everything was done for clicks.” Kept in the dark Earlier this month Twitter permanently banned Politics For All and its associated accounts without warning, citing its rules on platform manipulation – leading to suggestions that it may have engaged in excessively aggressive tactics to drive up engagement. But the admins remain in the dark, the social network has so far refused to elaborate on the reasons for the ban and there is no right to appeal. Westminster has noticed. Government officials have talked to the Guardian about whether the deletion of Politics For All is an issue that ministers should consider while framing journalistic protections in forthcoming online harms legislation. In some ways the flaw with Politics For All might have been that its approach was too refined, too obvious, and perhaps sailed too close to the wind. Two kids in a trenchcoat – or at least a group of teens with a WhatsApp group chat – worked out how to game Twitter, which is embarrassing for the social network. But these days many click-chasing mainstream news sites are also just rapid aggregators, ripping off anything resembling an exclusive from their rivals as fast as possible. Enormously popular news sites such as MailOnline operate on the same basis as Politics For All: humans like to consume provocative news stories and are rarely bothered about the original journalistic source. But perhaps most crucially, Politics For All reveals the motivation behind a lot of journalism in 2022: Posting online is addictive. As Wright puts it, aggregation of other people’s stories is just really fun: “I was trying to do reporting in London and asking people questions, but I was awful at it. But doing aggregation, I enjoyed a lot more.” If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/techscape-politics-for-all-twitter;science and technology
4083;4083;4083;4083;4126;4126;Lloyd Webber calls for more music tuition funding in schools;2022-01-12;['Dalya Alberge'];['Music', 'Andrew Lloyd Webber', 'Schools', 'Education', 'Culture', 'UK news'];"Andrew Lloyd Webber is calling for the government to recognise the transformative effect that classical music tuition can have on the lives of children in disadvantaged communities. The award-winning composer of hits including Evita, Cats and Jesus Christ Superstar spoke of his despair over the lack of adequate public funding for music, despite its life-changing benefits. He said: “We do know music empowers children. The evidence is that it absolutely improves academic standards [and] all aspects of behaviour because they’re having to take part in something … with other people and think of other people … It doesn’t have to be classical music … As Duke Ellington said, there’s two kinds of music, good and bad. “Drugs are greatly reduced in the schools where a music programme exists. Consider what the saving to the community is, having children much more engaged. It’s not about necessarily turning them into musicians, but the fact that music is something that liberates kids.” Lord Lloyd Webber said ministers did not seem willing to consider “the actual statistics”.
“It is proven, but I’ve found, in dealing with this government, one’s been banging one’s head against a brick wall on so many issues – and this one is a no-brainer,” he added. He pointed to the work of the Music in Secondary Schools Trust (Misst), which partners with schools in disadvantaged areas to provide regular classical music tuition. Its latest report, which will be published on Thursday, presents compelling statistics on the impact of such programmes on 11- to 18-year-olds, such as improving self-confidence and resilience. Its research shows Misst students are “bucking the national trend”, with self-confidence, for example, increasing by more than 10% in schools that have the programme compared with those that do not. Lloyd Webber said: “At a time when schools are so under pressure that music teaching is at serious risk, programmes like Misst are needed more than ever before.”
Misst was founded in 2013, after years of development at Highbury Grove school in Islington, north London, with the belief that young people’s lives could be transformed through high-quality music education. It provides 8,030 students with regular tuition and instruments through programmes that would otherwise not be available to them. However, the trust is crying out for funds, with a waiting list of more than 30,000 children. The trust wants to develop the programmes beyond London, having so far reached Warwickshire, Oldham and Middlesbrough. Its education programme costs about £200 a year for each child. The Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation has donated £3.4m to the main Misst programme and a further £100,000 to other activities. Lloyd Webber said: “We calculated that … it would only cost £300m to implement this scheme across all schools. This one is actually oven-ready. It’s ready to go, but we can’t do it all. It’s got to the point where many thousands of children in schools want to join this. But we haven’t got the resource to do it.”
Rachel Landon, the chief executive of Misst, said: “We’ve done this completely through philanthropy.” Having been turned down recently for government funds, the trust has submitted another proposal. At the moment, music training varies from one school to another, Landon said, adding: “We went to a school last year and they had no music whatsoever and now we’ve introduced the programme and it’s a really … amazing music department.” Lloyd Webber described the first concert he attended at Highbury Grove school as “one of the most extraordinary things that I’ve ever seen”. “There was [a] choir – where you’ve got [60] or more different languages spoken in the school – singing Mozart’s Ave Verum. Just on one level, you were seeing Muslims, Jews, Christians … singing and enjoying it … I felt we had to get ourselves involved,” he said. The Department for Education said: “We are committed to ensuring all children can enjoy the benefits of music and arts. We have invested over £620m between 2016 and 2021 on a diverse range of music and arts education programmes.”";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/12/lloyd-webber-calls-for-more-funding-for-music-tuition-in-schools-disadvantaged-communities;entertainment and culture
4098;4098;4098;4098;4141;4141;Omicron dims optimism as South America enters pandemic’s third year;2022-01-12;['Tom Phillips', 'Uki Goñi'];['Americas', 'World news', 'Brazil', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Argentina'];"As the pandemic’s second, gruelling year drew to a close and Covid rates in Rio de Janeiro plunged to levels unseen since it began, the Brazilian city’s health secretary, Daniel Soranz, celebrated a desperately needed respite. “We’ve been through such painful, difficult months … this is now a moment of hope,” the 42-year-old doctor said last November as carioca life regained some semblance of normality, hospitals emptied and the city’s effervescent cultural scene was reborn.
But the new year, and the arrival of the highly contagious Omicron variant, has brought Soranz and many others crashing back down to Earth as coronavirus cases surge across Latin America with consequences that remain unclear. “It’s really tiring,” Soranz admitted this week as infections in his beachside city soared to their highest ever levels and plans for Rio’s rumbustious annual carnival were cast into doubt. “This pandemic has been going on for almost two years. It’s exhausting. But there’s nothing to be done,” Soranz said, noting how 20% of Rio’s health workers – about 5,000 people – had been infected since December. Similar angst is being voiced around South America, which, having witnessed some of the pandemic’s bleakest moments – with bodies dumped in mass graves and patients starved of oxygen in overwhelmed hospitals – had been enjoying a long-awaited moment of optimism after becoming one of the world vaccination champions. Nearly 65% of South Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project, compared with about 62% in Europe and the US, and less than 10% in Africa. So far Argentina seems to be the South American country worst hit by Omicron. Over the last week it registered over 50% of South America’s daily cases, with just 11% of its population, and had the world’s seventh-highest number of daily cases. Although cases are rising in a straight line from a daily average of about 2,400 a month ago to more than 130,000 now, authorities say they are not unduly worried. Their assumption is that Covid has become an endemic disease and vaccination is the only necessary safeguard. The government is relaxing restrictions even more than last September when restaurants, football matches and entertainment venues reopened after a sharp dip in cases, and the outdoor mask mandate was lifted. “In the evolution of the disease you can see that it is really like chickenpox, the flu or that type of disease. The transition to the endemic will no longer require testing all cases and the role of isolation will change,” the health minister, Carla Vizzotti, told journalists on Tuesday. Health official Sandra Tirado predicted cases could begin to fall in the next two weeks and pointed to Córdoba province where Omicron infections were already coming down.
Arnaldo Dubin, an ICU doctor at a private Buenos Aires hospital, said he had deep misgivings about Argentina’s Covid policy and believed mask mandates had to return. “It’s horrifying. You have a very serious Covid situation that is paradoxically simultaneous with a total relaxation of safeguards.” Peru, which has one of the world’s worst per-capita death tolls, is also suffering, with more confirmed infections in the first week of January than during its ferocious second wave in early 2021. Other South American countries including Bolivia, Guyana and Uruguay have also seen infections jump while further north, Omicron appears to be rattling Mexico. On Saturday, a record 30,671 coronavirus cases were registered. On Monday, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced he had tested positive for the second time in a year and was isolating. “I think it’s the flu,” López Obrador, whose dismissive handling of the pandemic has been criticised, had told a press conference earlier in the day. He appeared without a mask despite admitting feeling hoarse. Brazil, which was already facing a major influenza outbreak, is also under pressure although a statistics blackout apparently caused by a hacking attack on the health ministry is hampering efforts to track the surge. Isaac Schrarstzhaupt, a data scientist who monitors Covid statistics, said Brazil was clearly careening into a new wave, with states such as Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo seeing a “vertiginous increase” in infections similar to that in Europe. “But [because of the blackout] we don’t know the scale of it and I fear we’ll only understand when hospitals start raising their hands to say: ‘Hey, we’re in trouble over here.’” Schrarstzhaupt warned: “Even if there’s a 95% reduction in severe cases, if we hit one million cases a day like the US, the remaining 5% will still be a very big number.” Rio’s health secretary said there was no doubt Omicron was driving a major Covid outbreak there. It had taken Omicron just 17 days to become Rio’s dominant variant, responsible for more than 98% of cases. Previous variants took more than 45 days to do the same. Soranz voiced apprehension about the coming days and could not confirm February’s carnival would go ahead. However, high vaccination levels seemed to be helping prevent a more dramatic crisis – as appears also to be the case in neighbours such as Peru and Argentina, and European countries such as Portugal. Ninety-six per cent of Rio’s adults have been double jabbed and 32% boosted. Soranz said 13 Covid patients were admitted on Sunday: 11 unvaccinated and two with only one shot. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen – but we can see it’s spreading much faster and that this is not being accompanied by severe cases or fatalities,” Soranz said, before adding a word of caution: “This could change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/south-america-covid-omicron-brazil-argentina;environment

4112;4112;4112;4112;4155;4155;Centrica boss says high energy bills could last two years;2022-01-12;['Joanna Partridge'];['Centrica', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Utilities', 'UK news', 'Gas', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Ofgem', 'Money'];"The boss of the UK’s largest energy supplier has said rocketing energy prices, which are adding to the soaring cost of living for British households, could last for as long as two years. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said the energy market “suggests that high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years”. O’Shea told the BBC there was no reason to think that gas prices would start to fall again “any time soon”. The rising global demand for gas is partly being driven by the energy transition, according to O’Shea, as countries move away from reliance on coal and oil. “As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel, so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, maybe there is more demand for gas,” O’Shea said. “There isn’t an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly, so I can’t say that this will be done in six months, or nine months, or a year.” However, O’Shea said he did not believe that increasing the domestic supply of gas from the North Sea would help to solve the energy crisis. “I’m not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from £3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago,” he said. “We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we’re not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market.” Consumers are bracing for a jump in what they pay for household energy in April, after the regulator reviews its energy price cap. Many expect Ofgem’s decision will lead to average bills soaring by as much as £700, taking the annual cost of electricity and gas for households on a supplier’s default tariff to £2,000. O’Shea, who has headed Centrica for almost two years, recently called on the government to help out struggling consumers by cutting VAT on energy bills, or stripping environmental levies from bills.
According to O’Shea’s calculations, the VAT cut would shave £100 off the average annual bill. However, this move has been dismissed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson. O’Shea also suggested that the government should fund environmental and social levies through general taxation instead of household bills, which he estimated would cut the average annual total by £170. Last year 26 UK energy firms collapsed, and O’Shea has previously said that energy companies would have to pass on higher wholesale costs in order to survive, although he has insisted that Centrica would not want to receive a government bailout to help it keep bills down. O’Shea’s comments came as the chief executive of rival supplier, Ovo Energy, apologised for what he described as a “ridiculous” email sent to customers, advising them to cuddle their pets, eat “hearty bowls of porridge”, or do “a few star jumps” to lower their heating bills. Stephen Fitzpatrick, Ovo Energy’s founder and chief executive, blamed an employee for sending out the email, which he called “embarrassing”, adding that it “should never have been written”. “Somebody had a bad day and they sent out an email and the truth is, we should have caught it,” Fitzpatrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. “I think it was probably meant with good intentions, but this is the kind of message that causes many customers a lot of upset.” Fitzpatrick said he was not expecting wholesale energy prices to fall until 2023 and called on the government to announce measures to ease the energy crisis. The UK’s third-largest energy supplier sent the email on Monday to customers of its SSE Energy Services, which Ovo acquired in 2020. The company was widely criticised for the tips on how to stay warm during the winter – described as “insulting” and “offensive” by MPs – which came at a time when millions of households are worrying about how they will cope with a significant increase in their energy bills.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/centrica-boss-says-high-energy-bills-could-last-two-years;business and economy
4136;4136;4136;4136;4180;4180;Rise in non-Covid virus that can leave children struggling to breathe;2022-01-12;['Andrew Gregory'];['Health', 'Society', 'Infectious diseases', 'Children', 'UK news'];"Parents are being warned to look out for signs of a non-Covid virus that is “rife” in the UK amid a surge in reports of children struggling to breathe. The British Lung Foundation (BLF) said Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is staging a comeback this winter after lockdown last year meant there were fewer infections than would normally occur. It is concerned that this year children will have “much lower immunity” at a time when the NHS is already under extreme pressure. “In the last few weeks, we have noticed a surge in calls from parents who are worried about their child’s breathing,” said Caroline Fredericks, a respiratory nurse who supports the BLF’s helpline. “Most of these parents have never heard of RSV which is worrying.”
RSV is common in babies and children. Almost all will have had it by the time they are two. It may cause a cough or cold but for some it can lead to bronchiolitis, an inflammatory infection of the lower airways which can make it hard to breathe. The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a common cold but can develop over a few days into a high temperature, a dry and persistent cough, difficulty feeding, and wheezing. While many cases clear up in two to three weeks, some children will end up being hospitalised. “There are steps parents can take to make their child more comfortable at home if their RSV develops into bronchiolitis, such as keeping their fluid intake up, helping them to breathe more easily by holding them upright when feeding and giving them paracetamol or ibuprofen suitable for infants,” said Fredericks. The BLF has already seen a 400% rise in calls to its helpline from parents worried about their child having breathing difficulties in the last three months compared to the same period the year before. During that time an estimated 1,000 children have required hospital care in England alone, it said. It is issuing new guidance for parents which includes asking anyone who has a cough or cold to stay away from young children, making sure that anyone who handles their child washes their hands regularly and to avoid smoking around young children and babies. BLF clinical lead, Dr Andy Whittamore, said: “In general practice, we are seeing a lot of children with coughs and viruses that weren’t circulating last year and so their immunity is lowered. “Doctors on the ground are concerned that alongside a rapid increase in cases of Covid-19, we are also going to see a surge in diseases like bronchiolitis. Some babies do develop severe symptoms with the RSV virus, and warning signs to look out for include if they refuse to feed, are becoming very breathless or if they are breathing in a shallow or irregular way.” Chloe-Ann Ford, 22, from the Isle of Wight, said she knows first-hand how terrifying RSV can be as her baby Teddy, who is 12 weeks old, was hospitalised with bronchiolitis caused by RSV last November. “We had to spend five nights in hospital and Teddy was kept on oxygen,” she said. “On one occasion, he stopped breathing for 28 seconds which was terrifying. “I’d never heard of it [RSV] before and didn’t know how dangerous it could be. Thankfully, Teddy is now recovered but I want all parents of young children to be aware of RSV and to get medical help if their child finds it hard to feed, becomes very breathless or breathes in a shallow, irregular way. It could save their life.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/rsv-virus-infection-uk-rise-children-struggling-to-breathe;health
4139;4139;4139;4139;4183;4183;Theatre leader Pooja Ghai: ‘I couldn’t sit back and complain about roles I wasn’t getting’;2022-01-12;['Arifa Akbar'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Hampstead theatre', 'Race'];"Pooja Ghai struggled to find her footing as a professional actor at first. It was the early 1990s and she wasn’t given many auditions. When parts were offered, they were limited to older Indian aunties or grandmothers. “My first role on television was on Holby City playing a 60-year-old woman. I was 23,” says Ghai. Then she discovered Tamasha theatre company, set up in 1989 by Kristine Landon-Smith and Sudha Bhuchar, and everything changed. Originally offering opportunities to south Asian artists (the company has since broadened its reach to all global majority artists), Tamasha instantly felt like a home, says Ghai, now an award-winning director as well as an actor. “They were telling stories that encapsulated migrant, colonial and postcolonial experiences and I thought ‘This is why I want to do what I’m doing.’ I’d found a space for telling stories that mattered.” More than two decades later, Ghai, who has worked as an associate director at Theatre Royal Stratford East in London, and associate artist at Kali theatre company, is Tamasha’s new artistic director and she has big plans for its future. One recurring, and problematic, feature of organisations dedicated to global majority artists is their perennial status as “emerging” companies, she says. It is something she wants to address. “Tamasha’s been around for over 30 years and it’s still an emerging company that looks at talent development. My ambition is to keep growing that foundation but to elevate it to a mid-scale touring company that’s promoting and working with mid-career and established artists as well. There is no reason that Tamasha shouldn’t be on a par with English Touring Theatre or Headlong.”
That does, of course, require more financial backing, she adds, along with support from established institutions. Would she want to stage work by Tamasha at our biggest venues, such as the National Theatre? “I absolutely think we should be on at the National, and I would welcome a conversation between the two organisations. In my 20-year career, the National hasn’t felt like the natural home for stories from the global majority that celebrate the multiculturalism of our nation.” She does, however, think there has been a breakthrough with black diaspora stories. “Seeing this work on our stages is amazing, but we still have a long way to go. It’s about opening up that thinking to all other global majority artists and challenging what we deem to be a ‘risk’.” Clint Dyer, a black Briton, was appointed deputy artistic director at the National last year. Does this make her more hopeful? “Clint is a brilliant artist and a warrior. It’s an exciting thing to see him there and, yes, I hope it shifts the conversation.” Stories about the British empire, its colonial history and postcolonial experiences are vital to her, and she would like to see these issues explored on stage. “We are not taught our colonial histories in schools. We don’t talk about the darker side of the British empire and we need to.”
To that end, she wants to revive Tanika Gupta’s Lions and Tigers, originally staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in 2017, and directed by Ghai. “It was about young revolutionaries from the 1930s trying to overthrow British rule in India and it was one of the most important pieces of theatre I have ever done.” She also wants to examine what it means to be Asian in Britain today and is directing Lotus Beauty, a Hampstead theatre production in association with Tamasha, this spring. Serendipitously, Ghai was invited to direct Satinder Chohan’s play before she took over Tamasha (Chohan had originally been commissioned by Tamasha 10 years ago). Lotus Beauty follows the lives of five multigenerational women at a beauty salon in Southall and touches on identity, female friendship, domestic violence and suicide. “It’s very funny, moving and deeply honest about the complexity of being a migrant and building a community together,” she says.
It is the job of theatre-makers to grapple with difficult topical conversations, she believes, especially when there are so many divisions in society and when “cancel culture” poses a threat to artistic freedom. “The question is how to hold the space for difficult conversation and debates with opposing opinions respectfully, and find common ground to move forward, so we’re not just staying in our silos and echo chambers.” What difficult debates does she mean? Stories of racism, colourism and misogyny within global majority communities as well as Islamophobia: “Since 9/11, we have seen the capitalisation of fear culture. For me, having conversations around Islamophobia and what it means, not only though the impact of a white supremacist system but around attitudes within our own community – what’s going on inside and how it impacts our young people – feels important.” Ghai was born in Kenya, to Kenyan Indian parents, and spent her first 14 years there. She signed up for her first play at the age of 11 while at boarding school and was instantly hooked. “It was Tom Sawyer and I was playing Aunt Polly. I fell in love with what I’d experienced after our first performance. And looking at the cast around me, there was every creed, culture and colour. We all celebrated each other’s differences and thrived off that. I couldn’t imagine it any other way.”
She encountered a very different world after coming to Britain and launching her career as an actor. She set up a university drama society while studying psychology and sociology at Oxford Brookes and took shows to the Edinburgh festival fringe every year, producing, directing and acting. “It gave me a real sense of building something. It was exhilarating.” But on a drama course elsewhere, her eyes were opened to the limits and labels imposed on her. She remembers being told: “You’re quite a good actress but you’re Indian and you’re fat so you won’t work.” It left her feeling “floored”, she says. “I didn’t know I didn’t belong. It’s only as I moved in the profession that I thought ‘Why is everything so limited for me?’” Fifteen years on as an actor, she was still feeling confined: “I did a lot of radio, TV and theatre but I could see I was never going to be really challenged as an actor because of the roles I was getting or being seen for.” She was so disheartened she decided to leave the industry but after a heart attack and being diagnosed with lupus, she returned, now more determined to campaign for change. “I felt like I couldn’t be away from acting and storytelling. I felt we needed more pathways, we needed to give more voice to people of colour, we needed to have new leadership at the table, to diversify our boards. I couldn’t sit back and complain about what I wasn’t getting. I needed to go out and understand how we could make change and not feel that because we weren’t white we didn’t have a voice.” She signed up to the campaigning group Artistic Directors of the Future, where she is co-chair, which aims to demystify leadership. The silver lining to the pandemic is that it has given us a chance to re-evaluate and rebuild, she thinks. Just as she saw solutions, and gained strength, after hitting rock bottom, she thinks we can do the same thing collectively. “It’s been a tough time for the sector but we as artists are challenging the structures. We are thinking about how we level up and of the systems and structures in place that won’t allow for that levelling up. There’s a long way to go.” Lotus Beauty is at Hampstead theatre, London, 13 May-18 June.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/12/theatre-leader-pooja-ghai-i-couldnt-sit-back-and-complain-about-roles-i-wasnt-getting;entertainment and culture
4158;4158;4158;4158;4202;4202;UK households suffer biggest fall in available cash in eight years;2022-01-12;['Richard Partington'];['Inflation', 'Family finances', 'Household bills', 'Energy bills', 'Money', 'Savings', 'Banks and building societies', 'Consumer affairs', 'UK news', 'Consumer spending', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Young people', 'Society'];"UK households have suffered the sharpest fall in the amount of cash they have available to spend for almost eight years, amid a worsening cost of living crisis driven by high inflation and rising energy bills. According to a report by the insurer Scottish Widows, increasing living costs at the end of last year hit people’s pockets and led to the steepest decline in cash availability since the start of 2014. It said people were increasingly pessimistic about their future finances in 2022, according to the latest reading from its quarterly household finance index. The poll of 1,500 individuals, compiled by Ipsos Mori and IHS Markit on behalf of the insurer, found that pressure intensified on savings and disposable income in the final months of 2021, with both declining quicker than at anytime in over the past seven years. The index, which measures households’ overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, fell from 44 in the third quarter to 40.1 in the final quarter of 2021, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2020 when Covid-19 first spread. A figure above 50 signals an improvement as opposed to a deterioration. It comes as a separate report from the Royal Society for Arts said young adults were among the hardest hit by the cost of living crisis, in a warning that the damage to their finances from inflation, student debt, and rising taxes risked creating a new “generation precariat”.
According to a survey of 1,000 young adults by the thinktank, researchers found almost half (47%) were unable or just about managing to make ends meet each month, or had an income that varied significantly from paycheck to paycheck. With inflation at the highest level in a decade, ministers are coming under growing pressure to act on living standards ahead of an expected sharp increase in gas and electricity prices for British consumers from April. According to the RSA study, carried out as part of an inquiry by the Health Foundation thinktank into young people’s health, those living in financially precarious situations were far more likely to be worried about their mental and physical health. It found that just 41% of young people believed others like them would ever be able to buy their own home, and only 51% thought they would ever earn enough to support a family. Just over half (51%) said they thought young people like them would not be able to retire and live comfortably when the time comes. The researchers said young adults risked a tougher squeeze than other age groups as the government’s “national living wage” for under-23s was lower than the headline rate of £8.91 an hour. The legal pay floor will go up to £9.50 from April for those aged 23 and over, while there will also be increases for those in younger age brackets.
The RSA also noted that the government was considering lowering the repayment threshold on student loans to £22,000 from £27,295 at present, which would have the effect of reducing incomes for graduates. Fran Landreth Strong, an RSA researcher and lead author of the report, said: “Young people across the UK face a toxic cocktail of inadequate work and safety nets, high levels of debt, and a rising cost of living. “Our research shows that this results in a worrying number of young people facing financial precarity, with significant impact on their mental and physical health and their confidence about the future. Without proper action, we risk creating a ‘generation precariat’, unable to invest in their futures and move confidently into adulthood.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/uk-households-suffer-biggest-fall-in-available-cash-in-eight-years;business and economy
4172;4172;4172;4172;4217;4217;Che Adams seals romp over Brentford to delight Southampton’s new owner;2022-01-11;['Ben Fisher'];['Premier League', 'Southampton', 'Brentford', 'Football', 'Sport'];"With a broad smile on his face and a Southampton scarf in his hands, it is probably worth someone telling Dragan Solak, the Serbian billionaire behind the club’s recent takeover, that it is not always like this. Southampton swept past Brentford, scoring four goals here for the first time in more than four years in a win capped by the substitute Che Adams, after Jan Bednarek, Armando Broja and an unfortunate own goal by Álvaro Fernández helped the hosts into a comfortable lead. At the final whistle, as Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now blared over the speakers, Ralph Hasenhüttl put both thumbs up in the direction of the directors’ box. The own goal, which pinballed off a post and in via the back of the Brentford goalkeeper’s hand, summed up a taxing night for the visitors. A rasping equaliser by Vitaly Janelt was nothing more than a footnote for Thomas Frank’s side, who succumbed to their heaviest defeat of the season. The timing could not be worse as their next game is Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday.
This marked the first home game of a new era, with Solak, adorning club colours – a red tie and white shirt, plus a scarf given to him by a supporter from the tier below – sitting alongside the Southampton chief executive, Martin Semmens. Since the takeover by Sport Republic, in which Solak is the main investor, the manager, Hasenhüttl, has talked up the benefits of the investment group’s plan to put Southampton at the heart of their multi-club empire, a model he is well-versed in from his two-year spell in charge of Red Bull Leipzig. Hasenhüttl said the arrival of Rasmus Ankersen, co-founder of Sport Republic and an integral part of Brentford’s rise through the divisions, brings welcome knowledge. Solak, the founder of Serbia’s biggest telecoms and media provider, has a love for golf – he is a keen player and owns courses in Slovenia – but with five minutes gone here he appeared to have the football bug. James Ward-Prowse sent an inswinging corner into the box and Bednarek nipped in front of Ivan Toney at the front post to glance a header beyond Fernández. Solak, Semmens, and Henrik Kraft, the chairman of Sport Republic, rose to their feet in celebration. “They saw a good game from our side,” Hasenhüttl smiled.
For Frank, it will have been a particularly maddening goal to concede given the Brentford head coach had forewarned his team of Ward-Prowse’s prowess from set pieces, and, in the buildup to this game, even made a case that the Southampton captain may be second to only Lionel Messi as the best free-kick taker on the planet. Unsurprisingly, Frank referenced Ward-Prowse’s “top delivery” for the first goal. Frank cut a frustrated figure on the sideline but his team replied in style. Bryan Mbeumo sped down the right, breaking clear of Mohammed Salisu, and stood up a cross towards the back post. Toney missed it but Janelt, lurking a few feet behind the striker, did not, scissoring across a bouncing ball with his left foot and emphatically smacking his shot into the bottom corner.
It was almost as if Ibrahima Diallo, one of three changes from Southampton’s extra-time victory at Swansea on Saturday, had been inspired by Janelt’s strike. When a corner was cleared to the edge of the box, Diallo sent a left-footed shot thudding towards goal that rattled a post and cannoned in off Fernández’s right glove. Frank could only chew on his gum that little bit faster. Brentford could argue Southampton were a touch fortunate and Fernández unlucky but they only had themselves to blame when Broja extended the lead courtesy of a slick move. Oriol Romeu exposed a gaping hole in the Brentford back line with a defence-splitting pass and Broja slotted in, via a kind deflection from Fernández’s left boot. Soon enough, Solak, Semmens and Kraft were rejoicing again in the stands. Diallo intervened to stem a Brentford attack, walloping long from deep and Adams got the ball under his spell with his first touch before dinking past a stranded Fernández with his next.
There was still time for arguably the moment of the match. Brentford switched the ball from right to left and just as Yoane Wissa looked primed to apply the finishing touch, Ward-Prowse charged in to rake the ball to safety. “We cannot feel sorry for ourselves because there is a big, big task ahead of us on Sunday,” Frank said.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/che-adams-seals-romp-over-brentford-to-delight-southamptons-new-owner;sports
4197;4197;4197;4197;4243;4243;The Guardian view on Afghanistan: aid is not enough | Editorial;2022-01-11;['Editorial'];['Afghanistan', 'United Nations', 'Taliban', 'Aid'];It is the United Nations’ biggest ever appeal for a single country. But the $5bn (£3.7bn) sought to stave off catastrophe in Afghanistan is dwarfed both by the trillions that were poured into the war, and by the level of current need. The Disasters Emergency Committee says that 95% of Afghans do not have enough to eat, and one million children are at risk of dying from malnutrition this winter. Women and other vulnerable people are especially hard-hit. The money is merely a stopgap, as the UN itself points out. Even if the appeal is fully funded – as it must be – the desperation will grow. Conditions will only worsen as winter intensifies, remaining possessions are sold and flimsy social safety nets break: even the relatively lucky are struggling, leaving them less able to help family and friends. The Taliban’s seizure of power last August brought economic collapse, and drought has exacerbated the crisis. One UN expert believes that no modern economy has experienced such an abrupt shock, with the overnight loss of foreign aid amounting to 43% of GDP. Work and salaries disappeared. The price of essential imports such as wheat surged. Asset freezes and sanctions have deepened the crisis. The Taliban’s repression has left women jobless: “While we are living under the poverty line, the statements of [the]Islamic Emirate are about women’s hair and faces,” complained protesters in Parwan province last week. No one wanted the Taliban to take power, and no one wishes to reward a group who are immiserating and punishing their compatriots and dismantling democratic institutions, even as they demand foreign assistance. But while western governments ask themselves if they can deal with the Taliban, Afghans have no such choice. Humanitarian relief is essential but wholly inadequate. In late December, the US extended and clarified its waivers for aid, including development funding. This must be given too, but carefully. Though international donors have very limited leverage, strict monitoring and conditionality – such as ensuring that only services accessible to women are funded – is necessary. This will not be about grand deals, but the grind of daily negotiations. European nations have gone further than the US in a “humanitarian plus” approach, but Afghanistan cannot get off its knees without a functioning financial system. Unfreezing the assets of the central bank remains a highly controversial option, for obvious reasons, and it is unclear that the Taliban are capable of handling it anyway. Among the alternatives mooted are the creation of a private central bank or credit swaps, perhaps the quickest fix. Without a serious effort to shore up the economy, others will feel the consequences too: there is a significant risk that Islamic State could gain ground and that the production of narcotics will increase sharply. More people will be forced to flee into grim conditions. Above all, the appalling human toll in Afghanistan will rise steeply. Judging the best path ahead is extremely difficult. What is striking is how little serious effort is being put into it. A greater sense of responsibility by the US, and of urgency across the international community, is desperately needed.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/11/the-guardian-view-on-afghanistan-aid-is-not-enough;politics

4231;4231;4231;4231;4277;4277;How to move: with foot pain;2022-01-11;['N/A'];['Health & wellbeing', 'Life and style', 'Fitness', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Yoga'];"Foot pain is a common, disabling condition associated with older age and obesity and is more prevalent in women than in men. A 2008 study found that foot pain affects nearly one in five people aged 18 years and over in Australia. Dr Kade Paterson, a researcher at the Centre for Health, Exercise and Sports Medicine at the University of Melbourne and certified sports podiatrist, says in younger to middle-aged adults, plantar heel pain is the most common condition, affecting around 5-8% of the general population. But as people age, the most common cause of foot pain is osteoarthritis of the big toe and the ankle joints, says Prof Kim Bennell, an academic physiotherapist and the director of the centre.
Some illnesses can also affect the feet, such as diabetes or poor blood flow, says Prof David Hunter, a rheumatologist at Royal North Shore Hospital and the University of Sydney. Because the feet are involved in most types of exercising, foot pain can deter people from physical activity. But exercise, Bennell says, strengthens the muscles, improves flexibility and balance, and helps with weight loss, reducing the load on the feet. It also provides psychological benefits. “Exercise makes people feel better,” says Hunter. “Pain might still be present but can be better tolerated.” Exercise can help reduce foot pain in many ways, but it is essential to consult a podiatrist, doctor or a physiotherapist before you begin. The class: tai chi and yoga There is evidence that tai chi and yoga classes can help reduce foot pain, Bennell says. Tai chi and yoga are excellent, holistic workouts that can strengthen and improve the whole body,” says Paterson. These barefoot practices can help strengthen the feet’s muscles and increase stability. Tai chi and yoga classes can also improve balance, essential to avoid falls and further injuries, especially as people get older. “The balance benefits that come with tai chi and yoga are an additional benefit that we don’t see with some of the other workout classes,” Paterson says. “Classes have the benefit of social participation as well,” adds Bennell. “People with persistent pain can often find it helpful to be in a group setting.” The move: calf raises “My number one go-to exercise is some form of calf raises,” says Josh Butcher, a podiatrist and APA musculoskeletal physiotherapist. Although it can be challenging for many people, he says, calf raises are great for improving calf strength, stabilising the foot and preventing injuries. “If you have great calf strength, it means you don’t have to compensate through other muscles or other joints within the foot,” he says. “You’re using your body’s natural spring mechanism to propel forward and move.” Calf raises are a simple exercise you can easily slip into your day-to-day life. Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart. Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels, keeping the knees extended but not locked. Hold for one second, then lower slowly back to the ground.
This exercise has many variations, and you can slowly increase the intensity over time. You can begin with seated calf raises if standing causes too much strain. You can progress with weighted calf raises by holding weights in your hands or a single-leg calf raise by lifting one foot off the floor and holding on to a chair for balance. “[Calf raises] strengthen the big muscles that are outside of the foot and run into the foot. They also work out the little muscles that live inside the foot,” says Paterson. “It’s a really good all-round exercise to support foot function and can have pain-relieving effects.” However, he says calf raises might exacerbate some forefoot conditions, such as neuroma or bursitis, so it is essential to modify the exercise if necessary. The activity: walking and running “Walking is always a good exercise for [foot] osteoarthritis,” says Bennell. But even a short stroll might feel excruciating to someone with severe foot pain, so starting with short easy walks is recommended. Running is also an excellent activity for foot pain, especially if you already are a runner, Bennell says. But pacing yourself is critical. “Running is really good for foot pain,” says Butcher. “It just has to be done really well as it can lead to further injuries if you do it incorrectly. Starting with a couch to 5km run programs is always preferable.” He also recommends getting footwear checked by a recognised running-shoe shop. “Provided that the pain is not getting too bad or lasting too long, then certainly running is fantastic,” agrees Paterson. “But if you find this weight-bearing exercise makes your pain worse, then you can look at non-weight-bearing options like swimming or cycling.” The hard pass: not too fast While exercise has several benefits, all experts agree that people with foot pain should avoid doing too much too quickly. “Ease into it,” says Butcher. After months of lockdown, people are eager to get out and move more, he says, but overloading your feet too suddenly might exacerbate foot pain. “Having some pain during exercise is OK and expected,” says Bennell. “But if you are getting much worse symptoms that don’t settle down by the next day, then obviously whatever you are doing is a bit much and you need to back off.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/how-to-move-with-foot-pain;health
4232;4232;4232;4232;4278;4278;Easy wins: ‘Tastes great on almost any savoury dish’;2022-01-11;['Michael Sun'];['Life and style', 'Food', 'Australian food and drink', 'Chinese food and drink'];"I grew up in a household eating copious amounts of chilli at every mealtime: heapings of chopped bird’s eye on eggs, extremely liberal lashings of Tabasco in popcorn, huge dollops of hot sauce consumed straight from the spoon. It was the idyllic childhood, probably because I spent most of it in a hot and heady daze, tongue burning and mind pleasantly blissed out in picante pleasure. These days, I make my own chilli oil whenever I’m feeling particularly nostalgic. The right chilli oil feels transportive. For the less sentimental, it also just tastes great on almost any savoury dish, banishing weak-flavoured woes. Neil Perry recommends it on steamed silken tofu; Kylie Kwong drenches dumplings in the stuff; Meera Sodha tops vegan noodles with a light smattering for extra oomph.
There are many variations out there, but I favour a very simple recipe of just four ingredients. You will need: a good handful of chilli flakes, salt, minced garlic, and vegetable oil. Eyeball everything. Throw it all into a pot at medium heat and let it simmer until the garlic just turns brown – the result is a brilliant red condiment with crispy garlic bits. The great thing about chilli oil is that it lends itself to experimentation: anything (and everything) goes. Add sesame, or cardamom, or grated ginger, or shallots, or Szechuan peppercorns on repeat attempts. Does too much of this chilli oil make my stomach ache with an intense burning sensation as I lay awake at 3am? Yes. Will I continue making it and then over-indulging anyway? Also yes. Reader beware: if you are unlike me in that you are sane, just a light patter of this chilli oil is sufficient to add requisite zing to your dish. My perfect lazy dinner is chilli oil on rice, but it’s also easily dressed down in toasties, soups and salads, or dressed up à la Ottolenghi. And for the extra lazy, Lao Gan Ma offers an iconic store-bought version that’s available in the international aisle (as well as all Asian groceries).

4238;4238;4238;4238;4284;4284;Labor pledges to boost Australia’s disaster readiness with revamp of $4.7bn emergency response fund;2022-01-11;['Sarah Martin'];['Australian politics', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Labor party', 'Australia news'];"A Labor government will revamp the $4.7bn emergency response fund to commit up to $200m a year to disaster prevention and resilience, as leader Anthony Albanese sharpens his attack on the Morrison government for failing to plan. Making the announcement ahead of a visit to Mackay in Queensland on Wednesday, Albanese said Labor would use interest from the fund, which is managed by the Future Fund, to improve Australia’s disaster “readiness”. Proceeds from the fund would go towards prevention measures such as flood levees, sea walls, cyclone shelters, evacuation centres, fire breaks and telecommunications improvements.
“Thousands of Australians who face bushfires, floods and cyclones every year deserve to be protected by a federal government who plans ahead and invests to keep them safe,” Albanese said in a statement. “These investments will literally save lives, not to mention the taxpayers’ funds that have to be spent on recovery and repairs when disasters hit. “Australians are renowned as the best disaster responders in the world. They deserve to be backed by a government that looks forward, plans and prevents the worst.” The redirection of the fund towards resilience and mitigation measures draws on recommendations made in a 2015 productivity commission report which looked into natural disaster funding arrangements in Australia. The report, which was ordered by the then treasurer Joe Hockey, found that governments “overinvest in post-disaster reconstruction and underinvest in mitigation that would limit the impact of natural disasters in the first place”. “Current government natural disaster funding arrangements are not efficient, equitable or sustainable. They are prone to cost shifting, ad hoc responses and short-term political opportunism,” the report found. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The government established the emergency response fund in 2019, with the funds to be spent on recovery and mitigation, but none of the fund has so far been spent with the government referring to it as a fund of last resort. In the 2021 budget, the government announced a similar fund called the Prepare Australia fund, which committed $600m over six years for disaster resilience measures. Labor accused the government of continuing to sit on the emergency respond fund which had “done nothing to help” prepare the country for natural disasters. “Three years after it was announced, the ERF has not spent a cent on disaster recovery and has not completed a single disaster prevention project. The only thing it has done is earn the government over $750m in investment returns,” Albanese said. “As with Covid-19, the Morrison government’s failure to plan and prepare for natural disasters has left Australians vulnerable. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We know weather events are on the horizon – we have the smarts and the resources to prepare and prevent. We just need a government with a plan.”
The funding, which would be set at the current cap of $200m a year, would be matched by state, territory or local governments, in line with the productivity commission recommendations. Labor said it would continue to fully fund disaster recovery through existing arrangements and would improve the efficiency of disaster recovery processes, “to simplify and speed up payments to disaster victims and repairs to damaged infrastructure”. Albanese, who is midway through an eight-day “Better Future for Queensland” tour, will spend a second day in the seat of Dawson on Wednesday, visiting a canegrower and the local Country Women’s Association. Dawson is held by the LNP’s retiring MP George Christensen on a 14.6% margin. The opposition is using the Queensland trip as a test run for the election campaign, with Labor needing to build on the six of 30 seats it currently holds to try to win government. Grilled about the performance of the party in Queensland at the last election during his trip, Albanese said it was clear Labor did not get enough votes right around the state. “One of the things that I’ve been determined to do is to make sure that we do better right around Queensland,” he said. “We’ve learned the lessons. We did a whole review into it. And what we didn’t do was show that in terms of our policy offering, (that) wasn’t strong enough to secure the support of people in Queensland.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/labor-pledges-to-boost-australias-disaster-readiness-with-revamp-of-47bn-emergency-response-fund;politics

4270;4270;4270;4270;4316;4316;Payout offers over Post Office IT scandal sent to less than third of applicants;2022-01-11;['Haroon Siddique'];['Post Office', 'UK news', 'Postal service', 'Politics', 'House of Commons', 'Business', 'Law'];Less than a third of Post Office workers who applied for compensation under a government scheme in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal have received a payout offer, almost 17 months after it closed, MPs have been told. The Horizon IT system installed by the Post Office and supplied by Fujitsu falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls, leading to 736 unsafe convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. The historical shortfall scheme (HSS) was set up in 2020, with a closing date for applications in August of that year, to compensate Post Office workers who had not been convicted but who had instead been forced to replace missing funds from their own pocket. Appearing before the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee on Tuesday, the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, said that there had been 2,500 applications to the HSS but only 777 offers had been made. He said the size of the panel dealing with claims was doubled in October, and was bullish about future progress. “From my perspective, we will get to 50% by the end of March and we will get to in excess of 95% by the end of the calendar year … I hope therefore that we will ensure that as many of those individuals who have come forward will be compensated and/or their families if not the individuals themselves.” Separately, those who have had a criminal conviction overturned are entitled to an interim compensation payment of £100,000, but Read said only 57 people had received the sum so far. He explained that this was because only 72 of the 736 people whom the Post Office acknowledges as having an unsafe conviction have had them overturned so far, despite attempts to contact them all. Read told the committee that the Post Office had not managed to contact 126 of the 736, while 214 had not responded to letters. Asked why they might not have responded, Read replied: “There will be many individuals who will want to put it behind them and won’t want to revisit it.” The postal affairs minister, Paul Scully, went further in his evidence to the committee. “There is a mistrust in this entire process, not just with the Post Office but with government, with everybody, because they’ve had 20 years of absolute hell,” he said. “So why would they trust authority in general?”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/payout-offers-compensation-post-office-horizon-it-scandal;business and economy
4287;4287;4287;6;4333;4333;Prince Andrew can sell Swiss chalet after settling £6.6m debt, say reports;2022-01-11;['Caroline Davies'];['Prince Andrew', 'UK news'];The Duke of York has settled a £6.6m debt with a French socialite allowing him to sell a Swiss chalet as he faces escalating legal bills over the sexual assault civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, according to reports. Isabelle de Rouvre, 74, who sold the property to Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, in 2014 for a reported £18m, said: “The war is over. He has paid the money.” Andrew and his ex-wife had agreed with Rouvre that Chalet Helora in the ski resort of Verbier in the Swiss Alps, would be paid for in instalments. But Rouvre claimed the two failed to make the final £5m instalment. Initially Rouvre agreed the final instalment could be deferred until December 2019, with interest accruing, but the Yorks still did not honour the agreement despite repeated demands, it was reported. Rouvre launched legal action in May 2020 in Switzerland to recoup the £5m plus interest owed to her. Andrew is said to have finally paid late last year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rouvre said she had sold the house to the Yorks about two months ago. “That is the end of the story thankfully,” she told the website. “The war is finished. It is the end of the matter. I have nothing to do with it now. That’s all.” She added: “It was about six weeks ago that the matter was closed. It was November. The second payment needed to be paid and that payment is now done. That’s it. You can be sure that’s it. It’s done.” A source close to Andrew said: “I can confirm that the legal action has been halted and that the chalet is being sold – but otherwise no comment on private financial matters.” The prince is now selling the property as he faces the lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal on three occasions after she was trafficked by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has denied the allegations. His ex-wife and the couple’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, stayed at the chalet over the New Year holiday. As a family, the Yorks had rented the seven-bedroomed chalet, which has an indoor swimming pool, for winter holidays before deciding to buy it as a nest egg for their daughters. Until the debt was settled, Andrew was unable to sell it. It is understood a buyer has been found and the sale is proceeding, but not yet completed. Andrew is awaiting a New York judge’s decision on his application to have Giuffre’s lawsuit against him dismissed.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/prince-andrew-sell-swiss-chalet;business and economy
4288;4288;4288;7;4334;4334;As a paramedic, I see an NHS ambulance service at breaking point, letting down those who need it most | The Secret Paramedic;2022-01-11;['The Secret Paramedic'];['NHS', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news'];"Waiting, and waiting, and waiting. For a GP appointment, a routine screening, a vaccine. To see a clinician in A&E, or for an ambulance to take you there. Waiting for a referral appointment, for the community nurse to arrive, for a care worker to call. The NHS waiting list feels endless. And all our leaders seem to do is tell us we must do our best so the health service doesn’t become overwhelmed. As a paramedic with more than 20 years in the ambulance service, I know we are not the only ones to cry, “We are overwhelmed.” Over the past three nights I’ve been working the 7pm-7am shift. Every evening, I’ve arrived at work to a list of more than 160 outstanding 999 calls. That’s more than 160 people waiting for an ambulance. Some have been waiting for longer than 12 hours; some will have life-threatening or life-changing conditions. Six hours into a recent shift, I attended an elderly woman who had fallen over seven hours earlier. She had fractures to her hip and wrist, and bruises to her face. In addition, she had suffered the indignity of being incontinent. But there is nothing new in this: in fact, stories like hers are a daily occurrence. How long must we wait for the situation to improve? The NHS and its patients need support. The ambulance service has been failing for years. Although Covid has shone a bright light on this, it alone did not create these problems. There are multiple reasons for failure.
It’s clear we can’t blame the crews for these problems. Paramedics and call handlers turn out for 12-hour shifts knowing they’re unlikely to feel they have really made a difference. Over the past three nights, my colleagues told me of a 28-year-old man with groin pain and a woman who had eaten a muffin passed its best-before date and now felt some stomach discomfort. Why did they take priority over the woman on the floor? Why don’t those patients make their own way to hospital? Is it because our management doesn’t have the courage to say no to anyone? The frustrating result is that we let down the patients who need us most. Patients die while they wait for us to attend the out-of-date muffin case. In the south of England, many local ambulance stations have closed to make way for “super hubs”. So why are people still waiting? Local ambulance stations served local communities; now, with super stations, ambulances have to travel for 30 minutes or more to reach people. The idea is that larger towns, which have the largest call volumes, hit the target times in those areas. But the result is that patients in smaller communities – which don’t seem to matter as much – are left waiting. Another flaw is the system followed when answering a 999 call; the way calls and concerns from the public are prioritised and routed to front line staff. Among call handlers, it’s called “fire fighting”, which is funny because if you leave a fire waiting there is often nothing left to extinguish and it burns itself out. It can feel as though this is all part of some grand plan to eventually privatise the ambulance service. I feel deeply sorry for all the people who had to wait for us to arrive when they needed us, for those families who had a loved one die while they waited, and for those who will have to wait in the future. Frontline ambulance crews want our management to manage and take responsibility for their actions. We want more funding to clear the waiting lists and ensure we can help those who need it most. Unless the waiting list ends, the ambulance service, like a fire, will only keep going until it burns itself out.

4289;4289;4289;8;4335;4335;Zak Crawley aims to put 2021 failures behind him after ‘fun’ Ashes innings;2022-01-11;['Simon Burnton'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"For 156 minutes at the start of England’s second innings in Sydney, as he set about compiling the second-highest score of his Test career and propelled his team towards the draw that ensured they will avoid a series whitewash, Zak Crawley found himself experiencing something that not many English cricketers have managed in Australia this winter: having fun. It was not just for his team that the fourth Test represented the end of a miserable run, as in his first match of 2022 the 23-year-old shrugged off the poor form that had dogged him in 2021 to re-establish himself in the side with an impressive innings of 77. “It was not far off the most fun I’ve ever had on a cricket field,” he said on Tuesday. “I mean, that’s the reason I play the game, for days like that. I massively enjoyed it, absolutely loved it. Cricket, you get so many failures that you have to enjoy the good times. And when you’re playing nicely, it doesn’t get more fun than that.”
Having scored an apparently career-defining 267 in his final Test of 2020 against Pakistan in Southampton, at which point he was averaging 48.41 after 12 international innings, Crawley floundered in 2021. Across the year he averaged 10.81 in 16 Test innings and 23.14 across 37 first-class knocks for Kent and country. “It’s all a great learning curve,” he said. “You tend to learn more from your failures than your successes and it wasn’t the year I wanted. We played some great opposition on some really tough pitches – I wasn’t too hard on myself in some regards. I learned a lot about myself and my game and I feel like I can push on from it and become a better player.” It is true that he faced some particularly difficult sporting challenges in 2021, from India in Ahmedabad to Australia with the wind in their sails in Melbourne. “Playing in India against that spin and then at the MCG in that final session [on the second day] – they’re the two hardest spells of cricket I’ve ever had by a long way and I wouldn’t have thought that it would get much harder than those two experiences. You’ve just got to take them on the chin and move on and learn from them.”
While Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Rory Burns and Ollie Pope have first-class averages in the 40s or, in Pope’s case, 50s, Crawley’s languishes in the low 30s – 31.21 at present, down slightly since he made his England debut in December 2019. This he puts down to “the fact I’ve batted on poor pitches really my whole Championship career”. Unusually, his first-class average is worse – 29.15 – on his home ground of Canterbury. “I don’t think it’s a Kent thing,” he said. “Obviously I’d like the pitch at Canterbury to be a little bit better. I don’t think it’s unfair of me to say. But I think pretty much all the grounds I’ve played on have been pretty poor. I can think of about two or three where I’ve got to them thinking that this is a really good wicket. The pitches have been very favourable to bowlers my whole career so far so until that changes …”
It is one of Crawley’s regrets that he has not “gone on to score big hundreds”, though he draws frequently on the memory of the one time he did. “I watch that innings frequently to be honest, when I’m going through bad form, because it’s a nice reminder that I’ve done it before and I can do it again,” he says of his 267. “Sometimes if you’re feeling a bit rough you can lose sight of the fact that you can play. I played really nicely that day, but I feel like I’m a better player now and that’s because of the failures I had last year. I learned a lot about myself, like what not to do almost. I would have liked to score a lot more runs, but for that I’m quite thankful.” Whatever happens in this week’s final Test in Hobart, given the way the tour has panned out everyone involved with the England squad will leave with some failures to learn from. “The majority of it has been top class and just how I expected it to be – quite hostile Australia crowds and a hostile Australian team who are very good in their own conditions,” Crawley said. “Unfortunately we haven’t performed quite at our best but it’s a great experience and hopefully – we’ll see how my career turns out – but if I’m back in four years’ time then this experience will be very beneficial.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/zak-crawley-england-ashes-cricket;sports
4294;4294;4294;13;4340;4340;‘We fought the good fight’: journalists in Hong Kong reel from assault on media;2022-01-11;['Vincent Ni'];['Hong Kong', 'China', 'Press freedom', 'Media', 'Newspapers', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'World news', 'Asia Pacific'];"As the last news programme came to a close and anchors bade farewell to their online audience on 3 January, Chris Yeung, the founder and chief writer of Citizen News, gathered together his staff and tried to strike an optimistic tone. “Remember our very best memories,” he said, dressed in a blue shirt with sleeves rolled up and a crimson jumper draped on his shoulders. “No one knows what will happen next. Don’t worry. Just remember the happy things.” It was the day 90 largely pro-establishment legislators were sworn in. The previous evening, the independent Chinese-language news outlet of five years said it was closing. It justified the decision citing a deteriorating media environment and concerns for the safety of its staff. It was a painful decision for Yeung and his editor-in-chief, Daisy Li, to make. “If I am no longer confident enough to guide and lead my reporters, I must be responsible,” Li said last week. “Can we work on some ‘safe news’? I don’t even know what is ‘safe news’.” She added: “What has changed is not us but the exterior, objective environment.” On 4 January, another outlet, Mad Dog Daily, followed suit and halted operations together with Citizen News.
The latest developments came as no surprise to those who follow recent events in Hong Kong’s once-freewheeling media industry. An exodus of journalists and editors from the territory’s much-acclaimed news outlets, such as Cable TV and its public broadcaster, RTHK, in the last couple of years have alarmed free speech campaigners in the city and beyond. Barely a week ago, another Chinese-language outlet, Stand News, was forced to close after 200 police officers raided its office and detained seven current and former employees. Two former senior editors were charged with conspiring to publish seditious materials and denied bail. The Stand News arrests came a day after Jimmy Lai, the former owner of the popular tabloid Apple Daily, and six of its former journalists, were given new charges of “conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications”. Last June, the newspaper was forced to close. State media in Beijing called the newspaper a “rotten apple that plagued Hong Kong for 20 years”. Amnesty International said it was “the blackest day for media freedom in Hong Kong’s recent history”. Across Asia, the erosion of press freedom has repeatedly made headlines in recent years. In Myanmar, dozens of journalists have been jailed since last year’s military coup. In Thailand, an emergency decree to ban news that “incites fear” was announced after anti-government protests in 2020. And in the Philippines, the country’s most profitable broadcaster, ABS-CBN, was forced to shut down that same year. These incidents are a poignant reminder that even the most successful news outlets could not survive the authoritarian resurgence in the region. In Hong Kong, once a bastion of free speech within China’s territory, the intensified move against independent news outlets began shortly after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law in the summer of 2020. The legislation drew fierce criticisms from western capitals, from Washington to London. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, however, said the closure of news organisations “cannot be directly connected” to press freedom in Hong Kong. She also rejected claims of a “chilling effect” in the city’s media landscape. The assaults on press freedom have continued since the Apple Daily saga. A few days after the tabloid folded, the city’s police chief, Raymond Siu, suggested that a “fake news” law would be necessary to tackle “hostility against the police”. His boss, Lam, announced a few weeks before that her administration was working on “fake news” legislation to tackle “misinformation, hatred and lies”.
“The authorities are just adding more weapons into their pocket in order to stifle dissent,” Yeung said after Siu’s speech in June. “It looks very likely that this proposal of ‘fake news’ law will be put on the agenda in the next legislative session.” In recent years, the Hong Kong Journalists Association, which Yeung used to lead, has raised the authorities’ ire. Last autumn, the city’s new security chief, Chris Tang, accused the organisation of “breaching professional ethics” by backing the idea that “everyone is a journalist”. In December, Tang gave his full backing to the introduction of a fake news law. The psychological impact on Hong Kong’s journalists, once regarded as muckraking by many, is evident. A November survey released by Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents Club found that 84% of people surveyed thought the situation had deteriorated since the introduction of the national security law. Some of the respondents admitted to a degree of self-censorship. Beijing accused the trade association of “sowing discord”. “We are very nervous here for the future of media freedom in Hong Kong,” said Jemimah Steinfeld, a China expert at the London-based Index on Censorship. “It’s hard to believe today that until only recently Hong Kong was the place that journalists at foreign media went to if they wanted to report more freely on China. It’s devastating.” For young and ambitious Hong Kong journalists, the devastation has been personal. When the police raided Apple Daily’s headquarters in 2020, one of its staff reporters was angry. “I at first was too stunned to even react,” the reporter, Oscar, said in a Guardian documentary that year. “Then that turned into anger as I watched the events unfold.”
Last June, when the nails had been hammered into the coffin of Apple Daily, he met a colleague at the subway platform to share their plans for the future. They greeted each other with a big hug and broke out in tears. “We have never done anything wrong. We have always been doing our part and working hard to make good news. Why did we end up this way?” he said. Now, at the age of 25, Oscar has put down his pen and works as a photographer in Hong Kong. He said he “grieved” when he left Apple Daily in June. “I [had studied journalism] in college for four years, worked for Apple Daily as part-timer then full-time [for] over four years. It was my dream and passion to be a great reporter, and I did work hard for it. But it turned out to be like this,” he said. The quick turn of events in his home city in recent years has saddened him. Months after mass street protests that began in 2019, the national security law came into force. The authorities claim such legislation is “necessary in order to secure the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong”, but critics say it is used to stifle dissent and is draconian. There have been waves of arrests of individuals, from journalists to politicians, who disagree with Beijing and the Hong Kong government. According to Reporters Without Borders, close to two dozen journalists and press freedom campaigners have been arrested since the implementation of the national security law in June 2020. Among them, at least a dozen have been charged or are awaiting the trial. Some opposition politicians, including Nathan Law, once the youngest lawmaker in the history of the legislative council of Hong Kong, are now living in exile.
For Oscar, his transition from a reporter to a photographer was a reluctant one. “This is not the decision I wanted to make, it is the times that forced me to stop being a reporter,” he said. “I still want to be a reporter from the bottom of my heart. I’m not afraid to sit in prison. But how about the people who work with me? Will they sit in, too, because of my work? How about my family and my girlfriend? They’d absolutely be heartbroken.” It is not only local Chinese-language news outlets that are feeling the chill. International news outlets such as the New York Times are already shifting their base to elsewhere in the region because, according to the US company, the national security law “unsettled news organisations and created uncertainty about the city’s prospects as a hub for journalism”. Senior officials are now sending letters to foreign news organisations, urging them to support the authorities’ actions. “If you are genuinely interested in press freedom, you should support actions against people who have unlawfully exploited the media as a tool to pursue their political or personal gains,” Hong Kong’s chief secretary, John Lee, wrote to the Wall Street Journal in a recent letter. “So far, western media still operates with a degree of protection but even this is eroding and many are now choosing Taiwan instead,” said Steinfeld. “The question is: to what extent will they be pushed out, or will they jump? Beijing has been killing the chickens to scare the monkeys, to quote the Chinese idiom, and it is really working.” At Citizen News, departing journalists have been pondering on their future in these uncertain times. On the eve of the closure, there were tears in the newsroom as well as well wishes. “We fought the good fight. We finished the course. We kept the faith,” one farewell card read.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/we-fought-the-good-fight-journalists-in-hong-kong-reel-from-assault-on-media;politics
4312;4312;4312;31;4359;4359;Football transfer rumours: Luka Modric set for Manchester City move?;2022-01-11;['Tom Davies'];['Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"With the Premier League title race already close to being a foregone conclusion, Manchester City could be considering a proper victory-lap signing to rub it all in: none other than 2018’s Luka Modric. With the Croatia midfielder yet to agree a new deal with Real Madrid for when his contract expires this summer, El Nacional reports that the 36-year-old is “tired of being underestimated” by the club’s modest and unassuming head honcho Florentino Pérez. And in the wings Pep Guardiola is reportedly prepared to welcome Modric with “open arms”. Liverpool may have suggested they’re not keen to splash out but it looks like they might have rustled up a few bob to wave in the direction of Seville for the defender Jules Koundé, Rumours are that the Reds are prepared to cough up and activate the £75m release clause for the French defender, who has won seven caps for his country. Liverpool may face competition from Chelsea and Real Madrid, who are also sniffing around the 23-year-old.
Talking of Chelsea, their defender Antonio Rüdiger is the subject of interest from PSG and Real Madrid. Madrid are thought to be Rüdiger’s preferred destination but the French league leaders are reportedly prepared to pay the Germany defender €7m after tax, so which will win out in this romantic tale? Today’s Newcastle rumour puts Bayer Leverkusen’s Patrik Schick on their radar as they step up that search for a striker, any striker, to solve their goalscoring problems. It would cost around £50m to spring the Czech Republic striker from the Bundesliga, but money’s not the main issue here. Also linked with the Toon is Steven Bergwijn, whose people are said to be sizing up loan options away from Tottenham, with Ajax also interested. On the subject of getting out of N17, Tanguy Ndombele not fancying it against Morecambe and being assailed by a cacophony of boos when substituted seems to have alerted a number of European suitors to his potential availability. PSG, Barcelona, Milan, Roma and Lyon have all been linked with the Tottenham midfielder. Going the other way could be Milan’s Franck Kessié, with Spurs apparently leading the hunt for the Ivory Coast midfielder. Meanwhile plucky, cash-strapped Barcelona continue to be linked with an inordinate range of targets, some likelier than others. There has been plenty of talk that Xavi Hernández is interested in snapping up Álvaro Morata from Atlético Madrid, though the Barça manager has waved it away as a mere “hypothesis”. Meanwhile, TNT Sports claims the former Chelsea playmaker Oscar, currently at Shanghai Port FC, is also a target for the Catalans.
In the WSL, Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema is subject of interest from PSG and all-conquering Barcelona, with the Dutch striker’s contract expiring in the summer, but Arsenal are keen to keep her and Miedema has suggested she’s open to staying. And that’s all the weather. Only 20 more days to churn through.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-luka-modric-set-for-manchester-city-move;sports
4315;4315;4315;34;4362;4362;Hottest ocean temperatures in history recorded last year;2022-01-11;['Oliver Milman'];['Oceans', 'Climate crisis', 'US news', 'Environment', 'World news'];"The world’s oceans have been set to simmer, and the heat is being cranked up. Last year saw the hottest ocean temperatures in recorded history, the sixth consecutive year that this record has been broken, according to new research. The heating up of our oceans is being primarily driven by the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say, and represents a starkly simple indicator of global heating. While the atmosphere’s temperature is also trending sharply upwards, individual years are less likely to be record-breakers compared with the warming of the oceans.
Last year saw a heat record for the top 2,000 meters of all oceans around the world, despite an ongoing La Niña event, a periodic climatic feature that cools waters in the Pacific. The 2021 record tops a stretch of modern record-keeping that goes back to 1955. The second hottest year for oceans was 2020, while the third hottest was 2019.
“The ocean heat content is relentlessly increasing, globally, and this is a primary indicator of human-induced climate change,” said Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and co-author of the research, published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. Warmer ocean waters are helping supercharge storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall, the paper states, which is escalating the risks of severe flooding. Heated ocean water expands and eats away at the vast Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are collectively shedding around 1tn tons of ice a year, with both of these processes fueling sea level rise. Oceans take up about a third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity, causing them to acidify. This degrades coral reefs, home to a quarter of the world’s marine life and the provider of food for more than 500m people, and can prove harmful to individual species of fish. As the world warms from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other activities, the oceans have taken the brunt of the extra heat. More than 90% of the heat generated over the past 50 years has been absorbed by the oceans, temporarily helping spare humanity, and other land-based species, from temperatures that would already be catastrophic. The amount of heat soaked up by the oceans is enormous. Last year, the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, where most of the warming occurs, absorbed 14 more zettajoules (a unit of electrical energy equal to one sextillion joules) than it did in 2020. This amount of extra energy is 145 times greater than the world’s entire electricity generation which, by comparison, is about half of a zettajoule. Long-term ocean warming is strongest in the Atlantic and Southern oceans, the new research states, although the north Pacific has had a “dramatic” increase in heat since 1990 and the Mediterranean Sea posted a clear high temperature record last year. The heating trend is so pronounced it’s clear to ascertain the fingerprint of human influence in just four years of records, according to John Abraham, another of the study’s co-authors. “Ocean heat content is one of the best indicators of climate change,” added Abraham, an expert in thermal sciences at University of St Thomas. “Until we reach net zero emissions, that heating will continue, and we’ll continue to break ocean heat content records, as we did this year,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University and another of the 23 researchers who worked on the paper. “Better awareness and understanding of the oceans are a basis for the actions to combat climate change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis;environment
4337;4337;4337;56;4385;4385;Never mind the nose: what makes Cyrano de Bergerac a hero for all time?;2022-01-11;['Michael Billington'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Jamie Lloyd', 'James McAvoy', 'Joe Wright', 'Film', 'Derek Jacobi', 'Antony Sher', 'Steve Martin'];"Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac is never far away. In February Martin Crimp’s radical adaptation, starring James McAvoy, returns to London, then tours to Glasgow and New York. Then follows the release of Joe Wright’s new movie, with Peter Dinklage in the lead. Although in both cases the actors eschew prosthetic adornments, you could say that the noses generally have it since Rostand’s “comédie héroïque” has been in regular revival since its 1897 premiere. I’ve seen close to a dozen productions over the past half-century and it’s been the source of multiple movies, at least three musicals and an opera. There was also in 2015 a gender-swapped version known as CyranA. So why does it endure? At its premiere, it was seen as a revolt against the prevailing naturalist drama. As Graham Robb has pointed out, it also had a topical resonance, coming at the time of the Dreyfus affair (the scandal in which army captain Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of treason): “the soft-hearted slasher was everybody’s hero – a man with alien features who suffered for his virtues but represented the society Dreyfus was supposed to have betrayed”. But there are other reasons for its continued popularity: it has a glorious theatricality, glittering poetry and boasts a big star part that has attracted actors as various as Ralph Richardson, Derek Jacobi and Antony Sher on stage and José Ferrer, Steve Martin and Gérard Depardieu on screen.
But I suspect there are deeper reasons for its survival. Since Cyrano lends his poetic genius to a dim-witted rival allowing him to woo the woman Cyrano himself loves, it is one of the great dramas of heroic self-sacrifice. It is a theme that never loses its popularity: contemporary with Cyrano was Sir John Martin-Harvey’s The Only Way, based on Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities. Henry James pointed out in 1901, discussing Rostand in The Scenic Art, that the novel “lives its hour mainly under favour of the romantic prejudice”. But while being shamelessly romantic, Rostand’s play is also a study of a fiercely independent spirit. Rostand’s Cyrano hates hypocrisy, defies authority and when he says – in Anthony Burgess’s translation – “You’ve no idea how bracing it is to go marching upright against a volley of venom”, I am reminded of Alceste in Molière’s The Misanthrope in his self-lacerating honesty. Mention of Burgess raises the eternal question of how to render Rostand’s poetry. Seeing the play in French in 1898, Max Beerbohm wrote that “to translate it into English were a terrible imposition to set any one” and even Henry James, who admired Rostand, wrote of “his merciless virtuosity of expression”. I’ve come across versions by Brian Hooker, Patrick Garland and Christopher Fry but Burgess’s, with its eclectic mix of rhyme, rhetoric and quasi-Joycean puns, finds a way to match Rostand’s virtuosity while Crimp clearly demonstrates that the play is also about the dangerous lure of language.
In the introduction to his translation, Burgess makes the pragmatic point that a play’s first duty is “to feed the actors” and I’m struck by how various are the Cyranos I have seen. Edward Woodward, who played it for the National in 1970, offered us a moody introvert but one a little lacking in panache. By contrast Robert Lindsay, who donned the nose in a West End production in 1992, was all vigorous swash and buckle, putting one in mind of the screen heroics of Douglas Fairbanks. But, alongside McAvoy who offers a fierce, proud, free-thinking Cyrano in black leather, the two performances I remember best come from different RSC productions. Derek Jacobi played the role, with Sinéad Cusack as Roxane and Pete Postlethwaite as a versifying pastry cook, in Terry Hands’s 1983 production and it remains one of his finest hours. Jacobi had the right swagger and impetuosity but there was also a sweet-souled sadness to his performance. Asked if he had ever read Don Quixote, Jacobi replied “Read it? I’ve practically lived it” and there was something about his falling inflection that suggested a whole world of spiritual desolation.
Antony Sher was Cyrano in Gregory Doran’s 1997 production and brought something entirely different to the part. Sher specialised in playing solitary outsiders and his Cyrano was a small, faintly bookish man who was aware of his own absurdity and who even donned specs to pen a love-letter to Roxane: a tiny touch echoed by Mark Rylance in Jerusalem when he too put on glasses as if to belie his character’s alleged wildness. Oscar Wilde said there are as many Hamlets as there are actors and much the same is true of Cyrano. But Jamie Lloyd, director of the current revival, hit a nerve when he said “the reason the play has endured is that we all have an insecurity, something we’re battling with”. Different actors may put more or less stress on Cyrano’s swordsmanship and showmanship but underneath this is a play about self-sacrifice and solitude, which is, perhaps, the real reason it has lasted for well over a century and in many different cultures. Jamie Lloyd’s production of Cyrano de Bergerac is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, 3 February-12 March; the Theatre Royal Glasgow, 18-26 March; and at Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, 5 April-22 May";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/11/never-mind-the-nose-what-makes-cyrano-de-bergerac-a-hero-for-all-time;entertainment and culture

The normally pro-Boris Johnson Express blasts a full-throated warning in its splash headline: “Enough Boris! You MUST end ‘partygate’ farce now”, it says, reflecting backbench Tory exasperation at the drip-drip of damaging reports about partying No 10 staffers.
The Mail takes a similar line and says “Boris rocked by new party revelations”, ramming home the iniquity being felt by people throughout Britain with a subhead that reads: “Email proves key aide invited 100 Downing Street staff to party with PM – while public could only meet one person outdoors”.
Others are more scathing with the i picking up on a particularly galling line from the leaked email invitation to the gathering on 20 May. “‘Bring your own booze’”.
The same line is used by the Guardian as well with its lead story “Fury as email reveals No 10 ‘bring your own booze’ lockdown party”.
The Mirror describes the email as “Invite to do what you like”, while the Metro goes with a play on words – “Downing it Street” – alongside a picture of Johnson quaffing a pint of beer.
The coverage contrasts with that of the Times and Telegraph, neither of which choose to lead with the party revelations. The Times does have the story on its front page – “No10 celebrated ‘lovely weather’ with lockdown drinks party” – but leads on limits to sporting fixtures being eased.
Ditto the Telegraph, which says “Johnson received invite to lockdown party” but leads on cabinet anger over misleading isolation guidance.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/11/bring-your-own-booze-newspapers-lash-pm-over-latest-downing-street-party-claim;politics

If you’re keen to read today’s news as it breaks, you have come to the wrong place. The right place is our live blog.
If you are daunted by the prospect of a whole five reads and would just like some immediate, animal themed diversion, then please enjoy this story about medieval warhorses, which far from the dinner-plate hoofed monsters of legend were in fact the size of present-day ponies. Cute. Now on to the reads. 1. The heartbreaking, bankrupting rise of romance scams Though nothing new, romance scams have increased, and become increasingly sophisticated, during the pandemic. Here, victims and experts share how cybercriminals prey on our deepest vulnerabilities.
Notable quote: “Romance fraud is just a more extreme version of something that lots of us have experienced,” says trauma therapist Olivia James. “Many of us have wounds around our age, appearance and past relationships that make us susceptible to someone promising love. It’s tempting to ignore doubts and see what we want to see.” This is a British story though. Is this happening here? Very much so, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Australians lost $131m to romance scams in 2020, making them second only to investment scams in terms of monetary losses. How long will it take me to read? About five minutes. I’m sad now. Have a palate cleanser: the story of how Carl and Lynda met, it’s an online romance gone right. 2. Could Russia really invade and occupy Ukraine? If you haven’t been following the developments between Russia and Ukraine closely, defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh’s explainer on what could happen, and what is most likely, is a helpful primer. What would a full-scale occupation look like? “A war on a scale not seen since Iraq in 2003,” writes Sabbagh. Is that … likely? It could happen, but experts describe it as “the least likely” military scenario. How long will it take to read this piece? About three minutes. 3. How Broadway is living with Omicron “New York theatre is not closed,” writes David Smith, “but it is not wholly open either, and cast lists on any given night can be something of a lottery.”
What kind of lottery? Well, lets say you paid $699 to see Hugh Jackman in The Music Man, and then he tests positive for Covid-19, and you get an understudy instead. Must the show go on? Not always, several productions have temporally closed their shows. But Kevin McCollum, of Rent and Avenue Q fame, who is currently the producer of Mrs Doubtfire, remains optimistic. “We are an industry that is used to being at constant risk,” he says. “Those of us who toil in the theatre have maybe a chip missing: we are resilient against all odds. So it’s painful but that’s no reason not to get up and try again.” How long will it take me to read? Three minutes 4. An unlikely collision at a detention hotel Reporting from the ground at the front of the Park Hotel, Cait Kelly talks to the refugee advocates and Djokovic supporters standing side by side.
Notable quote: “I feel so ignorant,” one Djokovic supporter said as she was leaving on Thursday. “I came here for him and found out they’ve been locked up nine years. It’s so wrong.” How long will it take me to read? Two minutes. 5. A five-ingredient pasta recipe Sure it’s designed to give comfort in the depths of European winter, but Rachel Roddy’s shepherd style ricotta, pecorino and guanciale pasta will hit the spot in Australian summer too. How long will it take me to cook? 20 minutes or so – you can do most of the prep while the pasta water is heating up – making it a perfect midweek dinner.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/five-great-reads-romance-scams-omicron-on-broadway-and-a-20-minute-pasta-recipe;entertainment and culture
4370;4370;4370;89;4419;4419;‘Daughter, give us strength to fight’: family mourns teenager killed by LAPD;2022-01-10;['Sam Levin'];['Los Angeles', 'US policing', 'US news'];"The Rev Al Sharpton delivered a eulogy on Monday for Valentina Orellana-Peralta, the 14-year-old girl killed by a Los Angeles police officer, denouncing LAPD’s longstanding abuses, as her family remembered a bright young girl who excelled in school and had big dreams for her life in the US. “There is nothing normal about shooting so recklessly that a young teenage girl looking to live the American dream, shopping with her dear mother … for a Christmas dress, ends up being dressed for her funeral,” Sharpton said in his eulogy, recounting his marches in LA and fight for justice 31 years ago when the LAPD beat Rodney King. “I led marches and joined in all kinds of efforts to call on the prosecution of those police, and calling on the Los Angeles police department to reform how they do policing … Through those 31 years, we keep seeing LAPD get it wrong. Here we are again. How long will it take for you to get it right?”
Valentina’s parents cried over their daughter’s open casket at the City of Refuge church in Gardena, south of LA, as Sharpton and the family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, stood by their side. The teenager was dressed in a pink dress, her favorite color, and the funeral programs featured a skateboard on the cover, celebrating one of her treasured hobbies. Valentina was shopping for a Christmas dress with her mother on 23 December at a Burlington Coat Factory in North Hollywood when the LAPD officer William Dorsey Jones Jr fired three rounds at a 24-year-old man in the store, killing him and Valentina in the process. When Valentina was shot, she was in a nearby dressing room with her mother, Soledad Peralta, and died in her mother’s arms. “There was nothing I could do. As I lay screaming for help, the police did not come to help me or my daughter,” she said, days after the killing. Footage of the events at the store showed that the 24-year-old, Daniel Elena Lopez, had assaulted several customers with a bike lock. Jones’s body-camera footage revealed that the officer shot Elena Lopez from a distance, appearing to immediately fire three rounds before issuing any commands. Elena Lopez was standing alone at the other end of a store aisle, had no gun and appeared to be turning away from the officer the moment he was shot. He and Valentina both died on the scene.
Valentina moved to the US from her native Chile six months ago, and her parents said she was excelling at her school, High Tech Los Angeles in Van Nuys, despite English being her second language. She had ambitions for a career in engineering and technology and was interested in building robots, telling her mother that one day she would build a robot to help her around the house. Her parents said her primary dream was to become a US citizen. “It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,” Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, Valentina’s father, told reporters at a recent press conference. He arrived from Chile days after his daughter was killed, and at a news conference held in his hand a skateboard, still in its plastic wrapping, that had arrived for Valentina on Christmas Eve, the day after she died. He said he would deliver the skateboard to her grave and lamented that the two of them would never get to see LeBron James play basketball in person. The Chilean president, Gabriel Boric, has called for justice for Valentina’s family, and Joe Biden has offered condolences. Soledad Peralta struggled to speak at the funeral, but said she would continue to carry on her daughter’s “mission of peace and love”. One of Valentina’s cousins stood by her aunt’s side at the podium, saying: “All of [Valentina’s] dreams consisted of applying herself and helping others. In only 14 years, Valentina was making all of the people who loved her proud. This is what we will remember when we think of Valentina and we will imagine more of her triumphs. I know that we would all be amazed how many of those big dreams would come true for Valentina.” Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas lamented that his daughter was killed in a country that she loved, where she dreamed of going to college: “She always told us this country was the safest country in the world. Unfortunately, she was mistaken. She only came to this country to face her death,” he said, in Spanish. “This pain and suffering of not having her by our side, we will never overcome it. Daughter of mine, we love you forever. Give us strength to continue this fight. We know we will win. Daughter, fly high, take care of us, forever.”
Sharpton, who has given eulogies for high-profile victims of police killings across the US, questioned why the LAPD officer fired his weapon so quickly, shooting “like it was the wild, wild west”.“It puzzles me how you can take hostage situations and de-escalate it, but you can’t [respond to] one man in a department store without recklessly shooting everybody”, he said. Sharpton called for the officer to be held accountable, noting that it did not matter to him that Jones was Black: “I don’t feel better if I’m shot by a Black cop. I want to deal with the question of how we have policing in this country … We’re not looking to be abused by anyone under any circumstances. It is important we stay on this and we do not leave this family out here by themselves.” Crump compared the killing to the murder of George Floyd, whose family he also represented and told Valentina’s parents that they would not allow LAPD to “justify the unjustifiable actions that caused your 14-year-old angel to spill her innocent blood”. The killing of a young bystander has prompted widespread scrutiny of the LAPD, which shot a total of six people in a nine-day period last month, contributing to a sharp increase in officer shootings and killings in 2021.
LA’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, has said the LAPD will review its tactics, training and policies in the wake of the killing. But the case has renewed calls for the defunding of the department, with critics arguing that ongoing reform efforts have failed to prevent police violence, and that officers must face accountability for misconduct and unjust killings. The LAPD has declined to answer specific questions about the shooting, which remains under investigation, but has said the officer was unaware there were people in the dressing room when he opened fire. The officer’s representatives have said he was following his training for “active shooter” cases, since some 911 callers had mistakenly stated Elena Lopez had a gun, which turned out to be wrong. But at least one 911 caller in the store told dispatchers he did not have a gun, according to audio released by the department. Rahul Ravipudi, another attorney representing the family, spoke at the funeral, lamenting that “Valentina’s life was needlessly taken away with an AR-15 assault rifle by the very people who were charged with protecting her”, adding, “with Valentina’s spirit guiding us, we will expose the truth, hold accountable those responsible for her death and implement changes that will allow all Americans, all immigrants, and everyone to feel that same American dream, the one where we’re raising children in a place where we feel safe and protected.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/reverend-al-sharpton-eulogy-funeral-valentina-orellana-peralta-shot-lapd;politics
4377;4377;4377;96;4427;4427;NHS England had no choice but turn to private hospitals during Covid surge;2022-01-10;['Denis Campbell'];['NHS', 'Health policy', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news'];"Another day, another initiative to stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed by a combination of the Omicron surge and normal winter pressures. NHS England has struck a deal with private healthcare providers under which their hospitals will be ready to start treating NHS patients who cannot get the Covid or non-Covid care they need because their local NHS hospital is under too much pressure. This follows the recent news that “mini-Nightingale” field hospitals are being built in the grounds of eight hospitals, that gyms and education centres in hospitals could be turned into overflow wards, and that thousands of Covid patients could be treated at home in “virtual wards”. Any or all of this could happen if the increase in Covid hospitalisations leads to a hospital trust or even entire region of the NHS deciding it needs “surge capacity”.
Announcing the latest tie-up with the private sector on Monday, NHS England’s chief operating officer, Sir David Sloman, who is also the service’s Covid incident director, said: “This deal … means as many people as possible can continue to get the care they need. “It also places independent health providers on standby to provide further help should hospitals face unsustainable levels of hospitalisations or staff absences. Just like the Nightingale hubs being created across the country, we hope never to need their support. But it will be there if needed.” Sloman said the the new arrangement was “struck under direction from the secretary of state”. It is easy to see why Sajid Javid would look to private hospitals to ease the NHS’s burden. First, the waiting list for non-urgent hospital care in England is already at a record 5.83m and may break through the 6m barrier when the latest monthly performance figures come out on Thursday. Downing Street is open about the fact that getting that number down is a key priority. Second, the number of hospitals that have been forced to cancel elective surgery in the face of intense pressure will increase the headline total when the same statistics come out next month. Third, however one feels about privatisation of NHS care, it is unarguable that people who needed urgent surgery during the pandemic, for a range of serious conditions but especially for cancer, have been able to undergo a procedure in a private hospital that they would otherwise have had to wait an indeterminate length of time to receive on the NHS, because the pandemic disrupted so many non-Covid services, especially in the first wave. The health impact of that is still emerging.
Will any part of the NHS need to in effect commandeer their local private hospital(s)? The deal is “another NHS insurance policy”, one health service boss says. The fact that at least 24 trusts in England have had to declare a major alert since New Year’s Day, because they could not cope with the level of demand they were facing, especially with so many staff off sick because of Omicron, suggests the arrangement may have to be triggered, especially with Covid admissions rising in many regions – up 7% in 24 hours on Monday in both the north-west and south-west, for example. But David Rowland, director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank, cautioned that private hospitals’ reliance on NHS consultants means the plan “really doesn’t stack up as a way of adding capacity to the NHS”. He also asked whether private hospitals would be paid just the NHS “tariff” rate for any treatment they do provide – the fee they receive when performing a hip or knee replacement on an NHS patient – or whether the health service’s almost desperate need for extra capacity means they will receive a markup as part of the deal. NHS England said only that details about the pricing of the arrangements would follow in the next few days. The deal confirms that the sheer scale of the healthcare backlog means the NHS will be looking to private hospitals to undertake as many operations as they can for the foreseeable future. NHS England was budgeting to spend £10bn on them for that purpose over the next four years even before Javid ordered this tie-up. A report by the Commons health select committee last week said the private sector would play a key role in the NHS’s efforts to tackle the backlog and that reality was central to NHS England’s finished but still unpublished “elective recovery plan”. The many people offended by NHS billions being handed to private hospital groups will balk at what is likely to be a long-term marriage of convenience. But a decade of successive governments’ underfunding, and ignoring or exacerbating its staff shortages, has left the NHS with no choice.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/nhs-england-left-with-no-choice-but-turn-to-private-hospitals;health
4382;4382;4382;101;4433;4433;Michael Lang obituary;2022-01-10;['Adam Sweeting'];['Woodstock', 'Pop and rock', 'Music', 'US news', 'New York', 'Film', 'The Rolling Stones'];"When the Woodstock Music and Art Fair was held in upstate New York in August 1969, it was billed as “Three days of peace, love and music”, though nobody could have predicted that it would attract half a million people and become an enduring monument to the 1960s counterculture. Starring the Who, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and many more, Woodstock gave birth to the “Woodstock Nation”, an escapist alternative to the assassinations, racial conflict and Vietnam war casting shadows over the US. One of the key organisers of the festival was Michael Lang, who has died aged 77 of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. “Woodstock came at a really dark moment in America,” said Lang in a 2009 Rolling Stone interview. “An unpopular war, a government that was unresponsive, lots of human rights issues – things were starting to edge toward violence for people to make their points. And along came Woodstock, which was this moment of hope.” Not everyone agreed – the music writer David Dalton decried Woodstock as “an exercise in consummate narcissism” and “a hippy Disneyland” – but the festival’s significance as a benchmark of its era and a template for festivals to come lives on.
Lang had been promoting concerts in Florida and in 1968 had produced the Miami pop festival, featuring Hendrix and Frank Zappa, before he relocated to Woodstock in early 1969. Woodstock had its own community of musicians that included Van Morrison and Richie Havens, and Lang frequently attended the low-key performances by the local artists known as “Saturday soundouts”. Lang became manager of a band called Train, and approached the Capitol Records executive Artie Kornfeld to try to get them a deal. Kornfeld did not bite, but the pair began throwing ideas around, including a proposal to build a recording studio in the town of Woodstock. They approached the entrepreneurs John Roberts and Joel Rosenman – who had advertised themselves in the Wall Street Journal as “Young Men with Unlimited Capital Looking for Interesting and Legitimate Business Ideas” – to participate in the project, but Roberts and Rosenman were more interested in Lang and Kornfeld’s other idea of a Woodstock music festival, whose profits would fund the studio.
The foursome created Woodstock Ventures Inc, which would produce the event. However, the Woodstock authorities would not allow it in their town, and the burghers of nearby Wallkill were also loath to be swamped by the hippytide. A deal was then struck to rent Max Yasgur’s 600-acre dairy farm near Bethel for $75,000. Nobody was prepared for the unprecedented invasion of music fans and the local police’s failure to make any arrangements for traffic management created a logjam of abandoned vehicles blocking local highways for miles. Lang, who commissioned the Woodstock logo of a peace dove sitting on the neck of a guitar, said: “Our vision was to create a very positive, a very sort of comforting environment for the audience, not to present confrontation in any way.” He had devised a “Please Force” of unarmed officers to control security, but as the crowds expanded uncontrollably the army and the national guard had to fly in emergency water, food and medical supplies by helicopter. Lang and his partners had anticipated an attendance of about 200,000, a manageable number that would have guaranteed them a profit, but as attendees trampled over fences and swarmed on to the site, they abandoned the attempt to sell tickets. The loss of ticket revenue left Lang and his fellow organisers millions of dollars out of pocket, but they were subsequently rescued when Michael Wadleigh’s film of the festival (in which Lang appeared prominently) became a lucrative smash hit the following year, grossing $50m in the US. The live albums from the festival also sold strongly. The event was memorialised in the song Woodstock by Joni Mitchell (who did not perform there), and in May 1970 it reached number 11 on the US chart in a storming rendition by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (who did). Lang was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. His father ran a construction and heating installation company, for which his mother was the bookkeeper. Michael attended New York University to study business and psychology, but dropped out in 1967 and moved to Coconut Grove in Miami, where he opened a “headshop” selling drug paraphernalia.
After Woodstock, he became the manager of Joe Cocker, one of the festival’s featured artists, and their partnership lasted more than 20 years. He was also recruited at short notice to assist with relocating the Rolling Stones’ December 1969 free concert in California from Sears Point Raceway to the Altamont Speedway. The event is now regarded as the tragic anti-Woodstock because of the killing of the audience member Meredith Hunter during the Stones’ performance. Lang considered it “a missed opportunity and the result of a lack of planning … what could have been a great day of music degenerated into a horror show”. During the 70s Lang ran his own Just Sunshine Records label, releasing discs by artists including Karen Dalton, Mississippi Fred McDowell and Betty Davis (the former wife of Miles Davis), and in the 80s managed Rickie Lee Jones. However, he remained dedicated to sustaining the legacy of Woodstock, devoting much energy to staging anniversary editions and at one point proposing an annual Woodstock festival at different sites around the world. For its 25th anniversary, Lang co-produced Woodstock ’94 in Saugerties, New York, some 70 miles from the 1969 site. Artists included veterans of the original lineup, such as Crosby, Stills and Nash and Country Joe McDonald, alongside newer names including Nine Inch Nails and Green Day. As a venue for Woodstock ’99, Lang found a former air force base in Rome, New York, to which 400,000 fans flocked in July that year. However, the event was scarred by violence, looting, sexual assaults and over-priced food, while extreme temperatures and insufficient free water caused widespread distress. Disgusted punters referred to the event as “Greedstock”.
In 2009 his memoir The Road to Woodstock (co-written with Holly George-Warren) was published, and also that year Lang was portrayed by Jonathan Groff in Ang Lee’s film Taking Woodstock. In 2019 he appeared in the two documentaries Woodstock: 3 Days That Changed Everything and Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation. Lang battled hard to mount a 50th anniversary Woodstock festival in 2019, with the Watkins Glen race track in upstate New York the first proposed venue and funding to be supplied by the multinational media company Dentsu Aegis Network (now Dentsu International). However, Woodstock 50 was plagued by delays and cancellations (and was relocated to Maryland), with grandiose plans to present such icons as Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and a reunited Led Zeppelin all turning to dust. The project collapsed in lawsuits and acrimony, but Lang was unbowed. “What we did in 1969 was in 1969 and that’s what has endured and will continue to endure. We’re not going away,” he told Rolling Stone. His first marriage, to Ann, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Tamara, their daughters, LariAnn, Shala and Molly, and sons, Laszlo and Harry. • Michael Lang, music business entrepreneur and producer, born 11 December 1944; died 8 January 2022";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/10/michael-lang-obituary;entertainment and culture
4400;4400;4400;119;4451;4451;Global financial markets hit by fears of US interest rate rise;2022-01-10;['Richard Partington'];['Stock markets', 'Business', 'Interest rates', 'Economics', 'Economic policy'];Global financial markets tumbled on Monday amid growing investor concerns about the US Federal Reserve potentially putting up interest rates in response to surging inflationary pressures. Share prices fell back on both sides of the Atlantic with the FTSE 100 shedding 40 points, or 0.5%, in London, to finish the day at 7,445, while stocks fell by a more substantial margin on Wall Street as traders bet on the American central bank leaping into action from as early as March to tackle high inflation rates. On a day of selling pressure around the world, the Nasdaq index slumped into correction territory, defined by financial investors as a drop of more than 10% from a previous peak, amid a sell-off in US tech stocks from an all-time high reached in November. Housebuilders were among the biggest fallers in London after the UK government announced a £4bn package forcing developers to help remove dangerous cladding from buildings in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017. Shares in Persimmon and Barratt fell by about 5%, while Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley dropped 3.5%. The gyrations come as financial markets worldwide adjust to the prospect of central banks ramping up interest rates in response to soaring cost of living, despite weaker levels of economic growth at the outset of 2022 after the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.5% on Monday afternoon in New York, while markets in France and Germany finished the day down more than 1% amid heightened investor caution worldwide. US government bond yields hit a two-year high as investors bet the Fed could raise rates from as early as March, in a jittery trading session ahead of official US inflation data due on Wednesday. US inflation surged to 6.8% in November, the highest level since 1982. Minutes released late last week from the latest Fed meeting in December showed officials considered whether interest rates needed to rise “sooner or at a faster pace” in response. Inflation in the UK reached 5.1% in November and is expected to peak close to 6% this spring, driven by an expected sharp increase in household energy bills this April amid soaring wholesale prices. Despite weaker UK growth in recent months amid supply chain disruption and rising coronavirus infections, the Bank of England is expected to steadily raise interest rates from the current level of 0.25% to more than 1% this year as the central bank seeks to quell inflation. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: “Investors seem, for the moment, to have entirely lost their appetite for stocks.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/global-financial-markets-hit-by-potential-us-interest-rate-rise-concerns;business and economy
4405;4405;4405;124;4456;4456;Liberty at last as Levante end 273-day wait to win a game in La Liga | Sid Lowe;2022-01-10;['Sid Lowe'];['Levante', 'La Liga', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Something amazing happened on Saturday: Levante Unión Deportiva won a game of football. “How lovely! I’m very emotional. How lovely it is to win, to feel this again,” their captain, “commander” José Luis Morales, said when the longest wait ever was at last over, a little hope let in at 3.54pm on 8 January 2022. They hadn’t experienced this since 10 April 2021, eight weeks from the end of last season. They hadn’t experienced this at all. That day, Levante defeated Eibar 1-0. Since then, nine months and 27 matches passed, every team in primera: they didn’t beat any of them. Twenty weeks into the season, 273 days later, this weekend at last they did. Officially the worst team in La Liga history – Sporting Gijón’s 24-game winless run from 1998 was surpassed a month ago – on Saturday afternoon Levante defeated Real Mallorca 2-0. “No, it’s not the Champions League, but it’s a first,” their coach said. It might still prove to be nothing, relegation a reality, only this moment will always be something. “The best gift The Three Kings could bring,” Morales called it, having recovered from Covid and come on to clinch victory.
If it had to happen sometime and it probably had to happen like this. At the end of a week in which furious fans waited for the bus, whistling them home from a 5-0 hammering in Villarreal; in which the manager, their third this season, admitted “I don’t know if we’ve hit rock bottom” but it felt like it, and the president said he would willingly walk, pleading with everyone not to “self-destruct”. At the end of a game where they were somehow still standing, their goalkeeper saving a penalty and their opponents having two goals disallowed, but still not safe until the very last kick which must become come the first. Asked to sum it up, Soldado said: “Relief. Suffering. Need.” Soldado had scored the opener just after half time, his first for the club he joined for €500,000. Roger Martí had then hit the bar. But Mallorca had pushed Levante back. Brian Oliván saw a penalty saved by Aitor Fernández, aided by a spot of what Morales called kirikocho or jinxing from afar. Fer Niño then had a goal ruled out for a handball spotted by the VAR and Takeshi Kubo had one taken away when he was ruled offside straight from a short corner. Now, Aitor said, Levante were “all hanging from the goal posts,” desperately holding on. Until at last they could let go. The clock said 95.47 when Mallorca got a last corner, goalkeeper Leo Román up, only for Levante’s centre-back Róber Pier to clear it up the line, past another ball on the pitch, for Roger. Way over on the other wing, Levante’s subs and staff were on their feet waving frantically. Some pleaded for the whistle, others for Roger to run. Up the wing, anywhere, just out of there. The camera on them, poetry in pictures, they soon changed their minds: Roger had seen Morales sprinting alongside. With the clock on 96.35, he scored, all those months and all those defeats falling away as he pulled at the badge on his shirt.
Liberated, the rest set off down the touchline to join him. They were everywhere, impossible to keep count of them all, something almost biblical about the sudden, surreal glimpse of Shkodran Mustafi’s crutches raised somewhere in the stampede. This was the resurrection and in the corner they were roaring, the pile of people growing, fans tumbling down the terrace. Everywhere there were embraces, screams. Duarte lifted Morales like a trophy. Jorge Miramón was in tears. They had actually done it. A boy in the stands fell exhausted into his dad’s arms. Standing alone on the touchline, Mallorca manager Luis García silently waited for the Levante coach to return from the corner to shake his hand and congratulate him. His name is Alessio Lisci and he had done what more experienced and supposedly more qualified men could not, the first coach to win with Levante this season. He is younger than the man who had just scored the winner and looks it too. Born in Rome in late 1985, Lisci never played beyond the seventh tier in Italy and began coaching early. One day, he wrote to every club in Spain. Three replied: one fell through; Atlético Madrid offered him a job coaching seven-a-side; and Levante invited him over to work in the academy. That was over ten years ago. Now, at 36, he is the youngest coach in La Liga. The 10th Italian to manage here, on some list with Sacchi, Capello, Ancelotti and the rest, his experience was a little different. At youth level, coaching is not well paid so Lisci worked as salesman for an Italian food importer, visiting restaurants in the providing parmesan, pasta and tomato. “That helps,” he says, “because when hard times come, you know you have been through harder ones.” He briefly departed when the coach he worked under with the Juvenil A (U19s) was sacked but was called back, able to continue thanks to the Leonardo Da Vinci programme. Nicknamed the Conte of Buñol, Lisci is methodical, open, ambitious, dedicated to the point of admitting it damages your personal life. He coached the Alevin D (U12), Infantil E (U13), Infantil C (U14), Cadete B (U16), Juvenil B (U18), and was been assistant coach in the Juvenil A (U19). In December 2020, he was given the B team. A year later, he was announced as first team coach. Unable to afford anyone else, Levante knew there were few other options but also that they could trust him; he knew that if an opportunity ever presented itself, it would be because things were bad but that there was something there somewhere. Paco López had taken charge of more games than anyone in the club’s history, he was Levante, yet was sacked after picking up four points in eight games. Javier Pereira left having picked up three in seven, the entire sporting directorate sacked with him: Manolo Salvador, David Navarro and Manu Farjado. Lisci came with good will – he is one of them, a club man in the middle of the crowd talking to angry fans last Monday – but on an impossible mission, or so it goes.
His first game was a 0-0 draw with Osasuna. That was followed by three losses in which they conceded 18 goals but on Saturday there he was, leading his players into a celebratory circle, a win finally secured nine months later, fans chanting: “Yes, we can!” “Thanks for your patience, thanks for your support, sorry for the delay,” Lisci tweeted. “This is a day we deserved,” Morales said. As he ducked into the tunnel, Levante’s captain recorded a message, thanking the fans: “With you, we can do it,” he shouted. “Come on! Shit on the mother!” After the goal Lisci had embraced him, then stepped back to point at him. Asked afterwards what his manager had said, Morales replied: “That we’re going to get out of this.” He has done it before. Last season, Lisci took over and lifted the B team to salvation. “And that was harder: that team was sunk,” he said. “What I went through last year helps a lot this year”. There is a plan too, he told Cadena Ser: forget every game is a final, it’s about short and mid-term targets, achievable objectives.
Levante remain bottom, three points off Cádiz, five behind Elche, six behind Alavés and safety. Getafe are seven in front, Mallorca nine. Lisci knows his defence is a mess, that his best players are two or three years past their best, that there is no money and that relegation remains likely. But least it’s not a certainty any more. After Villarreal, Lisci insisted “this is not our league”, but this is: Mallorca was the first of a three-game relegation run followed by Cádiz and Getafe, and they won. That, he insists, changes everything, bringing hope, unity, a shared cause. “This has to be the start of something,” Aitor said. “It’s very hard: the players suffer it a lot, there’s tension, the team doesn’t let go,” Lisci admitted after Levante’s first La Liga win in 28 and his first ever. “But weeks ago, I said the first would come like this, with suffering. You’re not going to end the run with a 3-0. This is how I dreamed it and it’s good to win this way because there will be more games like this. Things change now. In the dressing room the players had another face, other thoughts. You can say I’m mad but this has cleared our minds. It’s hard but you can do it.” Ten months later, longer than any other club had ever taken, Levante finally did. Now they just have to do it all over again.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/liberty-at-last-as-levante-end-273-day-wait-to-win-a-game-in-la-liga;sports
4444;4444;4444;163;4495;4495;Roma 3-4 Juve: a magical melodrama with more twists than a HBO series | Nicky Bandini;2022-01-10;['Nicky Bandini'];['Serie A', 'Roma', 'Juventus', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Every now and then, a football match comes along that defies explanation. “Was Roma-Juve a comeback or a collapse?” asked the front-page of Monday’s Corriere dello Sport, but those options seemed too narrow. This game was a melodrama, a saga, a whole HBO series worth of narratives crammed into 90 minutes, complete with celebrity cameos and premature farewells to your favourite characters. Juventus won 4-3, and that was improbable enough. The Bianconeri had been the lowest-scoring team in the top half of the table, with 28 goals to show for their first 20 matches. Roma had conceded only eight all season at the Stadio Olimpico.
They did so three times in seven second-half minutes on Sunday, throwing away a 3-1 lead after already having surrendered a 1-0 advantage at the start. The last goal was scored by Mattia De Sciglio, a 29-year-old full-back who had found the net just once before in his professional career – and that half a decade before. That was not the final plot twist in a game that featured a red card, a penalty, game-changing substitutions, crucial VAR interventions and an injury that could spell longer-term disaster for Juventus but also Italy’s World Cup qualifying bid. All this with Francesco Totti making a rare appearance in the stands. Perhaps, though, we ought to start at the beginning. Before kick-off we knew that this could be a defining game in both teams’ seasons. Roma, seventh in the table, had a chance to pull level with fifth-placed Juventus. But the Bianconeri needed a win to stay within touching distance of Atalanta ahead of them. Expectations were low for Roma after a disappointing performance against a depleted Milan on Thursday. They had lost 3-1 to opponents missing their first-choice central midfield pairing as well as three-quarters of a starting defence. But José Mourinho changed up his tactics, swapping away from the three-man defence he used at San Siro to mirror Juventus in a 4-2-3-1. He named Ainsley Maitland-Niles as his right-back, just two days after the player arrived on loan from Arsenal. Bryan Cristante was drafted into midfield and academy graduate Felix Afena-Gyan given a start on the left wing.
Individually, those players did not all sparkle. Juventus’s first goal arrived when Federico Chiesa forced Maitland-Niles on to his heels with a powerful run down the left, before serving Paulo Dybala in the middle. Cristante should have been tracking the Argentinian but was caught ball-watching. Dybala had all the time he needed to pick out the bottom corner. Roma’s change in shape, however, was effective. Juventus’s manager, Massimiliano Allegri, was serving a suspension but his sideline surrogate, Marco Landucci, confessed that the switch caught them off guard. Cristante and Jordan Veretout held the middle of the pitch, starving their Juventus counterparts Manuel Locatelli and Rodrigo Bentancur of early possession. Roma won five corners in the game’s opening 11 minutes and took the lead from the last of those with a Tammy Abraham header. They could have had a penalty, and a chance to go 2-0 up, when Lorenzo Pellegrini’s shot rebounded from Matthijs De Ligt’s boot on to his outstretched arm. Instead, Juventus equalised through Dybala. But Roma stayed on top. They retook the lead on a deflected shot from Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Then Pellegrini, Roma’s captain, scored a magnificent free-kick to make it 3-1. The TV cameras tracked to his predecessor Totti. Here was your story: a passing-of-the-baton moment, the rise of a new Roma team made possible by the emergence of another homegrown captain. A Juventus comeback seemed implausible. Chiesa had exited the game before half-time with what immediately looked like a serious knee injury and has now been confirmed as a cruciate ligament tear – a hammer blow for club and country. Landucci sent on Álvaro Morata for Moise Kean in the 63rd minute. The Spaniard scarcely saw the ball for the next seven, but then, out of nowhere, conjured a game-changing assist, driving toward the touchline on the right, dragging the ball away from Roger Ibañez’s sliding challenge and floating a cross for Locatelli to head home.
Just like that, the game was transformed. Dejan Kulusevski fired Juventus level, driving his shot into the ground and up into the roof of the net after Morata’s initial attempt was blocked. The goal was initially disallowed but VAR confirmed that there was no offside. Then Morata combined with Weston McKennie down the left, before the American chipped the ball over for De Sciglio to run inside. Chris Smalling got his head on the ball but could not intercept it. The full-back finished at the near post. Delirium. And a new story: Juventus rescued by Morata, the forward whose future had been in doubt amid reports of interest from Atletico Madrid. Only, this game still was not done. Roma won a penalty in the 81st minute, De Ligt handling the ball inside the area a second time. The Dutchman, already booked, was shown a red card. The cameras went back to Totti as Pellegrini stepped up, but this time we would not see either man celebrate. A weak spot-kick was saved by Wojciech Szczęsny – the Juventus goalkeeper who turned his career around during three seasons right here at Roma.
When the full-time whistle finally went, half of the people inside the Olimpico looked to be in a daze. Juventus celebrated, but even Landucci joked that he hoped Allegri “comes back soon because I just lost five or six years of my life.” To throw away such an important game from such a commanding position could only be a hammer blow to Roma. Defeat left them nine points adrift of the Champions League places, and there are more damning statistics to be found. This is the first time since 1988-89 that the Giallorossi have been beaten at home by Juventus, Milan and Inter in the same season. A crestfallen Mourinho sought to portray the defeat afterwards as further evidence of the limitations of the squad he had inherited. “My heart hurts because I am not used to this profile of team,” he was quoted as saying in La Repubblica. “I am here to give the lads a way to improve. But I want the team to follow me in going above their limits, not that they should take me to their level.” Right now the question might be whether they have moved forward at all. Roma are eight points worse off than they were at the corresponding point last season, despite considerable summer investment. The Portugal midfielder Sérgio Oliveira is set to join on loan and it is possible that the club may do more business before the end of this month. There is no new signing, though, who can restore the opportunity they threw away to beat Juventus this weekend.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/roma-3-4-juve-a-magical-melodrama-with-more-twists-than-a-hbo-series;sports

Food and water are scarce. Even the flimsiest shelters are in short supply and sanitation is nonexistent. Girls have been raped by militiamen while attempting to find food in fields around the site. Ibrahim Cisse of Unicef says people here are in effect being held hostage. Rhoe – a remote camp of internally displaced people (IDP) approximately 45km northeast of Bunia, the capital of DRC’s Ituri province – is “a tragedy waiting to happen”, according to those who have visited. Ituri province is home to what is possibly Africa’s largest unexplored gold reserve, and in diplomatic circles has been called “the bloodiest corner of DRC”. But even by Ituri standards Rhoe camp is grim, and the significance of the UN’s appeal for urgent support here should not be underestimated. For many in Rhoe it will be not the first or even second time they have become refugees in their own land. The three DRC warlords convicted at the international criminal court (ICC) for their part in the ongoing violence – Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, the subjects, respectively, of the ICC’s first ever conviction, in March 2012, first case in which crimes of sexual violence including rape and sexual slavery were charged (although he was acquitted) and the longest sentence ever issued – began their killing careers here. In 2003, the EU deployed its first autonomous military intervention in Ituri. It was an attempt to shield a population not being protected by government or international peacekeepers. Now Ituri is burning again. A militia group known as the Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or Codeco, which distinguishes itself by its copious use of machetes and flamethrowers against civilians, is terrorising the population. According to UN briefings seen by the Guardian, the situation started to deteriorate on 12 November when Codeco began ramping up attacks on villages and within camps, placing pressure on already struggling relief operations. In one attack, in Tsuya, 1,296 houses were destroyed by Codeco militia. No one knows how many died. At around the same time, Codeco men armed with ageing AK-47s attacked the villages of Buki, Ngazba, Kpaluba, Tata and Litsinga; opening fire at random and torching houses. In Reta, in the furrows of Djugu territory, not far from the Drodro camp, a two-month-old baby girl was killed during a Codeco attack. Unicef says militiamen also destroyed three hospitals and two schools in the area, and have made any kind of humanitarian assistance impossible. Those who survived the assaults fled to camps at Tché and Drodro. On 21 November, Tché was attacked; 950 shelters were destroyed. Codeco also attacked Drodro, killing at least 35 and destroying 14 of the 18 housing blocks that sheltered IDPs. Over the last eight weeks militiamen have attacked at least four IDP camps in Ituri. These accounts shed light not only on the violence unfolding in Ituri but also reveal that at least 35,000 children, almost half of Rhoe’s population, are at risk of death through starvation or disease. What will happen to people without any food, including the 19 breastfeeding women who gave birth in the camp in December? Built to shelter 6,000 households, Rhoe was already a humanitarian tinderbox, hopelessly over capacity. Aid agencies can reach the camp only by helicopter. In December, Unicef counted over 14,000 households in the camp, making up a total of 75,000 people; there is one toilet for every 1,300 people and sewage flows openly.
Three cases of measles have been identified. People are dying of respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and malaria. There is no equipment to hold funerals. There is also only one clinic, run by Doctors Without Borders, with an adjacent twometre sq delivery room for women in labour. These conditions are alongside impunity-fuelled violence, starvation and displacement that has festered since 1996, leaving the government unable to keep its citizens safe, secure or fed. More than 27 million are facing starvation. Approximately 5.5 million people, including 3.2 million children and 1.2 million women, have now been displaced from their homes because of violence. In May 2021 DRC’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, declared a state of emergency in Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu. Yet Tshisekedi has appointed Floribert Ndjabu as his evoy for the region, a man who served 15 years in preventive detention on suspicion of the murders of nine UN peacekeepers in 2005. Last August, he employed another former rebel leader, Tommy Tambwe, three months before Tambwe’s militia gang M23 allegedly attacked Bukavu. Tshisekedi has promoted many figures the UN has labeled “red generals,” some of whom are under UN and EU sanctions for human rights violations, including Gen Gabriel Amisi, Gen Muhindo Akili Mundos, Fall Sikabwe Asinda, Thierry Ilunga Kibambi and Egide Ngoy. How can you protect civilians from violence if the very men who caused it are in power? Unicef says it needs $356m (£260m) to hold back hunger and disease in Ituri, including Ebola, measles, meningitis and cholera. But there has been no indication from London, Washington or Brussels that any programme will be funded. Everyone of course understands that money will only address the symptoms and not the fundamental problem. It is largely a question of political will: whether or not to send-in UN lawyers – not troops – to end the impunity still fuelling the ongoing violence, starvation and displacement.";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/10/as-violence-drc-democratic-republic-congo-escalates-thousands-are-effectively-being-held-hostage;environment
4484;4484;4484;203;4536;4536;The Power of the Dog among worthy winners as disgraced Golden Globes plays it safe;2022-01-10;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Golden Globes 2022', 'Golden Globes', 'Film', 'Awards and prizes', 'Culture'];"So the much-disgraced Golden Globes, derided for a lack of diversity and transparency in the voting membership, lucrative TV coverage cancelled, gravy-train derailed and the awards ceremony dwindled to a virtual event on social media, carries paradoxically on with delivering a set of awards that are in perfectly plausible good taste and not very much different from all the other un-disgraced awards ceremonies. However, it was sad to see Paul Thomas Anderson’s dazzling comedy of transgression Licorice Pizza overlooked, of which more in a moment. Jane Campion’s handsome, complex and brilliant western drama The Power of the Dog gets best picture (drama) and best director, along with best supporting actor for the excellent Kodi Smit-McPhee, while Steven Spielberg’s glorious, passionately respectful revival of West Side Story wins best picture in the musical or comedy section, along with its breakout player Ariana DeBose for best supporting actress and newcomer Rachel Zegler for best actress in musical/comedy. Will Smith and Andrew Garfield win best actor in drama and musical/comedy respectively for King Richard – the story of Venus and Serena Williams’s demanding tennis-coach-dad Richard – and for tick, tick … BOOM!, about the troubled composer Jonathan Larson in which role the eminently lovable Garfield gave an object acting lesson in relatability and emotional availability. Entirely decent choices, though I was sorry here to see Mahershala Ali overlooked for his excellent performance in Swan Song, and indeed Denzel Washington’s mighty interpretation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. And the Globes’ excellent best foreign language list would surely pass muster in the most demanding critics’ choice forum with Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car emerging as the winner.
The Power of the Dog, through that mysterious process of awards-season groupthink, is emerging as the single frontrunner, though there could hardly be a more deserving beneficiary: a colossal tragic drama taking place on a giant plain, dominated by an almost dreamlike house, surreally isolated on this vast landscape. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fascinatingly spiky, confrontational, uningratiating performance as the cattleman in the grip of psychological turbulence he cannot explain and of which he is perhaps hardly even aware, as he begins a spiteful duel with his sister-in-law (fellow nominee Kirsten Dunst) and her son played by Smit-McPhee. West Side Story, though a box office disappointment, and coolly received by some critics for its alleged failure to be radically different from the original stage show and 1961 movie version, seemed to me a dazzling spectacle, whose every scene and dance sequence is presented with matchless flair and exuberance. This is a magnificent picture that really should be seen on the big screen – and let’s hope its Globes success will boost the box office.
I loved Kenneth Branagh’s heartfelt autobiographical movie Belfast, about his early childhood in Northern Ireland at the beginning of the Troubles, for its heart-on-sleeve directness and the way he challenged the tacit liberal consensus that Belfast and the Troubles can only be represented in terms of angry despair. It was great to see Branagh pick up best screenplay – but I have to say that here, as in so many other categories, the superb Licorice Pizza (the 70s-set story of a hilariously pushy 15-year-old boy and his romantic obsession with a 25-year-old woman) was snubbed. Perhaps this is a film that confuses too many people, and its jagged, surreally satirical barbs at racism and antisemitism not easily accommodated into the contemporary discourse. And as for Nicole Kidman winning best actress (drama) for her very peculiar impersonation of Lucille Ball in Aaron Sorkin’s strenuous Being the Ricardos, about the 50s TV hit I Love Lucy … well, big fan of Kidman as I am, this was not her greatest performance and she was arguably the weakest link in a category that included Kristen Stewart’s performance as Diana, Lady Gaga’s uproarious turn in House of Gucci and Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. The Globe should really have gone to Olivia Colman for her amazingly good and richly detailed performance in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter. So – no backslapping, no boozy dinner, no outrageous presenter gags from Ricky Gervais, but a decent, if mainstream, list of winners.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/the-power-of-the-dog-among-worthy-winners-as-disgraced-golden-globes-plays-it-safe;entertainment and culture
4502;4502;4502;221;4554;4554;To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara – a masterpiece for our times;2022-01-10;['Alex Preston'];['Hanya Yanagihara', 'Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"To Paradise, Hanya Yanagihara’s vast, complex follow-up to her Booker-shortlisted A Little Life, is a novel of many faces. I could tell you, for instance, that it’s about colonialism and racism in America today; or that it’s a queer counterfactual history (and future) that asks what would happen if sexuality were destigmatised (and then restigmatised); or an elegy for the lost kingdom of Hawaii. Most readers, I think, will concentrate on the book’s longest section, the third, in which Yanagihara writes of a series of pandemics and the way they reshape society in the decades ahead. To Paradise is arranged in three discrete but interrelated parts. The first, Washington Square, is set in the 1890s in a fictional New York. History has gone through a delicious skew, so that the north-eastern states have seceded from the rest of the US, part of a more general post-civil war rearrangement. Our hero for this section is David Bingham, the dreamy and foppish scion of a banking empire. He lives with his grandfather, Nathaniel, in a beautiful house in Washington Square. The “Free States” based their independence on the question of gay marriage – it seems that, with all stigma stripped away from homosexuality, around half of the citizens choose same-sex relationships.
This section is in essence a love story, as David, “still almost-young”, falls for the 23-year-old Edward, a music teacher. There is another potential suitor for David: the bluff, genial Charles Griffiths, a New Englander. As David attempts to choose between the two men, Nathaniel Bingham looks into Edward’s past and finds that all may not be as it seems. David is faced with a choice: the certainty of life in the Free States or a journey westwards, to California, to paradise. The second part of the book, Lipo-Wao-Nahele is itself divided in two sections. The first is about another David Bingham, this one a junior paralegal carrying out a semi-illicit affair with his boss, the wealthy Charles Griffiths. It is the 1980s, deep in the heart of a pandemic (which we presume is Aids – it is never named). Even from Griffiths’s opulent Washington Square home (the house is one of the constants in the novel), there is the sense of a city under siege. Yanagihara has always been brilliant on the trappings of the good life, but here there’s an almost fetishistic caressing of material goods, a celebration of luxury as necessity at a time of crisis.
We discover in this second section that David Bingham is “from one of the oldest families in Hawai’i… If things had gone differently, I would have been king.” David is Kawika, heir to a throne that no longer exists. The dark history of the US annexation of Hawaii is too complex to unpack here, but it is one of the key themes running through the novel; how American capitalism warped and curdled Hawaii’s sense of itself. The drifting, gentle David/Kawika, and the narrator of the second half of this section, Wika, David’s damaged and dying father, are collateral damage in this half-forgotten act of colonialism. The final part of the novel is Zone Eight. Again, the section is split in two, although these two parts interweave and reflect upon each other. One thread is set in the 2090s, two centuries after the novel opens, and is narrated by Charlie, who we learn is a survivor of one of the terrible zoonotic pandemics that swept the globe in the course of the 21st century. She is a strangely blank, affectless character: she fell ill as a child in the pandemic of 2070 and the experimental drug that was used to cure her has half-destroyed her mind. Charlie lives, again, on Washington Square, although the house has been divided into apartments. The world is ruled from Beijing and all the marks of classic dystopia are there: the internet has been shut down, the press is state-controlled, books are banned, the secret police spy on people using insect drones.
This narrative is intercut with letters from another Charles Griffiths, Charlie’s grandfather, who is writing to Peter, a fellow scientist in “New Britain”. His letters begin in 2043 and take us through the dark years of the second half of the 21st century, where each new wave of disease becomes an excuse for increasingly totalitarian modes of control. It’s brilliant and horrifying in equal measure, particularly if, like me, you’re temperamentally disinclined to worry too much about the loss of freedoms in the face of a pandemic. I’m not about to burn masks in Parliament Square, but this is a novel that really forces you to examine your woolly liberal assumptions about the motives behind lockdowns. Put together, the three sections of the novel combine to deliver a series of powerful statements about progress and utopia, about those who are excluded from our visions of a better world. Yanagihara asks us in particular to move beyond binary configurations of sexuality, race and health, to challenge any political movement that seeks to privilege one group or another based on narrow definitions of identity. We are all multiple selves in the world of To Paradise. Nabokov said that names carry “coloured shadows” in a novel and the repetition of names across the three sections is on one level quite simple: this is a multigenerational family saga, showing how fortunes rise and fall over centuries, questioning the idea of inheritance and examining ideas of family that extend beyond blood ties. There’s something more than this, though, something that chips away at the verisimilitude of the novel, that asks us to engage in a complicated way with the very idea of characters in a book: these are figures facing similar challenges in different times, but the points of correspondence reveal essential truths about what it means to be human at a time of crisis. Sometimes literature takes time to digest momentous events: the great novels of the Napoleonic wars, of the Holocaust, of the plague, weren’t published until decades after the episodes they describe. Occasionally, though, a masterpiece emerges from the white heat of the moment: The Great Gatsby, The Decameron, The Waste Land. There’s something miraculous about reading To Paradise while the coronavirus crisis is still playing out around us, the dizzying sense that you’re immersed in a novel that will come to represent the age, its obsessions and anxieties. It’s rare that you get the opportunity to review a masterpiece, but To Paradise, definitively, is one. To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara is published by Pan Macmillan (£20, AU$32.99).

4509;4509;4509;228;4561;4561;From Mendelssohn to mush: a day tuned to Scala Radio’s Women Composers ;2022-01-10;['Stephen Moss'];['Classical music', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Women', 'Radio', 'Television & radio'];"At 10am last Thursday, Women Composers came on air and Hit the Dancefloor bit the dust. This new arrival among Scala Radio’s 20-strong family of digital niche stations is devoted entirely to classical music composed by women. Things began, however, not with a great fanfare (what a wonderful commission for a female composer that would have been) but with a bit of technical jiggery-pokery that meant knocking out one of Scala’s existing stations – farewell Hit the Dancefloor, a peculiar mixture of waltzes, ballets and galops (even a clog dance in its final hour) – and replacing it with the new Women Composers icon. The changeover took a few minutes, and the first piece to be played – the opening movement of Fanny Mendelssohn’s String Quartet in E Flat Major – was sadly not available to this listener, whose computer kept displaying an error message. But the second piece – Hildegard von Bingen’s Spiritus Sanctus Vivificans – was extremely uplifting, and the third, even better: a movement of Clara Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A Minor played by Isata Kanneh-Mason and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.
And yet after this promising beginning, the new station opted for a day of mostly musical mush: the sort of ghostly, ghastly mood music that would not be amiss on Scala’s mindfulness station. Anne Nikitin’s Found God did not make me find God; Julianna Barwick’s Healing Is a Miracle was far from miraculous; Alexandra Hamilton-Ayres’s Coma did exactly what it said on the tin. On the plus side, there was some captivating piano: Oscar-winning film composer Rachel Portman’s A Gift made me want to hear more of her work; Marie Bigot’s Etude in A Minor was hugely polished; Maria Szymanowska’s Six Menuets wonderfully elegant. Like Clara Schumann, Bigot and Szymanowska were virtuoso pianists in the first half of the 19th century who also composed. Playing was seen as respectable for women; composition less so. When contemporaries heard a piece by “F Mendelssohn”, they invariably assumed her brother Felix rather than Fanny. A letter from her father has become infamous: “Perhaps for Felix music will become a profession, while for you it will always remain but an ornament.” 
Scala’s premium stations – targeted at “music super fans” who pay £3.99 a month to get ad-free access – are a classic example of narrowcasting: there are stations for devotees of baroque or romantic music, there’s one that plays nothing but Mozart 24 hours a day, one that dishes up “dinner party” music, and a station that promises “classical bangers” which seems to play the Blue Danube a lot.  This is presenter-less radio, with lots of short pieces (three or four minutes on average) broken up by brief prerecorded statements: “Non-stop music from women composers” and “The only station that plays the best works by female composers 24 hours a day.” It is essentially a playlist, shuffled by computer with occasional human intervention. There are a lot of similar-sounding film scores and plenty of unthreatening piano, harp and guitar pieces. Think Enya crossed with Philip Glass: relaxation, mindfulness, the rhythm of a well-ordered life. Not much vocal music – too intrusive? The station’s computer prefers narcoleptic sopranos humming wordlessly.  Scala sets out to make classical music (what a knotty and unhelpful term that is) “accessible”, so you will not find many longer or more challenging pieces on the new station. Don’t expect Judith Weir, Sofia Gubaidulina or Hannah Kendall. The pieces align with what programme manager Jenny Nelson calls Scala’s “familiar sound world” – music that washes over you, gives pleasure, vaguely reminds you of something you saw and enjoyed on the telly.  Nelson sees Weir as “a Radio 3 composer”, and Clara Schumann, Anne Dudley and Portman as representative Scala composers. “Radio 3 is a brilliant station,” she says, “and people assume there’s a lot of crossover [with Scala] because of the term classical, but the overlap isn’t that great. One of the ideas we had when we started Scala was ‘What if Radio 2 did classical?’ It’s more that mindset that determines our music and editorial policy. There is some crossover, but there’ll be pieces we play that Radio 3 wouldn’t touch with a bargepole, and vice versa.” 
Composer Julie Cooper, whose ethereal Secret Paths crops up a lot on the new station, insists the formulaic programming will not undermine its contribution to correcting the imbalance between male and female composers. “It really doesn’t matter from what genre they are playing works,” she says. “The most important thing is heightening awareness and giving visibility to women composers.” Scala has allied with the charity Donne, which campaigns to “readdress the gender inequality within the music industry”, to start this new station. Donne’s founder, Gabriella Di Laccio, believes an all-women station – even one with so limited a playlist – will demonstrate how many female composers, ancient and modern, there are. But she also accepts there is a danger of ghettoisation, and has some sympathy with those who reject the label “woman composer”. “We look forward to the day when there are just composers,” she says, “but we are not there yet and there is still a need to highlight women composers.” It is an interesting experiment, but surely Scala need to be braver. Subscribers have stumped up their £3.99 and aren’t your run-of-the-mill casual radio listeners – these are “music super fans”, remember? – so why not give them Weir, Gubaidulina and Kendall alongside Dudley and Portman? And programme some works that last longer than four minutes – the whole of Clara Schumann’s piano concerto for instance. Expand that sound world. Maybe start a station devoted to female serialists. Now that would be an adventure. • Subscribe and listen at planetradio.co.uk/women-composers/";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/10/from-mendelssohn-to-mush-a-day-tuned-to-scala-radios-women-composers;entertainment and culture
4514;4514;4514;233;4566;4566;Can you solve it? Gödel’s incompleteness theorem;2022-01-10;['Alex Bellos'];['Mathematics', 'Education', 'Science', 'Mathematics', 'Logic puzzles', 'Philosophy'];In 1931, the Austrian logician Kurt Gödel published his incompleteness theorem, a result widely considered one of the greatest intellectual achievements of modern times. The theorem states that in any reasonable mathematical system there will always be true statements that cannot be proved. The result was a huge shock to the mathematical community, where the prevailing view was an unshakeable optimism about the power and reach of their subject. It had been assumed that maths was “complete”, meaning that all mathematical statements are either provable or refutable. The 25-year-old Gödel demonstrated this was incorrect by constructing a true statement that was not provable. Maths, he announced, has its limits. The incompleteness theorem transformed the study of the foundations of mathematics, and would become an important result for computer science, since it shows that all formalised systems, such as coding languages, have limitations on what they can achieve. The theorem is also at the heart of today’s puzzle, which we’ll get to shortly. Gödel’s proof of his theorem is based on self-reference: in a formal mathematical setting, the statement ‘This sentence is unprovable” is both true and formally unprovable. The technical details of the proof are hard going. Yet the American logician Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017) devised a brilliant way to convey the gist of the incompleteness theorem using simple logic puzzles about truth-tellers and liars. Today’s teaser, composed in cooperation with Professor Benedikt Löwe of Churchill College, Cambridge, is inspired by Smullyan’s approach. The two tribes of If In the Ocean of Deduction lies the logical island of If. People born here belong to one of two tribes: the Alethians and the Pseudians. The only way to tell an Alethian from a Pseudian is to talk to them. Alethians always speak the truth, no matter what they are saying. Pseudians will always utter falsehoods, no matter what they are saying. At the centre of the island, the Master of the Alethians keeps the Ledger of Identity, a book that lists the names of everyone born on the island together with their tribe. The information in the Ledger of Identity is correct and freely available to anyone who asks. One day, an intrepid explorer arrives on If. She encounters various inhabitants and identifies them as Alethians and Pseudians by asking clever questions. After several successful such encounters, she meets a man called Kurt. The explorer does not know his tribal affiliation, but before she has time to ask him a question, he says “You will never have concrete evidence that confirms that I am an Alethian.” 1. Is Kurt an Alethian, a Pseudian or neither? 2. How might this relate to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem? Please return at 5pm UK for the solutions and a discussion. NO SPOILERS. Instead please post your favourite logic jokes. UPDATE: Read the solution here. Today’s Gödelian puzzle is a pre-celebration of UNESCO’s World Logic Day, which takes place annually on January 14. (The date was chosen since it is both the day Gödel died, in 1978, and the day the logician Alfred Tarski was born, in 1901.)

4516;4516;4516;235;4568;4568;Home Office backing of women’s safety app is insulting, campaigners say;2022-01-10;['Alexandra Topping'];['Crime', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Women', 'Domestic violence', 'Society', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'Sexual harassment', 'UK news'];"Women’s safety campaigners have called the Home Office’s backing of an app that allows users to track their friends’ journeys home “insulting to women and girls”, arguing that it does nothing to tackle the issue of men’s violence against women. The new app provides anyone walking home at night with a monitored route on their phone. If the walker moves more than 40 metres from the route or stops for more than three minutes, the app asks if they are OK. If there is no reply, nominated “guardians” – normally friends and family – receive a notification on their phones to say there has been a deviation. They can then check on the person in question and alert the police if they are unable to do so. The Home Office minister, Rachel Maclean, said such schemes should be part of a wider plan to make streets safer for women and girls. “We need a whole-of-society approach to tackling violence against women and girls, and I welcome initiatives from the private sector that deliver on this aim,” she said. Anna Birley from Reclaim These Streets, which was set up after the murder of Sarah Everard, said safety apps did nothing to tackle the underlying problem of men’s violence against women. “The Home Office backing of this app is insulting to women and girls,” she said. “We already share our location, we already ask our friends to text us when they get home, we already wear bright clothes, stick to the well-lit routes and clutch our keys between our fingers. “It still isn’t enough. Women and girls, and the steps that we take to stay safe every day, are not the problem. The problem is that male violence makes us unsafe.” The free, not-for-profit app, Path Community, is being trialled by about 500 people including Metropolitan police officers in Southwark and Lambeth in south London. It creates routes avoiding unlit streets, alleys or areas known for antisocial behaviour and users can mark where they feel unsafe. Harry Mead, the creator, told the Guardian that anonymised information can then be shared with local councils and police to establish problem areas that may need more resources. The platform was also developing an education platform, he said.
“The underlying issue of men’s violence is the core problem and everyone has to help tackle it,” he said. “The app is designed to help with immediate concerns and help users feel safer. Path is our attempt to do our bit.”. Domestic violence campaigners have also raised concerns about safety apps that track movement being misused by abusers. They could “potentially extend an abuser’s reach beyond the home, controlling women in spaces they previously felt safe and free”, said the chief executive of Women’s Aid, Farah Nazeer. The Home Office and police and crime commissioners needed to work with the women’s sector to remove barriers to their safety, she said. “There is so much work to be done to increase survivors’ confidence in reporting abuse to police, tackle misogyny with public awareness and education and, of course, provide adequate funding to services supporting survivors,” she said. Mead said developers were very conscious of the issue of potential misuse and had designed the app to be as private as possible while providing maximum safety. Tracking only lasted for the duration of a set journey and users would always be contacted first to check if they were OK before a guardian was notified while a toggle to turn live tracking on and off was being developed, he added. The shadow minister for domestic violence, Jess Phillips, said: “This seems like a sticking plaster instead of dealing with the actual problem that is men’s violence against women.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said its Tackling Violence against Women and Girls strategy launched last year included initiatives and funding to target potential perpetrators and protect potential victims, including the pilot of the StreetSafe online tool, which allows the public to anonymously report areas where they feel unsafe.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/womens-safety-app-backed-by-home-office-is-insulting-experts-say;environment
4520;4520;4520;239;4572;4572;Best baby monitor cameras for travel or the home;2022-01-10;['Grace Holliday'];['Gadgets', 'Smart homes', 'Motorola', 'Kodak', 'Technology', 'Family', 'Parents and parenting', 'Life and style', 'Business', 'Wifi'];"Whether you have a newborn or know someone who does, a good baby monitor can be both freeing and reassuring, helping keep an eye on the little ones as they rest. But with so many to choose from with varying brands, capabilities and prices, it can be hard to know which work best in practice. So we put nine of the best baby cameras to the test across three different categories for travel or home. Here are the ones that delivered. Best wifi-free camera for travel Babysense V43 split-screen monitor
Price: £139.99 With a sturdy parent unit and two cameras for split-screen capabilities, the Babysense V43 performs impressively pretty much across the board. The parent unit is user-friendly with responsive buttons and a logical, well-labelled menu. The built-in lullabies are a little old-fashioned and tinny, and while it displays room temperature it does not show the time. The Babysense is wifi-free, making it safe from remote hackers. Its 300-metre wireless range means the parent unit, which can be used on battery or mains, can be taken outside ready for warmer months. Notably, none of these features waned or stalled when two cameras were connected during testing. Settings for each camera can be tailored individually, and switching between camera feeds is almost instantaneous. Up to four cameras can be used with one parent unit with additional purchases. The battery lasts about 10 hours in eco-mode, which pauses sound and video on the parent unit if the camera detects no sound for 30 seconds. A spare or replacement battery costs £5.99. The base of each camera has a pleasant orange night light, while the lens pans, swivels 360 degrees and zooms quickly and smoothly. The motor, while not silent, did not disturb a sleeping baby. Panning is controlled via the parent unit, meaning there is no need to fiddle with camera angles once initial setup is complete. The cameras can be wall-mounted using the screws and wall plugs included, but easily lifted away for travel purposes. Many monitors designed with travel and flexibility in mind sacrifice screen size, but that is not the case here. The 5in screen has good picture quality, which is extra clear when close up to faces or objects. There is no delay in movement or audio on the unit, although two-way talk mode sounds somewhat walkie-talkie-esque. There’s no need to worry about software updates as there is no app, which also makes the Babysense a smart option for those looking to avoid checking their phones during the night too. Verdict: A comprehensive package that offers genuine flexibility, with smooth panning, speedy connection and an impressive range without the need for wifi. Runner-up: VTECH VM3254
Price: £50 The VTECH VM3254 offers a compact, wifi-free package, making it suitable for travel, and the picture quality is good, particularly close up. The talk function, however, is far too quiet and the button layout on the parent unit isn’t particularly easy to navigate. Our runner-up, the VTech VM3254 is still an excellent option for the price, but note the battery cannot be replaced and it is not repairable. Best wifi camera for home Kodak Cherish C525
Price: £159.99 This baby monitor may not be made by the Kodak of old, but at least it lives up to picture quality of the brand name. Via either phone app or parent unit with 5in screen, the Cherish C525 displays not just the baby’s features or silhouette, but even subtle facial expressions during the day with lifelike colour, which cannot be said for competitors. Night mode is also excellent, while movement and audio come through with minimal delay and the two-way-talk sound is crisp. Not only does the camera zoom and swivel 360 degrees at an almost imperceptible volume, the parent unit can handle split-screen viewing with up to five paired cameras with additional purchases. There is a fair selection of pleasant-enough lullabies, white noise and heartbeat sounds, plus room temperature monitoring. Special milestones and events can be captured and stored either on an SD card or in the cloud. The Kodak smart home app for Android or iPhone is easy to navigate and intuitive but the parent unit is less so. While the keyboard can be backlit, which is handy for night-time check-ins, its icons are not labelled and the buttons are fiddly, so you need to learn how to navigate it efficiently. Despite this drawback, the parent unit, antennae and handy flip-stand are sturdy, and the device is neither fragile nor too heavy. It has two factor authentication for extra security when accessing the app and requests authentication if you attempt to log in from a different location than usual. Alternatively, the camera and parent unit – though not the app – can be used without an internet connection. Out of the house, both the camera and parent unit can run on battery power for a few hours. The units are generally repairable and replacement batteries are widely available too. Kodak will support apps for the Cherish for a minimum of three years after the model is discontinued. Verdict: Outstanding picture quality sets this monitor above the rest, while most additional features are well executed. Runner-up: Motorola VM65X Connect video baby monitor
Price: £249.99 With stylish rose gold detailing on the parent unit, a sleek camera and a sturdy over-cot stand, the Motorola is an attractive package. However, it is more expensive, the picture quality is less sharp, the colours are not as true and there is a slight crackle to the voice when speaking to the baby. The battery can’t be replaced either. The best premium system Nanit Pro
Price: £299 The Nanit Pro’s 1080p HD camera, app and breathing band is a comprehensive and well-executed baby monitoring system for parents who wish to cover every possible base. There is no parent unit, but the app is efficient and streamlined making checking in on the baby easy. The camera’s stream goes live in the app within 3 seconds with little in the way of delay, and switches between day and night mode automatically. The camera has a good zoom and field of view over the cot but does not swivel. That means there is no disruptive motor to worry about, and as it will be either attached to a wall or floor stand (£80 additional purchase) it won’t get knocked over by rambunctious pets or other children. As for security, Nanit encrypts your data, protects accounts with two-step verification and has various settings for controlling when and who can see the feed from the camera. The app shows room temperature and humidity, while five buttons allow users to quickly snap a photo, play music, white noise, birds or wave sounds, listen to or talk to the baby and switch on a nightlight. The nightlight is particularly good. It shines upwards with adjustable brightness so you can see the cot and immediate surroundings without disturbing the baby or others in the room. The Nanit comes with a year of basic “Insights” including special milestones and memory videos, sleep tracking and quality analysis, and breathing monitoring using a soft, electronic-free band wrapped around the baby’s torso, which sounds an alarm if an issue arises.

4539;4539;4539;258;4592;4592;Novak Djokovic: judge asks what more tennis star could have done to prove vaccination exemption ;2022-01-10;['Paul Karp'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Australia news', 'Tennis', 'Sport', 'Australian immigration and asylum'];"The judge hearing Novak Djokovic’s case has queried “what more” he could have done to prove his medical exemption and criticised the Australian government for reneging on a deal to give him more time to defend his visa from cancellation. Judge Anthony Kelly said he was “preoccupied” and “somewhat agitated” by the issue of why Australian officials did not accept an exemption document provided by the world No 1 male tennis player from a qualified physician, backed up by an independent Victorian government panel. The federal circuit court began to hear Djokovic’s case on Monday morning, allowing him temporarily out of detention to view the hearing away from the Park hotel in Melbourne, where he is being held. The expedited hearing comes ahead of a looming Tennis Australia deadline of Tuesday for Djokovic to be included in the draw to play the Australian Open.
Djokovic is seeking to win a record 10th Australian Open which would be his 21st open grand slam title, the most ever for a male player in singles. He now finds his fortune at the whims of Australian administrative law which advocates have long complained is stacked against those seeking to regain visas, including the refugees held at the Park hotel, in detention for up to nine years. Djokovic arrived in Australia late on Wednesday evening before his visa was cancelled at 7.29am on Thursday morning on the basis he may be a threat to health and safety because he was unvaccinated. Djokovic’s counsel, Nicholas Wood, told the court the Serbian tennis star had done his “level best” to provide everything to substantiate his exemption that he recently had Covid-19, including uploading a medical exemption from the chief medical officer of Tennis Australia before travelling. Kelly interrupted to comment that the status of Djokovic’s medical exemption “preoccupied” him, describing it as a “relatively significant fact” that Djokovic had obtained an exemption from “a professor and eminently qualified physician”, which was further approved by an independent expert panel established by the Victorian state government. “That document was in the hands of the delegate [who cancelled his visa]. The point I’m somewhat agitated about is: what more could this man [Djokovic] have done?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Wood said that Djokovic had been “utterly confused” when interviewed on Thursday morning, pointing to a note he received before travelling from the home affairs department that his claim for an exemption had been assessed and accepted. The department argues that response does not amount to an assurance his medical exemption would allow him to enter Australia. Kelly noted Djokovic was “effectively incommunicado” from 4am when he was asked to switch his phone off until 7.42am when he was told of the cancellation, as the department reneged on an agreement to give him until 8.30am to consult Tennis Australia. The Australian government has argued visa-holders cannot be allowed to “filibuster” by refusing to completely respond to a notice to cancel a visa. Wood submitted that Djokovic had wanted to wait for a particular time to speak to Tennis Australia and the judge appeared to accept he had done so to “effectively take up the opportunity … to provide [authorities] anything further [they] might want”. Kelly noted that Djokovic was urged not to get in touch with his lawyers, which Wood said occurred on the “spurious rationale” it would be in his interests to complete his interview without them. In its written submission the Australian government argued that any failure to consider further representations from Djokovic is immaterial. Wood labelled that view “erroneous” unless the delegate had a closed mind about the case. Kelly suggested on one view the interview could be seen as an ex-post-facto justification for the cancellation decision. The Australian government submitted that recent infection with Covid-19 by itself is not enough for a medical exemption, and the evidence established that Djokovic “has recovered” and is therefore not entitled to one. Through counsel, Christopher Tran, it submitted that Djokovic had given a response to the notice to cancel the visa in the interview and there was no denial of procedural fairness. Tran said Djokovic may have felt “pressured” to respond, but urged the judge not to find that was Border Force officials’ intention.
The hearing continues on Monday afternoon, with further submissions from Tran. The morning’s remote hearing suffered technical outages in webcasting that triggered adjournments or closed it from public view. Earlier on Monday, Wood accused the delegate of the home affairs minister of a “paucity of evidence” for the decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa, and warned that any defect in reasoning should see it reinstated. Legal experts have warned even after the expedited hearing, there is no guarantee Djokovic could secure a court order restoring his visa in time to play, and he could also face his visa being revoked again. In written submissions the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has asked the court, if it sides with Djokovic, to quash the original decision but not to order his release. The government submitted it had the power to make a fresh cancellation decision and noted “other powers” including re-detention. Wood sought an interlocutory injunction to release Djokovic pending the result of the case. Kelly noted on Thursday Tran had ruled out deporting Djokovic before the result.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/novak-djokovic-judge-agitated-by-issue-of-why-australian-government-did-not-accept-tennis-players-medical-exemption;sports

Huntington, the No 1 pick in the 2017 draft, is now facing a third knee reconstruction in her short Western Bulldogs career while Davey, last year’s AFLW best and fairest winner, will undergo her second ACL surgery on the same knee having first injured it in 2018. A third big name, Brisbane’s Kate Lutkins, is facing a nervous wait on her own scan results after injuring her knee on Sunday.
Scans showed Huntington ruptured her right ACL graft and damaged her lateral meniscus after her knee buckled as she changed direction in the Bulldogs’ loss to Melbourne on Saturday. The standout junior lost the 2018 and 2019 seasons to similar injuries before she returned to win the 2020 Rising Star as a defender. “We are absolutely devastated for Izzy – she is a much-loved figure at the kennel, and everyone is well aware of her injury battles, so we’re just heartbroken for her,” Bulldogs women’s football boss Debbie Lee said. “She worked extremely hard this pre-season to get herself ready for this year, so it’s a real shame her 2022 campaign has been cut short. “Izzy is a true professional though, and having been through this twice before she will know what’s required of her. As a club, we’ll continue to support her and the family in any way we can.” Magpies co-captain Davey left the field in tears late in the fourth term of Sunday’s 19-point victory over Carlton at Ikon Park and after will not return until next season at least, after scans confirmed she had ruptured her ACL and had a medial collateral ligament tear in her right knee. Collingwood’s head of women’s football, Jess Burger, said the entire program was “heartbroken” for Davey, who won the club’s best and fairest medal and was named captain of the All-Australian side last year. “It’s very hard to see our captain go down with such a cruel injury, let alone someone who is at the top of their game,” Burger said. “There is no doubt her injury has been felt not just within our team, but across the entire AFLW community. “She’s recovered from this injury before and knows what it takes to get herself back to being regarded as one of the competition’s best. Bri will continue to play a key role in leading this team from the sidelines this season and our entire program will wrap our arms around her during this difficult time.” Both players will consult with their surgeons this week.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/alfw-loses-two-of-its-brightest-stars-for-rest-of-season-due-to-knee-injuries;sports

It is understood to have taken place after a press conference, and was described as having had a celebratory feel with drinking late into the evening. After No 10 denied this, a photograph was obtained by the Guardian showing Boris Johnson, his wife and two officials at a table with wine and cheese, with another 15 officials in the rest of the garden with wine bottles visible. No 10 says Johnson had been having a work meeting and went up to his flat with his family just after 7pm that evening. 20 May 2020 Dominic Cummings lifted the lid on a May gathering in the Downing Street garden, with invites to a “social distanced drinks”, which is believed to have been organised by the civil servant Martin Reynolds. No 10 has not denied that Johnson and his wife attended, with reports of food on tables and drinking. Restrictions on social mixing were still in place at this point. 13 November – Boris and Carrie Johnson flat party This is the date that Johnson’s chief adviser, Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles. Sources have reported loud music and sounds of a party coming from the flat occupied by Johnson and his wife on this date. Cummings has alleged there had been “other flat parties” and suggested the pair’s “bubble” policy should be investigated. Asked if a party went ahead in his flat on 13 November, Johnson said: “No.” 27 November – Downing Street leaving do While England was still in the grip of its second national lockdown, a leaving do was organised in No 10 – said to have been for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Cummings. A source told the Guardian that Johnson had personally attended and given a speech, remarking on how full with people the room was, before leaving to continue working. 10 December – Gavin Williamson’s staff party When London was in tier 2, which only allowed socialising in groups of six outside, the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, threw a party in his Whitehall department. The most senior civil servant in the department, Susan Acland-Hood, attended and admitted that there had been a “work-related” gathering hosted in the canteen. She did not dispute people had been drinking wine, and appeared to blame Williamson for instigating the event. She recalled he had wanted to “say a few words” to thank staff after a difficult year. 17 December A quiz was held for members of the private office of Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, who was originally meant to be investigating the reports of parties in No 10. Invitations were sent out titled “Christmas Party!” and about 15 people were thought to be in attendance over Zoom. Responding to the claims, a government spokesperson said it was a virtual quiz with a small number of people from the office taking part from their desks. “The cabinet secretary played no part in the event, but walked through the team’s office on the way to his own office. No outside guests or other staff were invited or present. This lasted for an hour and drinks and snacks were bought by those attending. He also spoke briefly to staff in the office before leaving.” 18 December 2020 – Downing Street Christmas party A party was held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events, according to multiple sources after the Daily Mirror first broke the story. Several dozen people – a mix of civil servants and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. While Johnson’s spokesperson insisted no rules had been broken and then denied any party took place, a video filmed four days after the event was published by ITV. The leaked footage showed Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then aide, rehearsing for televised press conferences and laughing and joking with aides about a party on 18 December. Stratton all but confirmed the event had taken place by laughing it off as a “business meeting” but added: “It was not socially distanced.” 15 December 2020 – a festive No 10 quiz A Christmas quiz was also organised for No 10 staff, with invitations emailed to everyone who worked in the building. Some guests were said to have dialled in by Zoom but others apparently attended in person and sat in groups of six, some wearing Christmas jumpers. A photograph later emerged in the Mirror of the prime minister taking part. 25 December 2020 – Christmas Day socialising The prime minister’s “bubble” has come under scrutiny before, after his spokesperson did not deny that Nimco Ali, a close friend of Carrie Johnson, stayed with them over Christmas. One of the explanations offered was that Ali was considered part of the Johnsons’ childcare bubble. However, under the rules, the arrangement was meant to be purely for a second household to look after children, with the adults not meant to be socialising.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/no-10-partying-in-lockdown-who-enjoyed-what-and-when;politics
4597;4597;4597;316;4653;4653;Outspoken Saudi princess returns home after nearly three years in jail;2022-01-09;['Martin Chulov'];['Saudi Arabia', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Mohammed bin Salman', 'King Salman', 'Human rights', 'World news'];"A Saudi princess and human rights advocate has returned to her home in Jeddah after three years in a state prison without charge, her supporters and lawyer have confirmed. Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 57, a staunch critic of her cousin and Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, was released on Saturday, along with her daughter, Souhoud Al Sharif, who was arrested with her in March 2019. Mystery surrounds the pair’s detention and release, which was met with silence by Saudi officials over the weekend. However, announcing her arrest on Twitter 13 months after she vanished, Princess Basmah claimed to have done no wrong and said she was facing “very critical” health issues. Her tweets in April 2020, which were apparently sent from detention, were quickly deleted. The move appeared to fit a pattern of the arrest of dozens of Saudi dissidents and attempts to spy on activists in exile. Saudi dissidents and rights activists say Basmah had been especially vocal about a crackdown on dissent and consolidation of power led by Prince Mohammed. She had also been critical of the kingdom’s treatment of women, who had little ability to shape their lives under the kingdom’s heavily restrictive guardianship laws – some of which have been revoked in the past three years. “She thought that her family connections would give her cover,” said one senior Saudi royal in exile. “But MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has locked up bigger family members than her.” They include two brothers of the incumbent monarch, King Salman, the crown prince’s father. A former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, remains under house arrest in the kingdom after being ousted by Mohammed. Basmah is the youngest child of the late King Saud, who ruled from 1953 to 1964.
In bulldozing through a reform agenda that has introduced a range of individual freedoms, Mohammed has at the same time consolidated power like few other Saudi leaders before him. A ruthless crackdown on dissent has been a centrepiece of his new regime, with critics, or political activists given no leeway and in some cases jailed indefinitely. Basmah’s legal adviser, Henri Estramant, confirmed on Saturday: “The two ladies were released from their arbitrary imprisonment, and arrived at their home in Jeddah on Thursday 6 January 2022. “The princess is doing fine but will be seeking medical expertise. She seems worn out but is in good spirits, and thankful to reunite with her sons in person.” Basmah was detained in al-Ha’ir prison, where numerous other political detainees have been held, including the activist Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent advocate of allowing women to drive in the kingdom. She was released in February last year and has not since spoken publicly about her ordeal, which her family has said involved physical abuse and torture. Several senior Saudi officials familiar with Mohammed’s thinking say he is sensitive to being seen as making concessions under political pressure, and wants reforms to be seen as a gift from on high, rather than bowing to demands. “Many of the things that are being demanded publicly are already being delivered,” one official said last September. “In the eyes of the leadership, [activists] went too far.” However, human rights groups and dissidents in exile insist that dissent remains fundamental to a functional society and that even by the standards of an absolute monarchy, the domestic fear surrounding Mohammed’s rule has been disturbing. “This is quite the police state now,” said one activist based in North America. “No one feels safe, and that’s how he likes it.” Basmah had been due to travel abroad for medical treatment around the time of her arrest and was informed after her detention that she was accused of trying to forge a passport, a close relative said at the time. The nature of her illness has never been disclosed.
Following her release, the rights group ALQST for Human Rights said: “She was denied the medical care she needed for a potentially life-threatening condition. At no point during her detention has any charge been levelled against her.” In written testimony to the UN in 2020, Basmah’s family said her detention was probably due in large part to her “record as an outspoken critic of abuses”. She was also deemed an ally of Mohammed bin Nayef, the written testimony added.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/outspoken-saudi-princess-released-after-nearly-three-years-in-jail;politics
4601;4601;4601;320;4657;4657;Raising a teenager is scary. Don’t be daunted and embrace the hard work | Andie Fox;2022-01-09;['Andie Fox'];['Parents and parenting', 'Family', 'Children'];"Raising my daughter through this teenage stage is scary and I don’t know if I will get through it These years in the thick of raising teenagers are a little like the first years of parenthood. You, once again, feel overwhelmed and incompetent. There is also the aloneness. Sometimes, when I admit to another parent that this is hard, harder than I expected, they lower their heads near mine and, with eyes widened, whisper urgently about something very worrying they are contending with as a parent. Their voices convey the relief of an honest conversation but also, the ache of big problems that cannot be immediately fixed for a child. The aloneness we felt when we were raising babies was about maintaining the facade that babies weren’t softening us too much or that the days were filled with nothing but joy. Now, the aloneness is about being discreet. Teenagers have a right to privacy and rebirth as they muddle along. While adolescent impulsiveness is entirely predictable, poor choices are still judged very harshly by the rest of the world. I do not know if the world is getting more complex to raise teenagers in or if it has long been this fraught. I don’t know, because like I said, no one talks about this part of parenting with much real honesty. I recently asked a close friend for advice. She was facing a tough time of her own as a mother, but she said, reassuringly, it is probably like that book we read over and over to our children when they were little: We’re Going on a Bear Hunt.
In the book, a young family go on an adventure to find a bear. The plot resembles the motivations you fabricate to keep the energy of small children up on long walks. We are walking, why? To find a bear, of course. When you are walking with small children even the simplest of walks present challenges. Every bit of mud or water that you manage to get through without a child falling over in it feels like an achievement. So, it always made sense to me that the book focuses more on the obstacles of the walk than the dangers of a bear. And each time the family is deterred by new terrain, the book repeats the mantra: we can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, we’ve got to go through it. When I used to read that story to my children, I assumed its appeal lay in the whimsical sense of drama and sing-song lessons in prepositions and spatial concepts. But maybe the book was written for parents? Rereading it as the mother of a 16-year-old daughter, it seems obvious that its true purpose is imprinting a script for living. And so, I now look with curiosity at the depictions of mother and daughter in the book. In one part of the story the family are making their way through an overgrown field. The mother and the little daughter, with their arms stretched towards one another, are holding hands but are swallowed chest-deep into long grass. Is the daughter showing her mother the way or is the mother helping her daughter through the grass? We cannot assume by this stage of parenting teenagers that we, as parents, always know what is best.
I am reminded of a quietly haunting poem by Lucille Clifton, My Mama moved among the days, describing the experience of being the child of a mother who is unravelling. The mother does her best – “she got us almost through the high grass” – before tragically succumbing to something terrible inside herself and running back into the grass alone. My own experience with mothering a teenage daughter is that there is a lot of push-pull. She still wants to hold my hand, but she is insistent that she knows the right way ahead through the long grass. So, when I look at that illustration in the Bear Hunt story, I see a mother trying to pull her daughter back from a dangerous course. I try to explain this fear to my daughter carefully, so as not to offend her. How it feels to not only be scared, as a parent, but also unexpectedly powerless. My daughter and I were walking our dogs off-leash, when I told her about a fear in the United States, real or imaginary, that dogs can be lured away from their owners by coyotes. Whether the dog follows a coyote for play or out of bravado, we cannot say, but the result is they underestimate the small, impish creature until finding themselves isolated and surrounded by a pack of them. Then, far from their owner’s protection, they are killed. Her mouth dropped in horror. That is how it sometimes feels to be a parent, I told her. I am trying to call you back, to warn you of the dangers in the world, but you are disappearing into the long grass.
Of course, my daughter is not like a pet. She is not mine; she is becoming her own person. And I deliberately sought not to raise my daughter to be too fearful of the world, lest she curb her participation in it as a young woman. But the youthful underestimation, my corresponding powerlessness and the collision of all this with a world not as kind as I hoped for my children are proving to be a daunting combination for me as a mother. What to do? When I am feeling engulfed, I remember the instruction of the book. The resistance and avoidance are their own pain. Reaching acceptance – that I will have to go through this and do the hard work involved – is the only way for me to get to the other side. My friend, if this is you too, I have these words for you: keep going. • Andie Fox is a freelance writer who writes about motherhood from a feminist perspective";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/10/raising-a-teenager-is-scary-dont-be-daunted-and-embrace-the-hard-work;business and economy

The book of the show is more than just excerpts from their best episodes. Instead, it’s one of those confidence-building self-help guides – using insight from guests such as Ant Middleton, Chris Hoy and Kelly Holmes – which focuses the mind on how to be your best, rather than the best. Pop psychology at its most obvious, but Humphrey and Hughes lay out some thought-provoking signposts to a more fruitful 2022. Luster Raven Leilani Pan Macmillan, £9.99, pp240 (paperback) The concept is intriguing: Edie, a young, black, New York artist, moves into her white fortysomething lover’s marital home in the suburbs, with all the tensions an open marriage brings. Meanwhile, Leilani makes piercing observations on race, sex and 21st-century city life. Yet for all the fresh and vital writing, Luster adopts a more elegant tone when exploring Edie’s relationship with her art and her lover’s wife.

Perhaps deliberately, this makes A Time Outside This Time less successful as a traditional novel with compelling characters and more an involving, long-form literary opinion piece.

4643;4643;4643;362;4699;4699;PM must commit to low taxes or risk losing next election, says David Frost;2022-01-09;['Rowena Mason'];['David Frost', 'Conservatives', 'Brexit', 'Politics', 'Boris Johnson', 'Tax and spending', 'UK news', 'European Union', 'Foreign policy', 'Europe'];Boris Johnson’s former Brexit minister who quit last month has warned him to commit to low taxes and the free market or risk losing the next election, as the prime minister comes under continuing pressure from the Conservative right. David Frost, a former lobbyist whom Johnson made his chief Brexit negotiator and later gave a peerage, said in his first major interview since quitting as a cabinet minister that the Tories needed to “focus on rebuilding the nation and be proud of our history”. Lord Frost resigned before Christmas, citing concerns about the direction of travel of the government, particularly over Covid rules. However, it also came at a difficult time for the UK’s negotiations with the EU, as it emerged that Britain was prepared to drop demands for EU judges to be stripped of their role in overseeing Northern Ireland. Since then, Frost has signalled his intention to join with others on the right of the Tory party, becoming a member of the so-called Covid Recovery Group, which is sceptical of restrictions and focused on getting the economy moving. The Tory peer told the Mail on Sunday: “We need to get the country going economically again and that means free markets, free debate and low taxes. “People need to look at this country and think: yes, something is changing here. You’ve got to set the direction of travel. If we’re going to get out of this little trough and win the election in a couple of years’ time, then we’ve got to develop that.” His demand for tax cuts comes amid growing unease among Thatcherite Tories about the government’s plans for a rise in national insurance contributions this April, which Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, pressed Johnson to scrap at cabinet this week. Frost also criticised the advisers around Johnson and joined the many Tory backbenchers calling for a shake-up of the No 10 team, while insisting he is still the right leader. “I think he probably needs better support around him in the team to deliver on that. The PM has a right, when he wants something to happen, for the levers that he pulls to actually produce something,” he said. “And he has the right to the best possible advice around him. So I think there needs to be machinery changes and there probably need to be some different voices around him to make sure that he gets the best possible advice.” Frost’s successor as chief negotiator with the EU is Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who warned in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph that she was just as prepared as him to trigger article 16 of the post-Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland if necessary. Truss said she would suggest “constructive proposals” to her EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, this week during their first face-to-face talks. However, she said she was “willing” to trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol – a move that would suspend parts of the treaty designed to prevent a hard border with the Republic – if a deal could not be struck. In response, the EU ambassador to the UK, João Vale de Almeida, said it was “not very helpful that we keep agitating the issue of article 16” and insisted that the EU was “eager to reconnect with the British government”. Vale de Almeida told Sky News: “We’ve heard this before from the government, so we’re not surprised. We are not too impressed. We still believe it’s not very helpful that we keep agitating the issue of article 16. I think what we should focus on – at least that’s where we are focused on – is trying to find solutions for difficulties in the implementation of the protocol.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/pm-boris-johnson-low-taxes-next-election-david-frost;politics

I had heard legendary stories about the ‘best ever’ hot chocolate and ‘giant churros’ and, fuelled by greed, made my way to where the shop was meant to be. We looked, but it wasn’t there, only discovering later that it had sold up and moved out East Lothian way and there was no Chocolate Tree shop front any more. A really good hot chocolate I could easily replicate at home, but I felt bitterly cheated by the lack of giant churros. Back home in England, I decided to order some Chocolate Tree merchandise. They do a great array of chocolate, from bars and boxes to spreads to dip-your-hand-in packets of chocolate-covered nuts and things, plus the aforementioned hot chocolate. I decided on a nut theme, selecting milk chocolate-covered almonds (£7.95, 200g), which were excellent and have become a daily staple, but had the almonds been blanched first they would have been even more excellent. I chose a dark chocolate coffee and hazelnut bar (£3.95, 100g), which ended up being my favourite – a lovely mix of what’s a quite unusual flavour combo with added cocoa nibs for crunch. The dairy-free gianduja (£5.95, 80g) was glorious, too. Just four ingredients, but the hazelnuts made it so creamy I had to constantly recheck the label for milk. I wish I’d been braver and gone for the haggis or winter-spice bars; chocolate covered corn crunchies also looked good.

4684;4684;4684;403;4740;4740;Will it be a happy new year? Depends who you are talking to… | Eva Wiseman;2022-01-09;['Eva Wiseman'];['Life and style'];This week I have been wishing people a happy new year so regularly and so earnestly that the phrase has chipped off in my mouth and come loose like a bad tooth. I need to put it together again, piece by piece. It requires elaboration, this year more than most, because a happy new year for me may be an entirely awful one for you, and if the pandemic has taught us anything beyond the benefits of opening a window, it is clear and present empathy. So, to clarify: Happy new year to you if you’re a parent of a primary school-age kid. Yours has been a year lived as if sleeping with one hand in warm water, leaping up desperately at regular intervals convinced you’ve pissed yourself. Being the parent of a young child is stressful at the best of times. At the worst of times it is a struggle akin to trying to cross a motorway in bare feet after too much coffee. The year 2020 saw you teaching them trigraphs while nodding along to a Zoom meeting on mute. Then 2021 saw you watching their classmates’ positive test results flash up on your WhatsApp while nodding along to a Zoom meeting on mute. As you gratefully offered your arm for a vaccine, then another, then another little one for luck, each sharp scratch a little crumb of Valium, your young children were still waiting for their first. Were trotting alongside you, reeling off facts about photosynthesis or how to make purple, every now and then stopping to quietly note the unmasked status of a stranger. Were waking in the middle of the night from surreal nightmares where death arrived on a crowded bus or where they were the monster. It was not a case of whether Covid would visit your house, it was a case of when. Where’s Covid? Is it behind the tree? No! Is it under the rug? No! Is it sweeping through the school canteen like the smell of chips? You’ll find out on Friday. I wish you a new year of vaccinations and small relaxations, and a gradual slowing of your very tapping leg. Happy new year if you’re a Tory MP. Can’t be worse than last year can it? Happy new year if you’re the owner of a lockdown pet. It was a good idea. No! No, it was, it was a good idea. You made the right choice. You did! You did. It’s going to be fine. This year your cat will stop staring at you with those “how dare you?” eyes. Your new sofa will not be gutted like the last, which you rose one morning to find disembowelled, its foamy guts now strewn across the carpet, the cat surveying the devastation from her post on the counter. This year your puppy will listen when you say, “Down!”, will not take it as a challenge to see how many steaks he can grab from the table, will not reply at a volume that causes neighbours to stick livid little notes through your letterbox, will not whine like Veruca Salt. This year your allergy will disappear, your eyes will dry, your itches cease. Your dog will finally become comfortable around men with beards, simply sitting quietly and allowing them to talk to you in the street, the urge to protect you from their aggressive facial hair by leaping up and barking like a fire alarm having passed by mid-Jan. The pressure of having to train and manage them will this year be eclipsed by the comfort of their warm body and hot meat breath. Their grand love will bury the burden like a bone. Happy new year if you’re self-isolating. The stages of self-isolation – anger, fear, boredom, cheese – became blurry the second or third time round and now, as a new year breaks like an egg on your forehead, the feeling is one of cold, white numbness. Long ago you stopped arguing with the internet, shouting at the prime minister that before telling us to get tested and self-isolate it was his responsibility to make sure we had the ability and support to do either. That our “resilience” is running low. It is tempting to slip into familiar psychological patterns of doom, where feelings of pointlessness and anxiety dance badly together across the filthy kitchen table, but I wish you a happy new year, where isolation breeds, not quiet, but creativity. Whether you’re alone or among an overheated family, I wish you… OK not a whole year, too intimidating, but instead a series of hours that spread into days then months, where you’re able to replace the discontent of lockdown with moments of meditative peace, cosiness, time spent counting your various and disparate blessings, before returning to something quite good on TV. Happy new year if you’re a new variant. Ah, come in, we’ve been expecting you. Good journey? Sorry – no spikes on in the house. If you wouldn’t mind just snapping off that one, and that one, yes, all of them off, sorry. Sorry! And then if you just want to pop through to the boiling vat of drugs we’ll meet you in there in a sec. Yep, just behind you. See you in there.

4686;4686;4686;405;4742;4742;Hanya Yanagihara: ‘I have the right to write about whatever I want’;2022-01-09;['Claire Armitstead'];['Hanya Yanagihara', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Fiction'];"Hanya Yanagihara’s debut novel taught her not to give up her day job as a travel writer and editor. The People in the Trees was the story of a scientist jailed for sexually abusing children he adopted during his Nobel-winning research on a Pacific island. It impressed reviewers with its exhaustive inventiveness and its refusal to offer redemption or solace, but sold only a few thousand copies when it was published in 2013. Two years later, the Manhattan-based writer released a novel that was twice as long and even less forgiving. It was about the fallout, among four college friends, from the appalling childhood sexual abuse of one of their group, and it hit the jackpot, becoming one of those vanishingly rare literary break-outs. Victoria Beckham and Dua Lipa declared themselves fans, while an equally passionate group of readers condemned it as gratuitous, even “evil”. A Little Life sold a quarter of a million print copies in the UK alone, where it was shortlisted for the Booker and the Women’s prize for fiction. But far from giving up her day job, Yanagihara took on a bigger one, as editor-in-chief of T, the New York Times style magazine. When we meet up, at an upmarket London hotel in October, she is combining a whistlestop publicity trip for her third novel, To Paradise, with two weeks of European fashion shows that have left her with “a mysterious illness” which, she hastens to add, is definitely not Covid. The jaunt is a twice-yearly ritual: menswear and furniture shows the spring and summer, then women’s ready-to-wear in the autumn. “I do New York, Milan and Paris, and I always end up getting sick. Usually it’s a cold or flu, so this is a new one for me,” she says, brandishing hands flushed with tiny red spots. She is determined not to let her mystery ailment get in the way of a promotional campaign that began six months earlier when news of To Paradise was teased to the book trade. “Do you remember where you were when you finished A Little Life? And where were you when you heard that Hanya Yanagihara’s new novel arrives next year? Right here,” tweeted Waterstones at the time – an enthusiasm rewarded by Yanagihara in proof copies of To Paradise, with a personal note of thanks to all the booksellers who had pressed her work into readers’ hands.
Like its predecessor, To Paradise is a brick of a book that checks in at well over 700 pages and is set largely in New York. But there the similarity ends. This is a very different city, which is seen in three different iterations in a trio of time zones. There’s perhaps another motive behind Yanagihara’s note to the booksellers: until you get the hang of it, which takes the length of an ordinary-sized novel, it’s all a bit disorientating, not least because – for reasons to do with its preoccupation with inherited privilege – the protagonists in all three timezones are all named David, Edward and Charles/Charlie Bingham. It is, however, most definitely worth hanging on in. “It’s a mature masterpiece, which makes A Little Life look overcaffeinated,” says veteran novelist Edmund White, who emerged as an early champion with a Facebook post that To Paradise was “as good as War and Peace”.
In the first section we’re in 1893, at the heart of fin-de-siècle society with clear Jamesian resonances (it centres on a big family house in Washington Square), except that this New York is a breakaway republic where same-sex marriage is the norm. “I’d always wanted to write a marriage story, but marriage stories are about money, and I wondered, if you wrote one that wasn’t about gender norms, and gender rules, what would that marriage story be? And beyond that, what would that history be?” says Yanagihara. In the second section we move to 1993, where an unnamed plague is laying waste to the complacency of the next generation of Davids, Charleses and Edwards. In the third section we’re in a dystopian 2093 where the personal and social freedoms of David, Charles and his granddaughter Charlie have been sacrificed to the demands of controlling wave upon wave of pandemics. It’s all scarily plausible: a “what if?” novel combined with a “what when?” one, I suggest. “And what is,” says Yanagihara. What it is not, though, is a response to Covid. She had the idea of the novel in 2016 and started researching it in earnest shortly after the election of Donald Trump, at a point when “history suddenly started to move very quickly, raising questions about whether we were who we had always thought we were”. She can’t explain why she started interviewing scientists about the probability and likely consequences of the next pandemic. “But I can say that it didn’t arise from any special oracular powers,” she wrote in her note to booksellers. By the time New York was locked down, the novel’s structure, characters and themes were in place, the first part was finished and the other two were partly written. “Of course, it would occasionally strike me as strange that I was writing about this pandemic in the midst of one, but not terribly,” she says. “And listen, there’s no way to say this without sounding completely heartless, but Covid really gave me a lot of time. It was not an anxious period for me, because I was extremely lucky to have a job that I knew was secure. I had health insurance, I had savings. I had a place to live that was safe. And suddenly, as someone who needs eight or nine hours’ sleep a night, I had time.” After the taxonomical precision of The People in the Trees, where scientific identification and naming is central, and the introversion of A Little Life – in which external history is airbrushed out, leaving no distraction from the agonies and ecstasies of Jude, JB, Willem and Malcolm, over three decades – the bleaching out of identity associated with names in To Paradise is particularly striking. One of the Davids is actually a descendant of Hawaiian royalty, the reluctant centre of a running argument about sovereignty and the appropriation of people and objects. Nor is this anonymity limited to the novel’s characters: in the world of the 19th-century Binghams, there is no word for “gay”, while the diseases that sweep through the later sections are never named. It’s a bold formal move for a writer whose breakout readership is likely to be expecting another agonised circle of friends. For Yanagihara this play with naming represents one of many negotiations with America’s idea of itself. “We’re often renaming things in the United States, either to eradicate a bad memory or to try to dissociate it from a person who history has not treated kindly or who deserves to be treated with more respect. There’s this idea that naming something changes the fundamental nature of it, but does naming who we are make us more real to others? Or is it simply a way of making ourselves more real to ourselves? Above all, To Paradise offers a profound challenge to the idea of democratic society. The very concept of paradise, she says, is that it is not for everyone but for the chosen few. “The idea of sacrifice for a kind of freedom, the idea of personal freedom, as opposed to social freedom, the idea of a freedom for some, but not for all – these are questions that are integral to the founding, and continuation, of America.” The current disarray around management of wave after wave of Covid pandemic bears out her point, giving the novel a shadow that seems to have warped and elongated even in the two months since I first read it. This is particularly true of its chilling representation of a young woman whose independence, and capacity to make adult relationships, have been sacrificed by her doctor grandfather to the task of keeping her alive. Did Yanagihara have any qualms about being seen as playing to the anti-vax gallery? “I didn’t think about it that way,” she says firmly. “My father’s an oncologist. He doesn’t treat children, but there are certain forms of treatment, as I understand it, that save children while really hurting them and causing long-term complications: I was thinking about the sacrifice that Grandfather, and unwittingly Charlie, end up making for her life. He has a much colder and more clinical idea of meaningful life until she gets sick.”
For all this book’s differences from Yanagihara’s previous novels, all three have one striking thing in common: they barely touch on the consciousness of women. Rendered infertile and perpetually childlike by the antidote to the virus, Charlie has little agency. Why such an absence? “You know,” says Yanagihara, “after you’ve written your third book, certain patterns and motifs begin to announce themselves that you’re not conscious of. Sometimes they have to do with your biography, but sometimes they don’t. I don’t know why there’s a grandparent in each one of these books, because I wasn’t close to my grandparents. There are no mothers in any of my books, and I’m not sure why, because I have a perfectly fine relationship with my mother. There are very few women and again I’m not really sure why, but there’s always disease and the body falling apart. The short answer is I’m not sure why Charlie is the only woman.” If one were to go down the psychoanalytical route, one could cite the many interviews in which she has spoken extensively of the influence of her father, who – when she displayed an interest in art at the age of 10 – took her to a pathologist’s lab so that she could draw a cadaver. “I was always interested in the disease, not the human,” she told one interviewer. “I always say that my father came from the last generation of quasi-intellectual men who were completely open and saying that they expected one thing from their daughter, and another thing from their wife,” she says now. “I didn’t want to be a wife and a mother, and was probably very dismissive of the lessons my mother had to teach me, which I regret. And so I deliberately never learned how to do certain things like cook or clean. And as a teenager everything seems like such a binary: you would either be at home cooking and cleaning, or you would be out doing what you wanted, and I wanted to be out doing what I wanted.” * * * Yanagihara was born in Los Angeles, one of two children, to a family that had lived in Hawaii for three generations but were not of Hawaiian blood. Her childhood was itinerant, following her father’s jobs across the US, though she spent three high-school years at the private school in Honolulu that Barack Obama had attended a decade earlier. Punahou School was founded on land given to an American missionary called Bingham, whose grandson, an explorer turned US senator, is listed among its famous alumni (all the surnames in the novel, it turns out, are from prominent 19th-century missionary families in Hawaii). Does she feel American? “Yes, 100%,” she says, though she has Japanese ancestry and considers Japan to be “the country of my heart”. Travelling abroad, she admits, disarmingly, “is a process of constant humiliation. I feel very gauche most of the time. This ugly American behaviour which I can see in myself is kind of what people expect. Especially if you are a non-white American, you will never feel more American than that when you go back to the country of your ancestry, as I do to Japan.” In Hawaii, she grew up at the height of the sovereignty movement with parents who were “classic liberal boomers” and favoured the less radical state-within-a-state solution. In the second section of To Paradise, a range of hopelessly naive separatist movements lay claim to the islands. “I hope the book offers no moral judgment about a craving to return to this era in which things seemed simpler and more noble and respectful. It only says something about how hard it is to try to go back, when history is always in the way,” she says. The Bingham house is stuffed with Hawaii artefacts, which become part of a larger conversation about the ethics of protectiveness: or, as she puts it, “who gets to decide what’s best for people and for cultures”.
There’s an unflinchingness in Yanagihara’s writing that can seem gratuitously punishing – a reminder of the little girl who was more interested in disease than people. By the third section of To Paradise, Hawaii has been destroyed. In A Little Life, she pushed the torture and self-flagellation of lawyer Jude so far that some readers recoiled while others hung on in horrified fascination. “This book and its champions seem bound to each other by their mutual disgust and discomfort,” wrote Daniel Mendelsohn in the New York Review. “It’s rare to encounter literary discussion of such dissonant zeal, such enthralled distress,” observed the Australian critic Beejay Silcox, in an essay summarising the Little Life phenomenon. How did Yanagihara herself feel about inspiring such strong feelings? “I don’t read anything about my books and I’m not on Twitter, which is, as I understand it, where the majority of these conversations tend to get slugged out,” she says. She is particularly impatient with the #ownvoice movement, which might question her right, as a woman, to tell the stories of gay men. “It’s very dangerous. I have the right to write about whatever I want. The only thing a reader can judge is whether I have done so well or not.” While A Little Life was a dark adolescent fairy story of a group of friends who attempt to hold historical institutional evil at bay by making their own family, To Paradise takes a more history-hardened view of relationships. People always ultimately choose their family over friends, asserts one of the Charleses. Though Yanagihara says that she disagrees with that position, I wonder how much – as someone who is resolutely single and lives alone – her own idea of friendship has altered during the pandemic. “I think if people did live with someone, whether it was their partner, their family, or so on, they almost always prioritised those people over their friends,” she says. Does that mean she personally lost friends? “It led to some meaningful conversations,” she replies, “…and then there were friends who I became much closer to.” She is wearing a chunky gold necklace featuring her star sign, Virgo, given to her by a friend who is the artistic director of a leading couture house. “I don’t have family,” she says, correcting herself a beat later to: “I do, but they’re in Hawaii and they’re fine.” (She spent two Covid summers there, watching the wildlife return to tourist-bare beaches and disappear again as the industry returned.) Her point, she clarifies, is “I think people divided according to grades of fear, and who they had to protect”.
It’s hard to imagine how the 47-year-old author manages to combine such a high-profile, jet-setting job with writing such big books, but she says that being the boss has its advantages, as everything works around you. “I’m not the smartest or hardest-working or most educated person, but I am the best at time management,” she says. “It’s a skill that I’ve worked hard to develop, which is not to say that I’m disciplined. I’m not really that disciplined. But once I set aside time for myself, I know how to sit down and use it.” And besides, she adds, journalism has made a valuable contribution to her writing: “It teaches you to be respectful of grammar and spelling, which sounds like a small thing, but really isn’t. It teaches you structure, which I think is an underrated skill. It teaches you how to turn things in on time. And it teaches you that at a certain point, you have to let it go.” After three novels, her project is becoming clear: as Edmund White puts it, she is chronicling her country just as panoramically as Tolstoy did his, with a similar confidence that the story is interesting. “I’ve really thought about how young America is as a nation,” says Yanagihara. “Despite the frustration and despair – even in countries like France, which pretend they don’t care about it – there is such an admiration for America. It’s our vitality, our childlike qualities, you know – our optimism and generosity, but also our spoiltness, our tantrum-throwing, our inwardness, our myopia. I really do think of it as a precocious and quite bratty child, heading into adolescence: every quality that you would admire in that child and every quality that will frustrate you exists within America as well.” The issues to which America is now applying this adolescent brattiness are undeniably global. “The arguments we’re having about vaccine mandates; the ones we’re having about the kinds of sacrifices we might make to effect greater global change and deal with the climate crisis; the ones that involve a reframing of history, especially when it comes to race and immigration. Those questions feel more urgent now because the threat is much more intense, especially when it comes to climate change and disease,” says Yanagihara. They are questions that fiction needs to address, because there are no easy answers in fact. To Paradise is published by Pan Macmillan on 11 January (£20).

4687;4687;4687;406;4743;4743;Boiling Point review – Stephen Graham is on fire in nerve-jangling night in hell’s kitchen;2022-01-09;['Mark Kermode'];['Drama films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Stephen Graham'];"Movies that have the appearance of being filmed in a single continuous take usually raise two questions. First, is this actually a “one-shot” production (and if not, can you see the joins)? Second, does the format actively benefit the drama or is it merely a gimmick? Alfred Hitchcock famously referred to his experimental 1948 stage-to-screen adaptation of Rope as a “stunt”, and admitted to François Truffaut: “I really don’t know how I came to indulge in it.” More than six decades later, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s wildly overrated 2015 best picture Oscar-winner Birdman felt similarly indulgent – technically dazzling but ultimately hollow. Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay actor turned director Philip Barantini’s low-budget Brit pic Boiling Point (co-written with James Cummings) is to say that I frequently forgot I was watching a brilliantly orchestrated one-shot film. Not that the format isn’t effective – far from it. It’s utterly immersive, conjuring the raw experience of an inexorably accelerating panic attack. Yet, like the 2015 German thriller Victoria, which was similarly captured in an authentic single take, this is first and foremost a gripping and gritty drama in which the spiralling descent of the narrative is enhanced and enriched by uninterrupted digital photography.
Stephen Graham, who was so brilliant in last year’s BBC mini-series Time, and who gets an executive producer credit here, is on fire as Andy Jones, the already rattled head chef whose world is teetering on the brink of chaos. We first meet him scurrying through the crepuscular streets of London – late for work and ensconced in some on-the-hoof phone pleading that succinctly establishes the collapse of his family life. In the restaurant kitchen where his arrival is overdue, stalwart team leader Carly (Bifa winner Vinette Robinson) and her exasperated colleague Freeman (Ray Panthaki) are holding the fort, something that’s clearly become an increasingly common situation of late – another deftly delivered detail. Andy is overwrought (the Friday-before-Christmas rush is upon them), and swearily takes his stress out on others, his anxiety levels stoked by a visit from a patronisingly pernickety environmental health officer. Meanwhile, out in the restaurant, a rogues gallery of customers must be served. They range from a gaggle of social media influencers who are indulged rather than ejected, to an irate, racist patriarch performatively throwing his weight around on table seven. As for the soon-to-be engaged couple on table 13, they’ve flagged up a nut allergy that needs to be prioritised by the already overworked staff. And then there is Alistair Skye, a celebrity chef to whom Andy is uncomfortably indebted, played with brilliantly passive-aggressive smarm by Jason Flemyng. On the surface, Alistair is all smiles, assuring Andy that “we’re here to support you”, and insisting that he needn’t worry about the feared food critic with whom he has arrived (“You don’t need my endorsement, there’s such a buzz in this place!”). Yet soon enough, Alistair is taking credit for Andy’s menu (“I recognise all these dishes”) and offering smug serving suggestions (“Could I just get a little ramekin dish with some za’atar?”) while making increasingly threatening noises that reveal a deeper, more desperate purpose.
Bifa-winning director of photography Matthew Lewis (who also shot the 2019 short from which this feature was born) leads us with superbly unobtrusive skill through this wholly believable hectic world. It’s a world in which everyone has a story, from the nervous young saucier hiding his forearms beneath untucked sleeves, to the game-faced maître d’ weepily phoning her father from the toilets, and the cocky chancer indulging in covert backstreet liaisons by the bins. Subplots about overdue pay increases and overstretched ambitions swirl amid the cacophony of standoffs and service bells (plaudits to the sound team), each thread skilfully interwoven into a complex mosaic of individual voices, all rising to a single scream. The result is a spicy nerve-jangler served with a chargrilled side order of jet-black gallows humour – a divine comedy barrelling towards inevitable tragedy, played out in hell’s kitchen where someone is bound to get burned.

4691;4691;4691;410;4747;4747;Art historian discovers that £65 painting on his wall is work of Flemish master;2022-01-09;['Dalya Alberge'];['Van Dyck', 'Painting', 'Art and design', 'Art', 'Culture', 'UK news'];"As a leading art historian, Christopher Wright has uncovered several old master paintings in public and private collections over five decades. Now he has discovered that a copy of a painting by Sir Anthony van Dyck, which he bought for himself for £65 in 1970, may actually be an original by the 17th-century Flemish court painter to King Charles I. “I bought it from a jobbing dealer in west London,” he said. “I was buying it as a copy, as an art historian. I took no notice of it, in a strange way. The syndrome is the cobbler’s children are the worst shod. So the art historian’s collection is the least looked at.” Wright estimated the painting might be worth around £40,000, although some Van Dycks have fetched seven-figure sums. The painting, a portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia, Infanta of Spain and Regentess of the Spanish Netherlands, has been hanging in his sitting room for years. Now, having realised its significance, he wants it to go to a public institution. He is putting it on permanent loan to the Cannon Hall Museum, Barnsley, which boasts a collection of fine 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings. Wright’s previous discoveries include a Stubbs portrait in the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, and his publications include studies of 17th-century artists such as Rembrandt.
He looked at the infanta’s portrait more closely only after it caught the eye of a visitor to his home, Colin Harrison, senior curator of European Art at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. “He comes to see me. We chat. He says, ‘I really think your picture is by Van Dyck,’’’ said Wright. “When you own something, you don’t take any notice of it. It was the sitter’s hands that set it off. That’s what Colin noticed.” Harrison recalled: “In the normal way of a museum curator, Iimmediately was looking around the walls. It seemed to me that this was an interesting and possibly good picture [and] that, if you got the hands right, Van Dyck may very well have painted them.” When buying it, Wright had assumed that it was one of numerous copies of Van Dyck’s infanta portraits in various formats, including full, three-quarter and half-length versions. His is half-length, an oil on canvas measuring 81.5cm by 70.5cm. In each, she appears in a nun’s habit, signalling her mourning and piety after the death of her husband, Archduke Albert VII of Austria, in 1621. She became Regentess of the Netherlands and ruled in her own right until her death in 1633, abandoning the lavish jewellery and clothing in which she had been painted in her younger days. Wright acknowledged that she had been a pious woman, a good administrator and an arts patron, but he never particularly liked the portrait. “My nickname for it was ‘Er Indoors’ after Rumpole of the Bailey. She’s a kind of doom-ridden personality.”[See Footnote]. But, inspired by Harrison, he took it to the Courtauld Institute of Art in central London, where it has been examined and restored. “It was dirty and had yellow varnish, but it was in decent condition,” he said. “The whole thing looks absolutely magnificent now.”
It is thought to date from between 1628 and 1632. Van Dyck had by then worked in England for King James I and as court painter to the infanta and, in 1632, he returned to England, where Charles I appointed him “principalle Paynter” and knighted him. The Courtauld’s report, by Kendall Francis and Timothy McCall, notes that Van Dyck and his workshop produced many such infanta portraits and that it can be “very challenging” to determine the extent to which assistants were involved. They conclude: “The adroit skill leads us to tentatively propose that [it] can be attributed to Van Dyck’s workshop and that it was completed during his lifetime and under his supervision.” Wright noted that, while some believe that the half-length version in the Walker art gallery, Liverpool, is by Van Dyck, “that is not an opinion held by the Walker”, whose online description refers to it as from Van Dyck’s studio and “possibly” the artist. Discussing the qualities of his version, he said: “The hands are beautiful. When it’s a studio execution, the hands, they can’t do them. The structure of the face is right, her clothes are beautifully done. There’s no copyist busy here.” • This footnote was added on 14 January 2022. The nickname ‘Er Indoors’ is not “after Rumpole of the Bailey” but was used by the character Arthur Daley to refer to his wife in the TV series Minder.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/09/art-historian-discovers-that-65-painting-on-his-wall-is-work-of-flemish-master;entertainment and culture

In episode four, the recently widowed Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) returns to her old bachelor-girl flat, a place she kept on (because she is rich) untenanted after her marriage. There, having slept soundly for the first time in weeks, she pulls on a long tulle skirt that makes her look a bit like a fairy, and heads out to her local bodega to pick up a free coffee from its kindly owner. There is, we can’t help but notice, a spring in her step now, and thus the hapless viewer receives the message loud and clear. Happiness, it would seem, is only a simple matter of determination. Stride briskly on in your favourite outlandish clothes, a paper cup in your right hand and a mobile phone in your left, and daily rapture will be yours. In her new book, I Came All This Way to Meet You: Writing Myself Home, the American novelist Jami Attenberg has a lot to say about writing; ostensibly, her first work of nonfiction is determined to stare hardest at the creative life, and all that such an existence involves (in summary: a lot of hard work, a certain amount of luck, and very little cash). As the daughter of a travelling salesman, she’s interested, too, in a certain kind of transience. For many years, she found it hard to settle. Attenberg was 45 before she owned a bed; she once slept in 26 different places in seven months. In the end, however, she just can’t help herself. The truth must be told.
Ultimately, her memoir is about what it is like not to have, nor even much to want, all the things that are supposed to make a woman complete. If it is wonderful to be free – to be the kind of unicorn that judges yourself, not according to the putrid benchmarks of a sexist society, but by your own standards – this doesn’t mean that it isn’t also, sometimes, painful. For Attenberg, as for Carrie Bradshaw, happiness and being alone are not mutually exclusive. But as she also notes, expressing such a truth in public for the first time may still “feel like a specific kind of death”. Her memoir is, in other words, a powerful antidote to pernicious fantasies of the tulle-skirt-and-soya-latte kind. I don’t mean it as a criticism when I say that Attenberg’s book has an untidy, artless structure. Yes, its narrative, which moves repeatedly back and forth in time, is often in danger of seeming repetitive, and perhaps it comes with one too many Zoom meetings (it is something of a pandemic book, I think). But such restlessness reflects its subject matter: the sublets that come and go; the thousands of miles travelled in pursuit of minuscule sales at bookshop readings (it wasn’t until 2013, when her fourth novel, The Middlesteins, appeared on the New York Times bestseller list, that Attenberg had anything even approaching a literary hit). When success arrives at last, our one-time couch surfer finds that she cannot say no, and thanks to this she attends literary festivals all over the world, and teaches creative writing in Vilnius, Lithuania. Flying causes her intense anxiety, but still she does it, relying on Xanax “borrowed” from friends – she has so many! – to see her through.
What she needs, she comes to realise, as the “vibrations” of her youth begin at last to subside, is a home. She doesn’t want carpets strewn with toys; marital cosiness (smugness?) isn’t for her. But there is a moment, staying with a friend in Evanston, Illinois, when she considers the contents of a family-size refrigerator – six packs of yoghurt, freshly squeezed juice, an entire drawer devoted to cheese – and experiences a pang of envy. Where is her place? For a long time, it will be a loft in (pre-gentrification) Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a ramshackle cavern, all thin walls and exposed pipes, described in a love letter that is one of the best pieces of writing in her book. Finally, though, this won’t do. It’s in New Orleans that she will buy a room of her own, one that comes with a view of hummingbirds and loquat trees. The resistance you detect in her as she writes of this beloved house – she always had a room of her own in her head, she insists – only makes this the sweeter as you read of it. Similarly, her cheeriness – her absolute disdain for self-pity – only serves to make the sad parts of her book seem the more plangent. Those who love Attenberg’s novels – for me, All Grown Up (2017) is one of the best, most spirited and most enjoyable books ever written about a mostly single woman – will recognise her tone here, even if parts of this work do border on self-obsession (not that I particularly blame her for being self-obsessed; this, too, is something society forces on women, for we can never live up to expectations, falling back always on self-recrimination, self-improvement and, worst of all, hour-by-hour analyses of our moods). Attenberg recounts it all – the bad men, and the bad friends, the sexual assaults and the restaurants that won’t provide a table for one – in a way that is at once a kind of reckoning, as dramatic as this sounds, and effortlessly casual. Haven’t these things happened to all women? If they’re grave, they are also quotidian.
She’s very funny, and it’s this that makes her marvellous. When a man with whom she’s about to have sex for the first time – “we made our way towards nudity” – suddenly produces a brown paper bag in bed, all she can wonder is whether there’s a sandwich in it. In fact, it contains an unrequested sex toy. I laughed out loud at this. Here is the kind of determination I favour. Life is funny and grim (or, if you prefer, grimly funny). Forget this and, like the writers now desperately trying to make Sarah Jessica Parker relevant again, you’ve got what Attenberg would doubtless call Bad Art. • I Came All This Way to Meet You: Writing Myself Home by Jami Attenberg is published by Serpent’s Tail (£14.99).

4703;4703;4703;422;4759;4759;Is the US really heading for a second civil war?;2022-01-09;['David Smith'];['US politics', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'American civil war', 'US Capitol attack'];"Joe Biden had spent a year in the hope that America could go back to normal. But last Thursday, the first anniversary of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, the president finally recognised the full scale of the current threat to American democracy. “At this moment, we must decide,” Biden said in Statuary Hall, where rioters had swarmed a year earlier. “What kind of nation are we going to be? Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?”
It is a question that many inside America and beyond are now asking. In a deeply divided society, where even a national tragedy such as 6 January only pushed people further apart, there is fear that that day was the just the beginning of a wave of unrest, conflict and domestic terrorism. A slew of recent opinion polls shows a significant minority of Americans at ease with the idea of violence against the government. Even talk of a second American civil war has gone from fringe fantasy to media mainstream. “Is a Civil War ahead?” was the blunt headline of a New Yorker magazine article this week. “Are We Really Facing a Second Civil War?” posed the headline of a column in Friday’s New York Times. Three retired US generals wrote a recent Washington Post column warning that another coup attempt “could lead to civil war”. The mere fact that such notions are entering the public domain shows the once unthinkable has become thinkable, even though some would argue it remains firmly improbable. The anxiety is fed by rancour in Washington, where Biden’s desire for bipartisanship has crashed into radicalized Republican opposition. The president’s remarks on Thursday – “I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy” – appeared to acknowledge that there can be no business as usual when one of America’s major parties has embraced authoritarianism.
Illustrating the point, almost no Republicans attended the commemorations as the party seeks to rewrite history, recasting the mob who tried to overturn Trump’s election defeat as martyrs fighting for democracy. Tucker Carlson, the most watched host on the conservative Fox News network, refused to play any clips of Biden’s speech, arguing that 6 January 2021 “barely rates as a footnote” historically because “really not a lot happened that day”. With the cult of Trump more dominant in the Republican party than ever, and radical rightwing groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys on the march, some regard the threat to democracy as greater now than it was a year ago. Among those raising the alarm is Barbara Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of a new book, How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them. Walter previously served on the political instability taskforce, an advisory panel to the CIA, which had a model to predict political violence in countries all over the world – except the US itself. Yet with the rise of Trump’s racist demagoguery, Walter, who has studied civil wars for 30 years, recognized telltale signs on her own doorstep. One was the emergence of a government that is neither fully democratic nor fully autocratic – an “anocracy”. The other is a landscape devolving into identity politics where parties no longer organise around ideology or specific policies but along racial, ethnic or religious lines. Walter told the Observer: “By the 2020 elections, 90% of the Republican party was now white. On the taskforce, if we were to see that in another multiethnic, multi-religious country which is based on a two-party system, this is what we would call a super faction, and a super faction is particularly dangerous.” Not even the gloomiest pessimist is predicting a rerun of the 1861-65 civil war with a blue army and red army fighting pitched battles. “It would look more like Northern Ireland and what Britain experienced, where it’s more of an insurgency,” Walter continued. “It would probably be more decentralized than Northern Ireland because we have such a large country and there are so many militias all around the country.”
“They would turn to unconventional tactics, in particular terrorism, maybe even a little bit of guerrilla warfare, where they would target federal buildings, synagogues, places with large crowds. The strategy would be one of intimidation and to scare the American public into believing that the federal government isn’t capable of taking care of them.” A 2020 plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, could be a sign of things to come. Walter suggests that opposition figures, moderate Republicans and judges deemed unsympathetic might all become potential assassination targets. “I could also imagine situations where militias, in conjunction with law enforcement in those areas, carve out little white ethnostates in areas where that’s possible because of the way power is divided here in the United States. It would certainly not look anything like the civil war that happened in the 1860s.” Walter notes that most people tend to assume civil wars are started by the poor or oppressed. Not so. In America’s case, it is a backlash from a white majority destined to become a minority by around 2045, an eclipse symbolized by Barack Obama’s election in 2008. The academic explained: “The groups that tend to start civil wars are the groups that were once dominant politically but are in decline. They’ve either lost political power or they’re losing political power and they truly believe that the country is theirs by right and they are justified in using force to regain control because the system no longer works for them.” A year after the 6 January insurrection, the atmosphere on Capitol Hill remains toxic amid a breakdown of civility, trust and shared norms. Several Republican members of Congress received menacing messages, including a death threat, after voting for an otherwise bipartisan infrastructure bill that Trump opposed.
The two Republicans on the House of Representatives select committee investigating the 6 January attack, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, face calls to be banished from their party. Democrat Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Somali-born Muslim, has suffered Islamophobic abuse. Yet Trump’s supporters argue that they are the ones fighting to save democracy. Last year Congressman Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina said: “If our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place and that’s bloodshed.” Last month Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has bemoaned the treatment of 6 January defendants jailed for their role in the attack, called for a “national divorce” between blue and red states. Democrat Ruben Gallego responded forcefully: “There is no ‘National Divorce’. Either you are for civil war or not. Just say it if you want a civil war and officially declare yourself a traitor.” There is also the prospect of Trump running for president again in 2024. Republican-led states are imposing voter restriction laws calculated to favour the party while Trump loyalists are seeking to take charge of running elections. A disputed White House race could make for an incendiary cocktail. James Hawdon, director of the Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention at Virginia Tech university, said: “I don’t like to be an alarmist, but the country has been moving more and more toward violence, not away from it. Another contested election may have grim consequences.” Although most Americans have grown up taking its stable democracy for granted, this is also a society where violence is the norm, not the exception, from the genocide of Native Americans to slavery, from the civil war to four presidential assassinations, from gun violence that takes 40,000 lives a year to a military-industrial complex that has killed millions overseas. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “America is not unaccustomed to violence. It is a very violent society and what we’re talking about is violence being given an explicit political agenda. That’s a kind of terrifying new direction in America.” While he does not currently foresee political violence becoming endemic, Jacobs agrees that any such unravelling would also be most likely to resemble Northern Ireland’s Troubles.
“We would see these episodic, scattered terrorist attacks,” he added. “The Northern Ireland model is the one that frankly most fear because it doesn’t take a huge number of people to do this and right now there are highly motivated, well-armed groups. The question is, has the FBI infiltrated them sufficiently to be able to knock them out before they launch a campaign of terror?” “Of course, it doesn’t help in America that guns are prevalent. Anyone can get a gun and you have ready access to explosives. All of this is kindling for the precarious position we now find ourselves in.” Nothing, though, is inevitable. Biden also used his speech to praise the 2020 election as the greatest demonstration of democracy in US history with a record 150 million-plus people voting despite a pandemic. Trump’s bogus challenges to the result were thrown out by what remains a robust court system and scrutinised by what remains a vibrant civil society and media. In a reality check, Josh Kertzer, a political scientist at Harvard University, tweeted: “I know a lot of civil war scholars, and … very few of them think the United States is on the precipice of a civil war.” And yet the assumption that “it can’t happen here,” is as old as politics itself. Walter has interviewed many survivors about the lead-up to civil wars. “What everybody said, whether they were in Baghdad or Sarajevo or Kiev, was we didn’t see it coming,” she recalled. “In fact, we weren’t willing to accept that anything was wrong until we heard machine gun fire in the hillside. And by that time, it was too late.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/is-the-us-really-heading-for-a-second-civil-war;politics

We have been exiled now from the allotment site for six weeks or so. Another six weeks – we hope – to go. Locked out from working land in winter, from digging and planting. Just being there. The garden rituals and camaraderie that get us through. I pine for the plot but we are currently persona non grata. A survey discovered asbestos on ours and another nearby allotment site. I suspect it is perhaps not uncommon in London. There were council plans at first to build raised beds but costs put paid to that. In mid-November, planning permission was given for the plots to be covered with geotextile and half a metre of new soil. The earth work we have done is now buried.
I walk close to the gate sometimes. I almost press my face to the future. Everything we could save is sitting waiting on the banks at the edge of the plots. Tree and other treasured plants have been potted. Impatient on our return. Structures have been packed away. Fruit cages now without fruit. Poles waiting for beans and peas. In homes around north London, cuttings and saved seed sit quietly. There will be work to do to bring the new soil to life. To invite worms to return. Organic matter to add. At least, for now, it is winter. I wonder about the foxes, the feral cats, the owls, our robins and other birds. Where the other gardeners are. What plans they’re making for the new growing season. We have uprooted fennel and verbena waiting in Howard’s greenhouse. At least now we will have to thoroughly sort the seed. New life will return. The new year will see the return of old and new allotmenteers. Heads full of plans. Plot 29 will be carefully unpacked. Much-loved plants from before will be re-homed. New plots and new planting. New life will return. Until then at least, there is last year’s amaranth seed to sort. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

Interview attempts with Robert De Niro in 1977;2022-01-09;['Chris Hall'];['Robert De Niro', 'Film', 'Life and style', 'Culture'];Paul Gardner bagged himself a rare interview with Robert De Niro for the Observer Magazine of 7 August 1977 (‘Making It – the man from Mean Streets’). Gardner had met De Niro in Rome for the filming of Bertolucci’s 1900 – ‘an extravagant tapestry of Italian history’ – but was rebuffed. Then three years later he caught up with him in Hollywood, De Niro having spent five months on Martin Scorsese’s film musical New York, New York. ‘After my first movies, I gave interviews,’ he said, slouched in a chair in Scorsese’s office. ‘Then I thought, what’s so important about where I went to school, and hobbies… what does any of that have to do with acting, with my own head? Nothing.’ Gardner argued that ‘personality stars’, such as Steve McQueen, would lose fans if they changed their image for each film, but that De Niro ‘changes roles without leaving footprints, without leaving a clue as to who they really are’. His New York, New York co-star Liza Minnelli agreed: ‘There’s an intensity and mystery. His eyes look out, but they also look in.’ Gardner caught up with De Niro again in New York, surprised to see he’d ‘radically changed his physiognomy and physique for his fourth Scorsese film, Raging Bull’. Over lunch Gardner asked him what got him interested in acting. De Niro told him: ‘Aw, now, don’t ask questions.’ So they ‘sit around… without questions’. ‘I gained about 20lb for Jake [LaMotta] and I’m still puttin’ it on,’ De Niro eventually revealed. ‘I see so many fight movies where the actors are out of shape, I don’t believe them. So I come to the gym here – they rigged up a special one – and work out every day.’ He laughed, quietly. ‘I’ve got Sylvester Stallone’s trainer.’ What Gardner didn’t know was that De Niro would pile on 60lb for the scenes as an older, has-been LaMotta. But perhaps De Niro wouldn’t have told him how, if he’d asked.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/09/who-is-he-really-interview-attempts-with-robert-de-niro-in-1977;entertainment and culture

I’m not advocating that everyone maintains Christmas-level tippling every day and night past New Year’s Eve. But there is a reasonable line of thinking that says that this dark, cold, skint time of year may not be the best moment to deprive ourselves of one of life’s simpler pleasures. Moderation may be a more effective route to long-term healthy drinking, allowing us to lift our spirits with a glass or two of a moderately priced, delicious southern-sun filled red such as Indomita’s. Tesco Finest GSM, McLaren Vale Australia, 2017 (£9, Tesco) Chile remains one of the most reliable sources of inexpensive red wines of the softly textured kind that are the antidote to seasonal dankness – the sort that works as well on the sofa as it does at the table, such as Morrisons The Best Chilean Carmenère 2020 (£6.50), which makes it a good match for pizza. Also doing the job in the very specific category of ‘wines for TV and takeaway’ is the perfumed malbec from Argentina. Aldi Argentinian Malbec, Mendoza 2020 (£5.79) is one of the best-value versions of the style. Australia, too, has its way with the fruity, warming genre, although the best of the Down Under supermarket bunch tends to come seasoned with a lick of peppery spice, such as Tesco’s ever-excellent blend of grenache, shiraz and mataro. Domaine Gayda Chemin de Moscou, IGP Pays d’Oc France, 2019 (£25.99, Cambridge Wine Merchants) The GSM blend based on grenache and/or shiraz plus mataro and others is the base of many of Australia’s finest reds. But its origins are in southern France, producing wines that can feel like a transfusion of mood-boosting sunlight at this time of year. You can get some of that Mediterranean hillside feel in bottles from the Languedoc, such as Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Saint-Chinian (£9), or from the Rhône Valley, such as Marks & Spencer’s superb Les Closiers Lirac 2019 (£10). That’s true, too, of the latest vintage of one of my favourite wines from one of my favourite Languedoc producers. The darkly concentrated, blackberry, black olive, pepper and rosemary of Domaine Gayda’s Chemin de Mouscou, served with roast lamb, is my prescription for seeing off the winter blues.

4717;4717;4717;436;4773;4773;I’ve stopped seeing a married man. Was I unfair to end it? | Ask Philippa Perry;2022-01-09;['Philippa Perry'];['Relationships', 'Life and style'];"The question I’m 47 years old. Five years ago, I got involved with a married man with two kids. The relationship was intense, hyper-sexual and obsessive. I felt uneasy and tried to end it many times, but was always easily persuaded otherwise by him. He started living separately from his wife two years back and there was terrible heartache with the children going back and forth. I was getting unhappier, more neurotic, and not in control of my see-saw emotions. Then the pandemic brought immense trauma. First, my mother died, swiftly followed by my father and then, in the second wave, my sister-in-law also died of coronavirus. I have become entwined with my brother’s life, helping him resurrect a routine, looking out for his two daughters. In the midst of all that, I felt I didn’t need to live with what had become a gnawing, unhappy situation with the married man. I tried to explain to him, but I think he’d become so used to me ending it that he thought it’ll be like other times when we would argue and then make up. But I really did finish it this time. I stopped calling him, didn’t respond to his messages. That was three months ago. I feel better for it and am in a more stable space, but feel bad because sometimes I think I have been unfair in ending it like that. Was I hasty? Do I need to meet him and have a rational conversation? Philippa’s answer You have borne a lot of loss and I’m sorry. But I’ll address what you asked me, should you meet your lover again? It seems you were in the habit of ending things with him and then getting back together again. You remind me of a person determined to stop smoking. She knows it’s bad for her, will damage her health, but without ever even putting it into words she finds herself lighting another cigarette; no decision-making process, she just does it. With an addict, there are usually two parts to them: the sensible, this-is-bad-for-me part and the impulsive, unthinking part, who reaches for the cigarette, the drink, the drug or, in your case, the man.
You have two parts to you: the part that wants to be with him and the part that doesn’t. I’m going to call them Ms Adventure and Ms Sensible. Ms Adventure makes innocent-sounding suggestions, like, “Maybe we should have a rational conversation,” knowing that if you meet up for some rational conversation, going by past form, you will be seduced all over again. So that is Ms Adventure’s way of tricking Ms Sensible, who knows there’s something not quite right about this suggestion, so she sensibly writes to me. When we are addicted to drink, in our mind we think about what a first or a second drink used to feel like, which fuels the yearning. We don’t think of how we feel in the morning afterwards, we don’t dwell on not being able to stop once we start, we just remember the good bits. And I think there were probably good bits to your affair, loads of great sex, and Ms Adventure will tempt you with these, and she’ll gloss over the gnawing unhappiness and the see-saw emotions. You say you feel more stable without this relationship, but you have come up with an excuse to meet him again, which sounds very much like an addict reaching for those cigarettes. Do you need to contact him again as a question of doing the right, rational thing? No, you don’t. But I’m interested in Ms Adventure, that part of you who is untouched by the sensible, practical part of you and that wants to put you in the position of being in danger of seduction again. Is this for some distraction away from mourning those you have lost and how you feel for your brother and your nieces? Some intense, hyper-sexual passion would be a welcome distraction. What I think is, you know you feel better without him, but you have not admitted that you cannot resist him. If you meet him again you won’t have ended it, the meeting will be a continuation of it. What are you going to do with that part of you that longs for passion and intensity, but never quite puts that into words? You cannot ignore her, or she’ll do something that wouldn’t be in the best interest for both parts of you. You’d better find out a bit more about her; you don’t want her sabotaging the sensible part of you. The rational conversation that needs to be had is between Ms Sensible and Ms Adventure. What would they say to each other? I think you might always be in a see-saw of emotion unless you give Ms Adventure a voice and allow Ms Sensible to compromise. They may conclude that you need to take up painting, or try internet dating, and that you are giving support to your brother, but not getting any yourself. I’d recommend joining a grief group or otherwise finding support (cruse.org.uk). Do something for you, but without falling back down a hole you’ve just managed to climb out of.

4719;4719;4719;438;4775;4775;Real levelling-up means going local | Letters;2022-01-09;['N/A'];['Inequality', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news'];Phillip Inman strikes exactly the right note on the so-called levelling-up agenda (“It’s hard to ‘level up’ when No 10 is bearing down on us”, Business). If Michael Gove and co focus on structures rather than activity, outputs and outcomes, levelling up will struggle to get off the ground. Let’s also accept that meaningful activities, outputs and outcomes are in any case hard to achieve, given tough economic times, short-term political life cycles and economic and social inequities. If funding is to be properly channelled to relatively poor regions and localities, a government with less centralised control tendencies would be welcome. Beyond cities and regions with mayors and to avoid the inevitable mess and cost of too much restructuring, maybe it’s time to trust local authorities with regeneration activity and the like. Wouldn’t that be something after more than a decade of devastating cuts to local services? Central government could require local plans, a reporting process and some incentives or curbs, depending on progress. Even better, local people could have some involvement through existing consultation methods and citizen assemblies could be tried out. This approach might just stand a fighting chance of making a real difference. Steve West Fordingbridge, Hampshire Phillip Inman rightly draws attention to the problems with levelling up the north. Some of the problems lie here in Oxford, where donors seemingly queue up to fund new establishments, leading to all sorts of problems with affordable housing and undesirable green-belt development. Sometimes, the investment is very much to the good (there will be soon be millions more invested in vaccinology, for example), but the Oxford/Cambridge/London research and development triangle grows apace while universities elsewhere often struggle to find funds. A combined government and private enterprise initiative to divert research money to, say, Bristol, Birmingham and Sheffield would be welcome, though I cannot see our Oxford-based political establishment agreeing to this, alas. Don Manley Oxford Nazi art theft revealed With Vanessa Thorpe’s interesting article about Pauline Baer de Perignon’s sleuthing to recover her family’s Nazi-looted art, another piece of the jigsaw of wartime art theft falls into place (“The amateur sleuth, the galleries and a fight for family art looted by the Nazis”, News). I am reading the seminal work on the subject of Nazi art theft and the fate of Europe’s treasures in the Second World War, The Rape of Europa by Lynn H Nicholas. It must have been an influence on the making of the film The Monuments Men because so many events recorded in the book are portrayed in the film. The book is a masterwork of research, explaining the convoluted schemes to illegally acquire much of the patrimony of the conquered nations of Europe. It also explains the Allied programme for rescue, repatriation and restitution by “the monuments men” and their work with museum curators in the liberated nations. There are many unrecovered treasures from the period that perhaps will come to light, not least because of the diligent and persistent endeavours of people such as Pauline Baer de Perignon. Paul F Faupel Somersham, Cambridgeshire The wrong trousers? Your piece about school uniforms in Kerala was informative and insightful (“Unisex school uniforms come to Kerala. But some parents aren’t happy…”, World). It was also instructive, inadvertently, in illustrating gender-based assumptions in supposedly non-gendered thinking. Why is it that “unisex” and “gender-neutral” clothing is nearly always based on what is worn traditionally by boys/men? Obvious answers will refer to the disinhibiting practicality for girls and the need to disrupt the tendency to equate power and capability with items worn by boys. They are liberating interventions in the context of sexism. Just as there is nothing inherently male about trousers, there is nothing inherently female about a skirt or dress. Despite greater sensitivities about gender fluidity, gender-neutral clothing is still modelled on “male” norms. If we conceive of unisex clothing in terms of what girls must wear, and model gender-neutral clothing on what boys have worn, we should not be surprised if our children learn a lopsided message. Paul McGilchrist Colchester, Essex The politics of Covid In his interview with Robin McKie, infectious diseases expert Professor Mark Woolhouse makes a valid public health observation (“Britain got it wrong on Covid: long lockdown did more harm than good, says scientist”, News). However, what is missing is the political dimension of the decision-making process. While it was obvious in March 2020 that the global public health machinery was mobilised to combat the pandemic it had prepared for, rather than the one it was presented with, for the UK government to have admitted this would have shone a light on the consequences of its policies over the previous 10 years. Care homes should have been fortified, with enough skilled staff to safeguard residents. To have done so would have laid bare the working conditions, low pay and zero-hours contracts that facilitated the spread of Covid among those least able to cope. Infected patients were returned to care homes because the NHS had been so poorly funded that there was no slack in the system. While labour deregulation led to infected people having to continue working and concomitant poverty resulting in vulnerable people living in multi-generational households. All this overseen by a government (and party) whose inability to manage anything is only eclipsed by its willingness to lie. David Hoare Kingston, Lewes, Sussex Eleven years of council cuts Anne McElvoy’s interesting piece on Keir Starmer omits any reference to local government, which has suffered significantly over the last 11 years and faces more cuts (“Starmer is making headway, but has he got enough to worry the Tories?”, Comment). Councils are facing the prospect of having to continue to reduce staffing and services across the communities they struggle to support. It’s time the media began to cover the damage being inflicted by the government in this area of public policy. Jeremy Beecham Newcastle City Council Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne Yes sir, no sir I’m a great admirer of Sir Lindsay Hoyle. He has made the role of Speaker of the House of Commons his and continued to assert the independence of the office. He’s right to support Tony Blair’s knighthood – his support for George Bush over Iraq was a serious error of judgment, but there is still a worthy legacy, not least peace in Northern Ireland. However, Hoyle’s suggestion that all former prime ministers should be knighted (News) is surely a step too far: “Arise, Sir Boris” – no, thank you!

4736;4736;4736;455;4792;4792;As order is restored in Kazakhstan, its future remains murky;2022-01-08;['Shaun Walker'];['Kazakhstan', 'World news', 'South and central Asia', 'Protest', 'Inequality'];"For many Kazakhs, the full story behind the unrest of the past week remains as murky as the mist that enveloped Almaty, the country’s largest city and the centre of violence, at the same time. People were unable to access accurate information, as an internet blackout froze almost all access to the outside world during a tragic few days of violence in which military vehicles rolled through the streets, government buildings burned and state television carried rolling threats that “bandits and terrorists” would be eliminated without mercy.
Now both order and the internet have been largely restored, but there are still more questions than answers. One thing that is clear is many of the old assumptions about Kazakhstan, the resource-rich Central Asian state, have been overturned. Just last month the country celebrated the 30th anniversary of its independence, with official speeches highlighting the image of a peaceful, prosperous nation, one that had largely avoided political unrest and boasted an independent and “multivector” foreign policy. Kazakhstan, it seemed, had even successfully managed the tricky transition out of power from its long-standing president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led the country from independence in 1991 until 2019, to his handpicked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. A month later, and the picture is very different. Peaceful protests turned into violent clashes, Tokayev announced he had ordered security forces to “shoot to kill, without warning”, and troops from a Russia-led military alliance are on the ground after being called for by Tokayev.
Amid it all, dozens of deaths and a sense from eyewitness reports that the real number of casualties could be much higher than the 26 “armed criminals” and 18 security officers that the interior ministry has said were killed. More than 4,000 people have been detained. There was a suspicion all week that there may be more in play than a straightforward popular uprising, and this was reinforced by the announcement on Saturday that Karim Masimov, a powerful former security chief and prime minister, had been arrested on suspicion of treason. The move only increased speculation that the initial protests could have been used by groups within the country’s political elite to fight their own battles. A source in Kazakh business circles gave credence to this scenario, describing a situation over recent months of increasing tension between figures close to Nazarbayev and his successor, Tokayev. “In the last six to 12 months there was increased squabbling, which was paralysing decision-making,” said the source. “It has been bubbling for some time.” One of the more surprising episodes of the week was Tokayev’s transformation from placid placeholder to furious autocrat, promising to crush the revolt brutally. “We were dealing with armed and well-prepared bandits, both local and foreign. Bandits and terrorists, who should be destroyed. This will happen in the nearest time,” Tokayev said in an uncompromising address to the nation on Friday, noting that there were 20,000 such “bandits” in Almaty alone. He also posted a message in English on Twitter: “In my basic view, no talks with the terrorists: We must kill them.” It was later deleted.
“Before, he came across as a mealy-mouthed quiet diplomat, but the rhetoric we saw on Friday was that of a general leading an army,” said Kate Mallinson, associate fellow at Chatham House. Amnesty International described Tokayev’s promise to shoot without warning as “a recipe for disaster”, and there is now a question of how much the government response will differentiate between peaceful protesters and violent groups. Tokayev put Kazakhstan’s already beleaguered civil society on alert when he said that free media played a role in fanning the unrest. “There is still very little independent information and a lot of uncertainty. However, one thing is clear: the peaceful protest was genuine and spontaneous,” said Diana T Kudaibergenova, a sociologist at Cambridge University. “People went to the streets to voice their grievances and we saw some self-organisation, especially in western Kazakhstan.”
The protest began in the west last weekend, sparked by rising fuel prices, and quickly spread to other cities, including Almaty. There, many of those on the streets reported that on Wednesday and Thursday the demonstration was hijacked by violent groups, some of whom appeared to be well organised, and who attacked government buildings and briefly seized the airport. Tokayev, in his address, spoke vaguely about “foreign-trained” attackers, but gave no details and did not specify who they were supposedly working for. Many questions remain about the role of Nazarbayev in the week’s apparent backstage quarrels. Tokayev announced on Wednesday that he was removing Nazarbayev from head of the security council, without stating whether that was with or without the former president’s approval. There were persistent rumours throughout the week that Nazarbayev and his family had fled the country. On Saturday,, Nazarbayev’s spokesperson Aidos Ukibay denounced the rumours as “knowingly false and speculative information”. He said Nazarbayev was in close contact with Tokayev and wanted the nation to rally around the new president. But the man himself has been silent during the most dramatic week in the young country’s history. It was a surprising absence from a politician who has personified Kazakhstan for the past three decades. When he stepped down in 2019, the new capital city he had ordered created in 1997 was renamed Nur-Sultan, in his honour. But for all the excesses of the cult of personality, for a long time Nazarbayev’s Kazakhstan was a much savvier autocracy than those of the other post-Soviet Central Asian nations. Many western diplomats had a positive view of his leadership, despite the democratic shortcomings, in part because of the lucrative opportunities for western businesses the country provided. “He was able to balance Russia and China, and other external influences, and he implemented some genuine reforms,” said a western diplomatic source. At the same time, a small elite close to Nazarbayev became tremendously wealthy, while many ordinary people still lived in poverty. Over time, resentments only intensified. “In Kazakhstan, market economy means capitalism, which means big money, which means large bribes for the best connected,” as a former US ambassador put it in a leaked diplomatic cable from 2010, paraphrasing a conversation with a top Kazakh businessman. Whatever the final outcome of last week’s turmoil, the images of a statue to Nazarbayev in the city of Taldykorgan being pulled down, and of crowds chanting “Old man, out!” are likely to fundamentally alter the legacy he hoped for. Also at stake is the independent foreign policy that was one of his most prized achievements. When, on Wednesday evening, Tokayev called for support from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russia-led military alliance, the request was approved within hours. At a time when all eyes were on the troops massed close to Russia’s border with Ukraine, suddenly there was a different Russian intervention to contend with. Both the Kazakh and Russian sides have insisted the contingent will be limited in size, scope and duration, and so far, claims of a Russian occupation seem overblown. But even if the troops are gone in a few days, the balance of power in the region is likely to have been altered irrevocably. “Nothing comes for free with Putin, and there will be a quid pro quo,” said Mallinson.As well as geopolitical implications, the sudden collapse of the Kazakh security forces and Nazarbayev’s legacy may also have important repercussions in Russian domestic politics. “Russia and Kazakhstan are two very similar political models: post-imperial resource-based personalised autocracies,” said Moscow-based political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. The “Nazarbayev option” had been considered as one possible way for Vladimir Putin to step aside safely when his present term ends in 2024, but it now seems a much less appealing option than it might have done a week ago. Those involved in political decision-making in Russia would likely conclude from the recent events in Kazakhstan that even managed transition is dangerous, and that security forces should be further strengthened, said Schulmann. “If you have a pet idea, whatever happens will feed into your pet idea,” she said, noting that the Kremlin is fixated on preserving the current power structures and repelling perceived outside threats through repressing dissent at home. As attention shifts to the behind-the-scenes infighting and the geopolitical implications, some inside the country are urging that the human tragedy of the past days should not be forgotten. On Saturday, a group of Kazakh civil society organisations penned an open letter to the authorities: “Unrest and violence have no place at peaceful demonstrations… We ask the authorities to carry out a full investigation of every part of this tragedy.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/as-order-is-restored-in-kazakhstan-its-future-is-murkier-than-ever;politics
4740;4740;4740;459;4796;4796;Werner finds finishing touch in Chelsea’s stroll past Chesterfield;2022-01-08;['Jonathan Wilson'];['FA Cup', 'Chelsea', 'Chesterfield', 'Football', 'Sport'];"The cups are shoring up Chelsea’s season. After a run of three wins in nine games that has made a title challenge extremely unlikely and cost them top spot in their Champions League group, wins in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final and the third round of the FA Cup have restored a sense of stability at Stamford Bridge. This went about as well as it could have done for Thomas Tuchel’s side: ahead early and so in control by half-time that he could afford to rest players in the second half. “It’s very good for the young boys, and again they stepped up and showed what they are capable of,” said Tuchel. “It was good. There’s no need to talk it down artificially, but there’s no need to be overwhelmed: we played a fifth-division team.” But the magic of the Cup is that anything can happen: even Timo Werner can score. He had a go both at being offside and missing, but did manage to shovel the ball into an empty net after Hakim Ziyech’s initial effort, smartly created by Mateo Kovacic, had been blocked. There was the inevitable wait for VAR to ratify it and for once, having cancelled out 16 previous Werner efforts since his arrival in west London, it did.
And so, after six minutes, the chance of an upset, of the National League side beating the European champions, was in effect gone. Which, in a sense, took the pressure off. Six thousand Chesterfield fans, roughly their average home gate, packed the Shed, determined to enjoy the day – so much so that they greeted the dimming of lights before kick-off with a great gasp of amazement and delight, before perhaps realising that, even in the more remote corners of Derbyshire, lights that go on and off aren’t really that exciting any more, and trying to correct the fault by jeering and asking “Who are you?” The answer was swiftly provided: a much better football team than them. Callum Hudson-Odoi, given far too much space, curled a second after 18 minutes, before Romelu Lukaku converted a cross from the impressive debutant left-back Lewis Hall. Chelsea fans responded with applause warm enough to suggest Lukaku has been forgiven after his Sky Italia interview. Chesterfield fans responded by chanting “Romelu Lukaku, he’s Inter Milan.” And why not? With the final three-quarters of the game rendered an exhibition, they can hardly be blamed for taking their fun where they could find it. “It was a fantastic experience for us,” said the Chesterfield manager, James Rowe. “When the team sheet comes it’s exciting for everybody. That’s what we’ve worked for. It’s a remarkable day for everybody.”
When a looping Andreas Christensen header, after the Chesterfield keeper Scott Loach had parried Hall’s shot, made it 4-0 six minutes before the break it brought to mind 7-1, the scoreline in 1907 when they last met Chelsea in a league game. The England international George Hilsdon, nicknamed the “Gatling Gun” for the rapidity of his shooting, scored twice in that game but when war came, the Gatling Gun went missing as he tried to dodge his call-up. He was finally found hiding in a chicken run. Badly gassed at Arras, he never played football again, and tried to scrape together a living working as a teaboy on building sites, running a pub and organising raffles. When he died in Leicester in 1941, only four people came to his funeral and he was buried in an unmarked grave. A collection from Chelsea fans bought a headstone in 2015. Hilsdon’s memory, though, lives on: the weather vane on the East Stand – which tradition (and memories of the club’s decline when it was taken for refurbishment in the seventies) says must never be removed for fear of dreadful misfortune – is modelled on him. A mismatch it may be today, but the previous season Chesterfield had been the first away side to win at Stamford Bridge. This is a fixture with history.
The questions for the second half were whether Chesterfield could nick a goal and whether they could keep the margin down to under the six they lost by to Hilsdon and co. The answers to both questions were yes. Akwasi Asante gleefully knocked in after the tireless Kabongo Tshimanga’s shot had been saved to provide a proper souvenir for the away fans behind that goal. And although Ziyech scored a 55th-minute penalty, Chesterfield were resolute enough that the score never threatened to become embarrassing; as such, both teams probably ended up satisfied enough. This was the other side of a third-round mismatch: not an upset, but a gently enjoyable day out for everybody.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/chelsea-chesterfield-fa-cup-match-report;sports
4756;4756;4756;475;4812;4812;FA Cup roundup: Boreham Wood through as Huddersfield stun Burnley;2022-01-08;['Paul Doyle'];['FA Cup', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Huddersfield', 'Burnley', 'AFC Wimbledon', 'Hartlepool', 'Blackpool', 'Leicester City', 'Watford'];"Non-league Boreham Wood made history by reaching the fourth round of the FA Cup thanks to a rousing victory over League One AFC Wimbledon. The Hertfordshire side, fourth in the National League, ousted the visitors 2-0 thanks to goals in each half by Tyrone Marsh and Adrian Clifton, sparking ecstatic scenes among 3,500 fans at Meadow Park. “I’m on top of the world,” said Boreham Wood’s manager, Luke Garrard, who remains a cult hero at Wimbledon after making more than 100 appearances as a player. “This is my biggest achievement as the manager here for six years. It’s full credit to the players, I can’t describe it. They threw everything at us but we are good defensively and well drilled.
“I feel for them, it was a proper FA Cup tie with the wind and rain. The players will, of course, enjoy tonight.” Wimbledon failed to muster a shot on target against their accomplished hosts. Garrard had guided Boreham Wood into the third round for the first time last season before their progress was halted by Millwall in an empty ground – he said he was determined to go a step further this time to repay the loyalty of the club’s chairman, Danny Hunter, who, when the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, reassured staff by telling them immediately they would continue to receive their full salaries despite the club being forced to shut down. Hunter had to remortgage his house to cover the cost.
On Saturday, an excited capacity crowd cheered on Boreham Wood in driving rain and saw Marsh fire the hosts into the lead in the 10th minute with an emphatic volley from the edge of the area. Marsh was substituted later and his replacement, Clifton, scored within a minute of his arrival, flicking a cross by Jacob Mendy into the net at the near post. That confirmed a famous victory for Boreham Wood over a club who, in a previous incarnation in 1988, were responsible for perhaps the biggest cup upset in history. Huddersfield, sixth in the Championship, marked the centenary of their solitary FA Cup triumph by knocking out top-flight Burnley – just as they did before lifting the trophy 100 year ago. Matty Pearson’s late winning goal at Turf Moor secured a victory that was all the more impressive because the Premier League side had taken the lead through Jay Rodriguez. Josh Koroma drew the teams level with 16 minutes left after a mislaid pass by Matt Lowton before Pearson headed in the decisive goal from a corner in the 87th minute. James Tarkowski spurned a glaring chance to save Burnley in stoppage time, heading over from close range. Huddersfield’s manager, Carlos Corberan, refused to entertain talk of another cup triumph. “What is special is to be seven games without losing [in all competitions] but I cannot talk about the future,” he said. “To go seven games without losing means the players are playing really well. The challenge is to keep playing well.” Huddersfield’s win was the latest setback in a season of woe for Burnley, who have not won since October and languish in the Premier League’s relegation zone. They were without nine players owing to injuries and Covid – and Sean Dyche was self-isolating at home, too – but were still able to send out a strong side. Corberan made 10 changes from his team’s last outing in the Championship. “There are no excuses,” said Burnley’s assistant manager, Ian Woan. “We wanted to get the game on [despite the absences]. I’m sure we could have got the game off but that is not the way we work. “We have to keep believing in what we do and hopefully get some bodies back for the next couple of weeks.”
League Two Hartlepool came from behind to spring a surprise by winning at home to Blackpool of the Championship. Graeme Lee’s side have beaten four teams from League One this season in the FA Cup and the EFL Trophy but they surpassed those achievements thanks to a winning goal from a teenage substitute, Joe Grey. The 18-year-old sealed victory two minutes after being introduced from the bench, firing into the net just after the hour to claim his second senior goal with his first touch of the match. Blackpool had taken the lead through Keshi Anderson but the League Two team began turning the tables early in the second half when David Ferguson curled a shot into the net from the edge of the box. Another League Two side against Championship opponents, Barrow, went to the wire in a chaotic tie at Barnsley, where the hosts prevailed 5-4 after extra time.
Leicester, the holders, made light of their many absences by dispatching Watford 4-1. Youri Tielemans, the scorer of the winning goal in last season’s final, opened the scoring from a penalty in the seventh minute before James Maddison increased their lead. Watford struck back through João Pedro but goals by Harvey Barnes and Marc Albrighton made sure of the win.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/fa-cup-third-round-roundup;sports
4765;4765;4765;484;4821;4821;Covid calls last orders at Chelmsford’s pubs;2022-01-08;['Miranda Bryant'];['Coronavirus', 'Essex', 'Pubs', 'UK news', 'NHS', 'Football'];"Until a month ago, pub landlord Scott Jones knew only a handful of people who had got Covid. But since then, the majority of the people he knows have had the virus – including his young son, his assistant, who was off work for 10 days, and the people he depends on to deliver supplies to his Chelmsford pub, the Railway Tavern. “It was like the perfect storm, it all happened at once,” said Jones, 40, who was left trying to juggle it all with his partner, on top of a 40% drop in pub takings. “There’s so many knock-on effects of it. Every day seems to bring a new challenge.” The Essex city is just one of many places up and down the country increasingly struggling to function properly due to Covid staff shortages – affecting everything from bin collections to the local hospital and football team. According to the latest government figures, on Friday there were 410 new cases reported in Chelmsford and one death. In the first week of January, there were 3,198 new cases recorded.
Following issues with certain lagers and CO2 during previous phases of the pandemic, Jones said the latest delivery issues have centred on wine. At the same time, as Covid cases continue to rise, he is worried about the prospect of another lockdown, which he does not think the pub could survive. “Usually at this time on a Friday every table would be taken and I’d have three staff working,” he said, standing alone behind the bar, above which a sign reads “desperate times call for double measures”. Customer Phil Elliott, 61, an artist, said he has felt the impact of staff shortages on buses, which are running on a reduced timetable due to “higher than normal” staff sickness caused by Omicron. At the bus station, a driver said absences are the worst they have been throughout the whole of the pandemic and that they are cutting over 1,600 miles a day of journeys. “It’s stressful,” he said. First Essex apologised to customers and said they are doing everything they can to minimise disruption and that teams are “working extra hard to ensure as many buses run as is possible”. Meanwhile, at Broomfield Hospital staff are understood to be struggling with extra work and stress as growing numbers of staff fall ill. “Broomfield staff have never known a crisis like this. They’re absolutely wrung out from almost two years of near-constant emergency footing,” said Sam Older, eastern regional organiser at Unison, which is calling for an above-inflation pay rise for NHS staff. “With Omicron running riot, more and more are falling ill. Those left are contending with not only the fear of the virus, but the extra work and stress from the shortages.” Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which oversees the hospital, said Omicron is leading to “higher levels of staff absence”. A spokesperson added: “Our staff are working tirelessly to minimise the impact of this and we have robust plans in place to ensure that patients who urgently need our care continue to receive it.” Meanwhile, collections of food-waste bins were cancelled for three days last week after 23 drivers – 40% of their total drivers – were off sick following the Christmas break. Councillor Stephen Robinson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Chelmsford City Council, noted that it marked the first change to bin collections of the pandemic. “It was very much an emergency decision, and this week we’re now largely back on track,” he said.
He said managing services amid soaring infection rates had been a challenge and that leisure centres were having to move staff around to cover for absences. But, he added: “By and large, Chelmsford City Council has coped very well and services have kept running throughout the pandemic.” Even the football team has been taken down by Covid. Chelmsford City’s match against Braintree Town had to be postponed last Sunday because so many Chelmsford players had tested positive. And for Saturday’s match, against Bath City, Chelmsford’s manager, Robbie Simpson, who has also tested positive, was preparing to coach them remotely via a livestream from isolation. “Within the space of just over a week we’ve gone from having next to no-one to almost everybody, so it’s been crazy,” said Simpson. As an NHS worker, Simpson’s wife has had to work from home after his positive test, despite testing negative herself. Preparing for matches when many of the team have been quarantining has been tough. “Because obviously you can’t really prepare in advance because you never know when someone’s going to get a positive lateral flow,” he said. One player has converted his garage into a gym so that he can keep training while in isolation. “It seems like everybody’s getting it at the minute. Obviously, last week there was a big shortage on PCRs and some of the players had to wait at least a couple of days before they were able to get a PCR,” said Simpson. “So that just goes to show you how many people are having to get the PCR tests done … it seems to be affecting everybody and every industry.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/covid-calls-last-orders-at-chelmsfords-pubs;health

In a letter to Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, seen by the Guardian, Dorries asked him to explain how the corporation has responded to concerns from Jewish leaders over the corporation’s coverage of an incident in November on Oxford Street and how he plans to “resolve the issue in a suitably timely manner”. She added: “You will know my concerns about the speed of the process which I asked officials to communicate to the BBC earlier this week.” In the letter, she suggested that the BBC’s handling of the issue raised questions over whether it handled audience complaints in a “fair and effective” way. “It is crucial that the BBC can be properly held to account for the fulfilment of its Mission and Public Purposes as set out in the Charter, including through a fair and effective complaints process,” she wrote. “I expect the Mid-Term Review of the BBC Charter to consider whether this is currently the case.” Ofcom, the communications regulator, said it has written to the BBC to request information but that it could not comment further at this stage. The Times reported that during the attack, Jewish passengers on a bus were abused by a group of men. The BBC website published a story in which it said that “a slur about Muslims” had been heard from inside the bus, a claim that was also broadcast by BBC London. The newspaper reports that it was later discovered BBC editors thought the words “dirty Muslims” had been used. However, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which has reportedly commissioned two independent reviews of audio from the incident, concluded that the phrase was in fact “tikrah lemishu, ze dachuf”, meaning “call someone, it’s urgent” in Hebrew. Marie van der Zyl, president of the board, wrote to Davie last month, copying in Dorries. The BBC said the audio had been checked by “a number of Hebrew speakers”, reports the Times. The BBC told the Guardian: “Antisemitism is abhorrent. We strive to serve the Jewish community, and all communities across our country, fairly. “As we have stated previously, our story was a factual report that overwhelmingly focused on the individuals the police want to identify; those who directed abuse at the bus. “We know that there are some strong views about this report. We take complaints very seriously and they are being taken through our complaints process. “Tim Davie has instructed that this process is accelerated to the executive complaints unit, which is editorially independent from news and will ensure complaints are fully responded to as swiftly as possible.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/08/nadine-dorries-grills-bbc-over-coverage-of-antisemitic-attack-story;politics
4798;4798;4798;517;4854;4854;Fall in love with art: delight in collecting paintings;2022-01-08;['Rachel Cooke'];['Painting', 'Hobbies', 'Art', 'Culture', 'Life and style', 'Art and design', 'Collecting'];"Some people are art collectors. I’m not one of those. I’m not rich enough and, even if I were, I’m not interested in that kind of acquisition. I’m just someone who likes pictures a lot and who buys as many as I possibly can. Naturally, this depends – mostly – on my funds at any given moment. But not exclusively. When my passion first overcame me, after all, I was about as broke as it was possible for a salaried person to be. It was 1992, and I was trainee reporter in Glasgow, where I rented one small room, from whose single bed I could see everything I owned, which was mostly a load of letters from my bank informing me that I was overdrawn. I can’t remember whether the idea of travelling to Jura to write about Julie Brook, an artist who was living and working in a cave on the uninhabited side of the island, was my idea or my editor’s but, either way, I was mad keen to do the story, mostly because I knew that it was there that George Orwell wrote 1984. Of my interviewee’s work, I had rather less knowledge. Apparently, she liked to build stone structures on the beach in which she would then set a fire, the idea being that, as the tide came in, it would briefly look as though flames were rising from the sea itself. I arrived by ferry. Julie had hiked to Craighouse to meet me and, in the bar of its hotel, we talked, and she showed me some photographs of her land art, which was indeed dramatic. Then she took me outside, where some huge oils were propped against a wall.
This was when it happened. Standing in front of a painting of two salmon, my heart began to pound. “I would like to own this,” I heard a voice rather like my own say. “But I’ve got no money.” Julie must, I think, have felt my longing, which was extreme. She didn’t hesitate either. “Pay me in instalments,” she said. Which is what I did, for the next 18 months. It was all quite mad. Why was I buying this enormous canvas when I’d nowhere to hang it? More to the point, why was I spending money I didn’t have? But though I could hardly justify what I’d done, I didn’t regret it either. I was… relieved to have the painting in my possession, a sense of satisfaction that only grew as I transported it to Glasgow, and then, some weeks later, drove it to London in a hire car (I was moving again). When friends remarked on it, their disbelief (“you… bought this?”) induced in me only a crazed kind of pride. Better my salmon than any number of dresses from Top Shop. For a time, this was the only art I owned. But in my 30s, more flush at last, I started buying more. An abstract print by Victor Pasmore (he was less fashionable then, and his prices less loopy). A tiny oil of an old-fashioned newsagent, its window bedecked with tinsel, by no one you would ever have heard of. A portrait by John Aldridge, one of the (very much) less well-known artists associated with Great Bardfield in Essex. In each case, the feeling was the same. If a vaguely affordable picture speaks to me, the tips of my fingers seem to tingle and burn. I’m like Raffles, the gentleman thief, in the presence of a diamond tiara.
It is still possible, if you’re clever, to get amazing things for the price of a couple of easyJet flights (I’m including the taxi to the airport). I have a drawing by Edward Burra that cost me less than £200; I bought it at Abbot & Holder in Museum Street in Bloomsbury, where I’ve had a lot of luck down the years (Tom, who runs it now, is very knowledgeable, but also very kind and non-intimidating). I haunt online auctions and sales – for the latter, I recommend Liss Llewellyn, which specialises in 20th-century British art – and I favour galleries outside London, such as Zillah Bell in Thirsk, Yorkshire, home to an archive of work by Norman Ackroyd, master of the aquatint.
But my collection is not about big names. For me, value has nothing whatsoever to do with fame. There’s something thrilling about hanging a picture you scrimped and saved to buy next to one for which you paid £50 in a street market, and finding both equally beautiful; it’s like having a secret. I do own some pictures by fairly well-known artists (though I won’t name drop here). But one of my most beloved finds – a delicately gorgeous 1939 engraving by an artist whose name is illegible of Rachel’s Tomb in Hebron, in Israel/Palestine, where I lived as a child – I picked up for £40 at a Suffolk antique fair. Friends who were there will testify that I almost fainted with excitement as I handed over the cash. The judgmental cliche goes that either a person can spend money on stuff, or they can spend it on experiences. But a painting is both. Ben Nicholson thought people should hang a picture on the wall and “eat their meals with their back to it every day for a month”. Only then would they know how they felt about it; whether it was dead or alive. I think he was right. A painting will seem to change as you live with it. Like a person you’ve known for a long time, it will always be capable of surprising you. Perhaps you’ll move it to a new spot; perhaps the light will shift, falling on it in a new way; perhaps you’ll find yourself staring at it unexpectedly as you try to remember what you were going upstairs for. At any rate, you’ll see it anew, and suddenly interest and affection will rise inside you.

4800;4800;4800;519;4856;4856;From Gloucester to Ghana – How Jojo Wollacott’s dream became a reality;2022-01-08;['Ben Fisher'];['Ghana football team', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Africa Cup of Nations 2022', 'Africa Cup of Nations', 'Swindon'];"It is three years this week since Jojo Wollacott lined up for Gloucester City at East Thurrock United in the National League South before a crowd of 242 supporters. That game was a month into the eighth loan move of a career that has taken him on a remarkable journey from Truro to Norway’s fourth-tier and now the Africa Cup of Nations, where he is set to be Ghana’s No 1. No one can accuse the Swindon goalkeeper of not putting in the hard yards when he starts against Morocco on Monday. “It was always my ambition and I told myself it was going to happen one day,” he says. “To play for your country at a major tournament is every boy’s dream … I’ve got to pinch myself again.” Wollacott, who was born in Bristol, qualifies to play for Ghana through his mother, who was raised in Accra. He recalls watching Richard Kingson, now the Ghana goalkeeper coach, at the 2010 World Cup and getting a flavour for the nation’s obsession with the game. In October, he made his debut in a World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe.
They beat South Africa a month later to reach the play-offs for Qatar 2022, which take place in March. “I was a bit emotional after the game because it just hit me,” Wollacott says. “That was when I realised: ‘I’m playing international football for Ghana.’ It is going to be a busy few months but I am looking forward to it.” Wollacott has developed as a goalkeeper this season, becoming more comfortable in possession and improving his distribution, but arguably his most attractive trait is his humility. He has a laser-like focus and after an hour discussing everything from his Ghana debut shirt having pride of place in his hallway to the prospect of facing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – albeit now in doubt since the Arsenal striker has Covid – when they take on Gabon in Group C and his love for jollof rice, it is clear he will not be getting carried away any time soon. “I am pretty grounded,” he says. “I’m quite aware of my situation. I’ve had a good upbringing – that is down to mum. She does keep me in check every now and then, but not as much as when I was a little kid.” No one was prouder to watch Wollacott win his first cap than his mother, who ferried him to games as a boy. He had trials at Bristol Rovers and Bristol City, who accepted him at the third time of trying, and he spent 10 years at the club without making a first-team appearance before joining Swindon last summer. His adviser, Eric Anyan of JIA Sports Agency, and Anyan’s son, Elijah, a talent scout, previously alerted the Ghana Football Association to Wollacott’s eligibility. “My mum told me her phone was going off because everyone was messaging her,” he says. “She sacrificed a lot for me when I was younger.”
It has been a slow-burning career for Wollacott in many ways but he is determined to seize his latest opportunity. Playing alongside the Ayew brothers and Thomas Partey at a major tournament was a distant dream when he was on loan at Weymouth and Woking. Ghana players and staff converse in English and Twi, a dialect Wollacott is getting to grips with. “I need to get better at it, but I can get away with the basics,” he says. He values the importance of those loans, including one where he pitched up at an archipelago in Norway, spending three months at Bergsoy IL. “I don’t think I had anything else on the table in England, so I thought I might as well just take a chance and go abroad, see how it is. “Norway was another really good life experience. At the time it opened doors for other things when I got back. You need to go out and experience winning three points and being in high-pressure situations. There comes a point when you’re in the reserves or under-23s where it is just not relevant any more. It is not realistic.”
The initial backdrop when he arrived at Swindon was far from ideal – two weeks before the start of the season the League Two club had eight contracted players and no manager – but a takeover lifted the gloom. The goalkeeping coach, Steve Mildenhall, who has had a profound impact on Wollacott, was the de facto manager. “I signed for John McGreal and a week later he left due to the circumstances. It was a big risk to sign but it was one of the best decisions I made because I needed to play. I’m 25 now. Hopefully, the next few months we can keep pushing, climb the table and get promoted.” He acknowledges it has been an incredible rise from Gloucester to Ghana. “I know, I know,” Wollacott says. “It still has not sunk in yet. But it is just the nature of football. It is a game of opinions. You have to believe in yourself, trust the process and understand that if you keep doing the right things and the opportunity comes, you just need to be ready to take it.”
Wollacott has not had much time to stop and reflect but is adamant his life has not changed much over the past few months, aside from no longer breezing through the airport terminal on arrival in Accra. “The first time no one really knew who I was,” he says, laughing. “The second time I think people started to recognise me a bit more. “I don’t think anything has really changed. I’m not getting ahead of myself. I am just going to stay consistent with what I’m doing. I’m not a superstar. I’m the same person. I’m not going to change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/from-gloucester-to-ghana-how-jojo-wollacotts-dream-became-a-reality;sports
4808;4808;4808;527;4864;4864;It’s called stinking iris – but don’t let the name put you off, they brighten up a winter garden;2022-01-08;['Alys Fowler'];['Gardening advice', 'Plants', 'Life and style', 'Environment', 'Gardens'];"Tucked into hedgerows or peeping out from under trees, the stinking iris, Iris foetidissima, is in full glory right now, its vibrant coral berries bursting from their seed pods amid the deep-green foliage. In summer, Iris foetidissima is easily overlooked. Its flowers are quite beautiful up close, with their delicate veining, but from a distance are a dull-leaden blue, or blue and beige-yellow, tempered and not inelegant, but perhaps too easily lost among the dagger-like foliage (which has a meaty smell when crushed, hence its name). However, they save their best trick for last, with brilliant berries appearing in late autumn and persisting right through the winter and into early spring. The berries are deeply poisonous to humans, but not to birds, making this native plant a very valuable food source for wildlife. The birds won’t touch them till late in the season, when they have softened some. I notice mostly blackbirds devouring them.
Stinking iris’s ability to thrive in extreme dry shade means it’s particularly useful for, say, jollying up the base of a leylandii hedge that you can’t get rid of, or for a dark, basement courtyard that only sees a sliver of sunlight. Its tolerant nature means it is also unfazed by the battering of seaside weather; you often see it growing in shady parts along cliff tops. What is less well known is the smattering of interesting cultivars and varieties of this species. These will take some hunting down, and may require a visit to a few rare plant fairs, but they are well worth the hunt. If you chance upon Iris foetidissima “Citrina”, a yellow-flowered form, jump on it. The flowers are a muted, yet joyous yellow with a deeper purplish bronze centre, and you still get those vibrant orange/red berries in the winter. Two further cultivars are selected for their leaf forms: “Variegata”, with its cream and green striped foliage (it reminds me of deckchairs, but I can see that in the right space it could work); and “Paul’s Gold”, which is yellow-leafed, particularly in spring with new growth. It also has a dwarf form, making it very useful for pots and containers. Finally, a few forms have different-coloured berries. There’s a golden-seeded one which appears naturally in the wild, and is often sold as either “Golden Seeded” or “Golden Gobbet”, but “FructuAlbo” is the one to lust over. I saw it once years ago and foolishly passed it by and, oh, do I covet it now. Instead of vibrant orange berries, it has polished white ones that sit inside the furry interior of the seed head like brilliant pearls – the only sort of jewellery I long for.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/08/stinking-iris-brighten-up-a-winter-garden;environment
4824;4824;4824;543;4880;4880;‘Local is better’: battered Haiti looks to empower peasants to fight climate crisis ;2022-01-08;['Joe Parkin Daniels'];['Haiti', 'Food security', 'Society', 'Poverty', 'Hunger', 'Social exclusion', 'Farming', 'Climate crisis', 'Deforestation', 'Environment', 'Voluntary sector'];"Haiti, the western hemisphere’s poorest country, has often been a byword for deforestation and environmental calamity. It is often said that its border with the Dominican Republic can be seen from space, so marked is the difference between the lush forests to the east, and the scarred wasteland to the west. “In nature everything is connected to one other,” said Jean-Baptiste Chavannes, who in 1973 founded the Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP), which works to tackle deforestation and the climate crisis in Haiti’s poorest regions. “To disturb one is to disturb all.” Haiti’s woes seem to deepen with each passing month. Widespread protests and rolling fuel shortages have marked daily life for two years. In July last year, the Caribbean country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated in his own home. The following month, its impoverished southern peninsula was struck by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, killing at least 2,200 people and destroying tens of thousands of homes. Then, in September, a wave of deportations of Haitian nationals from the US, amid an alarming increase in kidnappings, thrust Haiti into further instability. But underpinning much of the vibrant yet embattled country’s troubles is environmental injustice and food insecurity, with 4.4 million people (of a population of nearly 11 million) at risk of hunger. Widespread deforestation over centuries, largely owing to the colonial timber trade as well as more recent felling for cooking fuel, has damaged fertile lands, and left them vulnerable to erosion, flooding, and drought. Seasonal hurricanes wreak havoc on homes and livelihoods, and contribute to the agricultural degradation each year. Previous top-down international development projects flooded Haitian marketplaces with unsustainable food staples, hamstringing local farmers’ attempts to achieve food sovereignty.
MPP is a grassroots organisation that seeks to tackle the climate crisis and related food insecurity by working with subsistence farmers across Haiti. With more than 40 years of experience in Haiti’s rural Central Plateau, MPP works with 60,000 members to improve deforested landscape so people living there can eat, while increasing forest cover to help reduce carbon levels. “The struggle for food sovereignty is the fight against global warming,” Chavannes said. “All actions aimed at food sovereignty will have a direct impact on the climate crisis.” MPP carries out its work directly with local people, while trying to reduce farmers’ reliance on multinational organisations and charities, which have often mismanaged resources and contributed to Haiti’s challenges, said Jusléne Tyresias, MPP’s programme director. “A local approach is better because it creates direct employment, values local knowledge, skills, and resources,” she said, adding that large international NGOs often spent resources on pricey hotels and transport, rather than using local knowhow. “Locals living in the territory will be more involved because they know the severity of the problem better than those who come from outside.” This grassroots approach has won plaudits from its international backers, including the Clima Fund. Global Greengrants Fund UK, one of four charity partners in the Guardian and Observer’s 2021 Climate Justice appeal, is a member of the Clima Fund, and will use its share of appeal donations on grassroots projects such as MPP.
“MPP is a fantastic example of the kinds of grassroots movements the Clima Fund resources in over 160 countries globally; they demonstrate the efficacy of building solutions from the bottom up – not just what is built, but also how it’s built with whom,” said Lindley Mease, Clima’s fund director. “They meet the material needs of a climate-ravaged island through culturally appropriate and abundant food, sustainable water recapture systems, and increased soil health, while also maintaining an active membership of 61,000 people governed by a circle of women. As part of the 200-million member [international farmers’ movement] La Via Campesina, they are modelling how strategic, collective organising can cool the planet at scale.” As a result of MPP’s work, swaths of the Central Plateau, once ravaged by deforestation, now teem with life. MPP’s network of peasant farmers has planted tens of millions of trees, while organisers have installed water infrastructure for homes and crops while training women and young Haitians in agro-ecology. Solar panels have been installed on homes, reducing reliance on burning wood for fuel, and a radio station broadcasts training and ecological advice. “Regionally and internationally, the MPP is part of global efforts to strengthen grassroots feminist movements, and is part of a global movement of small-scale farmers advancing food sovereignty with La Via Campesina,” said Sara Mersha, director of grant-making and advocacy at Grassroots International, after a visit to one of MPP’s projects.
“It’s this combination of strategies – with a focus on powerful organising and a connection with the earth – that make me understand what it means when MPP and La Via Campesina assert, ‘small farmers cool the planet!’” MPP has also used rapid response teams during Haiti’s frequent natural disasters, including the earthquake that struck the south of the country in August. In the immediate aftermath of that tragedy, MPP provided food, water and shelter, before introducing long-term resilience strategies, such as seed distribution and developing local infrastructure. In 2010, when an earthquake levelled much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and the surrounding areas, killing more than 220,000 people, MPP set up eco-villages, in which survivors and victims were taught to live and farm sustainably. Despite such a wide-ranging remit, MPP’s founder regards the movement’s work as grounded in one central tenet: sovereignty. “Sovereignty is nurtured as the right of every person to define environmentally friendly food production policies,” Chavannes said. “Respect for human life; respect for the rights of peasant families over agricultural land; the rights of indigenous peoples over their territories; respect for women’s rights and respect for culture; and the ways of feeding people.” • Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or PayPal, or by phone on 0151 284 1126.

What were you hoping for? Flowing conversation, free food and to meet my future husband. First impressions? He was smartly dressed and relaxed. What did you talk about? Travelling adventures and the awkwardness of the photoshoot. Any awkward moments? He said he’s been likened to Jack Grealish and I couldn’t quite hold in my laughter. Good table manners? Faultless. We shared tapas, and when I mentioned I was vegetarian he agreed to go meat-free with me. He didn’t even criticise me when I ended up ordering the chorizo.
Best thing about Thomas? He was super easy to talk to and has a genuine, warm laugh. Would you introduce him to your friends? Why not. I’m sure they’d get on well. Describe Tom in three words? Not Jack Grealish. What do you think he made of you? Hopefully easy to talk to, probably a bit loud, definitely not vegetarian. Did you go on somewhere? After a few cocktails we went elsewhere for tapas and stayed there till midnight. And … did you kiss? Nope. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? He missed the last train and my tube broke down – so the transport home. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Our paths could definitely cross, but just as friends.

The European champions are already seeking cover at left wing-back after Ben Chilwell was ruled out for the rest of the season. James is expected to be out for at least two months, leaving César Azpilicueta as Chelsea’s only right-sided defender, and Tuchel is worried about his lack of options. “If we play in a back five it is Azpi who replaces Reece James,” Chelsea’s manager said. “If we play a back four we may need a bit more of a defensive full-back – it is also Azpi. Maybe it is Trevoh Chalobah, but Trevoh is out with an injury. We are running out of options. If you talk about Christian Pulisic or Callum Hudson-Odoi, they can only play wing-back. It’s not their preferred position and they cannot play full-back. You lose options not only in personnel but in tactics.
“I will not comment on detail in the market. We check our options and it needs to make sense. If we had a full squad I would love to answer this question and say we need nothing. But we have the issue and that’s why we look into it.” Chelsea, who host non-league Chesterfield in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, want to cover for Chilwell by ending Emerson Palmieri’s loan at Lyon. They are also monitoring Everton’s Lucas Digne and Barcelona’s Sergiño Dest. A daunting fixture list could inform the club’s recruitment. Chelsea play the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Wednesday, go to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup next month and face Lille in the last 16 of the Champions League.
Chelsea, who were interested in Kieran Trippier before the right-back’s move to Newcastle, need more depth. Tuchel, who could recall the 22-year-old right-back Dujon Sterling from his loan at Blackpool, will not hesitate just because James should return soon. “If you don’t know how fast the process is for coming back you can lose a lot of matches,” the German said. “You can lose Club World Cup matches, you can lose Champions League matches, you can lose crucial Carabao Cup matches and league matches. If you are out for four or five weeks you can lose 10 or 12 matches. It can be too much.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/thomas-tuchel-forced-into-transfer-market-by-reece-james-injury-at-chelsea;sports
4872;4872;4872;591;4928;4928;Arsenal will let Mikel Arteta spend but face battle to land Dusan Vlahovic;2022-01-07;['Nick Ames'];['Arsenal', 'Mikel Arteta', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Arsenal will let Mikel Arteta spend significantly to improve his squad in this transfer window if the right players become available, but they face a battle to land the Fiorentina forward Dusan Vlahovic.
Arteta wants a midfielder and a striker, with depth in the former position a priority after Ainsley Maitland-Niles was allowed to join Roma on loan for the rest of the season. The addition of Vlahovic, a hugely sought-after centre-forward who has scored 16 goals in Serie A this season, would be a more extravagant flexing of Arsenal’s muscles and they are making efforts to exploit the Serb’s precarious situation in Italy. Vlahovic has rejected an extension to his contract, which expires in 2023, and Fiorentina will need to cash in on their prize asset before next season. Interest in Vlahovic from Europe’s wealthier clubs is significant and, even if Arsenal put together a viable package this month, they would face several obstacles in completing a potentially complicated deal. One of them is that Vlahovic would need persuading to join a club in their fifth season without Champions League football, although they are fourth in the Premier League and poised to push hard for a return to Europe’s elite competition. Asked on Friday whether Arsenal would try to close a deal for someone of Vlahovic’s standing in the current window, Arteta said: “I think with the amount of things, and the way that we want to evolve the squad, we have to maximise every window in many different ways and we are alert. Edu [the sporting director] and his team are working very hard, as we know exactly what we need to do. Whether we can accomplish that in January or the summer is a different question as it is related to other stuff. “If it is the right player and we can afford it, and we can do what we want to do, we will discuss it and make the best possible decision. We are open.”
Arsenal’s need for a striker has been heightened by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s exile from the squad, although the fact Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette will be able to leave for free in the summer had already made it a key position to strengthen. If necessary Arsenal can postpone an attacking arrival until the summer but it is not so simple in midfield, where Maitland-Niles’s departure and the participation of Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny at the Africa Cup of Nations mean Granit Xhaka and Albert Sambi Lokonga are the only senior players available. “We are going to move and look for options because we are very short there,” Arteta admitted, although he ruled out a short-term deal for Jack Wilshere. The former Arsenal midfielder is training at the club but, despite a clamour among sections of the fanbase, will not be signed as cover. “I think I was very clear with the situation with Jack and the role that he was going to have being around here and we continue the same way,” he said.
Arsenal visit Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Sunday and will wear a one-off all-white kit as part of their “No More Red” initiative to combat knife crime. Any benefit from three more days’ rest after the postponement of Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg with Liverpool may be minimal. Arteta said a mixture of “Covid and injuries” would restrict his options and that his squad was “really short in numbers” but they intend to play the tie.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/arsenal-will-let-mikel-arteta-spend-but-face-battle-to-land-dusan-vlahovic;sports
4884;4884;4884;603;4941;4941;A gentle hidden gem: a visitor’s guide to the NSW far south coast;2022-01-07;['Kate Hennessy'];['Travel', 'NSW south coast', 'Australia holidays', 'Australasia holidays', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Australia news', 'Life and style'];"About six hours drive from Sydney and seven from Melbourne, on Thaua Country in Yuin nation, are the small towns of Pambula and Merimbula. This is not your stereotypical Australian coast of bold, gold beaches and “aparthotels” with salt-smeared glass balconies. The far south coast of New South Wales has a gentle, hidden gem feel. Ringed by national parks and nature reserves, solitude is easy to find – yet so are some unexpectedly excellent spots to eat, drink and caffeinate.
The region is as leafy as it is sandy; as brackish as it is beachy. Just an hour from the Victorian border, the coastline is flecked by lagoons, lakes, estuaries and river mouths. It has an abundance of crescent-shaped bush beaches, fringed by salt-pruned scrub and rustling tea tree tunnels that, on a big year for cicadas, can thrum with brain-rattling intensity.
Fifteen minutes south is windy, whale-y Eden and, a little further, the soon-to-be renamed Ben Boyd national park. The park is known for its Mars-coloured rocks, turquoise-coloured coves and expansive views of an ocean that, from May to September, is often ruptured by the breach of a passing humpback whale. Pulpit Rock at dawn is breathtaking – you can ramble easily around its sloping platform and discover rocky pockets and pools that, in some places, carve out an aperture to the sky similar to a James Turrell skyspace. Inland are the national parks of South East Forests and Mount Imlay, while the coastal national parks of Bournda (20 minutes north) and Mimosa Rocks (40 minutes north) are worth the trip for the spotted gum forests alone. One hour north is Gulaga, a deeply sacred mountain to the Yuin people. If you climb it, you should “ascend respectfully, wearing a red wristband in deference to its sacredness, in bare feet if possible, and preferably in silence,” writes Yuin, Bunurong and Tasmanian man Bruce Pascoe in the guidebook Loving Country. In a roadside paddock on Pambula’s outskirts, the barn-like Longstocking Brewery lures punters that co-owner Peter Caldwell says once spanned “two-months-old and 94-years-old on the same day”. While the weather can get chilly this far south, even in summer, Longstocking’s lush foliage lends it a tropical feel. In addition to craft beer it serves up local bands, local oysters and wood-fired pizza.
Opposite the brewery is the 82-hectare Panboola wetlands, once the region’s race track. For 100 years, punters came to this flood-prone zone to bet on horses but now it’s a rewilded sanctuary for swans, swamphen, egrets and cormorants to wade among the mangroves, saltmarsh and billabongs. The Latham’s Snipe migrates here each spring from Japan. With the bird’s status classed as vulnerable in Victoria, but secure in NSW, it shows how impactful a community-run conservation project such as Panboola can be. Many Australian regions sing the superiority of their oysters but the “wilderness oysters” (the Sydney rock oysters grown in the estuaries between Wonboyn Lake and Bermagui) are crazily, creamily good. You can have them shucked and served with sparkling wine at a restaurant such as Wheeler’s or flip-flop down to an outlet such as Broadwater Oysters, Oyster Barn or McKay’s oyster shed to buy them fresh for a picnic. Eat them for breakfast! No one will care.
Don’t forget how badly this area was hit by the black summer bushfires. Respect the land, the waters and the reality that healing is continuing. Meanwhile, always check tides, practice safe swimming and wear lifejackets in boats and kayaks. Don’t miss Serious hikers shouldn’t miss the multi-day Light to Light walk in Ben Boyd national park. In town, and more family friendly, is the 3km Merimbula boardwalk, which takes you through mangroves and past oyster farms. The lyrically signposted Whale Dreaming Trail in Eden, meanwhile, is an intriguing fragment of the Bundian Way, of which the Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council says “is an ancient pathway for Aboriginal people from Yuin, Ngarigo, Jaitmathang, Bidawal Country that provided safe passage between the coast and the high country.” There are two Bundian Way walks in Eden – one in town and one from Cocora Beach to Quarantine Bay.
Where to sleep Green Cape lightstation Keepers Cottage, or the cheaper Telegraph Station bunkhouse (up the hill), is a rugged and atmospheric national park experience. The newly renovated 1969 Hillcrest Motel in Merimbula throws it back to the 1970s with coastal views to boot. Choice holiday home spots are Long Point (Merimbula) or Pambula Beach. If you camp at Millingandi Station you can kayak to the beach and get oysters delivered to your tent. Where to eat Valentina does well-executed Oz-Med fusion with stunning lake views while Dulcie’s does good vibes, great burgers and oysters in a weatherboard cottage from 1925. For bread, pies and coffee head to Wild Rye’s bakery; for top-notch coffee and inventive breakfasts, try Toast. Sprout Eden is a cafe and a food co-op (across the road) and a blessing for self-caterers with its environmentally ethical system of using excess produce supplied by local green thumbs.
When to go Any month from February onwards is considered “off peak”. Autumn works beautifully for nature adventures with its mild temperatures, bright and crisp days and still-warm water. Giiyong festival (April) celebrates Aboriginal arts, culture and resilience and Narooma Oyster festival (May) is dedicated to the region’s distinct merroir. Meanwhile, music events include Four Winds festival (April), Cobargo Folk festival (May) and Merimbula Jazz festival (June).";https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/08/a-gentle-hidden-gem-a-visitors-guide-to-the-nsw-far-south-coast;entertainment and culture

Great Barrier Island is about 90 kilometres off the coast of New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland. Completely off-grid, the island is home to about 1,000 people and boasts calm bays and surf beaches as well as a dark sky sanctuary, natural hot springs, and native forests. In 2015, island local Gendie Somerville-Ryan started the ‘No Barriers: Small Island Big Ideas’ event series based on the BBC programme Big Ideas. The first event’s theme was pandemics and brought together a virologist, a young adult fiction writer, a sociologist, and a representative from Civil Defence to discuss how the island’s residents should behave if a pandemic was sweeping the world, killing all in its wake. Somerville-Ryan asked me to moderate the event. I’m a microbiologist who has made a career of making nasty bacteria glow in the dark and using them to try to find new medicines and to understand how bacteria evolve to become more infectious. I’m also an award-winning science communicator and have spent more than a decade working with the media, as well as with illustrators, animators, and artists, to make science accessible to the public. My main motivations when I started were to help break down the stereotypes of what scientists look like and to upskill myself so I could communicate my publicly funded research beyond just publishing articles in scientific journals. The most important thing I learned at the Great Barrier event came from listening to sociologist Prof David Johnston. He studies how communities survive disasters. Despite what our favourite apocalyptic books and movies may have us believe, the research shows that the communities that come through disasters the best are those that work together, share their resources, and make sure no one is left behind. That’s what I remembered when the pandemic started. That people doing the right thing, together, was how we would get through this. So as an expert in infectious diseases and a science communicator, in January 2020 I started doing what I could to help people understand the ever-changing science of the pandemic and explain why their actions matter. Soon I was responding to multiple media requests a day, writing my own explanatory pieces for online media organisation the Spin-off, and teaming up with award-winning cartoonist Toby Morris to make the science of the pandemic understandable. It wasn’t long before Toby and his team were adapting our graphics for the World Health Organization. The abuse, harassment, and threats started almost immediately after I began doing media interviews. It’s been happening on a near-daily basis for almost two years now. It happens via my personal and work emails and phones as well as on social media. I’ve had my home address posted multiple times on far-right websites and social media channels, along with calls for people to pay me a visit. I was harassed by conspiracy theorists while eating breakfast in a hotel. They live-streamed the encounter, and afterwards described how sitting next to me had been like sitting next to a paedophile. I’ve even been the subject of a smear campaign by right-wing bloggers and politicians.
Social media abuse is relatively easy to deal with. While sending people death threats doesn’t appear to breach the social media companies’ terms of use, the platforms do at least provide a block button. Third-party apps like Block Party have been a lifesaver as they pre-emptively block abusive accounts. It’s the people who email, text, or leave voicemail messages that I’m fascinated and disturbed by. They use their real names, and often their work email addresses. I sometimes look them up online. They are executives and engineers. Political candidates, finance managers, and office administrators. Real estate agents and electricians. Some of them are retired. Others have hobbies like attending Toastmasters or being members of a running club. They are just everyday people. And they send me hateful and abusive messages because they think I’m a satanist, or that I just want to be famous, or that I’m trying to make money. My harassers can’t imagine someone not trying to profit from a situation like this. It doesn’t seem to occur to them that I could be motivated by just trying to save lives during a global pandemic. Frankly, that says more about them than it does about me. I pity them, and I won’t let them silence me.

4896;4896;4896;615;4953;4953;Should Australians be resigned to getting Omicron? Absolutely not;2022-01-07;['Alyx Gorman'];['Health', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Life and style', 'Omicron variant'];"Lying with a cloth over her face, “unable to even look at things” in the worst sinus pain of her life, Johanna Roberts knew she was a “lucky” Covid-19 patient. “I could manage it by myself, I didn’t have to go to hospital.” Despite being as cautious as possible in the run-up to Christmas, Roberts, who lives in Sydney, tested positive for the virus in mid-December. She still does not know if it was the Delta or Omicron variant. With hindsight, there is just one small silver-lining to her experience. She got sick before “everything completely went to hell”. “I had all the help I needed,” she says. “And I worry that people who have it now don’t have that. It’s just so extreme.”
As Australia’s confirmed Covid-19 cases climb to dizzying new highs, with real numbers likely far higher, it can be difficult to ward-off a sense of fatalism. A feeling that, as New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Boxing Day, “we’re all going to get Omicron”. But health experts implore public vigilance, rather than defeatism. Federal vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Chris Moy, says: “When Hazzard went out and said we’re all going to catch it, I thought that was one of the most irresponsible statements ever.” He says it felt almost like an invitation, “because it did not have the caveat about what you should be trying to do.” “The idea is to slow this down as much as possible so we don’t all get sick at the same time.” Dr Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the George Institute for global health and the University of Sydney says that while Omicron is “unbelievably infectious”, that “doesn’t mean everyone has to get it, and it doesn’t mean everyone has to get it right now”. How risky is Omicron if you’re vaccinated? Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician at the University of Sydney, says that taking a lackadaisical attitude toward Omicron is a dangerous gamble, even for the young and vaccinated. “Even if the majority of people will get Covid mildly and recover quickly, there remains an important minority who despite being relatively healthy will still get Covid severely, with hospitalisation and admission to intensive care.” While vaccinations work well for most people, most of the time, their protection against the virus is not flawless, and will not be the same for everyone, Booy says. There is no way of knowing which “healthy young person” will be “the unlucky one who will get Covid severely.” “This is a virus that’s still worse than influenza, it’s still more likely to kill you than influenza.” Right now, Booy says we are dealing with the fallout from “a whole month of dangerous behaviour, 30 days of Christmas and New Year’s Eve parties which have been super-spreader events.” He adds that in NSW, the pressure high case numbers have placed on the healthcare system makes this “a bad time to get sick”. What precautions should you be taking? The most important thing you can do is ensure all eligible members of your household are vaccinated. Booy says “Omicron … in kids or young adults is really worth preventing” and that the “benefit of vaccination is much greater than any side effects”.
For adults “there’s a palpable and important difference” between being vaccinated and having a booster shot, so if you are eligible for a booster, get one. Booy says Omicron is “extremely unlikely to be devastating if you’re boosted. Only are you at great risk if you’re immunosuppressed and not able to respond to vaccine.” “A booster gives you great protection not only against severe disease but even against mild infection.” Beyond vaccination, Booy says: “We don’t have to be in lockdown but we have to be careful. You go to fewer events, you make sure they’re outside, ventilated, short in duration and few in number.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Martiniuk says that “we need to get ourselves back to the basics of infectious disease control”. While shoring up public health infrastructure like contact tracing and testing will make the biggest impact, on an individual level, she suggests people in areas with high case numbers limit the amount of time they spend in indoor venues, including grocery shopping, and try to reduce the number of people they see. She also suggests you “put a few days in between social gatherings” because “Omicron infects quite quickly.” Taking a beat between seeing people gives you time to “fall sick in between”, thus lowering the risk of spreading the disease to others before you know you have it. Can you relax if you’ve had a booster shot? The short answer is no. “Even if you’ve had a booster, it’s about protecting other people,” says Moy. “We’ve all got to be in it together and not overcomplicate things.” “We need good, clear, simple instructions. Don’t overthink it, whether you’ve had it or had a booster, just practice good, common sense Covid-safe practices that we’ve known all along.” Booy agrees, saying that while those who have good Covid-19 immunity are a lower risk for transmitting the virus, a lower risk does not mean no-risk. “Your behaviour is not only about yourself, it’s about your community,” he says. What about if you’ve already had Covid? Moy and Martiniuk say that there is not yet conclusive data on how much protection a previous Covid-19 infection, Omicron or otherwise, offers, against future Omicron infections, or other variants.
However, Martiniuk says that it is “very clear” from “many people around the world that getting Covid-19 once does not prevent you from getting it again”. Booy says that “there’s no doubt that if you’ve recovered from Covid, on the back of being double vaccinated, you will have longer and stronger immunity”. But he says the risks associated with the illness far outweigh any potential benefits, saying “it would be crazy to have Covid parties”. Roberts, who is double vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 and was permitted to leave isolation just in time to see her family for Christmas. She says that having already been infected makes her slightly “less stressed” as she awaits her eligibility for a booster shot. But some small peace of mind is negligible compared to the “awful” experience of her mild case. “I would choose to not have it if at all possible,” she says. “I don’t recommend it as a holiday experience.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/should-australians-be-resigned-to-getting-omicron-absolutely-not;health
4903;4903;4903;622;4960;4960;Cyber Ninjas, firm that conducted Arizona election ‘audit’, shuts down;2022-01-07;['Sam Levine'];['US elections 2020', 'US politics', 'US news', 'World news'];"Cyber Ninjas, the firm that was contracted by Arizona Republicans to carry out a widely-criticized review of 2.1m ballots cast in the presidential election, is shutting down amid a legal battle seeking to force the company to make documents from the review public.
A judge fined the company $50,000 a day on Thursday – 50 times the amount requested by plaintiffs – for failing to comply with a court order to turn over public records, in a lawsuit brought by the Phoenix-based Arizona Republic newspaper. During the same hearing, a lawyer representing Cyber Ninjas, Jack Wilenchik, begged the judge to allow him to withdraw from representing the firm. He said he had not been paid for his work and that the company was insolvent. Rod Thomson, a spokesman for the company, confirmed in an email on Thursday evening that the company was shutting down. He said Doug Logan, the founder and chief executive who oversaw the review after expressing support for the disinformation pushed by Donald Trump and allies that the 2020 election was stolen by the Democrats, was no longer with the company. “Doug Logan and the rest of the employees have been let go and Cyber Ninjas is being shut down,” he said in an email. He did not respond to questions about why the company was closing. John Hannah, the local judge overseeing the case, warned that the firm could not escape having to turn over documents by shutting down. “The court is not going to accept the assertion that Cyber Ninjas is an empty shell and that no one is responsible for seeing that it complies,” he said, according to the Arizona Republic. The shutdown marks an abrupt turn for a company that led an effort Trump and allies around the country once saw as their most promising effort to prove widespread irregularities in the 2020 election. The effort raised a staggering $5.7m from outside groups. State lawmakers from around the country flew to Phoenix to watch the effort in person and pushed to replicate it elsewhere. This despite other officials at every level declaring the election the most secure in US history, and eventually William Barr, the then US attorney general, saying the Department of Justice had not uncovered evidence of voter fraud that would change the outcome of Biden’s victory in the November ballot. But the Arizona review, which began last April and largely concluded last fall, was quickly beset by shoddy methodology, bizarre practices, and infighting. Its final report in September not only affirmed Biden’s victory in Maricopa county, Arizona’s most populous and the location of the state capital, Phoenix, but also raised questions about election equipment being connected to the internet and mail-in ballot processing procedures. Nearly all of the claims the firm made in its month-long review were debunked on Wednesday in a 93-page document authored by election officials in Maricopa county, where Cyber Ninjas did its review. “Nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws,” the county wrote in its rebuttal. A claim that there were thousands of suspicious duplicate images of ballot envelopes, for example, was easily explainable, the county said. If a ballot comes in with a missing or faulty signature, election officials contact the voter and help them fix it. When the ballot is resubmitted, it is scanned again before being sent to be opened. “Only one ballot was counted for each envelope,” the county said. The report also includes a lengthy technical analysis debunking claims from Cyber Ninjas that its election equipment was connected to the internet. Out of the 2.1m votes cast in the county, officials acknowledged potentially double-counting 50 ballots and said they were referring 37 cases to the attorney general’s office for further investigation for potential voter fraud. Karen Fann, the president of the Arizona senate who was a staunch supporter of the Cyber Ninjas review, seized on those few irregularities to claim the audit was worthwhile. “From day one, the Arizona senate’s efforts have been in pursuit of a singular goal – identifying and implementing improvements to our election’s processes,” she said in a statement. “Although it took 14 months and a costly audit, Maricopa county yesterday joined us in pursuit of this worthwhile objective.” Her statement did not mention two of the most important, and obvious facts from the audit – that Joe Biden won Arizona and the original election results were accurate.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/cyber-ninjas-arizona-election-audit;politics

More than 2,300 flights were canceled in the US on Friday morning. Schools and offices in the north-east were shuttered, by a fierce overnight snowstorm, if not only by the Omicron coronavirus surge, and parts of the north-west were under an avalanche warning. No sooner had gigantic delays on the east coast I-95 road artery in Virginia been cleared earlier this week caused by weather and crashes, a more than 20-car pile-up in more stormy weather stranded drivers for hours in Kentucky. Tens of millions nationwide were hit by hazardous weather in the past 24 hours, ABC News reported, while a whopping 37 states faced winter weather alerts by Thursday evening.
In New England and the larger north-east region, the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted a “quick hitting nor’easter” storm would cause “disruptive snowfall” for the end of the week, with 4-8in falling in parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine. New York City received a quick dump of snow overnight, with New Yorkers waking up early Friday to the sound of snow plows for the first time this winter, followed by bluebird skies and sunshine on the freshly-dusted landscape. Public schools in Boston and Washington DC declared snow days Friday, while federal offices in the DC area closed amid the winter weather. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont shuttered executive branch state offices to the public, and residents were advised to stay home. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, declared a state of emergency because of the winter storm. “We urge all New Jerseyans to stay off the roads, stay updated, and stay safe,” Murphy wrote on Twitter.
Further south, a huge pile-up of vehicles beleaguered the snow-covered Western Kentucky Parkway on Thursday, where drivers barely moved, if at all, for four to five hours. Known injuries were minor, police told CNN. On the other side of the country, in the Pacific north-west and northern Rockies, the NWS warned of “heavy mountain snow and gusty winds” after “a stretch of very active and wintry weather” in the region. “Additional snowfall amounts up to 1-2ft are possible throughout the high terrain, which will exacerbate the already growing concerns for avalanches,” the NWS wrote. As well as flight cancelations, another 931 services were delayed by Friday morning, according to FlightAware.com. Mass cancellations have been dogging the airline industry for weeks because of Covid-related staffing shortages and inclement weather.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/us-weather-snow-north-east-new-york-new-jersey;environment
4938;4938;4938;657;4995;4995;Novak Djokovic ‘lured to Australia to be humiliated’, says Serbia;2022-01-07;['Jon Henley'];['Serbia', 'Novak Djokovic', 'Europe', 'Sport', 'Tennis', 'World news'];"Serb politicians and celebrities have described the treatment of Novak Djokovic as shameful scapegoating, as the foreign ministry in Belgrade suggested the world tennis No 1 had been “lured to Australia … to be humiliated.” The 34-year-old champion, who was born in the Serb capital, is in detention in an immigration hotel in Melbourne pending a legal challenge to Australia’s decision on Wednesday to cancel a visa allowing him to play in the Australian Open. In an op ed for the news portal Iskra, reprinted by the pro-government tabloid Informer, the acclaimed Serbian film-maker Emir Kusturica argued Djokovic’s detention was “not just a lesson to the noble Serb”, but to everyone. Kusturica said the “arrest of Novak Djokovic, first among the free, a rebel who does not want the chains of the new world and believes in a more just order” recalled the plot of a movie in which prominent citizens were arrested as a lesson to the rest.
Australian officials have said the player, who has refused to reveal his Covid vaccination status but previously said he was opposed to vaccination, was refused entry because he failed to meet exemption requirements. They have also said the player is free to leave the country whenever he chooses. “Hasn’t the world already become a prison of which barbed wire is the most expressive symbol?” Kusturica asked. “Aren’t the punishments for those who refuse to be jabbed just another step by the world government?” The president of the Serbian parliament, Ivica Dačić, a former prime minister whose Socialist party of Serbia is a partner in the country’s coalition government, said Djokovic was enduring “despicable political harassment”. Any country in the world “would gladly give citizenship to Mr Djokovic, let alone let him visit for a tournament”, Dacic Dačić said, calling Australia’s behaviour “shameful” and the result of “political instability in that country since elections are approaching”. The player’s family, who on Thursday compared him to Jesus and accused Australian authorities of “trying to crucify him”, called for a mass protest against his continuing detention on Friday, when Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas. “The family of Novak Djokovic calls on all fans and supporters of the best tennis player in the world, who is in a delicate situation, in front of the Belgrade city assembly,” the family said in a joint statement.
“The biggest Christian holiday is an opportunity to show the significance of the community, to send support from Belgrade, and to show how much support the best tennis player in the world has in its own country.” The foreign ministry said in a statement that the Serbian public “has a strong impression that Djokovic is a victim of a political game against his will, and that he was lured to travel to Australia in order to be humiliated”.
It added: “Novak Djokovic is not a criminal, terrorist or illegal migrant, but he was treated that way by the Australian authorities, which is causing understandable indignation of his fans and citizens of Serbia.” The Serbian government sent a formal protest note to its embassy in Canberra for transmission to the Australian government, and the foreign minister Nemanja Starović delivered a verbal protest to Australia’s ambassador to Serbia, Daniel Emery.
The foreign ministry said Serbia did not want to influence the upcoming court decision but expected “the authorities of the country, in the spirit of good bilateral relations, to allow Djokovic to spend (time) in better accommodation”. Djokovic’s wife, Jelena, posted a photo of the couple embracing on a beach to mark Orthodox Christmas, saying: “The only law that we should all respect across every single border is love and respect for another human being.” Milivoje Pantovic is a producer with N1 Television in Belgrade.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/novak-djokovic-lured-to-australia-to-be-humiliated-says-serbia;sports

4953;4953;4953;672;5010;5010;‘It’s like walking through stinging nettles’: Sara Cox on her trailblazing rugby career;2022-01-07;['Robert Kitson'];['Premiership', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"Anyone who has ever tried to be a trailblazer in women’s sport will identify with Sara Cox’s inch-perfect analogy. “It’s like walking through a patch of stinging nettles,” suggests the world’s first female professional referee. “If you’re the first one to do it, you’re going to get stung. If you’re the next person behind me, I’ve already created the path for you. You just need to walk.” Even in supposedly enlightened 2022 it is already clear that professional rugby is not yet a totally level playing field and, as Cox puts it, “there’s always going to be a little bit of friction”. Ideally the hugely capable Cox would be sitting here on the outskirts of Exeter discussing the plum officiating gigs she has already enjoyed, notably last year’s Olympic women’s sevens gold medal match. Instead the 31-year-old is quietly reflecting on the hidden battles she still has to fight in a traditionally alpha-male environment.
Take the history-making day last September when the Devonian became the first woman to referee a Premiership fixture. Her performance in Harlequins’ game against Worcester at the Twickenham Stoop earned universally good reviews; now it turns out she had to wear men’s kit in the absence of properly fitted women’s gear. She ended up in an extra small men’s jersey which she customised herself at home. “With me we’re treading ground we’re never trodden before. ‘We’ve never had a female in the Premiership before so why would we need to order female kit?’ It’s not even considered.” Another fact of life is regularly opting to share a small dressing room with her two male assistants, as opposed to being exiled to a distant side of the ground which can make her pre-match tasks – stud checks etc – more logistically tricky. She mostly finds it easiest to escape around the corner to the shower area and do a speedy change there. “I don’t want to make my male counterparts uncomfortable by changing in front of them … that’s not fair because they don’t know what to do.” Cox, back at the Stoop as an assistant referee for Saturday’s rerun of Quins’ dramatic 2021 Premiership final encounter with Exeter, is not complaining: she is simply telling it like it is, having refereed men’s matches in unglamorous surroundings since she was 17. She was also once a decent enough winger to have been invited to England Under-20 trials. Many are hoping 2022 will prove a stellar year for women’s rugby but, equally, greater recognition for brilliant role models such as Cox is seriously overdue.
How long must we wait, for example, for a woman – whether it be Ireland’s Joy Neville, Scotland’s Hollie Davidson, South Africa’s Aimee Barrett-Theron or Cox – to control a men’s Six Nations fixture? In Cox’s view, the naysayers are fast running out of road. “Nobody has ever turned around to me and said: ‘You’ll never get to men’s international rugby.’ In theory there is no reason why not. None at all.” It might even increase respect for officials worldwide. Aside from some social media abuse following the Olympic final – “You name it, they complained about it” – Cox insists her main on-field issue is players not knowing what to call her. “They stand there almost like little schoolboys going: ‘Er, um …’ I just say: ‘Call me Sir.’ I really don’t mind. By the time they’ve tried to correct themselves and address me as ‘Ref’ or ‘Ma’am’, they’ve often forgotten the point they were trying to make.” Some, though, have been supportive, notably the England prop Joe Marler who promised the scrums in the Quins v Worcester game would not descend into chaos. Sure enough, there were no issues and Cox came away with memories she will forever cherish. “If I could bottle that feeling I’d be a very rich person. People could say what they liked on social media … they were never going to take that unique moment away from me.
“Sometimes the easiest part of your job is being on that field. You’re free of the peripheral noise … you go out and feel at home. In your mind you’re thinking: ‘This is what makes me happy.’ Sometimes people find it strange that a referee might smile. They think about a referee as a robot. It’s as if I should have no personality. Why? I’m still a human being. It’s almost like people think I’m a thing that makes decisions. We’ve got to change that and break that down.” It might also help if rugby folk knew how deep Cox has had to dig emotionally to make it this far. “If I wasn’t optimistic I would have given up a long time ago. There have been a couple of times when I’ve been in some very dark places, both personally and professionally.” The biggest jolt was a breast cancer scare early last summer. “I found a lump in a place I wasn’t expecting to find one. Everything else suddenly doesn’t matter any more. Your whole world stops spinning. You stand there and think ‘Now what?’ Unfortunately there is cancer in my family: my grandmother had it and my mum had a scare as well. You forget about being out on a rugby pitch and all the things that come with that.” Thankfully things turned out fine and her optimistic streak also remains intact. As she continues to stride through her metaphorical nettles – “Yeah, I’m going to get stung a couple of times but I know that what I leave behind me will make life so much easier for the next generation” – she also senses times are finally changing. “I think we’ve got people in the Rugby Football Union who are willing to look at the future of the game and have a genuine desire for it to be all inclusive, no matter your background, your sex or how you identify.”
So what about her own remaining ambitions? Surely she fancies being the next Wayne Barnes or Luke Pearce? “It’s very difficult for me to turn around and say: ‘I think I should be there.’ I have zero control over how appointments are done. The guys above me do that.” OK, but can she feel another slice of history beckoning? “You’ve just got to focus on the bits you can control. Can I go to the gym at 7am and make sure I’m as fit as I can be? Can I go home and put the necessary time into my post-match reviews? Do all that and I put myself in a position where they have no excuse any more.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/07/its-like-walking-through-stinging-nettles-sara-cox-on-her-trailblazing-rugby-career;sports

Shell, the world’s largest producer and trader of liquified natural gas, expects trading results at its integrated gas business in the fourth quarter to be “significantly higher” year on year as the rocketing price of gas outweighs a drop in production volume because of unplanned maintenance works. Wholesale gas prices continue to break records, with energy suppliers warning of a “national crisis” that has already led to 27 suppliers going bust, and the prospect of bills increasing by more than 50% in April to about £2,000 a year. Shell, which will report its fourth-quarter results on 3 February, said it intends to pick up the pace of its $7bn (£5.1bn) share buyback scheme, which is being funded using the proceeds of the $9.5bn sale of its US Permian Basin shale oil assets to ConocoPhillips at the start of December. The company has already returned $1.5bn to investors and said on Friday the remaining $5.5bn “will be distributed in the form of share buybacks at pace”. The remaining $2.5bn from the sale is being used to strengthen Shell’s balance sheet.
While Shell is benefiting from the energy crisis, last week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, held emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, who are pushing for the government to intervene to alleviate the impact of soaring prices. Potential interventions being lobbied for include a windfall tax on major oil and gas companies such as Shell, as well as extending fuel grants, moving green levies from household bills into general taxation, and axing the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the EU. Later this month, Shell will move its headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK and scrap its dual share structure, after shareholders voted to back a proposal to simplify the Anglo-Dutch company’s operation.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/shell-benefits-from-energy-crisis-as-soaring-gas-prices-lift-profits;business and economy
4977;4977;4977;696;5034;5034;Attorney general ‘considering’ referring Colston statue case to appeal court;2022-01-07;['Haroon Siddique'];['Bristol', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'UK criminal justice', 'Court of appeal', 'Race', 'Law', 'Politics'];The attorney general has said she is “carefully considering” whether to refer the Colston statue case to the court of appeal after a jury cleared four protesters of criminal damage over the toppling of the monument. Suella Braverman announced she was contemplating what would be a highly unusual move after an outcry from Conservative MPs following the jury’s verdict on Wednesday. The former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick suggested the rule of law had been undermined, while Tom Hunt, a vice-chair of the parliamentary Common Sense Group, said he was “deeply concerned by the precedent set here”, despite jury decisions not setting legal precedents. Writing on Twitter on Friday, Braverman said: “Trial by jury is an important guardian of liberty and must not be undermined. However, the decision in the Colston statue case is causing confusion. “Without affecting the result of this case, as attorney general, I am able to refer matters to the court of appeal so that senior judges have the opportunity to clarify the law for future cases. I am carefully considering whether to do so.” If the case does go to the court of appeal, the judges will not be able to rule on whether the jury’s decision was correct, only on whether there was an error in law in the directions that were given to the jury. Juries have an absolute right to acquit, which they have exercised in the past for protesters against climate change and military action, even when defendants have admitted causing disruption or damage. People who have used, grown or supplied cannabis for the purposes of alleviating pain have also been acquitted by juries in the past, as was Clive Ponting, a senior Ministry of Defence official, in 1985, who was tried under the Official Secrets Act for revealing to an MP that government ministers had misled parliament over the sinking of the Argentinian warship General Belgrano during the Falklands war.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/attorney-general-considering-referring-colston-statue-case-to-appeal-court;politics
4984;4984;4984;703;5041;5041;The people have spoken: Labour should cut its ties with Tony Blair | Owen Jones;2022-01-07;['Owen Jones'];['Tony Blair', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Keir Starmer', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'Conservatives'];"Sir Tony Blair is a striking case study of how elite opinion and popular common sense collide. In media and political circles, Blair is a respected statesman: when he speaks, agree or not, you listen. His passionate detractors are essentially treated as cranks suffering from an acute case of Blair Derangement Syndrome: an unholy alliance of rightwingers enraged by three consecutive Tory defeats and leftwingers still bitterly resentful about their exile during the New Labour era. Yet among the electorate, sympathy for Blair belongs to the fringe. According to a new YouGov survey, just 14% approve of his knighthood – fewer than believe the moon landings were faked – and only 3% strongly so, while 63% disapprove, 41% strongly so. A decisive 56% of Labour voters disapprove, two and a half times more than approve. Meanwhile, almost a million people have signed a petition demanding the knighthood be rescinded. How Blair went from a prime minister with a 93% approval rating in 1997 to one of Britain’s most loathed public figures – including among his own political tribe – offers invaluable lessons for Labour’s future. There has been no shortage of attempts to rehabilitate him. His frequent public utterances are accompanied by deferential, soft-soap interviews, and Keir Starmer is surrounded by aides (including close associates of Peter Mandelson) who regard recovering Blair’s reputation as a political and moral imperative. The most obvious lesson is, of course, is: don’t launch a bloody war of aggression in conjunction with a hard-right US administration. Blair’s former defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, this week claimed he was asked to burn a memo from the attorney general questioning the Iraq war’s legality; for many of us, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan’s conclusion that it was illegal was already sufficient. Merely mentioning the Iraq war often sets off a cascade of eyerolls, of oh-so-bored retorts of “Move on!” and “Still going on about that, are we?”. Such sentiments, alas, are firmly placed in the long, tawdry tradition of the west’s contempt for brown and black victims of its foreign horrors: if hundreds of thousands of white westerners had so recently been slaughtered, their lives would not be so impatiently dismissed. As protesters courageously battle Kazakhstan’s dictatorship, Blair’s later CV warrants more than a cursory glance. Nursultan Nazarbayev is one of many despots Blair’s foundations have taken millions from: more gruesomely, our former prime minister offered his regime PR advice after it massacred 15 civilian protesters. Now, most of the public are not aware of the finer details of Blair’s association with various tyrannies – including receiving millions from the Saudi regime, which he shielded from a corruption inquiry when he was in No 10. What has cut through is a sense that Blair genuflects before wealth and power while lacking any apparent moral compass.
But it’s a mistake to conclude that Blair’s toxicity relies entirely on foreign horrors. Margaret Thatcher is adored by her own tribe because she transformed Britain in accordance with its most radically held, and long-suppressed wishes. The Tories before her, she declared, had “merely pitched camp in the long march to the left” by accepting the postwar consensus of public ownership, the welfare state and public spending. Those she delighted in facing down – from the trade unions to the municipal left – were the bogeymen of her grassroots, rather than her own kind. Blair mirrored the Tory predecessors Thatcher scolded – “I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them,” he said, on Thatcher’s death – and delighted in confronting elements of Labour’s own coalition. When he assailed the “forces of conservatism”, he included trade unions. While Thatcher’s zeal for privatisation went with the grain of her grassroots, Blair’s own passionate advocacy for expanding the role of the private sector in public services – not least in the NHS, Labour’s most treasured institution – did the opposite. Blair’s reputational downfall cannot be understood without examining his record on immigration either. Under New Labour, immigration did rise sharply, yet without the government making a political argument for it. Meanwhile, a growing housing crisis, caused by the failure to build, and a squeeze on living standards that predated the 2007-8 financial crash – the income of the bottom half flatlined after 2004 while for the bottom third it actually fell – created ample fodder for those seeking to scapegoat migrants. Without Labour offering a counternarrative, or indeed viable solutions to these grievances, anti-migrant sentiment overwhelmed British politics, culminating in Brexit. This issue, too, toxified New Labour, and Blair with it. And here’s the tragedy: Labour did have proud achievements in this period: from the minimum wage to tax credits, from gay rights to public investment (albeit undermined by creeping privatisation), from lifting millions of children and pensioners out of poverty to reducing homelessness. Yet this record was lethally undermined in three ways. First, Blair sought not to emphasise these wins, instead glorifying, say, public-sector reform (code for marketisation), which alienated his own side. Second, these transformative policies relied on an unsustainable financial bubble that inevitably popped. Third, Blair not only failed to defend his own government from the Tories’ post-crash deceit that Labour overspending caused economic calamity, he furthered it – castigating his party for failing on deficit reduction after 2005 and cautioning against blanket opposition to George Osborne’s slash-and-burn economics. That allowed the mainstreaming of the lie that the government Blair himself headed was unsustainably profligate.
Thatcher forged a new political consensus that she forced her opponents to accept; hence her proclamation that New Labour was her greatest achievement. Blairism did no such thing. Its greatest achievement, public investment, was not only swept away after defeat, it was positively demonised. Its other pillar – an inconsistent social liberalism, which included gay rights but which was undermined by often cartoonishly authoritarian home secretaries – has utterly crumbled. So what lessons for Labour today? That relentlessly confronting the interests and values of your own tribe is both politically avoidable and ultimately self-defeating. That relegating progressive values isn’t the strategic genius it might seem to be. And that failing to address growing social and economic insecurities will unleash political forces that will consume you. Blair’s own hubristic belief in his own political genius blinded him to these truths. It’s too late for him: it’s not too late for Labour.

4994;4994;4994;713;5051;5051;Dismantling my tree left me haunted by the ghosts of Christmases past | Digested week;2022-01-07;['Emma Brockes'];['UK news', 'US news', 'New York', 'World news'];"Monday As we age, some things fade, while others take on greater significance. It’s a line that sounds lifted from a Call the Midwife voiceover, but as the new year begins, it also strikes me as true. For the first time this year, I’m aware of a shift in emphasis, from Christmas Day itself – a pain of logistics and expectation management – to the period directly afterwards. Specifically, an occasion that before now I’ve never felt to be any such thing: the taking down of the tree. I bought our tree three years ago from Bed Bath & Beyond. It was $39.99 and came loaded with the kind of lights that, twinkling magically and extremely brightly, caused me to blurt out “bad wiring” and “house fire” every time I walked past. On Sunday night, while my children pottered around engaged with their new presents, I started slowly to remove the ornaments. I untangled the tinsel. I removed the listing star. As I did so, I caught myself in one of those unnerving moments in which you can feel time as an almost material property. For a second, I saw the scene as through a telescope backwards. How much longer would the magic of Christmas hold? How soon would this stage of childhood evaporate? How definitive the dismantling of a large object in my living room felt, the physical manifestation of another year passing. Some of this nostalgia was down to the decorations. We lean heavily on the homemade: the wonky angel from nursery school, already an echo of a distant past, along with the loo roll penguin and the glitter art. Six days after Christmas, my children turned seven – as a friend in Paris pointed out, the beginning of the age of reason. Six seemed to be running on the last vapours of toddlerhood. Seven is a different proposition entirely. With the care of one handling the crown jewels, I laid the decorations in Tupperware and covered them in tissue. “Why do you look like that?” said a child, crossly. God forbid anyone should have a moment of internal privacy in this house. “It’s my thinking face,” I snapped. On we go.
Tuesday Climbing into a cab in the pouring rain, in the middle of Broadway with a bus behind us, is a stressful business without my kids operating at quarter speed. “Hurry up, you guys are so slow,” I say, as they ease their way into the car and I continue to stand in the traffic. “That’s so mean!” says my daughter, when we’re finally in. “You tipped my bucket.” Are you aware of this? The bucket philosophy of childhood emotional welfare? It’s a thing. In schools in the US, or at least in our corner of New York, emotions are buckets. Or wait. The child is the bucket and you, the adult, are responsible for filling or tipping it. That could be wrong. “Explain the bucket thing to me again?” I say. She gives me a look of disdain, like I could study this for the rest of my life and still never grasp it. When children do well at at school, they are issued “bucket tickets”, like the gold stars of yore but with a prize at the end and an extra level of frisson because buckets can also be emptied. “You called me slow and that’s mean and it tipped my bucket,” she says. But I’m not wearing this one. “It would only be mean if you were incapable of going faster,” I say. “Are you saying you are literally incapable of going any faster when I ask you to?” Yes. That’s exactly what she’s saying. Wednesday What a gift on a gloomy Wednesday is Novak Djokovic, not merely barred from the Australian Open, but barred after taking an 18-hour flight from Dubai, then held overnight at Melbourne airport. Never mind that his treatment was a result of a dithering U-turn by the Australian government. It looked, for all the world, like a piece of top-class trolling and correspondents on Australian TV could hardly contain their delight. A day earlier, the Serbian world No 1 and vaccine-sceptic had smugly tweeted “today I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission” – that is, special dispensation to enter Australia and play in the Open, despite being unvaccinated, and causing sufficient fury among Australians for Scott Morrison to jump. At the 11th hour, the country’s border force cancelled Djokovic’s visa and after keeping him in the airport, moved him to another venue. Or as his mother, speaking at a press conference in Belgrade and ably demonstrating where her son gets his charm, summarised the week’s events, Australia was “keeping him a prisoner” in “some small immigration hotel”.
Thursday The new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, has been showing off since his inauguration five days ago, culminating in the moment mid-week when he slides down a firefighter’s pole in Queens. (One tries to imagine Bill de Blasio doing this and concludes it would be worse than that scene from the first Bridget Jones.) Hard on the heels of the pole slide, Adams displays a strapped finger at a press conference, which when questioned about he says is an injury sustained after shaking a police officer’s hand too vigorously. Adams, an eccentric figure who was busted before Christmas for abandoning his car in the middle of the street, to emerge from his house hours later and coolly drive up the pavement in avoidance of the traffic chaos he himself had caused, suddenly seems a delightful prospect for the next four years, with a pinch of that old Ed Koch showmanship. He certainly knows how to spin a line. Stand by, in coming weeks, for Adams to throw his back out bowing his head at the 9/11 memorial, get laryngitis from over-reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and wear an RSI wrist guard after too-enthusiastically saluting the flag. Friday The weather in New York is bananas. It was 15C last weekend for new year; mid-week it dipped to -5. Today there’s snow. I drive through it to a garage to return a rental car. Renting a car in the city can cost more than staying in a hotel, with an invoice full of add-ons that make less sense than a cable bill. Through incompetence, impatience and an inability to decode the fine print, I manage to gift the rental firm half a tank of petrol. This happens every time. It’s really tipping my bucket.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/digested-week-dismantling-tree-ghosts-christmas-past;entertainment and culture
5021;5021;5021;740;5079;5079;‘They want to remove us and take the rock’, say Zimbabweans living near Chinese-owned mines;2022-01-07;['Nyasha Chingono'];"['Global development', 'Zimbabwe', 'Mining', 'Inequality', 'Human rights', 'China', 'Africa', 'World news', ""Workers' rights"", 'Mining', 'Environment', 'Asia Pacific']";"A convoy of trucks laden with huge black granite rocks trundles along the dusty pathway as a group of villagers look on grimly. Every day more than 60 trucks take granite for export along this rugged road through Nyamakope village in the district of Mutoko, 90 miles east of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. The air reverberates with blasts and heavy machinery noises as the mountain above the village is slowly reduced, slab by slab. Quarrying has been happening here since the 1980s. Mutoko stone is sought after for its lustre. It is a popular material for tombstones. An extension to the Danish royal library in Copenhagen, known as the Black Diamond, is clad in Mutoko granite.
The Buja people who live here say that as mining companies extract wealth from the mountain, they leave behind a trail of damaged roads and bridges, hazardous pollutants and dirty air. Cracks can be seen on houses and blast debris is everywhere.
Now 50 families in the village have been told by a Chinese mining company that they will have to leave their homes and land. People in four other villages in the district fear they will also lose their ancestral lands. Two families, including an 82-year-old villager and his wife, have already been relocated by Jinding mining company, which wants to build a polishing plant. “The 82-year-old man collapsed when he heard the news because he never anticipated it. He was later resuscitated at the hospital. This is how bad things are here,” says Claudine Mupereri*, 38. She says the man was told his house was within the area licensed to the mining company by the government. Zimbabwe’s Communal Areas Act gives the president power to decide the use of an area that makes up 40% of the country’s land, home to about 70% of the population. “These companies do not respect communities. If the government does not protect us, then where will we get the protection we need?” says Mupereri. Two other families were given $2,500 (£1,840) to rebuild their homes, but community leaders say this is insufficient. “There is uncertainty around this village. Right now, we do not have anyone willing to help us because our councillor does not want to help us. Anyone who dares to speak out is threatened. Whether they remove us or not, we are already scared to speak out,” says Anesu Nyamuzuwe*. The 40-year-old father of four fears losing five hectares (12 acres) of land, his only source of income. “I have a good farm with fertile soil. My farming always meets my household requirements. I had built a good home and I am close to Mutoko centre, so I am not sure if I will ever get such a piece of land again,” he says. “What is more important, investors or the villagers? We should have the right to reject these people from entering our community.”
Jinding mining company in China could not be reached for comment. A manager and interpreter at the company’s plant in Mutoko says families who live within the 500 hectares the company is licensed to mine will be relocated, but adds: “the people who are giving out the claims [to mining companies] have a problem. Why are they giving them [companies] so much land? This land is almost 500 hectares, I am sure they already know that people live in this place.” Zimbabwe has enjoyed a close relationship with China for decades. But the bond between the two countries solidified when western states imposed economic sanctions on Robert Mugabe’s government. As credit and investments dried up, China stepped in. In 2018, Zimbabwe-Chinese relations were elevated from “all-weather friends” to strategic partners, paving the way for Chinese investors to pour money into the country, particularly in the extractive industries, where they have been accused of paying little attention to environmental damage by environmental and human rights activists. Those living near granite mines say companies are failing to restore the land after extraction. Open pits are left uncovered, endangering children and wildlife. Zimbabwe’s government has been accused of turning a blind eye to complaints because, critics say, it doesn’t want to anger its biggest investor. Mineworkers speak of poor working conditions. At another mine in Mutoko, workers give accounts of beatings and poor pay. “Imagine going to work every day for over 12 hours and getting $50 at the end of it all. When I get home I am tired. My home knows no peace,” one worker tells the Guardian. “My friend was beaten with a steel rod and another 17-year-old boy had his arm broken after coming to work late. He was given $250 as compensation after villagers complained.”
In 2020, two workers were shot and wounded in Gweru, central Zimbabwe, allegedly by a Chinese miner after a quarrel over salaries. Evelyn Kutyauripo, a paralegal with the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela), who has been rallying villagers in Mutoko to resist evictions, says local officials need to protect people. “I blame the headmen and the councillors because they are working with the Chinese. They should stand with the community,” she says, adding that companies were taking from communities and not helping them develop. “They are not developing anything in the community. They should have a strong corporate social responsibility because they are killing our environment. We are suffering, our houses are cracking and there is pollution. The government should come to see what is happening.” Another Chinese mining company, Shanghau Haoying Mining Investments, is also causing unease among Nyamaropa villagers. Last year, the company was reportedly given a government licence to mine granite on tracts of land belonging to local people. “I hear they want to remove us so that they take the rock, which is underneath, but the people do not want to. They will have to use guns to remove us here,” says Gladman Murape*, 34. Shanghau could not be reached for comment. Richard Ncube, a legal officer at Zela, says people in Mutoko were “extremely worried” about evictions. “The major challenge is they are living in the dark, and they are not sure what is going to happen.” He said people were too scared to challenge the company. “We have gathered that most of the communities [in Mutoko] are afraid to come forward and take these matters to court due to intimidation and fear of being victimised,” says Ncube. Attempts to challenge the mining companies elsewhere in Zimbabwe have had mixed results.
In November, Heijin mining company lost its mining licence in Murehwa, a district about 55 miles from Harare, after local leaders complained to the government that the company planned to evict locals. In 2020, Zela was involved in the successful fight to overturn licences to mine coal in Hwange national park, the country’s largest national park, home to 40,000 elephants. Following protests, the government banned mining in all its national parks. However, in September, hundreds of people in Chikomba district, 80 miles south of the capital, were evicted from their ancestral homes to make way for a $1bn iron and steel mining project. The Zimbabwe government says it has not received any reports of abuse of workers in Chinese-owned mines, but it did encourage workers to report any incidents.
Deputy mines minister, Polite Kambamura, urged villagers to approach the ministry if they had problems. “We haven’t heard of any Chinese company which has relocated people in Mutoko. If villagers are not happy, they may approach our provincial mining office in Marondera or come directly to the ministry,” he says. “We understand that if ever there is a company that wants to relocate the people, they should engage the community, to buy that social licence from the community.” Kambamura adds that an environmental impact assessment – to ensure the environmental, social, economic and cultural issues related to any mining project are considered before it begins – must also be conducted by the company and should address any concerns. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Mutoko leaders were also approached for comment. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/07/zimbabwe-china-mines-pollution-evictions;environment

For his first film without collaborator/brother Ethan, Joel Coen has delivered a confident, stylish take on Shakespeare’s murderous Scottish play. Denzel Washington is a magnificently brooding Macbeth, while Frances McDormand embraces the dark side as his lady – a role she was born to play. Their regicidal plot is worked out across austere locations in crisp black-and-white imagery reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. In an inventive touch, Kathryn Hunter plays all three “weird sisters” while eloquent support comes from Bertie Carvel as the doomed Banquo and Alex Hassell as an intriguingly shifty Ross. Friday 14 January, Apple TV+ *** After the Storm
Hirokazu Kore-eda’s 2016 drama is another of the great Japanese film-maker’s understated, comic tales of fractured families and the ways they find to muddle through life. Hiroshi Abe plays Ryôta, a divorced, one-time novelist now gambling away his earnings as a private detective and neglecting his young son. His encounters with his no-nonsense widowed mother Yoshiko (Kore-eda regular Kirin Kiki) and long-suffering ex-wife Kyōko (Yōko Maki) nudge him slowly towards sorting his life out, though not exactly in the way he was hoping for. Sunday 9 January, 12.10am, BBC Two *** The Sisters Brothers
Jacques Audiard, the French director of Rust and Bone, is not the first person you would expect to do a western. But this 2018 film is a fine piece of work, nodding respectfully to the genre staples of gunplay and glorious vistas while sneaking in moments of existential reflection. John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play Eli and Charlie, the chalk-and-cheese assassin siblings of the title, sent to follow Jake Gyllenhaal’s scout John Morris to California and then kill a chemist, Hermann Warm (Riz Ahmed), who has developed a potentially lucrative method for extracting gold from rivers. Sunday 9 January, 10pm, BBC Two *** Eternals
Here, Marvel stirs a whole new set of myths into its melting pot of fantastical adventures. The Eternals – including Gemma Chan’s Sersi, Richard Madden’s Ikaris and Angelina Jolie’s Thena – are superpowered aliens who have protected humanity down the millennia from destructive beasts called Deviants. In the present day, the group assemble again to fight a resurgence of the creatures, while discovering the true reason behind their mission. It’s portentous stuff but has good action, a dab of wit (courtesy of Kumail Nanjiani) and a lovely gold filigree look to it. Wednesday 12 January, Disney+ *** Magnificent Obsession
The film that confirmed Douglas Sirk as the master of Technicolor melodrama and made Rock Hudson a star. He plays egotistical millionaire playboy Bob, who inadvertently contributes to the death of the doctor husband of Jane Wyman’s Helen. Their improbable connection leads to tragedy, redemption and love among the comfortable upper middle classes, in a movie imbued with a philosophy of selflessness and charity as a spiritual act. Thursday 13 January, 6.45pm, Great! Movies Classic *** Save the Cinema
A true story ripe for dramatic treatment, Sara Sugarman’s guileless drama follows the fight to save the Lyric in Carmarthen in the early 1990s. Hairdresser and youth opera director Liz Evans (a warm performance by Samantha Morton) rouses the opposition, including Jonathan Pryce’s retired teacher Mr Morgan, when the council plans to replace the cinema with a shopping centre. There’s light villainy, in the shape of venal mayor Tom (Adeel Akhtar), a dash of Hollywood glamour and a gently reiterated message about the importance of community and local heritage.

Who needs a straight man when you have talents such as Steve Martin and John Candy riffing off each other? In John Hughes’s superb 1987 comedy, the two are thrown together on a frantic, weather-impeded trip from New York to Chicago as they race to get home in time for Thanksgiving. Martin’s advertising executive Neal (superior, quick to anger) and Candy’s travelling salesman Del (genial, accident-prone) are the perfect odd couple in a film that bears comparisons with Midnight Run for its smartly plotted twists and characterful humour.

With that in mind, on New Year’s Eve, Nasa announced that the Biden-Harris administration wanted to extend the operation of the ISS by six years to 2030. Nasa must liaise with its international partners, Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia, to agree their participation. The ESA’s director general, Josef Aschbacher, has already tweeted his support. Keeping Russia as a full partner may prove more challenging. The Russian news agency Tass reported in April 2021 that a research and power module originally intended for the ISS would now become the first part of a national space station. On 2 December, Nasa awarded grants to three private companies to develop commercial space station designs. But they will not be ready for launch by 2024, so an ISS extension to 2030 will give those companies more time to build and launch. Also in the running is an earlier proposal by Axiom Space, which is building a commercial module for ISS that could be detached to become a private space station. If successful, when the ISS is decommissioned Nasa will be able to seamlessly continue its space station research programme by simply switching their crews to the commercial stations.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/07/nasa-russia-international-space-station-iss-biden;science and technology
5082;5082;5082;801;5141;5141;Number of adults with dementia to exceed 150m by 2050, study finds;2022-01-06;['Andrew Gregory'];['Dementia', 'Health', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'Society'];"The number of adults living with dementia worldwide is on course to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050, according to the first study of its kind. Experts described the data as shocking and said it was clear that dementia presented “a major and rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems” in every community, country and continent. US researchers said the dramatic rise from an estimated 57 million cases in 2019 would be primarily due to population growth and ageing. However, several risk factors for dementia – including obesity, smoking and high blood sugar – would also fuel the increase, they said. Improvements in global education access are projected to reduce global dementia prevalence by 6.2 million cases by 2050. But this will be countered by anticipated trends in obesity, high blood sugar and smoking, which are expected to result in an extra 6.8 million dementia cases.
The Global Burden of Disease study is the first to provide forecasting estimates for adults aged 40 and older across 195 countries worldwide. The findings are published in the Lancet Public Health. Dementia cases will rise in every country, with the largest growth in north Africa and the Middle East (367%) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (357%). The countries projected to record the largest rises worldwide are Qatar (1,926%), the United Arab Emirates (1,795%) and Bahrain (1,084%). The smallest estimated increases are in the high-income Asia Pacific (53%) and western Europe (74%), the study suggests. Japan is expected to have the smallest increase in the world at 27%. In the UK, the number of dementia cases is projected to increase by 75%, from just over 907,000 in 2019 to almost 1.6 million in 2050. Hilary Evans, the chief executive of Alzheimer’s Research UK, who was not involved in the study, said the figures “lay bare the shocking scale of dementia across the world”. She said: “We need to see concerted global action to avoid this number tripling. Dementia doesn’t just affect individuals, it can devastate whole families and networks of friends and loved ones. The heartbreaking personal cost of dementia goes hand in hand with huge economic and societal impacts, strengthening the case to governments across the world to do more to protect lives now and in the future.” Dementia is already one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally, with costs in 2019 estimated at more than $1tn (£750bn). Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. A Lancet commission in 2020 suggested up to 40% of cases could be prevented or delayed if exposure was eliminated to 12 known risk factors: low education, high blood pressure, hearing impairment, smoking, midlife obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, social isolation, excessive alcohol consumption, head injury and air pollution. The researchers behind the new study called for more aggressive prevention efforts to reduce dementia risk through lifestyle factors such as education, diet and exercise, alongside research to discover effective disease-modifying treatments and new modifiable risk factors to reduce the future burden of disease. The lead author, Emma Nichols, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, said: “To have the greatest impact, we need to reduce exposure to the leading risk factors in each country. For most, this means scaling up locally appropriate, low-cost programmes that support healthier diets, more exercise, quitting smoking, and better access to education.” The authors acknowledged their analysis was limited by a lack of high-quality data in several parts of the world and by studies using different methodologies and definitions of dementia.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/number-adults-with-dementia-exceed-150-million-2050-study;health
5085;5085;5085;804;5144;5144;Kamala Harris evacuated on 6 January when pipe bomb discovered, report says;2022-01-06;['Adam Gabbatt'];['Kamala Harris', 'US news', 'US politics', 'World news'];"Kamala Harris was inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters when a pipe bomb was discovered outside the building on 6 January last year, according to a report.
The then vice-president-elect, who was sworn into office two weeks later, was evacuated minutes after Capitol police began investigating the bomb, Politico reported. The FBI described the bomb as a “viable” device which “could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death”. Citing anonymous sources, Politico said that Harris was evacuated from the DNC office in Washington at 1.14pm on 6 January, seven minutes after police attended to the bomb. The threat from the pipe bomb was eventually neutralized at 4.36pm, while another bomb, found at the Republican National Committee headquarters, was nullified at 3.33pm. The news that Harris was, for a time, vulnerable to a potential explosion adds a new dimension to the events of 6 January. Harris is the first female US vice-president and first woman of color in the White House. As Harris was being escorted from the DNC building, Trump supporters were beginning to grapple with police on the steps of the Capitol building. Some of the group would breach the building a little over an hour later. No one has been arrested in connection with the DNC and RNC bombs, which the FBI believes were planted by the same person. The devices were planted on the evening of 5 January, and discovered the next day. In September, the FBI published a series of videos showing what it said was a suspect in the case. The agency, along with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification of the person in the videos.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/kamala-harris-dnc-washington-pipe-bomb-report;politics
5092;5092;5092;811;5151;5151;Biden condemns Trump’s ‘web of lies’ a year on from deadly Capitol assault;2022-01-06;['Lauren Gambino'];['US Capitol attack', 'Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'US news', 'US politics', 'World news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats'];"Joe Biden on Thursday forcefully denounced Donald Trump for spreading a “web of lies” about the legitimacy of the 2020 election in a desperate attempt to cling to power, accusing the former president and his allies of holding a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”. The US president condemned his predecessor’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as a “failed” pursuit, but one that continues to imperil American democracy one year after the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, when a violent mob of Trump loyalists breached the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of Biden’s presidential election victory.
In a speech from the Capitol marking the first anniversary of the deadly assault, Biden was unsparing in his assessment of the harm caused by the “defeated former president” whose “bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or constitution”. “For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol,” Biden said, never mentioning Trump by name. “But they failed.” And yet the falsehoods and conspiracies that were a precursor to the violence still persist, Biden warned. He asked Americans to recommit to the protection of the nation’s 200-year-old system of government. “At this moment we must decide: what kind of nation we are going to be?” Biden said, speaking from the National Statuary Hall in the Capitol’s inner sanctum, one of several spots overrun and defiled by rioters on 6 January. He warned: “The lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.” Trump originally planned to hold a news conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday evening, but canceled amid pressure from Republicans and conservative allies who worried it would be a harmful distraction. But that did not prevent Trump from issuing a series of furious statements in which he continued to perpetuate the “big lie”, claims that were rejected by dozens of courts, Republican election officials and members of his own administration. “They got away with something, and it is leading to our country’s destruction,” Trump wrote in one such salvo that made no mention of the violence that occurred in his name that day. Four people died in the chaos of the hours-long siege, as rioters overran police barricades, wielding flagpoles and fire extinguishers to break windows and battle law enforcement officers. One US Capitol police officer, Brian Sicknick, died a day after being attacked by rioters and 140 police officers were injured. Most Republicans were physically absent from the Capitol on Thursday, with many of party’s senators, including the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, traveling to Georgia for the funeral of their former colleague Johnny Isakson, who died in December. In a statement, McConnell called the attack “antithetical to the rule of law” and said he supported efforts to hold accountable those who broke the law.
But he did not denounce Trump as he and many Republicans did in the aftermath of the attack. But a year on, the shock and revulsion have dissipated, and Trump remains the most powerful and popular figure in a Republican party, and questions about the legitimacy of Biden’s election have become a litmus test for candidates seeking the former president’s endorsement. Biden’s speech opened a day-long program of events on Capitol Hill to mark the anniversary. Throughout the day, members grew emotional as they recounted their memories of the insurrection – the sound of pounding fists at the door of the chamber, the whirring of the escape hoods, the shock of a Confederate flag in the hallowed halls. Others recounted quiet moments of grief and acts of heroism – the bravery of the police officers who defended the Capitol and the aides with the presence of mind to carry to safety the wooden boxes containing the electoral votes. Presiding over the House floor on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that democracy had prevailed when members returned to the Capitol after the riot to ratify Biden’s electoral victory. “The Congress, because of the courage of all of you, rose to honor our oath and protect our democracy,” she said, before leading members – all Democrats with the exception of congresswoman Liz Cheney – in a moment of silence.
Speaking just before Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris, a former California senator who was in the Capitol on the morning of 6 January last year, said the rioters not only defiled the building but assaulted “the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend”. In their comments, Harris and Biden called for the protection of voting rights. Harris urged lawmakers to pass the voting rights bills currently stalled before Congress. The insurrection was the last desperate attempt by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, after a series of legal challenges and a pressure campaign failed. On that day, a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol after Trump encouraged them to “fight like hell” as Congress convened to certify the election result. But lawmakers who had initially fled for their lives during the siege returned to the chamber, shaken but resolved, to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. In the year since the attack, elected officials, historians and democracy advocates have warned that the threat of future violence remains high. Trump and his allies have spent the past months rewriting the 6 history of January, downplaying the violence and shifting the blame. It was the the worst attack on the Capitol since it was burned by British forces in 1814. Much of Biden’s speech was devoted to establishing fact from fiction about the events of 6 January, as a revisionist history of the attack, promoted by Trump and his allies, takes root. “That’s what great nations do: they don’t bury the truth, they face up to it,” he said. “We must be absolutely clear about what is the truth and what is a lie.” “This wasn’t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection. They weren’t looking to uphold the will of the people, they were looking to deny the will of the people,” Biden said. All the while, Biden charged, Trump watched the violence unfold on TV from the private dining room near the Oval office. “He can’t accept that he lost.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/joe-biden-donald-trump-capitol-attack-anniversary;politics

The Downing Street flat is a complete tip. Just imagine the state that Theresa May left it in. The kitchen looks like something fitted by Peter Jones. I need an answer soonest. Boris From Lord Brownlow to the prime minister, 29 November 2020 Dear prime minister, It would have been nice if you could have used the word “please”. Are you sure the place is really that bad? I’ve checked the price of the wallpaper and it’s £840 a roll, which seems a bit steep. Plus, it’s totally hideous. I don’t mind stumping up but I don’t want to get taken for a ride. Sincerely yours, David From the prime minister to Brownlow, 29 November 2020 Hi David, You seem to have misunderstood your role. The whole point of you is that you do get taken for a ride and in exchange you get a new honour every now and again. You’re already a lord; what more do you want? So can we just get on with it? Carrie has already given Lulu Lytle her instructions and I just need to confirm the money is in place. Not mine, obviously, because I’m struggling to get by on £160,000 a year these days and the alimony payments on the kids are crippling. Besides, I’ve never really paid for anything and I’m not intending to start now I’m prime minister. Boris From Brownlow to the prime minister, 29 November 2020 Dear prime minister, You are quite right. I was forgetting my place. Your taste in soft furnishings is impeccable. I will authorise the payments forthwith. Yours sincerely, David From the prime minister to Brownlow, 29 November 2020 So where’s the money? You said it would come immediately. Can you add on another grand? Dilyn’s just chewed his way through the electrics. From Brownlow to the prime minister, 29 November 2020 Dear prime minister, It will be in your account within the next hour. I am sorry it has taken so long. Yours sincerely, David From the prime minister to Brownlow, 29 November 2020 That’s ideal. Now, you’re sure no one will know that the money has come from you?

From Brownlow to the prime minister, 29 November 2020 Dear prime minister, I’m sorry for the delay. No one will ever find out where the money comes from because I am in the process of setting up a blind trust. Once that’s up and running you’ll be in the clear. And thank you so, so much for considering my Great Exhibition plan. It’s been an honour to serve you again. Grovellingly yours, David From the prime minister to Carrie Johnson, 29 November 2020 All sorted. Though I did have to go along with his pathetic Great Exhibition fantasy. Bozza xx From Geidt to the prime minister, 2 December 2021 Dear prime minister, The above WhatsApp exchange has just been passed to me. It completely refutes your previous assurances to me that you had no idea where the money for the unnecessary Downing Street refurbishments came from. Not only does this make you look like a liar, it makes me look like a complete idiot for having exonerated you earlier in the year. Do you have any ideas on how we can resolve the matter in a way that causes least damage to us both? Yours sincerely, Lord Geidt From the prime minister to Geidt, 10 December 2021 Dear Lord Geidt, I am sorry to have taken so long to reply and for putting us both in this awkward situation. I have been going back through my diaries and I think what must have happened is that Dilyn ate my phone so I never passed on the old messages to you. My mistake, old boy. But don’t worry, it will be no big deal. Boris. From Geidt to the prime minister, 10 December 2021 Dear prime minister, Is that really the best you can come up with? No one’s going to fall for that. Please have another think. Yours sincerely, Lord Geidt From the prime minister to Geidt, 19 December 2021 Dear Christopher, We seem to be in this together. So, here’s what happened. I had to change my phone because my mobile number had been posted on Popbitch. And what with all the hassle of transferring data to my new burner, I completely forgot to pass on my earlier message exchanges with Brownlow. From Geidt to the prime minister, 19 December 2021 Dear prime minister, Do you really think that’s any better? Everyone knows that all messages in a WhatsApp chain get transferred on to a new phone. And even if they didn’t, will anyone believe that you just happened to forget that someone had just forked out a six-figure sum to bail you out? It’s all right for you. Everyone knows you’re a liar so they won’t expect any more from you. But I’ve got a reputation to protect. Any suggestions?

5138;5138;5138;857;5198;5198;The 355 review – Jessica Chastain-led action thriller is a disappointing dud;2022-01-06;['Benjamin Lee'];"['Film', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Culture', ""Lupita Nyong'o"", 'Action and adventure films', 'Thrillers', 'Penélope Cruz', 'Diane Kruger']";"While X-Men scribe Simon Kinberg’s junky action thriller chooses not to reveal the meaning behind its truly forgettable title until the end (one of his many bizarre decisions as writer-director), I’m going to start by explaining that The 355 is a reference to Agent 355, one of America’s first female spies, deployed during the late 18th century, real identity forever unknown. Perhaps the reason we find this out so very late is that a mere whiff of this story ends up being far more dramatically enticing than the film it’s inspired, the first big release of the year doubling up as its first big disappointment.
Back in 2017, while in the middle of shooting another ill-advised disaster – the loathed X-Men spin-off Dark Phoenix – Jessica Chastain approached Kinberg about creating a female-led action thriller in the vein of James Bond and Mission: Impossible. By the following summer, the film was presented to buyers at Cannes by Chastain and co-stars, an appealingly commercial package that was unsurprisingly snapped up fast. Almost four years later, after a delayed release as a result of Covid, whatever might have worked on paper fizzles out on screen, a gussied-up pile of schlock that wastes a cast who deserve so much better. Rather than being worthy of the collective might of Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Penélope Cruz, Diane Kruger and Bingbing Fan, it feels like the kind of bottom shelf dross that Bruce Willis and Jesse Metcalfe would sleepwalk through to pay the bills, piles of cash handed over via grubby manilla envelopes. The derivative, stitched-together plot focuses on an all-powerful piece of tech that can hack into pretty much anything, crashing planes, tanking power grids and creating chaos for whomever its owner wants. Mace (Chastain) is an agent tasked with bringing it in along with her colleague and best friend Nick (Sebastian Stan). But the plan goes awry and Chastain is left as a lone wolf, forced into partnering with agents from around the world to figure out what happened and who is to blame.
It’s every bit as generic as that sounds, with a hapless, first-draft script from Kinberg and playwright Theresa Rebeck that fails to introduce any surprise, suspense or humour, coasting along on its stretched star cast and good intentions. The genre still remains heavily male-skewed of course but simply replacing male action heroes with women and then standing back waiting for applause isn’t quite enough. There’s been a very slow inch toward a tad more equality of late, with recent female-led streaming efforts like The Old Guard, Kate and Gunpowder Milkshake easily putting The 355 in the shade, and so beyond the logline “what if Bond but with women”, there’s not much else brought to the table. The film also can’t decide if it’s skewering the genre or conforming to it. In one scene, Chastain’s character ridicules the lack of reality in a 007 movie – “James Bond never has to deal with real life” – but just a scene later, just after travelling around the world in an unexplained army plane, the on-the-lam women arrive at a gala with new outfits, new wigs and new tech, reality nowhere to be seen. Films such as The 355 live and die by the quality of their action set pieces and while there’s a propulsive pace to the proceedings, there’s never quite enough genuine excitement. The fight scenes, of which there are many, are shoddily captured despite game performers and so the action has a numbing effect, confusingly choreographed and ultimately rather boring. Chastain, who recently gave one of her finest performances in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, is a bit flat and muted here without any eccentricities to play with and so doesn’t really convince as the charismatic, take-no-prisoners lead inspiring a ragtag bunch of agents to follow her. There’s not much of interest for Nyong’o, Fan and particularly Cruz to chew on and so it’s Kruger who steals it, stepping in for the originally cast Marion Cotillard, doing a lot with very little. No one expects intricate character development with a barebones film such as this but there’s barely an attempt to even differentiate the characters outside of their nationalities, a film about strong women that reduces them to nobodies. Like the films it aspires to be like, The 355 ends with the promise of more but even without an Omicron-hit box office and a cursed January release, it’s unlikely that audiences would be clamouring for a sequel. There will be worse films to come this year but not many will be quite as hard to remember by the end of it. The 355 is out in US and UK cinemas on 7 January";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/the-355-jessica-chastain-penelope-cruz-action-thriller;entertainment and culture
5172;5172;5172;891;5232;5232;The Afghan judge working to free her sisters left behind;2022-01-06;['Diane Taylor'];['Afghanistan', 'Immigration and asylum', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Taliban'];"Just under three weeks before the Taliban reached Kabul and took control of Afghanistan, 50 of the most powerful women in the country gathered outdoors in a shady spot to discuss how to deal with the approaching danger. Wearing colourful headscarves, some took notes while others listened intently to Fawzia, 48, one of the most senior female judges in Afghanistan. Holding a microphone, she spoke with urgency about the advancing threat and the need to protect the rights that female lawyers, women’s rights activists and journalists had spent decades fighting for. But they had no idea quite how quickly their precious freedoms were going to be lost. Fawzia and her family escaped from Afghanistan via Tbilisi, Georgia, after the main Operation Pitting airlifts had concluded. They are now being accommodated in a hotel in London under Arap, the UK government’s Afghan relocations and assistance policy.
Unlike asylum seekers, the Afghan families are treated more like tourists or business travellers. They are also not constrained by burly security guards standing with folded arms in front of the hotel entrance. Fawzia, her lawyer husband and their four children – aged 18, 16, 11 and nine – say they are very grateful for the sanctuary that has been offered them, and the British government has been very kind. But they do not know what the future holds. Like other Afghans brought to safety, they have been granted six months’ leave to remain in the UK. Details of what will happen after that are not known. Fawzia is energetically networking with other female Afghan judges and human rights defenders in exile, along with prominent female lawyers in the UK such as Helena Kennedy, to try to secure a safe exit for those who have not yet managed to escape. She is becoming increasingly anxious about the female judges still stranded in Afghanistan. She believes that while hundreds have escaped, 93 remain there. “The situation for these women is getting worse all the time,” she says. News that eligibility criteria for the Arap scheme are tightening fills her with dread, and she is urging international governments to do more to rescue women still in hiding in her home country. “We must ensure they can be brought to safety.” Fawzia says she has parents to thank for inspiring her to aim high and fight for what she believes in. Her father was a successful scientist with his own factory and the family lived in a large and comfortable home in Kabul. “When the Taliban was in control of everything the first time in the 1990s I did not leave our home for five years. It was a dark and sad time – women and girls lost all their rights,” she says. “I spent my time studying and growing vegetables like tomatoes and peppers in the garden.” Her parents emphasised the importance of girls getting a good education and a career. “By the time I was eight or nine years old I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,” she says. “My mother’s advice to me for when I was grown up was: stand on your own two feet, don’t stand on your husband’s feet.” After qualifying as a judge, Fawzia worked with her government’s ministry of women’s affairs and introduced groundbreaking protections for women and girls including safe houses for women so they could escape from violent husbands, and protections against forced and child marriages. Although life in Kabul after the Americans and the British drove the Taliban out after 9/11 offered more opportunities to women, things were still very dangerous for women like Fawzia who challenged the status quo. “All the time I was in danger in my work,” she says. “And so were the women I was trying to help. One time a violent man came to the court with a gun to shoot his wife who was trying to get justice for things he had done to her. As he pointed the gun at his wife I hit his hands to direct the gun away from his wife. The bullet missed her and she survived.
“Another time I was in the car with one of my children who was just six months old. Some people tried to kidnap my baby. I hid her under the seat to save her. “Everything is lost for women in Afghanistan,” she says. “The situation for them is much worse now than it was soon after the Taliban took over.” She is determined to continue raising her voice for her sisters who are in peril just as she did in Afghanistan. Her focus is on building the international network to support the women left behind. For her family’s future in London she is hopeful and optimistic. “In Kabul we lived in a big house. But now it doesn’t matter if we have a big house or a small house. For the first time since the Taliban took over Afghanistan I felt safe and slept well when we arrived in the UK. Here we can start again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/the-afghan-judge-working-to-free-her-sisters-left-behind;business and economy
5174;5174;5174;893;5234;5234;UK weather: travel warnings issued amid snow, sleet and rain;2022-01-06;['Mark Brown'];['UK weather', 'Snow', 'England', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland', 'Road transport', 'UK news'];"Warnings of widespread travel disruption and tricky driving conditions have been issued as snow, sleet and rain swept across large parts of the UK on Thursday. The warnings came as a big chill enveloped all four nations. A temperature of -8C was recorded on Thursday morning in the village of Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, making it the coldest night in England of the winter so far, the Met Office said. Richard Miles, a Met Office spokesperson, said wintry snow showers were possible everywhere from mid-Wales upwards, with northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt. Blustery conditions would make the temperatures feel colder for many throughout the day and night as air from the Canadian Arctic swept across the UK, he said. Four Met Office yellow warnings for the west of Northern Ireland, northern England and much of Scotland were in place on Thursday, all of them cautioning about snow, sleet, ice and difficult travel conditions which were likely to continue into Friday morning. The alerts included warnings of thundersnow in Scotland, a relatively uncommon phenomenon. “It is just thunder when it’s snowing,” Miles said. “It happens for the same reason that thunder and lightning happens in the summer, it’s to do with the temperature gradient. It is the same mechanisms but it sounds and looks slightly different in snowy conditions.”
Miles said there was a small risk of power cuts or mobile phone coverage issues because of the weather conditions. The weather was affecting some ferry services in Scotland, including one of the busiest routes, between Ardrossan, in north Ayrshire, and Brodick, on the Isle of Arran. They were cancelled on Thursday and are expected to resume at 8.20am on Friday. Sailings to the islands of Coll, Tiree, Iona and to Armadale on Skye were also cancelled due to strong winds and swell conditions. Traffic Scotland tweeted safety tips for drivers. The wintry conditions follow an unseasonably mild new year, with record temperatures as high as 16.5C in Bala, Wales, on New Year’s Eve. “We are back to what you would expect in the winter,” Miles said. “It is more like average temperatures.” The yellow warnings are in place until late morning on Friday, with the weekend weather across the UK expected to be unsettled and changeable.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/uk-weather-travel-warnings-issued-amid-snow-sleet-and-rain;environment
5183;5183;5183;902;5243;5243;Edward O Wilson obituary;2022-01-06;['Georgina Ferry'];['Biology', 'Biodiversity', 'Science', 'US news', 'World news', 'Alabama', 'Society'];"When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individual’s genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the “nature v nurture” debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined “human nature” includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilson’s numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilson’s work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilson’s work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planet’s surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. “We’re extinguishing Earth’s biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin,” he wrote. “Have we no shame?” Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should “never back down if honour is at stake”; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ant’s progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hölldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as “just a flick on a movie screen”, but, he added “We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever.” Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine. • Edward Osborne Wilson, biologist, naturalist and author, born 10 June 1929; died 26 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/06/edward-o-wilson-obituary;science and technology

Cage was speaking as part of a wide-ranging roundtable discussion for the Hollywood Reporter with fellow actors including Peter Dinklage, Jonathan Majors and Andrew Garfield. On being asked whether guns should be banned from film sets in the wake of the Rust shooting, Cage responded by saying that “movie stars” needed to know how to perform certain activities that may be outside the experience of workaday actors. “You need to know how to fight. You’re going to do fight scenes. You need to know how to ride a motorcycle. You need to know how to use a stick shift and drive sports cars, and you do need to know how to use a gun. You do. You need to take the time to know what the procedure is. Those are part of the job profiles.” Cage also added that these can overlap with the role of a stunt performer, in a mutually beneficial way. “The stunt man and the movie star are two jobs that coexist. Every stunt man needs to be a movie star, and every movie star needs to be a stunt man.” Hutchins died, and director Joel Souza was wounded, on the Rust set in October 2021, after a live round was discharged from a gun carried by actor Alec Baldwin, as Baldwin was rehearsing for a scene. Police investigations into the incident are ongoing.;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/nicolas-cage-gun-rust-shooting-alec-baldwin;entertainment and culture
5219;5219;5219;938;5279;5279;Khawaja’s stand-in century a triumph for Australia’s old problem solver | Geoff Lemon;2022-01-06;['Geoff Lemon'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Australia cricket team', 'England cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"There was a moment early in the second day at the Sydney Cricket Ground when Steve Smith looked nailed on for a hundred. Sure, it was a dot ball, and sure, he was on seven at the time. But there was something about the way he stepped into a straight drive back at Stuart Broad, the feet moving perfectly, the timing crisp with no attempt at power, the line so straight that the bowler bent to scoop up the ball. At the ground where Smith made three international centuries in the previous Australian summer, he looked like Smith looks when he is most switched on. Yet a few hours later, it was Usman Khawaja raising his bat to the cheers of a home crowd. Broad had got the better of Smith for 67, to an uncharacteristic push at a ball that didn’t require one. Khawaja had left the bowling impeccably, defended it resolutely, and taken it on when given the opportunity, in an innings that showed all of the best parts of his game built over the course of his lengthening career.
It was the shortcomings in his game that led to Khawaja spending most of the past two and a half years outside the national team, having been dropped after the third Ashes Test at Headingley in 2019. Khawaja had not had a terrible series batting at first drop, making 40 in an important partnership at Edgbaston and 36 in another at Lord’s. But he hadn’t made a compelling score, and then ran into some bad luck or bad timing. Australia pulled the trigger on the opener Cameron Bancroft early, replacing him with Marcus Harris after two Tests. Marnus Labuschagne impressed in the third Test as Smith’s concussion replacement, and had to be retained when Smith returned. Had Australia given Bancroft one more match, he could either have succeeded and kept his spot, or been replaced by Khawaja moving up the order. But with Harris having played only once, selectors had to keep him for a stint that was ultimately worse than Bancroft’s, while Khawaja returned home to a poor Sheffield Shield season and floated out of the reckoning entirely. Since then the reasonable conclusion has been that Khawaja’s time is done. He turned 35 just before Christmas, while Labuschagne has cemented himself in Khawaja’s old spot at No 3, and Will Pucovski emerged as the young tyro most likely to accompany David Warner’s final years at the top. Warner and Smith are also moving deeper into their 30s and overall the Test team has needed to be refreshed.
But just as things change quickly in one direction, they can go quickly in the other. Khawaja had a good half-season, Pucovski was ruled out with another concussion injury, Travis Head returned a positive Covid test, and suddenly there was a spot that needed to be filled, and a job that needed to be done. Khawaja is no stranger to solving problems for Australia. During the one-day World Cup in 2019 he was thrown in at No 5 despite never having batted there in List A cricket. In the current match he was asked to bat there despite never having done so in Tests. By this point of his career the details such as where he bats don’t seem to faze Khawaja. He walked in on the first evening with Australia 117 for three, with trouble looming for the team if he failed, and instead made sure that he didn’t. He first batted through to stumps, then through the first session of the next day with Smith, before assuming the senior role once Smith was gone. Through those hours, and his 260 deliveries, his patience and concentration shone through. At times in his career Khawaja’s innings have been ended by lapses in either. After a long first session with an extra half-hour, as he moved beyond his half-century, he opened up his repertoire of strokes: that lavish cover drive, a back cut, the pull. But they were careful selections for the right occasion, not extravagances for their own sake. Through he went past tea, towards sunset, taking Australia to a point where his eventual dismissal for 137 prompted a charge towards a declaration rather than a rearguard.
Of course, there is the question of what is next. But Khawaja before this match said that he was filling in for the match in Head’s spot. He is probably right, with the longer-term holder having been anointed and having made his own match-defining century in Brisbane. Head will return for the fifth Test in Hobart. Khawaja’s assignment was short-term and it has been fulfilled immaculately. It doesn’t need to lead to anything else for it to be a triumph in its own right, a player showing that he still has what it takes years after he stopped getting that chance. Beyond Hobart, Australia will play nine Tests in Asia in the coming year. On his last visit in 2018 Khawaja made his masterpiece 140 to save a Test in Dubai. There is every likelihood that more chances will arise, and Khawaja has shown himself ready.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/06/khawaja-stand-in-century-a-triumph-for-australias-old-problem-solver-ashes-cricket;sports

Romain Saïss Morocco Maybe Saïss can no longer be described as underrated after his manager at Wolves, Bruno Lage, proclaimed him to be “the Moroccan Maldini” but the 31-year-old still tends not to get a mention in discussions of the Premier League’s most reliable and inspirational defenders despite his continued excellence this season. His quality has long been recognised in Morocco, whom he has captained since 2020 and hopes to lead on a better campaign than their disappointing past two appearances in the Cup of Nations. They will certainly not be allowed to ease their way into the 2022 edition, since they face Ghana in the first group game. While Saïss drives his team on from the rear, assisted by the wonderful Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi, Morocco are likely to look to Ryan Mmaee to make the difference for them up front. The 24-year-forward, who plays for Ferencvaros, has made a thrilling impact since declaring for Morocco last year, his speed and dribbling helping him to score four goals – and create another four – in four matches. Born in Belgium to a Moroccan mother, he – and his brother Samy, who could partner Saïss in central defence – will be aiming for glory in Cameroon, the birthplace of their father. That would be a lovely family story and also help vindicate the decision of the manager, Vahid Halilhodzic, to leave out Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech for a perceived lack of commitment.
2. Ismaël Bennacer Algeria Djamel Belmadi was a hothead as a player but his serene leadership since becoming his country’s manager in 2018 is the chief reason why Algeria are the favourites to win the tournament and retain the crown they claimed in 2019. The manager has brought order where there had been disarray, finding a way to turn an array of gifted individuals into a powerful collective. There is much more to Algeria than Riyad Mahrez. Milan’s Bennacer, voted player of the last tournament, is not as spectacular as the Manchester City magician but is a dynamic, clever and constant influence in midfield, where Saïd Benrahma can also be expected to create regular problems for opponents – and chances for Youcef Belaïli, a striker who is seeking a new club after being let go last month by his Qatari employers a day after, coincidentally, scoring for Algeria to knock Qatar out of the Arab Cup. 3. Sébastien Haller Ivory Coast This striker is not defined by the past. He was a youth international for France and a flop for West Ham. Now, with Ajax, he is top scorer in the Dutch league and he set a record this season by scoring 10 goals in the Champions League group stage. He hopes to take that form into the Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, whose attack he has been leading since scoring on his debut in November 2020. In addition to one of European football’s most in-form strikers, the Elephants boast, with Franck Kessié and Ibrahim Sangaré, one of the strongest central midfields at the tournament. They could seriously complicate things for Algeria, whom they meet in the group stage and maybe later, too.
4. Hannibal Mejbri Tunisia The midfielder, who turns 19 this month, has made one senior appearance for Manchester United, a fact Ralf Rangnick has suggested he hopes to change after Mejbri returns from his latest international adventure. He impressed at last month’s Arab Cup, where he helped Tunisia to finish as runners-up. There he demonstrated not just his technical finesse but also his personality, as he fended off occasional attempts to rough him up and took plenty of creative initiative. Reaching the final in Cameroon will be much harder but with Mejbri helping Wahbi Khazri to add ingenuity to a well-drilled side, Tunisia could go far.
5. Steven Caulker Sierra Leone Caulker’s only appearance for England, in 2012, is not easy to forget: the defender scored by heading in a free-kick from Steven Gerrard, who was making his 100th appearance, but that was rather overshadowed by four goals from one of the forwards he was tasked with subduing, Zlatan Ibrahimovic (although Caulker was on the pitch for only one of them). That was all in a friendly, however, and since Caulker did not appear again for England, he is free to celebrate his roots by representing Sierra Leone, where his paternal grandfather was born. When he makes his competitive debut at the Cup of Nations, it will be a moment to savour for the 30-year-old, who has overcome mental illness to continue to enjoy his career. The former Liverpool and Tottenham defender plays for Gaziantep in Turkey, on loan from Fenerbahçe. Sierra Leone are underdogs in a difficult group but making it to the tournament is a commendable achievement for the country and for Caulker.
6. Chidera Ejuke Nigeria Nigeria’s spluttering performances over the past year led to the dismissal of Gernot Rohr, who had been the country’s longest-serving manager until being jettisoned last month. The preparations of the interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, have been hampered by the loss of key forwards: not just the brilliant Victor Osimhen but also Emmanuel Dennis and Odion Ighalo, whose Saudi club, Al Shabab, refused to let him go on similar grounds to those that enabled Watford to keep hold of Dennis. All of which is likely to increase the pressure on Kelechi Iheanacho to provide goals. He can expect high-class assistance from the wonderful winger Samuel Chukwueze but also from central areas if Eguavoen’s plan to deploy the CSKA Moscow wideman Ejuke as a No 10 pays off. Ejuke’s extravagant skills and impressive speed make him a delight when on song and suggest he could run the Super Eagles’ show, which starts with a blockbuster against Egypt on Tuesday.

5258;5258;5258;977;5319;5319;Republicans are laying a path back to power – and paving it with lies | Rebecca Solnit;2022-01-06;['Rebecca Solnit'];['US Capitol attack', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'US politics', 'World news', 'Donald Trump'];"When the insurrectionists of 6 January rampaged through the Capitol, congressman Andrew Clyde of Georgia helped barricade a door, and he fled when the rest of Congress did. A photograph shows him looking panicky, mouth wide open and arm gesticulating wildly, behind what appears to be a security team member with a gun drawn, defending him. But a few months later he declared: “Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos, pictures. You know, if you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from 6 January, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.” Clyde’s account of 6 January might be a little more preposterous than those of his fellow Republican legislators. But they all joined him in pretending nothing much had happened and objecting to the investigation of the day’s events. After all, they were partly responsible, most of them. It was elected Republicans who supported and spread the earlier lies that Donald Trump had won the election, the lies that fed the insurrection; and then they lied some more about their own words and actions before, during and after. In the immediate aftermath, the then Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was angry and shaken, declaring: “The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.” Then he too began the project of walking it all back. What has ensued is a cover-up in plain sight. When Trump took office in 2016, Republicans faced a crisis: their party had won, but only by ushering to a minority victory one of history’s most extravagantly dishonest men. They had to stand with him or against him, and most chose to stand with him. Others chose to fade away by resigning or going home when their terms were up. Almost none of them stood up against him. The famously vindictive Trump punished any signs of disloyalty, so they were loyal. And to be loyal meant joining him in corruption and lies. “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it,” Lindsey Graham tweeted in the spring of 2016, before becoming one of Trump’s most grovelling sycophants. In a way, the sycophants got stronger: if truth restrains us and links us together, they unchained themselves. We make contracts with each other with words; we share information, make agreements and commitments, hold each other accountable and show who we are. Lies are broken contracts, in which words misrepresent what the speaker knows; they aim to delude, exploit and divide. The liar may get stronger, but the social fabric gets weaker. That strength is precarious, so lies have be piled atop lies to keep accountability at a distance. Of course, politicians of all stripes are notoriously shifty, and the Republican party had no great reputation for honesty previously. Many of their campaigns long before Trump could politely be called misleading. But after 2016, they clustered around the gaslighter-in-chief like bugs around a streetlight. I often think of what Trump did as disinhibition: the pallid, bashful untruths of yore were replaced by baldfaced outrages. They lost any compunction about openly contradicting themselves, and did so often, never more than with the insurrection of 6 January. As the mob was smashing its way into the building, congressman Jim Jordan had been on the house floor accusing election officials in six states of corruption. A week later he declared: “I’ve never said that this election was stolen.” But, as CNN noted: “Jordan claimed in October that Democrats were working to steal the election and spoke at a Stop the Steal rally in Pennsylvania two days after the election. In December, he said he didn’t know how he could be convinced that ‘Trump didn’t actually win’ the election.” During the hours when the mob rampaged through the US Capitol building, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called up Trump, reportedly furious. “The president bears responsibility for the attack,” he said shortly thereafter. Then he devoted himself to winning back Trump’s favour and playing down what had happened. “Pressed on whether he regretted working to overturn President Biden’s 2020 victory, Mr McCarthy took the position that he did no such thing,” the New York Times reported in April. Then he worked hard to sabotage the investigation into what had happened, by trying to put two congressmen most loyal to the big lie, Jim Banks and the ever-disruptive champion shouter Jim Jordan, on the committee. The house majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, blocked their appointment. Banks was later caught sending out letters, seeking information from government agencies, claiming he was the ranking Republican on the 6 January committee, of which he was never in fact a member. By September, McCarthy was full team cover-up: the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell noted that McCarthy “threatened to retaliate against any telecommunications company that complied with the records requests” of the congressional committee investigating the 6 January insurrection. That’s not technically lying, but it’s certainly an attempt to prevent the truth from being known. There’s a lot to cover up, especially if you don’t want the committee to find out the extent to which Congress itself was involved in the attack on Congress. The politicians who fled in fear thereafter threw themselves into denying the threat and protecting its chief instigator. No one did so more slavishly than the then vice-president, Mike Pence, who was pressured before and during 6 January to violate the law and exercise a power he did not possess to change the election outcome. “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump had tweeted early that day; and then, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution”. At Trump’s instigation, the mob was chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!” Pence trivialised the event when he told the Christian Broadcasting Network: “I’m not going to allow the Democrats to use one tragic day in January to distract attention from their failed agenda and the failed policies of the Biden administration.” Capitol police officer Aquilino Gonnell, who was seriously injured defending the politicians, told NPR: “That one day in January almost cost my life. And we did everything possible to prevent him [Pence] from being hanged and killed in front of his daughter and his wife. And now he’s telling us that that one day in January doesn’t mean anything. It’s pathetic. It’s a disgrace.” One of the first lies to explode out of the insurrection was that somehow the attack on the Capitol was the work of Antifa. The very idea of Antifa, as they used it, was an older lie, a transformation of scattered individuals and impromptu groups of antifascists into a cohesive sinister gang that could be blamed for pretty much anything, anywhere. The New York Times described how on 6 January the right was claiming that the insurrection had been led by Antifa, not Trump supporters. By the end of the day, Fox was promoting it, the claim was all over Twitter, and: “Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida had stood on the ransacked House floor and claimed that many rioters ‘were members of the violent terrorist group antifa’.” The claim, the Times added, “has hardened into gospel among hard-line Trump supporters, by voters and sanctified by elected officials in the party” That is, they took the position that the riot, which at the time Republican legislators begged the president to stop, was instead a riot by an essentially imaginary leftwing organisation with no conceivable motive to prevent the confirmation of Biden’s victory. Now the investigation is closing in on the role that many in Congress played in the attack on Congress. Having fled their own mobs, they are now trying to flee the truth, and relying on the fact that a significant portion of the country prefers the lies. The Republicans who helped the failed coup along and then dismissed its import are preparing to do it better next time. The Democratic senator Brian Schatz tweeted on Tuesday: “They are organizing the next one, not as a secret conspiracy, but as a central organizing principle for the next election.” The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “Donald Trump has infected, and that’s the appropriate word, the Republican party with his big lie and with his desire to stop democracy. We have no choice but to move forward,” by which he meant overturn the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. 6 January was one confrontation; there’s another one coming. The lies may implode at some point, but the liars have to be defeated. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

5275;5275;5275;994;5336;5336;Capitol attack: Biden to stress Trump’s ‘singular responsibility’ on anniversary;2022-01-06;['David Smith'];['US Capitol attack', 'US politics', 'US news', 'Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'Washington DC'];"It was a day that shook America. Joe Biden will lead sombre commemorations on Thursday to mark one year since the US Capitol insurrection that left five people dead and the nation’s democracy wounded, and is expected to lay out the “singular responsibility” that Donald Trump has for the “chaos and carnage” of that day. In a speech, Biden will directly address the former president’s role in the attack and his attempts since to distract from or downplay events, the White House said. “At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be,” the president will say, according to an excerpt released by the White House. “Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? “Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies? We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognise the truth and to live by it.” Biden has been “clear-eyed” about the “threat the former president represents to our democracy”, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a briefing on Wednesday. Biden has repeatedly stated that Trump “abused his office, undermined the constitution and ignored his oath to the American people in an effort to amass more power for himself and his allies”, Psaki said. “President Biden will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and the carnage that we saw,” she added. “He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened.” The president is also set to praise the bravery of outnumbered police officers on the scene and outline the unfinished work that America needs to do to heal, the White House said.
Defeated in the 2020 presidential election, Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol and interrupt certification of Biden’s victory. Scores of police were beaten and bloodied and congressional offices were ransacked in the worst ever domestic attack on the seat of US government. Trump this week cancelled his own anniversary event – a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for the evening of 6 January – reportedly at the urging of advisers. A year on from the attack, polls show Americans are still divided in their perceptions of what unfolded and why. The anniversary offers Biden, who promised to bring the nation together, an opportunity to reassert a fact-based account. He and and Vice-President Kamala Harris will speak on Thursday morning at the US Capitol. “The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Biden will put an extra spotlight on the role of Capitol police and others on the scene, Psaki said. “Because of their efforts, our democracy withstood an attack from a mob, and the will of more than 150 million people who voted in the presidential election was ultimately registered by Congress.” Psaki was asked at the press briefing what the president’s message will be to the many Republicans who believe Biden stole the election from Trump, despite overwhelming contrary evidence. “What he’s going to continue to do is speak to everyone in the country. Those who didn’t vote for him, those who may not believe he is the legitimate president, about what he wants to do to make their lives better,” the spokesperson replied. Other events at the Capitol on Thursday will include a moment of reflection with staff on the House of Representatives floor, a moment of silence on the House floor, a conversation with the presidential historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham, testimonials from members of Congress and a prayer vigil. Four people died on the day of the riot and one Capitol police officer died the day after. Four officers have since taken their own lives. The crowd called for the then vice-president, Mike Pence, presiding over the electoral college vote count, to be hanged.
But Trump, fellow Republicans and rightwing media personalities have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the attack, calling it a non-violent protest or blaming leftwing activists. Even Pence has dismissed it as “just one day in January”. Congressional Republicans are expected to keep a low profile or stay away from Thursday’s events. Trump had been expected to create a split-screen moment by pushing his counter-narrative at a televised press conference, but he abruptly scrapped the plan on Tuesday. In a statement, the former president criticised a House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection, which continues its work and on Tuesday issued a letter seeking the cooperation of the Fox New host Sean Hannity, who exchanged messages with Trump and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the days leading up to the attack. Trump said that he was cancelling his conference “in light of the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media”, and would address the issue instead at a rally in Arizona on 15 January. The ex-president was reportedly talked out of holding a press conference by allies. Senator Lindsey Graham told the Axios website that he discussed the subject with Trump over a weekend golf match in West Palm Beach, Florida, arguing that “there could be peril in doing a news conference … Best to focus on election reform instead.” Separate from the House investigation, the justice department is leading the prosecution of rioters who invaded the Capitol. More than 700 people have been charged so far in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history. More than 30 have received jail sentences. Trump was kicked off Twitter after the Capitol attack for statements encouraging violence. He was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, leaving the way open for him to seek the White House again in 2024. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 72% of Republicans say Trump does not really bear responsibility for what happened, 58% of Republicans believe Biden’s election was not legitimate and 40% of Republicans and independents say violence against the government is sometimes justified.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/us-capitol-attack-anniversary-joe-biden-police;politics

The development is highly unusual in the 16-year program at the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s (AWC) Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary, which closely monitors the birds and was identified in a three-week survey carried out during the dry season in October and November. Ordinarily breeding takes place during the wet season between December to April when insects are plentiful. It is indicated by “brood patches” – bare patches on the belly – of female birds and bent tail feathers caused when they nest their eggs in cramped nests.
But Dr Niki Teunissen, a postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University who conducted the recent dry-season survey, said that when she caught female birds they showed all the telltale signs of a “busy season”. “Some of those females already had fledglings, so they’d already successfully bred,” Teunissen said. “Then I caught them and found that they had brood patches, which means they already had a nest again. So it’s a busy season. “We don’t really understand why it’s happening but we would love to find out.” As it is had occurred for the second year running the discovery upended much of what researchers thought they knew about the bird’s lifecycle. Teunissen said there may be several contributing factors for the birds changing up their schedule, though so far any theories were “speculative” without further research. She said the region had experienced good rainfall after a period of drought which may make it more attractive for the birds, especially as life can be difficult during the wet season.
Not only is their habitat – wetlands along rivers – under threat from fire and cattle grazing, but it is also prone to flash flooding during the wet season that can see local waterways rise metres in a matter of minutes. Last wet season 40% – two in every five nests – were washed away. Another contributing factor may be pressure from cuckoos that lay their eggs in the wrens’ nests for the wrens to raise. As the cuckoos are not around in the dry season it is possible the wrens have adapted. “What I take away from it is that if anything these birds are clearly more flexible in terms of the time of breeding than we thought,” Teunissen said.

The purple-crowned fairy wren has two sub-species – the eastern sub-species and the western sub-species. The population being studied by the AWC belongs to the western sub-species. The birds get their name for the purple crown the males wear during the breeding season. This colouring fades when not in season, but last season they were purple all year round. With only an estimated 7,000 birds in the wild they are considered an endangered population that is in decline. The birds only live for four years on average, however the oldest bird tracked by the program has lived to 15 years.
Unlike the superb fairy wren, which has a reputation for promiscuity with the female birds regularly cheating on their partners, Teunissen says purple-crowned fairy wren’s are “quite faithful”. The birds do not always mate for life but they can form stable relationships with couples raising their young together and defending their territory together outside breeding season.
While the longest breeding pairs last eight years, Teunissen says divorce is not unheard of. “And what we find is that usually when divorce happens the female leaves to join a male elsewhere who’s got better habitat, so it’s all about real estate really,” she said. “It really is a soap opera and we follow them in so much detail that we know exactly what each individual bird is up to sometimes.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/australian-researchers-baffled-as-endangered-purple-crowned-fairy-wrens-breed-outside-season-again;environment
5311;5311;5311;1030;5373;5373;The Guardian view on Trump’s mob, a year on: threats to democracy grow;2022-01-05;['Editorial'];['US politics', 'Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats'];The threat to American democracy may be greater today than when the insurrectionist mob swept into the US Capitol one year ago, attempting to prevent the peaceful transfer of power following a free and fair election. Joe Biden is ensconced in the White House and with the passage of time, the shock of their lethal assault has faded. But if the danger appears less immediate, addressing it is no less urgent. We know more than we did a year ago about the full violence and menace of the riot, and about what preceded it – including the PowerPoint presentation turned over by Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, detailing ways to stage a coup. Rioters have been jailed, but so far no case has been brought against those who encouraged and incited them. Mr Trump himself has resurged, with a cult-like grip upon his party. He and his allies have longer to plan for this year’s midterms and 2024. State legislatures are constructing an election-stealing machine. In short: 6 January was not an end, but a beginning. Listen to the warnings from America’s political scientists. One says that the US is “closer to civil war than any of us would like to believe”. Another warns that the insurrectionists of 6 January are not part of a fringe: he sees a new mass political movement with violence at its core. Others foresee a slide to Hungarian-style competitive authoritarianism in which the trappings of elections remain, but so rigged that Democrats cannot win. Faced with an electorate that has rejected them, the Republicans have already entrenched their advantage in the electoral college, Senate and supreme court. Yet it is Republicans who claim that the system is cheating them. A vast swathe of the population is now detached from both political reality and political ideals – believing the 2020 election stolen, and believing that force is an acceptable response. “Alternative facts” have become mainstream belief: according to a recent poll, 68% of Americans think there is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in 2020 – but 62% of Republicans disagree. While 60% of Americans think Mr Trump bears either a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the storming of the Capitol, 72% of Republicans say he bears “just some” or “none at all”. Another survey found that 9% of Americans believed that “use of force is justified to restore Donald J Trump to the presidency”. It is hard to know where one might begin to tackle the sprawling rightwing disinformation ecosystem. The aspiration to a policy response to the political chasm – the Build Back Better Act – has been killed by Republican opposition, with the aid of conservative Democrat Joe Manchin. He and fellow Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema will also tank the fresh push on voting rights if they remain opposed to amending the filibuster. Meanwhile, Republicans who attempted to rein Mr Trump in on 6 January, or publicly criticised him afterwards, have long since fallen back into line. In 12 short months they have rewritten history. Their hostility to the select committee investigation, rushing to report before November’s midterms lest it be closed down afterwards, is another attempt to silence the truth. Last year’s tidal wave of voting restrictions at state level continues, and election sabotage is gaining ground, with Republicans giving legislatures control over vote counts and replacing nonpartisan officials with Trumpists. Against these are ranged the steady, committed efforts of activists, politicians and ordinary voters to defend their rights and protect their democratic institutions. More political violence is likely in future, not least because the GOP elite have helped to legitimise it. Senior Republicans have not merely made their peace with Mr Trump and his tactics, but embraced them. Next time, such efforts might gain support from within the services. Yet the deeper threat may be that force will not be required. The dismantling of American democracy could be bloodless: quieter, more sophisticated, more cynical – and nonetheless devastating for it.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-mob-a-year-on-threats-to-democracy-grow;politics
5315;5315;5315;1034;5377;5377;BMW unveils car that changes colour at touch of a button;2022-01-05;['Dan Milmo'];['BMW', 'Technology', 'Automotive industry', 'Business'];BMW has unveiled a chameleon car that changes colour, in the latest attempt by automotive firms to combine their vehicles with cutting-edge technology. The German car firm said it was “bringing the car body to life” with the specially developed body wrap for its all-electric iX SUV model, which uses the same technology as Amazon’s Kindle e-reader. At the touch of a button, a driver can change the shade of the car’s exterior, allowing the colour to shift between black and white or even light and dark stripes by activating electronic ink in the wraparound shell. “You decide what you want to wear, what your social media status is – and you can decide what your car looks like,” said Stella Clarke, BMW’s project lead on the vehicle. Clarke added that the technology could be used to locate the car by making it flash when the driver is looking for it, or to display the vehicle’s battery capacity externally. According to BMW, the effect is created by applying an electrical charge to microcapsules – which contain particles of white and black pigments – suspended within a liquid encased in the wrap. The colour alternates depending on whether a negative or positive charge is applied, causing either the white or the black pigments to collect at the surface of the microcapsule. The concept car, which is not available for public sale, was unveiled at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where automotive firms increasingly advertise their products alongside mobile phone, gadget and TV screen makers. The agricultural machinery firm John Deere has unveiled a smartphone-controlled autonomous tractor at CES this week, while Sony revealed plans to start an electric car company, General Motors announced an electric version of its Chevy Silverado pick-up truck and Mercedes-Benz revealed a concept electric car with a range of 1,000km – almost double the distance of a Tesla Model S. Apple, which does not exhibit at CES, has been working on a self-driving electric car that, according to a recent report, could be launched in 2025. New products shown by consumer electronics firms at CES this week include a portable Smart TV projector by Samsung, an autonomous home on wheels from LG and the official name for Sony’s new virtual reality headset, which will be called PlayStationVR2. Many of the product announcements have been made virtually after regular attenders such as Google, Microsoft, Intel and the Facebook owner Meta pulled out of physical appearances due to Covid-19 fears.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/bmw-unveils-car-that-changes-colour-at-the-touch-of-a-button;science and technology
5325;5325;5325;1044;5387;5387;US sanctions Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik for ‘destabilizing activities’;2022-01-05;['Julian Borger'];['Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'US foreign policy', 'Europe', 'World news', 'US news'];"The US has imposed new sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, a television station under his control and two other officials for “significant corruption and destabilizing activities”. The sanctions, involving asset freezes and visa bans, follow Dodik’s threat to withdraw Serbs from the Bosnian national army and other state-level institutions, potentially destroying the 1995 Dayton peace treaty and opening the way for a return to conflict.
Official statements accompanying the sanctions focus on the corruption which US officials say underpin Dodik’s political posturing. “His divisive ethno-nationalistic rhetoric reflects his efforts to advance these political goals and distract attention from his corrupt activities,” a Treasury statement said. “Cumulatively, these actions threaten the stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of BiH and undermine the Dayton Peace Accords, thereby risking wider regional instability.” It said Dodik had handed government contracts and monopolies in the Serb-run half of Bosnia, Republika Srpska (RS) to close business associates. “With his corrupt proceeds, Dodik has engaged in bribery and additional corrupt activities to further his personal interests at the expense of citizens in the RS,” the Treasury said. Dodik has already been sanctioned in 2017, for obstruction of the Dayton accord. The new measures are wider, criminalizing financial donations to him, and targeting Alternativna Televizija, a television station based in Banja Luka, the biggest town in the RS. The channel is privately owned by a company closely linked to Dodik’s family, the Treasury said, and operates as Dodik’s personal propaganda outlet. “Dodik has awarded ATV-related contracts directly to members of his family, which he has used as yet another avenue for corruption,” the Treasury said. “He has funneled money directly from public companies to ATV for corrupt purposes.” Dodik shrugged off the sanctions telling a local media outlet: “If they think that they will discipline me like this, they are grossly mistaken.” A Dodik adviser, Milan Tegeltija, was also banned from entering the US. The US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said Tegeltija had used his former role as head of the state-level judiciary for “corrupt acts that included using his political influence and official power for his personal benefit”. A Bosnian Muslim, or Bosniak, party leader, Mirsad Kukić, was also targeted in Wednesday’s sanction. He is accused of using his role as manager of the publicly owned Banovici mine and his seat in parliament to use “political influence and official power for his personal benefit”.
Although the effect on sanctions on Dodik are reduced by his limited financial exposure in the US, Daniel Serwer, a former US special envoy to Bosnia, said they still represent a setback for Dodik. “They do have a psychological impact. The question of how strong the financial impact is,” Serwer said. “Basically this prevents designated individuals from international financial transactions, almost all of which go through the US in one fashion or another.” He added: “The sanctions, in addition to targeting Dodik and Alternativa, are a warning to other politicians and companies, who may have more to fear than Dodik.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/us-sanctions-bosnian-serb-leader-milorad-dodik;politics

5331;5331;5331;1050;5393;5393;A tough year ahead for public sector wages | Letter;2022-01-05;['N/A'];['Public sector pay', 'Pay', 'Consumer affairs', 'Office for National Statistics', 'Business', 'Money', 'UK news', 'Inflation', 'Economics', 'Family finances'];The forthcoming economic crisis analysed by the Resolution Foundation (UK households warned of ‘year of the squeeze’ as cost of living soars, 29 December) is partly based on a view that wage growth is stagnant. This is true for a wide range of employees but not necessarily for all. In fact, earnings growth in the year to October was 4.9%, matching consumer price index inflation, in part buoyed up by labour market shortages. If we follow the Office for National Statistics’ breakdown of sectors, average earnings in the private sector grew by 5.4% in the year to October, while in the public sector the growth rate was 2.7%. So 2022 is set to be yet another tough year for public sector employees. Further analysis of the different parts of the private sector shows average earnings growing by 7.7% in the finance and business services sector, contrasting with a low rate of 2.8% in manufacturing. Pay growth for some is quite strong, while for others it is very weak and certainly below the rate of inflation.

5332;5332;5332;1051;5394;5394;Covid ‘vaccination doubt line’ receiving up to 1,000 calls a day in Netherlands;2022-01-05;['Jon Henley'];['Coronavirus', 'Netherlands', 'Europe', 'Infectious diseases'];"A “vaccination doubt line” set up by doctors in the Netherlands is receiving up to 1,000 calls a day from people who are still unsure whether or not they should get jabbed against the coronavirus. The helpline, originally launched as a local service in November by Robin Peeters, an endocrinologist at the Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam, and Shakib Sana, a GP, was given a national number last month and has been inundated with inquiries. Staffed mainly by volunteer medical students from rooms made available in the university hospitals of Utrecht, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Maastricht and Rotterdam, the service has met “an extraordinary response”, Peeters said. He told the Dutch public broadcaster NOS that there appeared to be more “doubters” than anti-vaxxers among the unvaccinated population. “The more you can help people come to a decision and limit hospital admissions, the better,” he said. Peeters said callers to the line, which is open from 8.30am to 4.30pm, fell into three main categories. First, those with questions about their individual medical situation: whether the jab would make their migraines worse, or interact with their medication. There were also a large number of questions about pregnancy and fertility and Covid-19 vaccines, as well as possible side-effects. The answers to many such specific questions could not be found on government information websites, he said. “The strength of a telephone helpline is that people can call anonymously and ask independent medical professionals,” he said. “People get their information from all sorts of unreliable sources, so there’s a need for independent advice.”
Before Christmas the line received 4,400 calls over five days, Dutch media have reported. The students log every question they receive, and have access to a database containing fully referenced answers to the most common queries. Whenever they are unsure about an answer, they can contact specialists such as immunologists, gynaecologists and allergists – for more specific information. “The aim is to give every caller an appropriate and correct answer,” Peeters said. Conversations with the few committed anti-vaxxers who call are kept as short as possible, with the students trained to always ask whether the caller has a specific medical question. If not, they move on to the next caller. The objective is expressly not to pressure anyone into getting vaccinated, Peeters told the Gelderlander newspaper. “We want them to come to their own decision – we just want them to base it on correct information,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-vaccination-doubt-line-receiving-up-to-1000-calls-a-day-in-the-netherlands;health
5347;5347;5347;1066;5409;5409;The Little Dum Dum Club: the 10 funniest things we have ever seen (on the internet);2022-01-05;['N/A'];['Comedy', 'Culture', 'Podcasting', 'Internet', 'Social media'];"We’re Tommy Dassalo and Karl Chandler, and we make a living as hosts of comedy podcast The Little Dum Dum Club. The internet gave birth to us, and it can end us. Guardian Australia has certain rules about what we can submit as the “funniest things we have ever seen on the internet” and according to them, it’s not appropriate to just send in a bunch of clips of our comedian friends where we re-voice them and make them say negative stuff about vaccines. So instead, we’ve sent in a bunch of other junk. Catch you at the end for a plug. 1. Dave Chappelle on Kramer Neither of us are very big consumers of standup specials on the streaming services, but this short clip of Dave Chappelle at the Laugh Factory is a massive favourite – in which he kinda defends Michael Richards’s infamous set there. “Hang in there, Kramer!” has become an essential, multi-purpose catchphrase in most elements of our lives. But most of all, it’s just fun to imagine that we live in a world where Dave Chappelle literally thinks that Michael Richards’s name is Kramer.
2. The ‘India’ prank calls to 2SM Prank calls were trolling before we had the internet. In 2006, a bunch of people – including Sam Mac, before he was a Gold Logie-nominated weatherman – were listening to a quiz segment on Sydney radio station 2SM and heard a caller mistakenly guess “India” to a question. The caller was then berated on-air by host Graeme Gilbert for guessing such a wrong answer.
The natural next step for Sam Mac et al, of course, was to get everyone they knew to call in and guess “India” to every question that was asked – for the next million years or so. We both became obsessed with this. We discovered it just before we shared a car in a four-hour traffic jam, and the word “India” was possibly 70% of our conversation. Sam Mac should’ve won the Gold Logie for this.
3. I Think You Should Leave: Driver’s Ed sketch Tim Robinson’s I Think You Should Leave is easily the funniest sketch show of the last few years – and this sketch is a really great taster of what you can expect. To be completely honest, we’d probably both pick the courtroom sketch from season two, but we had to submit clips that are officially available online. So go watch that sketch on Netflix and then pretend that you’ve seen it embedded in this article. Tables!
4. Jackass Forever: movie trailer We get it, it’s incredibly stupid to put a movie trailer in the list of funniest things we’ve seen. But: as if this movie isn’t going to rule. Its release date getting bumped back from last October to this year is probably the worst thing to have happened to us in 2021. Although watching it in a packed theatre at the moment is probably a dumber stunt than anything they actually do in the movie.
5. Final 2 This is a longtime personal favourite of Tommy’s. An animation student put together an animation showreel of Dobby from Harry Potter – a decent way of showing off his skills – but then went the extra mile by inserting himself into the video and writing a little scene between himself and Dobby, where they seem to be in love with each other? Which, as far as I can remember, is not canon in the Harry Potter universe.
He’s also recorded Dobby’s dialogue on what seems to be the world’s cheapest microphone, and then filmed all of his parts in a public park, so you can see people walking their dogs through the background. No hate though, because the animation is great and is far better than anything I could do (after dropping out of animation school after eight months).
6. Kay’s Cooking: avocado on toast Kay is a lovely lady in the north of England who videos herself learning to cook the most basic of foods. She’s intriguing and eminently likable but boy oh boy does her food look like a sack of crap. In this particular episode, she’s trying to make avocado on toast for the first time ever. However, she’s mistakenly used an eggplant instead, and is confused when she tries to mash the rock-hard innards of this “avocado”. It sounds bad, and it looks even worse. She’s since relabelled the video as “aubergine on toast”, to save face. Kay, you can’t fool us, especially by using the fancier term “aubergine”.
7. Succession but everyone wants some of Logan’s M&Ms Another Tommy pick. It seems like everyone loves Succession at the moment, but I don’t know if very many people have seen this clip. This guy is unbelievable. Doing even one of these characters so spot-on would be impressive, let alone the whole cast.
I have a very limited range of impressions – I think the only way I’d be able to pull off a video like this is there was a prestige HBO drama where every role was played by Dave Hughes. 8. Seinfeld A few years ago, we were giddy off the back of selling out a live podcast at the Sydney Opera House and being invited to do a live podcast at the most exclusive comedy festival in the world, Just For Laughs in Montreal. We had a meeting with a major radio station in Melbourne, thinking, “Here we go. We could get a radio show here.” Instead, the executive who was going to meet with us pulled out without explanation and sent in some guy who knew nothing about us (or much else), and ended his meeting with two comedians, in the year of 2017, by asking us, “Have you ever seen Seinfeld? That guy is funny.” So, we’d like to pass that suggestion on to you guys. Have you ever seen Seinfeld? If not, here it is.
9. Norm MacDonald on Saturday Night Live Weirdly, the official Saturday Night Live YouTube account has no clips of the late, great Norm MacDonald hosting Weekend Update: one of the best and most influential bits of comedy in the last 25 years. So instead, I (Karl) am gonna supply this stupid, weird sketch that I love so much in tribute to Norm.
Most of the cast in this sketch were fired after this 1995 end-of-season episode (Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Jay Mohr), and others were demoted (Norm and David Spade), and it’s clearly written by dead men walking. It’s SO dumb and the audience appear to HATE it. But what do people know? NOTHING. 10. The Little Dum Dum Club Seems a little silly to promote everyone else to people out there who, more than likely, don’t even know our own stuff. So, here’s our stuff. It’s the story of the time I (Karl) annoyed an open mic-er who was trying to get a gig at my weekly comedy night by relentlessly insisting he bring Dave Hughes along, despite the fact he clearly didn’t know him. And we told it on our show to Hughesy, who loved it. Stupid, pretty funny and a decent summation of the last 11 years of doing this podcast.

5365;5365;5365;1084;5428;5428;Text appeal: Ceefax recreated by 20-year-old Northern Irish man;2022-01-05;['Jim Waterson'];['BBC', 'Computing', 'Television', 'Television', 'Media', 'Technology', 'Culture'];"If you find news websites too overwhelming, too fast and too full of distractions then this might be the solution: a recreation of the BBC’s Ceefax service featuring up-to-date headlines, an accurate weather map and the latest stock market prices. Nathan Dane, 20, has spent the last six years building a simulation of the BBC’s defunct text-based information service. It takes in data from the BBC’s existing website and repurposes it in the distinctively blocky font that was ubiquitous on television sets during the 1980s and 1990s.
“It’s as close a recreation as I can make it,” said Dane from his home in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, where he has a separate screen at his desk for showing news headlines from his recreation of Ceefax. “I do find it really useful myself. If I’m sitting in work eating my lunch I can just stick that on and get up to date. You’re not flicking about between websites – you have all the information you need on a page but without all the distraction.” At its peak, tens of millions of Britons used BBC Ceefax and its commercial equivalent, Teletext, to check news headlines, find travel information or wait an infuriatingly long time for a quiz answer to be revealed. Individual stories were often split across multiple pages, meaning it could take minutes to fully comprehend an article if you were unlucky enough to load halfway through a piece. Only a few sentences of text fitted on each screen, forcing writers to develop the skills to produce concise stories. But the limitations and slowness of a system designed in 1974 may be increasingly attractive in a world of unlimited choice, while the cluttered advertising-heavy designs of many modern websites have made people nostalgic for the simplicity of Ceefax.
The BBC closed the original Ceefax service as part of the transition to digital television broadcasts, with Northern Ireland being the last region of the UK to lose access. “We had Ceefax in this part of the world until 2012, which is probably the only reason I remember it,” said Dane, who works for a digital signage company. “I have a great interest in all the old broadcast-TV type stuff. It’s really the service that I remember looking through when I was wee.” Dane’s recreation features a weather map (page 401) based on data from the Met Office that accurately recreates the current forecast on a map of the UK using the limited Ceefax colour palette. The Premier League football table (page 324) is up to date. A selection of national, foreign and local stories can be accessed through the headlines section (page 101). Some fans have also set up YouTube streams looping through Ceefax pages with muzak in the background, recreating the way the BBC used to fill overnight schedules on its channels.
The small but thriving online Teletext community, which is centred on a group on the chat service Discord, already helps run a separate long-running service called Teefax – although it does not use the same BBC styling. There are also dozens of teletext artists who challenge themselves to use the limited colour palette. One of them, Dan Farriond, said: “It’s a great gateway because it’s very simple, it’s built on 1970s technology, it’s simple to get your head around technology-wise. It’s the pure aesthetic of it and the simplicity. You only have a limited number of colours. A lot of the design decisions are made for you.” Dane, who runs his Ceefax server from his home, said his service was remarkably stable. When Facebook went offline in November he proudly tweeted a story about Mark Zuckerberg’s company with the caption: “Ceefax, however, remains unaffected.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/text-appeal-ceefax-recreated-by-20-year-old-northern-irish-man;science and technology
5372;5372;5372;1091;5435;5435;A maternal truth: some women don’t love their children as society thinks they should | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett;2022-01-05;['Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett'];['Parents and parenting', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'Elena Ferrante', 'The Lost Daughter', 'Books', 'Film', 'Children', 'Women', 'Family', 'Society'];"There’s a moment in The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel which stars Olivia Colman, where I gasped out loud and swore at the character. Colman’s Leda, a professor holidaying in Greece alone, is conversing awkwardly with a pregnant stranger. “Children are a crushing responsibility,” she says, by way of a conversational coda. The bluntness of Colman’s delivery meant that I was laughing as I gasped, but still: everyone knows it to be on some level true, but you don’t go around saying such things to pregnant women. Or at least, you shouldn’t.
The Netflix film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the 2006 novel; it holds the same capacity to shock while bringing out new feelings and elucidations. The moment in the film where one of Leda’s daughters cuts her finger and repeatedly begs her mother – a younger Leda, played by Jessie Buckley – to kiss it better, is far more emotionally affecting than when described in the slim, interior novel. “Poor creatures who came out of my belly,” Leda narrates in the book, and as a cinematic audience at times we are inclined to agree with her. Because what sort of mother abandons her children, as Leda does? Is maternal ambivalence still a taboo? Some insist that it is, though a woman failing to love her children as society deems she should is hardly a new story, either in literature or reality. Maternal cruelty is still shocking, whether it comes in the form of a performance of Medea or another heartbreaking headline case of child murder or neglect. For some, even having mixed feelings about motherhood warrants punishment. Rachel Cusk’s 2015 adaptation of Medea at the Almeida theatre featured a chorus of “conforming yummy mummies”; Cusk herself was castigated by such a chorus for A Life’s Work, her 2001 book which committed the crime of being honest about how exhausting and miserable it was to have a baby who cried unceasingly (hardly a controversial revelation, or at least not by today’s standards). “Again and again people judged the book not as readers but as mothers,” Cusk later wrote. In recent years there has been a proliferation of awareness-raising about maternal ambivalence, especially postnatal depression. Courageous women have spoken out and written about it, defying what Cusk describes as the tendency of the communal to prevail over the individual when it comes to motherhood. These women are brave because the voices that contradict a powerful cultural myth are so often castigated. Eventually these voices formed their own chorus, and the taboo itself is weakening, or at least it seems that way to me. Yet these works maintain an emotional force, perhaps because now, with our greater understanding, we know just how close so many mothers have come to being driven mad by it. Perhaps, we worry, our own mothers were. It is not a comfortable feeling, and The Lost Daughter is not a comfortable film. Leda is not held up for judgment by us, though at times the audience may of course judge her. In a recent adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love, maternal abandonment is played for laughs in the form of the character of “The Bolter”, Fanny’s mother, who flees any form of commitment. It is tonally entirely different to The Lost Daughter, but again, simple judgment is the least interesting reaction one can have. It feels less scandalous, these days, to admit that women can have other interests besides childrearing, and that finding a way to reconcile making art, in particular, with the division of domestic labour is a worthy source of creative exploration. Works such as Lara Feigel’s Free Woman, which explores Doris Lessing’s maternal ambivalence (she abandoned two of her children) as well as her own, have added to this conversation, as have novels by Sheila Heti, Jenny Offill, and Avni Doshi, among others. Yet the death of Joan Didion saw a resurgence of the Caitlin Flanagan article in which she puts Didion’s childcare arrangements under the microscope. “Where was Quintana when Didion was living at the Faculty Club, or finishing her novels at her parents’ house, or bunking down in the Haight”, Flanagan asks. “Not with her mother.” Those four words drip with judgment. “The children stared at me,” Leda narrates towards the end of the novel The Lost Daughter. “I felt their gazes longing to tame me, but more brilliant was the brightness of life outside them, new colours, new bodies, new intelligence, a language to possess finally as if it were my true language, and nothing, nothing that seemed to me reconcilable with that domestic space from which they stared at me in expectation.” Ferrante remains the empress of maternal ambivalence. It comes down to language. In The Days of Abandonment, the narrator Olga describes the experience of breastfeeding: “I was like a lump of food that my children chewed without stopping, a cud made of a living material that continually amalgamated and softened its living substance to allow two greedy bloodsuckers to nourish themselves.” To read such words still feel like a forceful, visceral refutation, a scream in the face of the prevailing narrative. Many women will no doubt read those lines and reflect, “that isn’t how it was for me.” But I hope that we are moving away from a place where one woman’s experience is taken to automatically undermine another’s. Most women will not abandon their children as Leda does, but many of us know that a more complex rendering of motherhood on screen and on the page can only be a good thing for us all. After all, it is when feelings are deemed unutterable that they become suffocating.

5399;5399;5399;1118;5462;5462;How to make tom yum – recipe | Felicity Cloake's Masterclass;2022-01-05;['Felicity Cloake'];['Food', 'Thai food and drink', 'Soup', 'Starter', 'Seafood', 'Shellfish', 'Vegetables', 'Main course', 'Fruit'];"Spicy and ear-tinglingly sour, this classic Thai soup is just what I fancy at this time of year: it’s something to cut through the pleasant, festive fug and reset the senses. Though shellfish are a common ingredient, this soup is almost endlessly adaptable, even for vegans: as long as it vibrates with flavour – aromatic lime leaves and lemongrass, warming galangal and fresh citrus – you’re on the right track. Prep 12 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 16 raw shell-on king prawns 1 dash vegetable oil 4 fresh makrut lime leaves 2 lemongrass stalks 2 thick slices galangal 2 bird’s eyes chillies 1 tbsp palm sugar, or soft brown sugar Juice of 1½ limes 2 tbsp fish sauce 1 handful coriander or Thai basil leaves, to serve 1 A note on the prawns You’ll need raw, shell-on prawns here. Frozen are fine, so long as they’re defrosted and soft enough to shell, but if your prawns are very large (or very small), adjust the quantities accordingly. If you can find only shelled prawns, use a litre of light fish or chicken stock (or even just water), and start from step 3. 2 Make a stock with the prawn shells
Shell the prawns, retaining the shells and heads, and set aside the meat for the time being. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high flame, then fry the shells and heads, stirring regularly, until they turn a vivid pink. Add a litre of water, bring up to a lively simmer, then strain into a clean pan and discard the spent shells. 3 Prepare the aromatics
Roughly tear the lime leaves (avoid using the dried kind here: frozen are fine, though, but fresh are infinitely preferable and fairly widely available). Bruise the lemongrass by pressing down on it with the flat of a large knife, then cut it into roughly 5cm lengths. Cut two thick slices of galangal – this ginger-like root is sold in specialist south-east Asian food stores and some large supermarkets, but use ginger if you can’t source any. 4 Infuse the stock
Add the lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal to the stock pan, bring it back up to a simmer, then leave to bubble gently and infuse for five minutes. Meanwhile, finely slice the chillies, leaving the pith and seeds inside (depending on your taste for spice, add more, if you like). Slide the chillies into the broth and leave the stock to blip away for a couple of minutes longer. 5 Add the prawns
Turn down the heat to the barest simmer, add the prawn meat to the broth and cook for about a minute, until just pink (be careful not to let the stock boil or to cook the prawns for too long, or they will turn rubbery).
Take off the hob, stir in the sugar, lime juice and fish sauce, then taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. 6 Serve with lots of fresh herbs Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure the prawns are evenly divided, then tear in the fresh herbs in generous quantities and serve immediately. It’s not traditional, but you can bulk out the soup by adding some cooked rice noodles if you want to make it a more substantial dish, or add other vegetables such as chopped tomatoes, mushrooms or whatever else takes your fancy.
7 Alternatives to shellfish If you’re not a shellfish fan, make this with good chicken stock, and add torn cooked chicken (or pork or turkey) at the end, just to warm it through. There’s also a more modern, richer variation of tom yum in which coconut or evaporated milk is added at the end of cooking: if that appeals, make only 750ml stock, and stir in 300ml coconut milk with the seasonings just before serving. 8 … or to veganise To make this vegan, use vegetable stock or water, and add two round shallots, peeled and cut into wedges, along with the aromatics in step 3. Add two deseeded and roughly chopped tomatoes and 200g chopped oyster, shiitake and/or chestnut mushrooms with the chillies. Vegan versions of fish sauce are available, and I’d recommend getting hold of some for this dish. 9 Other flavourings Vegan or not, you can also add some firm diced tofu instead of the prawns; I think it’s also rather nice with those fried tofu puffs sold in specialist south-east Asian food shops. Pick up a jar of nam prik pao while you’re there: this rich, sweet chilli paste, also available in vegetarian form, is a great addition to tom yum, and a great many other dishes besides.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/05/how-to-make-tom-yum-thai-soup-recipe-felicity-cloake-masterclass;entertainment and culture
5423;5423;5423;1142;5486;5486;Football transfer rumours: Arsenal make bid for Fiorentina’s Vlahovic?;2022-01-05;['Barry Glendenning'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Transfer window'];"Having secured their first signing of the January window in agreeing a £12m (and rising) fee for Atlético Madrid and England full-back Kieran Trippier, Newcastle hope to further bolster their hopes of avoiding relegation by bringing an injury-prone Welsh midfielder to Tyneside from Turin. Speculation abounds that Aaron “Rambo” Ramsey could swap the black and white stripes of Juventus for those of the slightly less decorated English club, although reports he has turned down an approach from Burnley because he wants to sit in the physio room of a more high-profile club suggest Newcastle’s owners will have to dig deep in a bid to turn his head. Ramsey has also been linked with a return to Arsenal and could share a taxi from Luton airport to their nearby St Albans training ground with his Juve teammates Dejan Kulusevski and Arthur Melo. Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Arsenal have formally bid the thick end of £45m (plus the £15m-rated Lucas Torreira) for Fiorentina’s 21-year-old Serbian striker Dusan Vlahovic, who already has 16 Serie A goals to his name this season. A player in big demand across Europe, Vlahovic seems happy enough where he is for the time being. “Only God knows what will happen in the next period,” he said recently. “My desire is to take Fiorentina to Europe, because we haven’t been in Europe for a long time. We’ll see.”
Chelsea, West Ham and yes, you’ve guessed it, Newcastle are all interested in liberating French left-back Lucas Digne from his Everton purgatory, but will have to pay up to £30m to get their man. “The most important thing for me is having players on the pitch who want to be there,” said beleaguered Everton boss Rafa Benítez after dropping Digne and playing right-back Séamus Coleman in his position in defeat against Brighton on Sunday, in a state of affairs that suggests the player will be shown the Goodison door this month unless his manager goes first. Manchester United central defender Axel Tuanzebe’s season-long loan to Aston Villa has been brought to a premature end after Villa boss Steven Gerrard refused to give the 24-year-old assurances he’d get game time in the second half of the season. He’ll be off to Napoli. Arsenal midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles is another young buck who could be Serie A-bound and may wrap up his loan to Roma on Wednesday. Having been forced to read an entire paragraph without seeing their club being linked with anybody in today’s Mill, Newcastle fans will be pleased to learn that Flamengo striker Gabriel Barbosa wouldn’t be adverse to a move to St James’ Park despite the resident club’s lowly league position, but is also wanted by goal-shy Wolverhampton Wanderers. Depending on your news outlet of choice West Ham definitely do or do not want the 25-year-old Brazilian international, but are reported to have definitely cooled their interest in Adama Traoré. Aymeric Laporte could become the latest player to tread the well worn path between Manchester City and Barcelona, with the Catalan club apparently prepared to send Frenkie de Jong the other way in a swap deal.
And finally, rumours abound that the worrying number of preening, self-regarding and under-performing divas who currently occupy the Manchester United dressing-room continue to scoff at the notion that they might be in any way responsible for their poor performances and are already plotting a mutiny against recently-appointed manager Ralf Rangnick, with whom they are reported to be underwhelmed.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-make-bid-for-fiorentina-dusan-vlahovic;sports
5424;5424;5424;1143;5487;5487;Planet Covid: Inside the 7 January Guardian Weekly;2022-01-05;['Graham Snowdon'];['Coronavirus', 'South Africa', 'Medical research', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];In welcoming you to the first Guardian Weekly magazine of 2022, I’d like to start by rewinding a couple of years. Buried in the 10 January 2020 edition was a small but significant story. “Respiratory contagion is not Sars, authorities say” was the headline on a short global report, at the foot of page 7, about a mysterious infection in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Two years on, it’s fair to say we now know a little more now than we did then about that mysterious illness. But the broader context of the pandemic can still be tricky to understand. This week, the Guardian’s data and visuals teams have collaborated to produce some beautiful graphics and analysis, revealing the pandemic’s global impact in a new light. Then, our China affairs correspondent, Vincent Ni, explores why, after two years, the search for Covid’s origins remains shrouded in politics and confusion. The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell for sex-trafficking offences concluded one of the most closely followed trials in recent times. Will this draw a line under the case – or will US prosecutors’ attention now turn to other known associates and employees of the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein? South Africa has been in the news lately, for the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant and for the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Both stories have touched on issues of governance in the “rainbow nation” (as Tutu described it after the fall of apartheid), so it is both sad and disturbing to read Jason Burke’s dispatch on how many citizens seem to be losing faith in the power of government altogether. It wouldn’t be a new year’s edition without pause to reflect on personal goals for the coming months. Johann Hari unpacks the fascinating topic of concentration, asking why so many of us have lost our ability to focus, and if it’s too late to do anything about it. Then, if your New Year resolutions are already going to pot, Rebecca Seal has some reassuring advice – just don’t worry about it.

5447;5447;5447;1166;5511;5511;How The Lost Daughter confronts one of our most enduring cultural taboos;2022-01-05;['Adrian Horton'];['The Lost Daughter', 'Film', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'Elena Ferrante', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Olivia Colman', 'Netflix', 'Dakota Johnson', 'Jessie Buckley'];"It is clear from the opening minutes of The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s melancholic, bristly directorial debut on Netflix, that a dark secret stalks the sunny Mediterranean vacation of Leda Caruso, (a luminous Olivia Colman), a 48-year-old English professor of comparative literature. Her “working holiday” at a Greek island is immediately beset by increasingly ominous intrusions: a spectral foghorn, a bowl of rotting fruit, a shrill cicada, a boisterous Italian American family from Queens who disrupt her beachside reading. Memories pull at her focus; when the young daughter of Nina (Dakota Johnson), a beautiful, languid member of the Queens bunch who immediately catches Leda’s attention, goes briefly missing, Nina’s panic elides with a flashback to twentysomething Leda’s (Jessie Buckley) frantic search for her daughter Bianca at a beach.
It’s a familiar language of buried secrets, sinister subtext and unspooling memories – the building blocks of suspense – but the landmines in The Lost Daughter aren’t the usual culprits of dark revelation: unspeakable trauma or abuse, evil spirits, suppressed desires, the ravages of capitalism or greed. Instead, the molten core of The Lost Daughter is one of our culture’s most enduring and least touchable taboos: the selfish, uncaring, “unnatural” mother – one who doesn’t shift easily to care-taking, who does not relish her role, who not only begrudges but resents her children. The Lost Daughter, adapted (and anglicized) from the short novel of the same name by Elena Ferrante, is a masterclass in imbuing ostensibly low stakes with spellbinding tension. The book is written entirely in Leda’s internal monologue, which Gyllenhaal, aided by Colman and Buckley’s fluid performances, conveys through taut dialogue and flashback sequences. The action is relatively mundane – Leda goes to the beach, eats dinner alone, and observes an exhausted Nina fielding the demands of her restless daughter Elena, who is lost for all of a few minutes. The most significant transgression is Leda’s impulsive and childish theft of Elena’s beloved doll. The film’s climactic reveal is not an act of abuse or searing trauma, as the prevalence of the trauma plot in film, TV and literature has taught us to expect, but an absence: for three years, Leda, desperate for reprieve and recognition, forfeited her role as mother, and left her daughters with her husband (Jack Farthing).
The stakes of The Lost Daughter feel so weighty, the viewing experience so unsettling and transgressive, because the myth Leda’s recollections deftly unravel – that motherhood will come to women naturally, that it will give something without taking something irreparable and valuable away – is so deeply woven into our culture as to be almost invisible. It is everywhere and nowhere, the idea of motherhood as an identity of tenderness, sacrifice, fulfillment and, above all, selflessness. It’s in commonly heard descriptions of motherhood as “my life completely changed”; “I became a different person”; “I found my purpose”; “I met myself”. (Which may be true for some people!) It shapes the image of mom-fluencers and so-called mommy blogs, informs the constant pressure for mothers to optimize every facet of their child’s life, and underpins the norms that, in the US, justify women as the de facto social safety net. The Lost Daughter, as in several of Ferrante’s other works (fans will note themes further explored in her bestselling Neapolitan novels), dares to posit that for some, motherhood might not actualize the self but plunder it, especially if, like Leda, she becomes one while still barely an adult herself (doing the math, Leda was 23 when she had her first child, 25 for her second). Leda’s ambivalence toward motherhood – magnetic, vulgar, revelatory, repulsive – is a posture still rarely explored on screen. There are anti-mothering villains in films and television (Psycho, Carrie, the horror films Hereditary and The Lodge) but few examples of women who struggle with the expectations of the role in good faith, fewer still those who reject it.
Crucially, The Lost Daughter is not a portrait of regret, for either having children or leaving them. Leda never says the word, nor does she appear to feel in isolation from other emotions such as guilt, anguish, pride, love. Gyllenhaal takes pains to portray Leda as anything but an uncaring person. She comforts Nina, meets her confessions with serrated vulnerability, offers up her apartment as a hideaway for the young mother’s nascent affair. She glows reminiscing about her 20s over dinner, comforts a frightened, lost Elena on the beach. In flashback sequences, Leda can be withholding, vindictive, unreasonable with her daughters; she is also doting, curious, radiant, expressive as she teaches her children to read, to play, or just holds them. Watching the scenes of her failures and abandonment – rebuffing her daughters, lashing out at them, leaving them – is an uncomfortable experience. Self-absorption is often indistinguishable from self-preservation, and neither are pretty. I resent Leda for ignoring her children, and I can imagine the language through which they’ll later describe their abandonment, perhaps estrangement. (For what it’s worth, I write this as a 28-year-old woman both drawn to and terrified by the prospect of having kids.) But Gyllenhaal’s unwavering focus on Leda’s battered interiority, and Colman and Buckley’s equal expressiveness, refuse to allow you to condemn her. Leda is a woman under siege – in the past, from the constant barrages of motherhood upon her body, sleep, time, academic career, her identity, sexiness, professional opportunities. She has no outlet for herself, no recourse for the pressure and little help from her clueless husband. In the present, from the memories of exhaustion, the hauntings of failure, the ghosts of condemnation. Motherhood, she delicately tells a pregnant member of the Queens family, is “a crushing responsibility”. The Lost Daughter sits with a woman who escaped its suffocation, however temporarily; the women who experience it disjointedly, and for whom there is no peace.

5453;5453;5453;1172;5517;5517;UK towns and cities hit by flash flooding 51 times since 2007;2022-01-05;['Sandra Laville'];['Flooding', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Climate crisis', 'Society'];"Flooding over the past 14 years has caused major disruption to towns and cities, schools, hospitals and care homes, a study reveals. The analysis shows towns and cities have been hit by flash flooding 51 times. Fifteen hospitals and 68 schools have also suffered from rising flood waters, which have caused major disruption to patients and to children. The analysis, carried out by the Conservative-leaning thinktank Bright Blue, says that with increased flooding due to the climate emergency, the government must do more to improve the resilience of communities, businesses, and other infrastructure. Using a form of artificial intelligence called Natural Language Processing (NLP), the data was collected by analysing archives of thousands of local, regional and national newspapers. The report comes after the devastation caused by Storm Arwen last October, when members of the public were left without power for more than a week. Storm Arwen was one of the worst in a generation. Electricity poles snapped and wires came down across large swathes of the country. The north-east of England, the Wye Valley, the Lake District, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire were among some of the worst-hit areas. The analysis shows that the impact on essential services such as power, which was dramatically highlighted by Arwen, is a threat linked to flooding for the last 14 years and will continue to be to in future as climate impacts increase extreme weather events. Since 2007, according to the analysis, there have been at least 12 instances of flooded electricity substations, in at least one case leading to power cuts that were problematic for emergency response and community resilience, and at least five instances of damage to gas pipelines due to the bridges supporting them collapsing. Working with the NGO ClimateNode, the authors produced the data in an interactive map of storm impacts. Bright Blue said the analysis revealed that the UK was not adequately prepared for the increasing risk posed by flooding as the climate changes. Particular areas of concern are: Urban drainage: heavy rainfall puts drainage and sewerage infrastructure under strain, even exceeding their limits, and contributing to flooding in some cases. Hospitals: at least 15 experienced flooding causing disruption or imminent risk of disruption to patient services or hospital support services, Schools: a least 68 schools have suffered sufficient water entering buildings to disrupt lessons, or school transport; 22 suffered at least significant damage and seven severe damage and Care homes: nine care homes and four retirement complexes have been flooded. Major disruptions to social care included carers unable to reach elderly people in rural areas; loss of power, hot water and heating in care homes. Helen Jackson, associate fellow at Bright Blue and the report’s author, said: “The disruption caused by Storm Arwen highlights the need to make our infrastructure resilient to extreme weather, and be more preventive and less reactive. “Many towns and cities in the UK are seeing repeat episodes of flash flooding affecting households, businesses, and transport systems. We need to recognise this trend and do much more to ensure our urban drainage and sewer systems can cope with heavy rainfall as the climate changes. This should include limiting the spread of impermeable surfaces in our cities and ensuring basic measures like drain cleaning are not overlooked.” The report called for the government to support and fund an ongoing programme of research to identify and monitor risks associated with extreme rainfall in urban areas. It also said government should conduct a civil resilience exercise for an extreme rainfall event in a major UK urban area, incorporating significant infrastructure failure. Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of Bright Blue, said: “Flooding is one of the most serious climate-related challenges that this country is facing and will continue to face as the climate changes further in the coming years. “The impact of flooding is already being felt deeply in communities across the UK. The UK government can and must do much more to better improve the resilience of local communities, businesses, public services, and critical infrastructure to flooding.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/uk-towns-and-cities-hit-by-flash-flooding-51-times-since-2007;environment
5460;5460;5460;1179;5524;5524;Scientists hope to unravel mystery of Sicily’s child mummies;2022-01-05;['Daniel Boffey'];['Italy', 'Archaeology', 'Europe', 'Science', 'World news'];"The 200-year-old secrets of the child mummies of the Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo in northern Sicily are to be revealed by a British-led team of scientists using X-ray technology. Dr Kirsty Squires, of Staffordshire University, will head a first attempt to tell the stories of some of the 163 children whose remains lie within the corridors and crypts of the famous underground tomb. The Catacombs contain 1,284 mummified and skeletonised bodies, the largest collection of mummies in Europe. While many of the children contained there are now skeletal, others have been described as appearing as if they are sleeping. The two-year investigation will focus on the children who died between 1787 and 1880 and, initially, on 41 bodies residing within a bespoke “child chapel”. None of the children’s identity, cause of death and medical history is known, and descriptive tags attached to them have long eroded away. It is hoped that a better picture about the children’s lives and passing will be revealed by cross-referencing the anatomical findings with archival records, including two books containing names and years of death. “We are going in January to carry out our fieldwork,” Squires said. “We will take a portable X-ray unit and take hundreds of images of the children from different angles. “We are hoping to better understand their development, health and identity, comparing the biological fundings with the more cultural kind of things: the way the individuals have been mummified and the clothes they are wearing as well.” The catacombs, once solely for the deceased friars of the Capuchin order, have become a popular, if macabre, tourist attraction, with every niche and crevice bearing bodies on open display. The preserved dead were often dressed in their finery and would be visited by their relatives.
The friars first established themselves at the church of Santa Maria della Pace in 1534. They created a mass grave for their dead which opened like a tank under an altar but, when that became full, the deceased were held in a vault, or charnel house, while a new crypt was dug. When it came to relocate the bodies from the overfull vault, 45 of the deceased friars exhumed were found to have been naturally mummified, with their faces recognisable, a development that was taken to be an act of God. Rather than bury the remains, the bodies were displayed as relics, propped in niches along the walls of the first corridor of the new cemetery. In 1787, a letter was published stating that everyone, including children, in the region had the right to be accommodated in the catacombs after death. Almost all the research until today has been on the adult mummies, excepting a headline-grabbing examination of Rosalia Lombardo, who died of pneumonia a week shy of her second birthday on 6 December 1920. Her startlingly complete preservation was investigated a decade ago by Dr Dario Piombino-Mascali, who is working with Squires on the latest project at the catacombs. He said: “Many of the mummies are a result of natural dehydration. Other mummies were chemically treated. Those chemically treated are normally better preserved. “Some of them are superbly preserved. Some really look like sleeping children. They are darkened by the time but some of them have got even fake eyes so they seem to be looking at you. They look like tiny little dolls. “Of course you want to do something to preserve them and to make sure their stories are told and give a sense that they are children. It is very upsetting when you deal with children in anthropology.” Radiographic images – 14 per mummy, from head-to-toe – will be taken and examined by Dr Robert Loynes, a retired orthopaedic surgeon who has previously investigated ancient Egyptian mummies. Piombino-Mascali said it was vital that the work on the fragile corpses was “non invasive”. Images will be drawn by an artist from Los Angeles, Eduardo Hernandez, who will produce illustrations for use in educational leaflets for handing out at the catacombs and elsewhere. The project has received over £70,000 in funding from the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. The last bodies interned in the catacombs died in the early 20th century.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/sicily-palermo-child-mummies-scientists-hope-unravel-mystery;science and technology
5468;5468;5468;1187;5532;5532;Labor calls for free rapid antigen tests before Australian national cabinet meeting;2022-01-05;['Sarah Martin'];['Health', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Scott Morrison', 'Coalition', 'Labor party', 'Tanya Plibersek', 'Annastacia Palaszczuk', 'Australian trade unions', 'Queensland', 'New South Wales', 'Dominic Perrottet'];"A Coalition plan to give the disadvantaged small cash payments to cover the cost of rapid antigen tests has been dismissed by Labor and the unions, as the government resists pressure to make the tests freely available for everyone. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the idea was “ridiculous” and finally called for the tests to be made freely available. “We have considered the options and it is clear that this is the simplest, most efficient, fairest and most responsible way to fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made of testing at this critical juncture of the pandemic,” Albanese said.
In the lead-up to Wednesday’s meeting of national cabinet, the Morrison government floated the plan in the Australian, revealing it would use the disaster payment system to give people on low incomes, welfare recipients and pensioners the funds needed to cover the cost of up to five tests. If states and territories agreed to the proposal, the funding would increase to cover the cost of 10 tests. Rapid antigen tests are understood to cost about $3 on the wholesale market but are retailing on the private market for much more due to widespread shortages. Speaking on Wednesday morning, Morrison said essential tests for those who are close contacts and symptomatic would continue to be free. “So if you’re a close contact, if you’re symptomatic, those tests are free to all Australians,” the prime minister said. “Always have been. That has never changed.” He said the government’s proposal related to “peace of mind tests” over and above essential requirements. “I’ll be putting a proposal to the premiers and chief ministers today, how we can offset the cost for those who are on commonwealth seniors health cards and pensioners, and those on healthcare cards and things of that nature to defray the costs for those that they’re seeking to get, where other Australians are buying,” Morrison said.
But the proposal has already been met with some resistance, with the Queensland premier, Annasatasia Palaszczuk, saying the new system needed to be “as easy and simple as possible”. “I haven’t seen a paper from the prime minister, I am only speaking from what I have read in the papers today, but we just need to be make it very, very simple and easy, especially to our most vulnerable people,” she said. “For our pensioners, for our health cardholders, these should be made available for free.” The cash-for-tests proposal, details of which are yet to be released, was immediately attacked as a “distraction” and an example of the prime minister again offering “too little, too late”. “Today’s attempt to distract from his ongoing failure to make rapid antigen tests free and accessible for all Australians proves that prime minister Scott Morrison still doesn’t get it,” said the Australian Council of Trade Unions acting secretary, Liam O’Brien. “Mr Morrison is planning to divide the nation by giving a small number of Australians limited access to the healthcare they need, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves. “This does nothing to help small businesses and those that work for them keep their workplaces safe and open.” The Labor deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, also criticised the plan. “Nothing says too little, too late like Scott Morrison saying he’ll give some people a subsidy to buy rapid antigen tests (at retail prices) when you can’t find one to buy,” Plibersek said on Twitter. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the state had put in place a substantial order for rapid antigen tests that would begin arriving next week, and would consider making a financial contribution towards the government’s plan.
“We want to make sure those who need access to rapid antigen testing, get access to that now,” Perrottet said. “We put whatever we need in to ensure that that support is there for people right across the state. “If there’s a financial agreement that we can reach with the commonwealth government, from my perspective and the treasurer’s perspective, there is no dollar figure that we will not put on the table to ensure as we move through this next phase, rapid antigen tests are available to anybody right across the state who needs one.” When asked about providing tests free across the board, Perrottet said that would be a matter for national cabinet to consider. “Clearly, with the significant queues that we’re seeing at PCR centres, by the provision of rapid antigen tests at those centres we will see a substantial alleviation of pressure on testing, so that is something that we’re currently focused on.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
He urged people to continue to be patient at state testing queues, and said there was a need to continue to adapt as the nature of the pandemic changed. “We’re in a pandemic,” he said. “There’ll be curveballs thrown at us over the course of this period of time, but … we’ve overcome those challenges over the past two years.” A growing number of experts have been calling for the tests to be made free, including the Doherty Institute head, Sharon Lewin, who told ABC on Tuesday they should be “widely accessible and free”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/labor-now-calls-for-free-rapid-antigen-tests-ahead-of-australian-national-cabinet-meeting;health

5478;5478;5478;1197;5543;5543;Non-urgent surgery and appointments paused across Greater Manchester;2022-01-04;"[""Euan O'Byrne Mulligan""]";['Coronavirus', 'Hospitals', 'Omicron variant', 'Greater Manchester'];"Hospitals in Greater Manchester have paused non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments due to the rising impact of Covid on patients and staff. A statement by Greater Manchester Combined Authority said the temporary measure, affecting 17 hospitals from Tuesday, will not apply to cancer and urgent care, including cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and transplantation.
About 15% of staff across the region are off sick or isolating with Covid, while in some hospitals more than one in five patients have the virus. Diagnostic services, including endoscopy, and the majority of outpatient services will continue “wherever possible”. The statement reads: “Staff have worked tirelessly to try to maintain services and deliver the highest quality of healthcare to local people. “But Covid admissions are rising sharply (from 126 on 19 December to 359 on 2 January), as are inpatient diagnoses (193 to 738 for the same period), and in some hospitals more than one in five patients have Covid (though this is not translating into critical care pressure at present). “However, the main reason is the high and rising level of staff absence, with around 15% off, either ill with Covid or isolating. “There are also outbreaks in an increasing number of care homes, which is affecting how people are discharged from hospital. “The bed modelling suggests these challenges may get worse, not better, in the next week or two.” The hospitals affected include Royal Bolton hospital, Trafford general hospital, Wythenshawe hospital and Macclesfield district general hospital. Patients who are not contacted should assume their treatment is continuing as planned, the statement added. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS foundation trust, co-chair of Greater Manchester hospital gold command and lead for elective care in the region, said: “This has been a very difficult decision and not one that we have taken lightly, but we’ve done it so we can keep people safe, can maintain the very best infection control measures, can make sure we deploy staff to where they’re needed most and can keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care, including cancer treatment.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/non-urgent-surgery-and-appointments-paused-across-greater-manchester;health
5484;5484;5484;1203;5549;5549;PEN15 review – the most captivating cringe-comedy on TV bows out on a high;2022-01-04;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy'];PEN15 (Sky Comedy) started out as a show that leaned on the grotesqueness of the teenage experience, and was constructed on the foundations of a largely visual joke – that the 13-year-old versions of the two protagonists, Maya and Anna, were played by actors in their 30s, while the other 13-year-olds around them were played by actors of that age. Yet its early fondness for a gross-out gag has evolved and it has matured into a remarkably sensitive and beautiful series about life, friendship and growing up. This run of final episodes, which conclude a second season delayed by the pandemic, mark the end of the show. It is bowing out at the peak of its powers. It returns with Bat Mitzvah, in which Becca, one of the Mean Girls-esque characters who is far more popular than Maya or Anna, has her batmitzvah, having been reminded to chase her classmates’ RSVPs during a lesson about the Holocaust. Becca’s disdain for Maya, a running theme of the series, turns a party into a finely tuned study of peer pressure and economic status, as Maya starts to realise that her family cannot buy Swarovski jewellery with the same ease as some of her classmates. When Maya hands Becca the gift she has forced her father to buy, it is a terrible, awkward snapshot of teen power dynamics and porcelain-thin self-esteem. Often awkward and usually excruciating, PEN15 conjures all the most painful parts of growing up and forces its characters to act them out, slowly, as if tiptoeing over a cliff edge. While Maya is learning about her social class, Anna is having an existential crisis, brought on by the discovery that there is evil in the world. Her parents’ divorce is exacerbating her anxiety, and the pressure of the newfound suspicion that life is pointless leads to alcohol, a kiss and a potential new boyfriend. All the great levelling drama of being a teen is here, from trying to be popular to wondering how God could allow great suffering to happen. It all exists in the same heightened emotional state. By this stage of PEN15, it is largely easy to forget that Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, who created the show as well as starring in it, are not 13, which is a credit to its keen eye for detail. It takes place in an American middle school, but you don’t need to be familiar with American schools to relate. It is set in 2000, but its retro appeal is also confined to the background now, and mostly to quick jokes about Discmans, waiting for a phone call that might never come, or endless conversations on the landline. (You know, the thing you couldn’t use when the dial-up was on.) Instead, it has blossomed into an intelligent and creative comedy. It has style and flair, tipping into the surreal when it feels appropriate, never afraid to be inventive. One episode unfolds from the perspective of Maya’s mother, Yuki (played by Erkine’s real mother). There is a scene involving amphetamines at a funeral, a clever use of glow sticks and light to convey a panic attack, and, in one especially tense moment, a use of perspective that is wordlessly devastating. If some of its early, cruder humour has been lost, that seems like a fair exchange. What remains is still funny and sometimes hilarious, though it is all tempered with fragility, and the sense that the characters are not quite grown-up enough to deal with what the world is throwing at them, until they do deal with it, usually together. This is sweet without being sickly, and that is a rare and hard-won balancing act. Its tone is perfectly judged. The show is so pitifully accurate about how cringeworthy teenage life can be that, at times, it is tough to watch. I put my hands over my eyes more frequently while viewing this than I would during a horror film. Towards its end, with the arrival of a sinister stoner named Derek, the series takes on a darker hue. Death intrudes on Anna’s life, and sex begins to nudge its way into Anna and Maya’s immediate world. I found the very last episode surprisingly upsetting, and wondered if this was really how it would end. And then it pulled out its PEN15 superpower, turned its lights up, and became something touching and brilliant again.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/pen15-review-the-most-captivating-cringe-comedy-on-tv-bows-out-on-a-high;entertainment and culture
5485;5485;5485;1204;5550;5550;‘Gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test’: TikTokers say it is cathartic to make light of Omicron;2022-01-04;['Lisa Favazzo'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'TikTok', 'Australia news'];"So many young people in Australia are testing positive to Covid that videos about their experiences are going viral on TikTok. One popular trend involves users posting videos of their positive rapid antigen test, or some other situation showing they have Covid, with the voiceover: “Yep that’s me, you’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.” That is then cut with a video of them doing legal but high-risk activities – such as dancing at a music festival – to the sound of Boney M’s Rasputin.
Other videos show users struggling to get their hand on a rapid antigen test or waiting in long queues at Covid testing centres. “Gorgeous gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test,” writes TikTok user @eilishgilligan, in a statement that attempts to capture the mood of young people living in Australia’s major cities.
According to New South Wales department of health statistics, 38,407 people between the ages of 20 and 29 tested positive for Covid-19 in the past seven days – 28% of the total cases. In Victoria, there were 18,467 active cases in the same cohort – 38% of the total. Victoria’s Covid logistics chief, Jeroen Weimar, admitted on Tuesday the state’s actual figures were likely higher but he said about 30-40% of cases being picked up were in people aged 20 to 40. As rapid antigen tests become increasingly hard to come by and PCR testing queues report hours-long waiting times, the Monash University infectious disease modeller Dr Michael Lydeamore said it was unlikely government statistics were capturing the magnitude of the outbreak. “We are just not getting an accurate picture of what’s happening,” he said.
Lydeamore said part of the problem was that there was no way to capture the results of rapid antigen tests. “In the UK, for example, there is a barcode on every test, and a QR code,” he said. “You can scan that with your phone and put in your information and record your test result and then the health agency can access that for reporting. “We don’t have that system here and so there are all these people testing positive with RATs, doing the right thing and staying home, but we have no way to know about them.” Although countless TikTok users claim they picked up the virus while celebrating New Year’s Eve, Lydeamore said several factors contributed to the high positive rates among people in their 20s. That cohort were traditionally key transmitters during outbreaks of infectious disease, he said. Not only because of their social contacts but because they also tended to work in high-risk settings such as retail, hospitality and busy offices.

Lydeamore said the timeline of the vaccine rollout also contributed to the high case numbers. “A lot of people in that age category are pretty far from their primary dose and not yet eligible for a booster. And that’s going to put them more at risk potentially of acquiring the virus.” ‘You have to laugh or you’ll cry’ Some young people on social media have said – most likely in jest – they were lucky to have tested positive before the recent outbreak so they could move on with their lives. “Smashing out c0v1d early so I can have an uninterrupted hot v@x summer,” says one user, 28-year-old Georgia Milhe (@brokebutmakeitboujee), who tested positive for Covid in November.
She said joking about the situation was a cathartic release and, despite her comment, she remained concerned she would be impacted by the current Omicron outbreak. She was doing her best to avoid exposure, reporting a similar attitude among her circle of friends. “You have to laugh or you’ll cry,” Milhe said. “I don’t think people are taking it lightly, I just think they’re trying to cope. This situation – to think that it’s going to still be going on and getting worse than it was after all the lockdowns – it’s pretty crap.” ‘You just have to try and protect yourself’ Other users have joked about trying to get the virus now so they can isolate with their housemates and partners. But Lydeamore warned against this strategy. “Even though younger people have a much lower chance of getting a severe disease, it’s certainly not zero,” he said. “There’s plenty of people under 30 in hospital and in intensive care. And every time you get Covid, that is something that could happen to you.” He also pointed to reports from South Africa of people suffering “distinct infections as little as a month apart”.
While he acknowledged the challenges of young people – especially those who live in shared housing – he said it was important everyone tried to avoid exposure. “It’s not inevitable that everyone will get Covid,” he said. “It’s inevitable that a lot of people will get Covid, but we don’t know who those people are. You just have to try and protect yourself as best as you can, the closer quarters [make it] harder, but you just have to do your best.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/gorgeous-girls-afterpay-their-rapid-antigen-test-tiktokers-say-it-is-cathartic-to-make-light-of-omicron;health
5495;5495;5495;1214;5562;5562;Caleb Azumah Nelson wins Costa first novel award for Open Water;2022-01-04;['Alison Flood'];['Costa book awards', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Awards and prizes', 'UK news'];"Caleb Azumah Nelson was working part-time in the Apple Store in London when he decided to “take a gamble” on himself and try to write his first novel. On Tuesday evening, his debut, Open Water, was named winner of the Costa first novel award, praised by judges as “deeply moving, searingly intimate and just so now”. Open Water follows the lives of two young Black British artists – he a photographer, she a dancer – as they start to fall in love after meeting in a south-east London pub. It beat titles including AK Blakemore’s The Manningtree Witches and Kate Sawyer’s The Stranding to win the £5,000 Costa prize. “We all loved this contemporary portrait of masculinity – it’s like nothing else we’ve ever read,” said judges. Nelson, a British-Ghanaian short story writer and photographer, said it was “so surreal” to be named winner of the award. “I think I am honestly still getting used to the fact that I have not only put a book out, but that it’s been really well received. All writers do this – you kind of commit these acts of bravery by putting words down on the page, and then you close your eyes when you’ve done it and hope someone might read it,” he said.
Nelson quit his job at the Apple Store to write Open Water, spending the summer of 2019 in the British Library writing all day. The manuscript sparked a nine-way bidding war before ending up with Viking, an imprint of Penguin. “The main thing I was trying to hone in on was this story of intimacy between people who might feel romantically for each other – these moments that often go unnoticed and undocumented but are really the fabric of our lives,” he said. “I think that my background as a photographer means that I’m just attracted to these really tiny moments in people’s lives that l expand outwards.” Claire Fuller won the £5,000 Costa novel award for her fourth novel, Unsettled Ground, the story of 51-year-old twins Jeanie and Julius, who live in poverty and rural isolation with their mother, Dot, until her death means they are at risk of losing everything. Already shortlisted for the Women’s prize, it is a “masterpiece of storytelling and craft”, said judges. “I’m still lost for words to have won,” said Fuller, who beat authors including Nadifa Mohamed and Elif Shafak to the prize. “It’s an amazing privilege to be recognised in this way.” The novel has its roots in Fuller’s son’s discovery of an abandoned caravan in the woods. “It was derelict and empty, and my son just knows I like weird places. So I went out to see it, and it was just really atmospheric. It made me start thinking: who would have lived here? And how would they have managed?” she said. “And then Jeanie, the main character, was just created in my head without knowing what her story would be or where she came from, or even that she had a twin brother. I had no idea till I started writing it.”
John Preston won the Costa biography award for Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell, which judges called an “epic, immersive, cinematic telling” of the life of the late media mogul and MP. The poetry prize went to former London teacher Hannah Lowe for The Kids, which draws on a decade of teaching in an inner-city London sixth form, and the children’s book category was won by Manjeet Mann for The Crossing, a verse novel inspired by the refugee crisis, about two teenagers from very different worlds. The Costas are open solely to authors resident in the UK and Ireland, and go to the “most enjoyable” books of the year. The Crossing, said judges, “will enrich all who read it”, while The Kids made judges “want to punch the air with joy”. A panel of judges chaired by the journalist and broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti will now select the Costa book of the year from the five category winners, to be announced on 1 February. Last year, Monique Roffey’s novel The Mermaid of Black Conch took the overall £30,000 prize.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/04/caleb-azumah-nelson-wins-costa-first-novel-award-for-open-water;entertainment and culture
5514;5514;5514;1233;5581;5581;‘Ruined the experience for me’: mother’s story of breastfeeding voyeurism;2022-01-04;['Rachel Hall'];['Breastfeeding', 'UK news', 'Women', 'Law', 'UK criminal justice'];When Julia Cooper had her first child, she decided to breastfeed so that she could take her out on long walks through nature, one of her favourite hobbies. But that suddenly changed when she spotted a man pointing a long lens camera towards her as she breastfed her baby daughter on a park bench in Greater Manchester. After twisting her baby out of view, feeling unnerved, and noticing he continued to stare, she approached the man to ask him whether he was taking photos of her. He replied that he had the right to do so, since they were in a public park. “I was just so shocked and turned away with my baby so he couldn’t get any more photos, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it – it was really bothering me,” Cooper said. Still rattled that evening, she called Greater Manchester police. Although sympathetic to her distress, they said there was no law against breastfeeding voyeurism, and as a result they were unable to help. But for Cooper the incident transformed her life. She no longer felt able to take her daughter out for long stretches of time, and would hide in her car whenever she needed to breastfeed her daughter. “I was left feeling so disgusted, disturbed and angry that this man had got away with taking photos of me and my daughter,” she said. “I only tried breastfeeding once in public again, and it just ruined the experience for me. I was looking at everybody around thinking: are they going to photograph me.” Distraught by the lack of action, Cooper turned to her MP, Jeff Smith, for help. Together with Stella Creasy, one of the few MPs who is a young mother and who has experienced breastfeeding voyeurism herself, he launched a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest, which has resulted in the creation of a new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which is being put before parliament on Tuesday. Cooper said the proposed new law would provide much-needed reassurance to mothers such as herself that “you can breastfeed in peace”. Creasy’s own experience of breastfeeding voyeurism took place on an overground train in London, when she noticed that a boy seated opposite her was filming her breastfeeding her baby. “You’re sat on the train and you think: what’s that person opposite doing? Then you realise with horror, you suddenly think: Oh my god, can you see anything? I just wanted to get out, I felt embarrassed, I felt humiliated and I wanted to get away,” she said. Creasy said that since the incident she had spoken to many young mothers who had shared similar experiences, and she thinks this may be connected with the UK’s comparatively low rates of breastfeeding. But she is pleased to now be able to tell them that “if you get breast pests in future they will be held to account”. “We need to make sure that mums know they can complain and that police forces should act,” she said. Women who spoke to campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed described their experiences of being stared at, filmed and photographed while breastfeeding. One recalled how a man had asked her: “Is it my turn next?” as she breastfed her three-month-old child. “I can imagine many women are anxious about breastfeeding in public and drawing attention to themselves at the best of times, but something like that could really put them off,” she said. Others described feeling unnerved by sustained eye contact for up to 10 minutes. One said the person “kept shifting to get a better look” and held her gaze when she tried to shame him into looking away, while another said she had felt so uncomfortable she had called her husband to collect her.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurism-mothers-story;health
5529;5529;5529;1248;5596;5596;Gas price hike of more than 30% stokes home bills fears for Europe;2022-01-04;['Rob Davies'];['Gas', 'Business', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Commodities', 'Utilities', 'Opec', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Energy industry', 'Household bills', 'UK news'];European gas prices have risen by more than 30% on Tuesday, adding to mounting concerns about the cost of heating a home, as supplies that usually come into Europe from Siberia continued to flow eastwards for the 15th day in a row. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied using Russia’s vast gas resources to turn the screw on Europe, after gas coming through the Yamal-Europe pipeline reversed direction three days before Christmas. Data from the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday showed that the eastwards flow of gas has increased, with volumes hitting almost 9.9m kilowatt hours an hour (kWh/h), up from 5.8m previously. Eastbound volumes via the Yamal-Europe pipeline hit almost 9.9m kWh/h at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday morning, the data showed, up from 5.8m previously. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said last month that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving price pressure, blaming German gas importers for the reversal of flows and soaring prices. The German government has declined to comment on Putin’s remarks. The benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract was up 32% at €95.20 (£79.40) a megawatt hour (MWh) by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, with the day-ahead contract up €29 at €95.50 MWh. The UK’s wholesale natural gas benchmark, the National Balancing Point, was up 38% at 236p a therm. Europe has been at the heart of an energy crisis since last year, when the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions put huge demands on depleted stocks of natural gas. Benchmark prices have more than quintupled since January 2021, squeezing consumers and companies and threatening the region’s economic recovery. In the UK, energy suppliers have warned that average gas bills could rise to more than £2,000 a year in April, when a cap on prices is revised upwards, piling pressure on the government to act to bring prices down amid a broader cost of living crisis. Expectations for colder weather in Europe were contributing to upward pressure on prices, but the low Russian gas flows were the main driver, a trader said. Separately, the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing nations resolved to press ahead with plans to increase output, signalling their optimism that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will have only a short-term impact on global growth. The 23-member alliance, led by Opec member Saudi Arabia and non-member Russia, stuck to a plan for a modest output increase of 400,000 barrels a day in February. The increase is part of a gradual unwinding of the 10m barrel-a-day production cuts made in 2020 as travel and transport slowed dramatically. Brent crude rose 50% last year as the global economy began to recover from the depths of 2020 and has rallied so far in the early days of 2022, trading 2% up above $80 (£59) on Tuesday. The US had urged Opec and its allies, led by Russia, to increase output to help keep a lid on prices in order not to dampen the nascent demand for fuel and slow that recovery. While the oil-producing nations opted for a slower increase than the US has called for, any rise in the volume of crude they pump indicates confidence that Omicron is not causing demand for fuel to plummet. In a technical report, Opec said the variant would be “mild and short-lived” and was upbeat about economic prospects. “This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies,” the joint technical committee report said.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/gas-price-hike-of-more-than-30-stokes-home-bills-fears-for-europe;business and economy
5540;5540;5540;1259;5607;5607;Almost 220,000 new Covid cases recorded in UK;2022-01-04;['Ian Sample', 'Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Hospitals', 'NHS', 'Society', 'Health'];"Confirmed daily Covid cases in the UK have hit another record high, with 218,724 reported in the past 24 hours. The latest figures – which reflect infections picked up by testing – bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,269,878, up 51% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The highly transmissible Omicron variant has fuelled a sharp rise in coronavirus cases since early December. After taking hold in London and other urban centres, it has spread rapidly around the country. The number of daily Covid cases in the UK is now triple that seen at the height of last winter’s wave driven by the Alpha variant, first spotted in Kent. The official figures continue to be affected by disruption over Christmas and the new year, with Tuesday’s data for Northern Ireland covering a four-day period, and for Wales covering a two-day period. However, the data shows that 148,725 cases were reported on Tuesday in England alone, up from 137,541 the day before but below the recent high of 162,572 reported on New Year’s Day. The figures do not include cases that are reinfections. The data released on Tuesday shows there were 15,044 Covid patients in hospital in England, up from 9,546 the week before. The number has also risen in Scotland over the same period, from 599 to 1,147. Data was not reported for Wales or Northern Ireland on Tuesday.
While hospitalisations have risen steeply with the Omicron wave, immunity conferred by vaccines and past infection, combined with the variant being intrinsically milder, has kept daily admissions and bed occupancy substantially lower than during the peak last January. In last winter’s Covid wave, before mass vaccination, daily UK admissions exceeded 4,500, while the number of people in hospital with Covid neared 40,000 at the peak. There are early signs in London that cases have plateaued and may even be falling among 18- to 59-year-olds. But cases continue to rise in people aged 60 and over. It is unclear whether hospital admissions will increase substantially as Omicron infects these older, more vulnerable people, or whether the high uptake of Covid boosters will protect them enough to keep admissions down. Further uncertainty remains over the impact of mixing over Christmas and the new year. Many infections picked up in the past two weeks will not have had time to progress to severe disease, if they are going to, and feed through to hospitalisations. The picture will become clearer in the next two weeks and public health officials are watching London hospitals, in particular, for the first sign of high hospital admissions among older people. The government said a further 48 people had died in England, Northern Ireland and Wales within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. The numbers for Covid deaths in Scotland were not updated. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/almost-220000-new-covid-cases-recorded-in-uk;health
5545;5545;5545;1264;5612;5612;‘Extreme marine heatwave’: waters off Sydney set to break January temperature records;2022-01-04;['Graham Readfearn'];['Sydney', 'New South Wales', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Marine life', 'Australia news'];"Waters off Sydney are undergoing an extreme marine heatwave with temperatures likely at their highest levels on record for January. Satellite data is showing the ocean surface off the coast of Sydney at 3C above normal, with swimmers and surfers reporting conditions that feel more like February and March than early January. Prof Moninya Roughan, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales and an expert in marine heatwaves, said the hottest water was covering an area of about 200sq km.
Roughan is waiting until new data becomes available in the coming weeks from a long-term ocean temperature monitoring station at Port Hacking, where temperatures have been observed since the 1950s. But she said: “It appears now to be reaching those record levels and will likely be the hottest January on record. It’s an extreme marine heatwave.” She said there were three factors behind the extra heat. Global heating was pushing up background temperatures in the ocean, a La Nina weather system was helping transport warmer waters south, and atmospheric conditions were also playing a role. “Marine heatwaves are having severe consequences on ecosystems and they can kill habitats,” she said.
She said the warm belt of water off Sydney was still attached to the East Australian Current – the 100km-wide belt that runs south from the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland to the area off Sydney. She expected a large eddy would break off from the tip of the current and take warmer waters south of Sydney. “I expect that water will hang around and push south over the coming months,” she said.

Prof Rob Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, regularly surfs off Sydney beaches. “It’s been over 21C in the water for over a month now. Everyone that surfs has been talking for weeks about how it’s felt more like February and March than December [when the heat started to build].” He said the warmer water was likely bringing bull and tiger sharks into the area and also farther south. Other species would also likely be arriving on the warmer waters.
Harcourt said while some species may benefit from warming oceans, the change in ocean temperatures along the eastern coast of Australia was dramatic. “A lot of animals will do poorly. A lot of animals that live in cooler waters, like seals and sharks, have a habitat that’s shrinking fast and the implications are hard to measure, but it’s likely to be dramatic.” He said in recent weeks whale sharks had been spotted north of Sydney and tiger and great white sharks had been seen feeding off a sperm whale carcass on the state’s far south coast. “Whale sharks do come down the coast but they’re rare,” he said.
He said warm water arriving on the current was nothing new, but this arrival was particularly early and was unusually warm. Research in the journal Nature has found marine heatwaves around the globe are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer. Separate research suggests the southern points of the East Australian Current are also warming faster than the area farther north.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/extreme-marine-heatwave-waters-off-sydney-set-to-break-january-temperature-records;environment
5546;5546;5546;1265;5613;5613;Still Life: 2013’s big-hearted gem is a salute to all the lonely people;2022-01-04;['Elizabeth Quinn'];['Still Life', 'Culture', 'Drama films', 'Eddie Marsan', 'Film'];"Still Life is a quiet British film with a mighty heart. Written and directed by Uberto Pasolini (best known as a producer of The Full Monty), it tackles the subject of loneliness with the lightest of touches. John May (Eddie Marsan) is a man who notices. His job at a local London council depends on it: part detective, part chief mourner, it falls on him to track down the next of kin of residents who died intestate and, invariably, alone. Over 22 years, May’s role has expanded to include organising, attending and writing the eulogies for the funerals of his “clients”. He pieces together their lives by observation – a birthday card here, a dent in a pillow there – and creates a life for them in words and music.
Marsan inhabits the role of May with very few words and even fewer gestures. His presence is a stillness in the centre of the camera lens while life in all its noisy chaos goes on around him. Background noise is turned up a notch – traffic, bird song, distant voices – as if to emphasise the quietness of his own life. Marsan himself is probably one of the best character actors you’ve never heard of. Known in the UK for his television and film appearances – including in Mike Leigh’s 2008 feature Happy-Go-Lucky, and in the US for crime drama Ray Donovan – he received the best British actor award at the 2014 Edinburgh international film festival for his portrayal of May, his first role as the romantic lead.
Romance is not a part of May’s daily life. He lives alone in a tidy council flat devoid of any personal touches. He is shocked to learn that his latest client – left for weeks before being found – lived opposite him. “A loner,” says his unsympathetic boss Mr Pratchett (The Crown’s Andrew Buchan). “You know the type.” The death of this fellow loner – William Stoke – affects May more than any of the others. When May is “let go” from his council job shortly after, he asks for more time to arrange a suitable send-off for Stoke. Pratchett grudgingly allows him a few days, unpaid, to complete this last case.
May’s dogged research leads him to an estranged daughter named Kelly (Downton Abbey’s Joanne Froggatt) living in Truro, Cornwall. She too lives alone, and the two strangers share the unspoken empathy of lonely people. They meet up again at a cafe a few days before the funeral to go over the arrangements. Kelly Stoke can hardly fail to be touched by the thoughtfulness of the man sitting across from her. As her train leaves the station, she asks John if he would meet her after the funeral for a cup of tea.
From that moment on, May’s demeanour changes. His blank expression takes on a sweetness bordering on a smile. For the first time, a gentle guitar score can be heard above the now-muted sounds of the train running on its tracks and the cries of children in the park. He is now an active participant in the world that surrounds him, not a passive onlooker. The camerawork in Still Life conveys the loneliness of the main character and that of his “charges” in this dialogue-light film. Its title is reflected in the painterly still shots and vignettes of the empty spaces they leave behind. Small gestures take on a poignancy that makes parts of it almost unbearable to watch. The final controversial scene has divided reviewers and led to accusations that it undoes all the goodwill built up to that point. The sceptical are outraged and the sentimental are moved by it: either way, it’s worth investing the 88 minutes it takes to reach the end of this moving, unpretentious gem of a film.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/still-life-2013s-big-hearted-gem-is-a-salute-to-all-the-lonely-people;entertainment and culture
5559;5559;5559;1278;5626;5626;Schools in England may suspend certain subjects to cope with Covid;2022-01-04;['Sally Weale'];['Schools', 'Primary schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Health', 'England', 'Education policy', 'Department for Education'];"Schools in England could suspend the teaching of specialist subjects such as music as part of emergency timetable changes to cope with soaring Covid-related absence rates among staff, headteachers have been advised. As the new term got under way, most primary schools managed to reopen, but some heads reported difficulties as a result of sick staff and pupils having to isolate, and warned that the situation could deteriorate fast.
In secondary schools, mass Covid testing is under way as part of a staggered return for pupils over the next few days. Parents at some schools, however, have already been advised their children will move to online lessons because of a shortage of staff due to sickness. Head teachers raised concerns about the supply of lateral flow tests after an email from the Department for Education (DfE) received on Tuesday morning said orders for additional tests should be placed by 5pm the same day in order to secure deliveries next week. If placed after 5pm, they would be not delivered until the following week, starting 17 January . Secondary schools have been asked to carry out on-site tests of pupils initially, after which pupils and staff are required to test at home twice a week to try to limit the spread of the virus in schools. “Given that some schools haven’t gone back and others have only returned today it’s very short notice,” said one head teacher. “We’re OK for tests at the moment, but this is the fastest turn around yet.” The DfE said schools were asked to place orders ahead of Christmas and 31m tests were delivered to education settings in the final weeks of last term. A further 17.6m kits will be delivered by the end of next week and schools can request emergency supplies if required. Earlier this week, the department suggested that headteachers, faced with high levels of staff absence, should combine classes and teach in larger groups in order to keep children in school. It has now emerged that heads might also consider temporarily suspending the teaching of specialist subjects including music and relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) in order to free up staff for other teaching, according to a Tes report. Ian Bauckham, who chairs the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) and is also chief executive and director of the Tenax Schools Trust, outlined the proposal as part of a “case study” on a DfE portal for headteachers, seen by Tes. While high absence levels can be managed to a certain degree, Bauckham wrote, “a point is also reached where resources can be stretched too thinly and alternatives, however undesirable, become necessary”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said any such move would depend on absence rates. “It is likely that where schools are experiencing particularly severe shortages of staff they will need to take other action such as combining classes or sending home classes or year groups to learn remotely for short periods of time.” Parklands high school in Chorley, Lancashire, is one of a number of schools to move to blended learning this week because of staff off sick. A statement from the school reported in local media said: “Unfortunately, due to an increase in staff absence due to Covid, we have had to take the difficult decision to revert to blended learning, with one year group working from home each day this week.” Bauckham and the DfE have been approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/04/schools-in-england-may-suspend-certain-subjects-to-cope-with-covid;business and economy
5576;5576;5576;1295;5643;5643;The Commando review – Mickey Rourke stars in military-grade dross;2022-01-04;['Leslie Felperin'];['Film', 'Thrillers', 'Action and adventure films', 'Mickey Rourke', 'Culture'];"This is a nasty, brutish, not-short-enough action film; basically one of those home-invasion stories in which brutal criminals terrorise a family. In this case the crims are led by newly released convict Johnny (Mickey Rourke, looking more melted than usual) and the family is a nuclear set-up led by James Baker (Michael Jai White), a DEA agent with PTSD. Johnny and co are supposedly trying is to recover money from a bank robbery, hidden years ago. But in this generally reprehensible subgenre, it doesn’t matter why the baddies break in. What matters is that it entitles at least one member of the terrorised family to fight back using their unique skills and, inevitably, armed force. Conspiracy-minded viewers might wonder if some of these films aren’t subsidised by pro-gun lobbyists as a way to drum fear into the audience and maintain support for the right to keep huge home arsenals to ward against a danger with a vanishingly small probability in the real world.
Produced, co-written and directed by Asif Akbar, The Commando contains a number of egregious implausibilities and cliches. For starters, Johnny’s henchmen are so stupid and bloodthirsty they can’t even wait for the occupants to leave the house before they invade. They just barge in while one of Baker’s daughters is having a small party. Several teens are shot, one while he’s having a wee and ends up spraying urine all over the most violent of the bad guys, Dominic (Gianni Capaldi, distantly related to Peter); this appears to be meant as a comic highlight.
Finally, Baker and his wife come home and it ends, inevitably, with a series of fisticuffs, gunfights and brawls before good supposedly triumphs over evil, although one of the kids has been raped. Perhaps we are meant to infer she deserved it for throwing a party while her folks were away; that tells you everything about the intended audience for this pernicious nonsense. • The Commando is released on 10 January on digital platforms.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/04/the-commando-review-mickey-rourke;entertainment and culture
5583;5583;5583;1302;5650;5650;Boris Johnson would not deserve an honour, says Keir Starmer;2022-01-04;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Labour', 'Keir Starmer', 'Boris Johnson', 'Tony Blair', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Boris Johnson should not be given an honour by the Queen, Keir Starmer has said, as he accused the prime minister of treating voters like fools and promised a new “contract with the British people” to uphold trust in a future Labour government. In a speech designed to kick off a new phase in Labour’s preparation for the next general election, Starmer said reports of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid rules had not just exposed problems with Johnson’s own behaviour, but “the flaws of a whole style of government”. Starmer said Labour had given ministers “the benefit of the doubt” on Covid restrictions to support the country through a national crisis but warned that the government had lost “the moral right to set those rules” because of the alleged rule-breaking. He signalled an intent to move beyond just criticising the government and to present optimistic alternative policies, vowing: “I came into politics to make things happen, not just to talk about them. I don’t think politics is a branch of the entertainment industry. I think it’s the serious business of getting things done.”
During a speech in Birmingham, the Labour leader said his new contract would give people the assurance that Labour was ready for power by focusing on security, prosperity and respect. Name-checking the three Labour leaders who have won elections – Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair – Starmer said he would lead a “patriotic” party. “It’s normally the job of the opposition to criticise and oppose, but it can make us sound pretty miserable,” he conceded. “It can sound as if we don’t realise our own historical good fortune to have been born into a peaceful, creative, liberal democracy.” Starmer said the Conservatives’ recent plummet in the polls did not automatically mean voters would switch to Labour, and promised he had a strategy to show people over the next 12 months why his party was “worthy” of their support. “Trust has to be earned,” he added. “I am confident but not complacent about the task ahead.” Starmer said the number of Covid cases, which is almost double what it was during the third lockdown last year, was “cause for concern” but was hopeful that no extra restrictions would be needed. He criticised ministers over the rollout of jabs to children over the age of 12, and said better ventilation and mass testing was needed in schools to avoid them having to close again. The possibility of a more-transmissible variant or one resistant to vaccines was a “known threat”, Starmer said, adding that he would support cutting isolation from seven to five days if the government’s scientific advisers recommended it. He also said ministers should study “all available evidence” about whether a fourth vaccine may be needed to top up protection from Covid further, after Andrew Pollard, the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said it was “not sustainable” to keep topping up people’s immunity while millions around the world were still unvaccinated. Starmer also defended the awarding of a knighthood to Blair in the new year honours list, after a petition against the move surpassed 500,000 signatures. Asked if Johnson was worthy of an honour, he told the audience in Birmingham: “No. I’m sorry, I do not think the prime minister has earned the right to have an honour. I do think Tony Blair has.” Pressed by the Guardian on what policies Labour would use to woo back voters who had deserted the party since 2010, Starmer pointed to announcements made since he became leader nearly two years ago. He said the party’s stances on housing, employment rights and tackling climate change were “very strong, very Labour” and vowed that his contract would “build on that and take those ideas to the country”. Senior Labour figures are preparing for the possibility of a general election next spring. They said Starmer had reformed the party’s internal procedures, presented a strong case against the Conservative government and would during the course of 2022 move to outlining more positive policies to put it on an election-ready footing.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/boris-johnson-would-not-deserve-an-honour-says-keir-starmer;politics
5616;5616;5616;1335;5683;5683;My new year’s resolution: to savour magic of playing as much five-a-side as possible;2022-01-04;['Elis James'];['Football', 'Sport'];"I look back at my list of failed New Year’s Eve resolutions with detached amusement. A few were vain attempts to improve myself (realistically, was I going to learn the harmonica or grow my own beetroot?), some reflected my concerns at the time (“I probably should touch it less, just in case it does drop off”) and as I aged others felt simple but somehow unachievable (eg 2018’s “have a shower before the school run”). My new year’s resolution for this year, however, will be achieved. Quite simply, it’s to play as much five-a-side as possible. Like most football fans, I’ve been playing the game for as long as I can remember. I grew up with loads of kids my own age on an estate of starter homes, which – coupled with a local primary school headteacher who thought that homework damaged children – created the perfect conditions to play football every day. I commentated on the matches we played in the park, I commentated on the kickabouts played in the hall of my friend’s house: “And the ball’s taken a wicked deflection off the Yellow Pages! LOOK AT HIS FACE, JUST LOOK AT HIS FACE!” Growing up in west Wales, where to PE teachers rugby union was king and football wasn’t played in lessons, I took part in unofficial matches between schools organised by the pupils. Football’s enforced absence during the pandemic has restored my enthusiasm to these teenage levels. In fact, to levels of eagerness not seen since Ian Rush played for Juventus.
Although I never played 11-a-side Sunday League football, I did play in a competitive five-a-side league for most of my 20s. This saw levels of hostility I hadn’t expected before signing up. A bloke squared up to me during one game and said that he’d knock me out in the car park, even though I was turning out for a regional gas pipe company and he was representing the call centre of a big insurance firm – all that pent-up aggression and we weren’t even playing in one of the big utility company derbies that are so common at Tuesday night five-a-side. “It’s EDF versus British Gas here at Cardiff Powerleague, AND IT’S LIVE.” As much as I loved playing, and my mind often returns to goals I scored in those games more than 15 years ago, that very angry bloke (who signed off with the brilliantly 1960s insult of “you longhaired freak”) is a good example of what I’m trying to avoid in the games I now play in as a man in my 40s. The right ethos is essential. I already play in one game where the attitude is perfect, but having played so little in 2020 a match a week just doesn’t feel like enough any more. If I’m asked to make up the numbers for somebody else, finding out if shinpads are usually worn is a good indicator of what the game will be like. Friends I’ve played with since primary school will confirm that I’ve never thrown myself into tackles like Bryan Robson during a World Cup group game, but at 41 I don’t want to have my tib and fib broken by some meathead from Kent who works in recruitment and no longer loves his wife. As a self-confessed luxury player (trans: genetically unable to get stuck in, a lot of what I try doesn’t come off, the talent I do have is largely unappreciated in England) I would ideally like to play with nine other people who are a laugh and slightly less good than I am, so I can score lots of goals and kid myself as I drive home that I could have played at a higher level.
This is the magic of playing football. I’ve interviewed professional footballers who haven’t kicked a ball since they retired, and yet when I kick the ball I could be 11 again. All the people I play with are the same. The only difference is that I now wear the boots my mum wouldn’t buy me in 1991 because they were too expensive, and I’ve come to accept that, age-wise, I’ve progressed from being “a senior pro” to “elder statesman of the dressing room” to “can his creaking limbs cope with one more campaign” to “club legend devastated to have contract terminated” before settling finally into the “young manager has new ideas” phase of my life. Thankfully, I’m usually playing against people closer in age to Eddie Howe than Erling Haaland. Five-a-side is the most accessible format of the world’s most popular sport, and as football is so ubiquitous, most players have a certain degree of competence. I love riding my bike, but when I’m cycling to Tesco to buy an onion and some AAA batteries I don’t kid myself that what I’m doing is the same as Geraint Thomas gritting his teeth during the Alpe d’Huez stage of the Tour de France. But even though I know it’s not true, a goal being lashed in with your weaker foot, an intelligent lay-off to a teammate, dribbling past an off-balance full-back will make me think: ‘Yes. I am Ferenc Puskas and I somehow slipped through the net.’ And then I will trip over my own feet or the ball will bounce off my shin and I will concede that actually: ‘I think the net was probably right to let me drift off into the Irish Sea.’
I have watched too many American football documentaries where the coach will tell his young players that if they fail to make the high school play-offs, this will be the final game they ever take part in. There is no real comparable NFL equivalent to five-a-side. Thankfully though, the kind of football I like can be played into old age. If you ask me, I will play. Just don’t expect me to track back.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/04/my-new-years-resolution-to-savour-magic-of-playing-as-much-five-a-side-as-possible;sports
5622;5622;5622;1341;5689;5689;Omicron infections may have plateaued in London, Neil Ferguson says;2022-01-04;['Matthew Weaver'];['Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'London', 'Infectious diseases', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health', 'Society'];"Prof Neil Ferguson, the scientist who helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Omicron infections had plateaued in London and could reduce in the next week. Ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist from Imperial College London, cautioned that record cases numbers being reported were likely to be an underestimate because test supplies have run out in some areas. But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “An epidemic reaching such high numbers can’t sustain those numbers forever. So we would expect to see case numbers start to come down in the next week, maybe already coming down in London, but in other regions a week to three weeks.” He added: “I’m cautiously optimistic that infection rates in London in that key 18 to 50 age group, which has been driving the Omicron epidemic, may possibly have plateaued. It is too early to say whether they’re going down yet.”
Ferguson also said that despite a recent doubling in Covid hospital admissions the vaccinations were proving effective at preventing severe disease. He said: “Vaccination is holding up in terms of protection against severe disease, assisted by the fact that Omicron almost certainly is substantially less severe, but it still puts pressures on the health system.” Ferguson said: “Omicron is substantially less severe. And that has helped us undoubtedly. We would be seeing much higher case numbers in hospital otherwise. And vaccines are holding up against severe disease and against severe outcomes well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be difficult few weeks for the NHS.” Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS did not want staff going back into hospitals with Covid and risk passing it on. He told Times Radio that reducing the self-isolation period to five days should be done only if the science “said it was absolutely safe”. On the general outlook, he said: “We should feel some hope and confidence about the medium term, [and] that we will gradually become more able to live with Covid as the prime minister has said, that when Omicron has gone through us that we make it to that stage and the NHS will recover.” But Taylor added: “On the other hand, we’ve got to recognise that in the next few weeks at least things are very, very difficult. One thing that people in our service find difficult is that it does seem as though there’s a kind of almost politicised attempt to suggest that things aren’t as difficult as they are, that any suggestion that we should sustain the restrictions or whether it’s personal responsibility or policy. “If you’re working in health service, you see the reality, and what you want politicians, what you want people, to be driven by is the data and what’s happening at the frontline, and let’s not be in the business of … getting away from the reality of this.”
He said the judgment on restrictions “needs to be driven by the data and what’s in the best interests of the country”, adding: “It shouldn’t be driven by a kind of political virility symbolism, where the sooner we can be free, the better it is, regardless of the effects. Let’s carry on being driven by the data.” The minister for vaccines and public health, Maggie Throup, said she was “not sure” how many Britons were currently in self-isolation. She told Sky News: “I’m not sure of that [actual] figure, but I think what’s shown over Christmas is that a lot of people have caught the disease, the Omicron variant is very transmissible, but what is good news, it doesn’t seem to be resulting in severe diseases as some of the other variants did.” She added: “Well, not everybody declares that they’re self-isolating, I think that’s one important thing, that it’s something that they do because they’ve tested positive or they’ve been in contact with somebody whose tested positive, they don’t have to report that in. “The vaccine is working and that’s the best way to stop the transmission, and to stop hospitalisations and for our life to get back to normal.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/omicron-infections-may-have-plateaued-in-london-neil-ferguson-says;health
5662;5662;5662;1381;5730;5730;Morrison government warned about lack of rapid antigen tests in September, AMA claims;2022-01-04;['Sarah Martin', 'Michael McGowan'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian politics', 'Scott Morrison', 'Australia news'];"The Australian Medical Association warned senior executives in the federal health department of the need to develop a national strategy for procuring rapid antigen tests (RATs) in September last year. But the AMA’s vice-president, Chris Moy, said that he was told in the meeting that the government did not want to intervene in the private market. “I asked the question of them because I knew what was happening in other countries, and we needed to transition, so what was the plan?” Moy told Guardian Australia. “We needed to get a lot of them [RATs], and we needed a really clear strategy to transition, it was so bloody obvious. “They have been caught short because of Omicron and the number of cases, but the bottom line is if you are going to rely on the private market in a health emergency you need to make pretty damn sure that they are ready.”
The chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, warned retailers on Tuesday the watchdog would not hesitate to “name and shame” companies engaging in “unconscionable conduct” over the pricing of the tests. “The ACCC is obviously acutely aware of the concern over the pricing of rapid antigen tests [and] we’re in the process of writing to both the suppliers and the retailers of these rapid antigen tests to find out what their stock levels are, their predictions of stock levels and most importantly what their costs are, what their pricing is and how that’s evolved over time,” he said. “I’d like to see, if any retailers are pricing as high as $45 for a test when they’re normally supposed to be a third of that, that they would immediately take notice of what we’re saying today and take those prices down.” Sims told reporters the ACCC had begun investigating reports of price gouging following a request from the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and had already seen reports of “excessive pricing” particularly on individual-sales sites such as Gumtree and Kogan. Sims said the watchdog had received more than 100 reports of potential “unconscionable” or misleading conduct over the products and he urged people to contact the ACCC if they encountered examples of the price of tests being unreasonably inflated. He said the ACCC would also be examining claims the current pricing levels of rapid antigen tests were due to challenges in obtaining supply of the tests. The government is under growing pressure to provide free rapid antigen tests across the community as case numbers in Australia reach record highs, while testing clinics remain overwhelmed. But Sims stopped short of criticising the federal government, saying that while “clearly demand is outstripping supply”, it was unclear what was causing the shortages. “The pricing of these is not something I’m going to comment on, obviously you can see both sides of that argument,” Sims said in response to questions about whether the tests should be provided free.
On Tuesday, New South Wales and Victoria registered record daily case numbers. NSW had 23,131 new cases, while Victoria recorded 14,020. Queensland registered a record 5,699 cases, while South Australia had 3,246 new cases, the ACT 926, Tasmania 702 and the Northern Territory 75. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government will not make the rapid tests free for everyone, but is in the process of finalising concessional access with state and territory leaders. National cabinet is expected to sign off on the details in a meeting on Wednesday. Regardless of the cost, supplies remain constrained in the private market across the country, with frustration growing that the tests cannot be found on chemist and supermarket shelves. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said Queensland would distribute 500,000 RATs to public testing clinics from Wednesday, but supplies remain constrained across the country. “This is happening across the country. We are as prepared as we can be, but have a look at what is happening around the world,” she said. “This is not unique to Australia. There is not one country, there is not one state who can say that we don’t have lines, that you won’t have to wait for tests now.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
She said RATs needed to be “heavily subsidised” or made free to ensure equity of access. “We do want to make sure they are affordable, we do want to make sure people have easy access to them and we don’t want to become a society where only those who can afford it get it.” She said she had also appealed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to fast-track any outstanding approvals for test kits, including those made in Australia. The Queensland chief health officer, John Gerrard, said the Omicron virus had changed the pandemic landscape, with each infected person now infecting between seven and 10 people. “The Omicron strain really has changed everything – I know it sounds like a cliche, but that has completely changed all the planning,” Gerrard said.
The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said Morrison was ultimately responsible for the lack of supply. “It’s about time the prime minister took responsibility for something himself, for doing his job. And his job is to ensure supply, just like it was his job to secure supply of the vaccine,” Albanese said. But the opposition leader fell short of saying the tests should be made free. “We think that if someone needs a rapid antigen test, and they can’t afford it, they should get one. Everyone should have access to a rapid antigen test. It shouldn’t be dependent upon your income.” However his NSW counterpart, Chris Minns, went further, saying on Tuesday that the NSW Labor party believed the state was facing an “urgent situation” and that the tests “need to be free of charge”. “This is what is happening in other jurisdictions around the world. It’s happening in the UK, it’s happening in the USA, it works,” Minns said. “The minimum the government can do for the citizens of this state, is ensure that they’re providing the services so that they can test whether they’ve got Covid or not, that’s the smallest and minimum thing the government can do on behalf of the citizens of New South Wales. “Now, at the end of the day, it’s a difficult set of circumstances and we know that we have to live with Covid. But that doesn’t mean we can live without a government.” The Nationals senator Matt Canavan said the TGA was to blame for the hold-up, and said making the tests free would exacerbate demand. “The hold-up was at the feet of the TGA,” he told Sky News on Tuesday. “We should have been better prepared for this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/morrison-government-warned-about-lack-of-rapid-antigen-tests-in-september-ama-claims;health

He did so not by outscoring Michael Smith but by outlasting him, not by blowing him off the board but simply by resisting, holding his nerve and holding his throw against one of the heaviest and most relentless treble-hitters in the sport. As an exhausted Wright celebrated a 7-5 victory, Smith stood at the back of the stage: distraught, disconsolate, destroyed. He looked up at the lights, down at his feet, off to the side. He buried his face in his shirt. He turned and stared at the blue sponsor’s backdrop. Anything to avoid glancing at the Sid Waddell Trophy that was being placed on a plinth in front of him, the trophy that has now twice eluded him at the final hurdle.
He believed it was his time. We all felt it, too. He had beaten the defending champion Gerwyn Price, the dangerous James Wade, the breakthrough star of the year in Jonny Clayton. When he is on song and in rhythm, when the 180s flow from his fingers like piano music, there is barely a player on the planet who can live with him. And perhaps, ultimately, only a player like Wright could have thwarted him. Late in the game Smith was 5-4 up with a break of throw, an advantage that felt decisive. Instead Wright endured, much as he has been enduring his whole career. Darts never came easy to him. Life never came easy to him. Even in his moment of triumph, the boos from an uncharitable Alexandra Palace crowd continued to sting his ears. But here he was, the last man standing and now legitimately one of the greats of the sport. Long before a dart had been thrown in this final, Alexandra Palace was already a heaving hive of fervour and festivity, as grown men bellowed their viral load across the Palm Court arena and the old songs were revived with relish. You were reminded again just what a befuddling challenge it must be to throw pinpoint darts in this environment, amid the pounding music and the hollering of the referee and the ambient smell of lager and takeaway. Many wither on the big stage. For those who succeed, it must be akin to performing open heart surgery on a nightclub dancefloor. But both men had been here before. Wright had broken his duck by winning the title two years earlier, and at 51 years of age was somewhere near the peak of his powers. An introvert dressed as an extrovert, Wright is a creature of paradoxes and contradictions: the showman with a chronic shyness, the court jester who throws with a sniper’s precision, the relentlessly consistent scorer who changes his darts between tournaments, between matches, sometimes even – as here – in the fifth set of a world championship final.
Three years earlier, Smith had been demolished on this stage by Michael van Gerwen, breaking a hand midway through after punching a door in frustration. And for a while it felt like the experience might be a terminal one. His scoring had always been peerless. But in times of stress the arm would tense and the doubles would drift. As if he couldn’t quite take the final step. As if he was finally being forced to contemplate what it meant to win. Such was the fate that befell him here. He has now reached seven major televised finals, and lost the lot. The action was as loose and easy as ever, but the body language looked a little strained, the gaze a little pained. The canny Wright was taking his time between visits, forcing Smith to think as much as possible. The contrast between them was stark. Smith flings his darts as if they’re laughing emojis: one, two, three, who cares? Wright, by contrast, throws them as if he’s trying to construct the three parts of a perfect sentence. The first two sets were scrappy, and Wright won them both. But as Smith settled, his sheer weight of scoring began to impose itself. He swung himself back into the match with a sumptuous 167 checkout. Two-all became 3-3 became 4-4 became 5-5. One hour became two. Even the crowd seemed to tighten a little, as if aware that the time for frivolity had passed. On the stage, both players were betraying barely a flicker of tension or nerves, even as they knew – as we all did – that they were fooling absolutely nobody.
And finally it was Smith who cracked, missing a crucial bullseye to hold throw in the 12th set. Wright checked out 81 for a 12-dart finish, and before long the last rites were being administered. Smith had recorded a higher average (99 to 98). He had hit 24 180s to Wright’s 17. But as the old truism goes, darts is not simply a game of scoring but of timing. And as Smith blinked into the Palace lights, pyrotechnics lighting his face, he could be forgiven for wondering when his time might come again.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/peter-wright-edges-out-michael-smith-to-secure-second-world-darts-title;sports
5680;5680;5680;1399;5748;5748;BlackBerry signals end of an era as it prepares to pull plug on classic phones;2022-01-03;['N/A'];['BlackBerry', 'Technology', 'Smartphones', 'US news'];"Tuesday marks the end of an era: BlackBerry will discontinue service on its classic smartphones. So for those still holding on to their QWERTY keyboards, be warned. In a 22 December statement, the company reminded users of the development, which will affect services for all of its devices not running on Android software, including the BlackBerry 10, 7.1 OS and earlier. “As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality,” the statement says. Boasting a physical keyboard and BBM instant messaging, the BlackBerry was once a powerplayer in the cell phone world. In the first decade of the 2000s, the devices were toted with pride by white-collar professionals and then-President Barack Obama alike.
At its peak in 2009 and 2010, BlackBerry owned nearly 20% of the global smartphone market – with an even higher percentage in the US – selling more than 50m smartphones a year. But with the rise of the iPhone and Android touchscreen devices, the phone eventually fell out of style. And unless it warrants a reboot like the T-Mobile Sidekick or Motorola Razr, it seems that BlackBerry’s moment in the sun has passed. When the iPhone first launched in June 2007, it didn’t immediately overtake BlackBerry’s reign. With an elite status and user-friendly reputation, businesspeople especially, stayed loyal to the product. BlackBerry’s BBM instant messaging system also remained a user favorite feature, boasting the same cachet and ease of iMessage today. Soon, though, BlackBerry’s technology fell behind and users began to make the move away from physical keyboards. BlackBerry launched a series of poorly received devices as the iPhone leveled up and Androids became viable alternatives. After the release of the iPhone 4, Apple’s phone sales passed BlackBerry’s for good. By the time BlackBerry’s technology began to catch up, it was out of fashion. Working professionals, one of BlackBerry’s core customer bases, began to make the switch to iPhones and Androids. In September 2012, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer snubbed the devices by asking that employees transition “from BlackBerries to smartphones”. By 2016, BlackBerry announced it would outsource its product and no longer manufacture its own phones. Instead, the company made a move to pivot into software, similar to Nokia, another former cellular giant. Today, BlackBerry bills itself primarily as “an enterprise software and cybersecurity company” developing software solutions for corporations. The company still employs thousands of workers and pulled in about a billion dollars in revenue in 2020, according to Statista.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/blackberry-discontinue-service-classic;science and technology
5688;5688;5688;1407;5758;5758;Moutinho’s strike earns Wolves deserved victory against insipid United;2022-01-03;['Jamie Jackson'];['Premier League', 'Manchester United', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Manchester United appear to be a work not in progress but regression. Ralf Rangnick is overseeing a team who set out with a structure against Crystal Palace, his first game in charge, but have since slid slowly backwards. João Moutinho’s sweet 82nd-minute volley handed Wolves a first league win at Old Trafford since 1980 while starting an inquest into where United are headed under an interim manager whose two main tenets seem to have gone awol. First, the “godfather of pressing” seems, oddly, to have eschewed his beloved mode of intensive shutting down. Second, the 4-2-2-2 to which he adheres has become aimless and misshapen. Before Moutinho crashed home – from a Phil Jones headed clearance – Romain Saïss hit a free-kick off the excellent David de Gea’s bar. United had existed in a quasi-survival mode for the entire game, which is hardly how to prosper. This, though, is precisely what Wolves did, moving to eighth place, one behind Rangnick’s side, courtesy of scintillating team play and the brilliance of Moutinho who, at 35 years and 117 days, is the oldest player to score a Premier League winner at United. “What I want is to help the team,” he said. “Winning here at Old Trafford is amazing for us. Phil Jones headed out the ball – I said I need to shoot: a beautiful goal.”
Jones’s first appearance since January 2020 – an FA Cup tie, 707 days ago – vied with Bruno Fernandes’s failure to be reinstated following a one-game suspension, as the headline team news. Jones, who suffered a string of injuries including a serious knee problem, was chosen because of the unavailability of Victor Lindelöf, Harry Maguire and Eric Bailly – the first two with knocks, the latter because of Covid – as the 29-year-old partnered Raphaël Varane in central defence. Fernandes’s non-selection was different: an uneven season featuring five goals, plus United’s win against Burnley here last time out, meant Rangnick felt neither Mason Greenwood nor Jadon Sancho should make way for a footballer who has, in essence, been the de facto captain. From the opening kick United were forced to ball-watch. And when they did wrest hold of it Cristiano Ronaldo, captain for the night, and Luke Shaw were both careless. But Greenwood showed the way: a Nemanja Matic chest-and-pass to the youngster was as slick as the latter’s skip infield and arrow into Sancho. This had him bursting in on goal, and though his shot disappointed – and ignored the overlapping Ronaldo – United hoped this might settle them. But no: the rest of the contest was dire from them, as De Gea again emerged as their finest performer. Jones – until the error that allowed the winner – also impressed, following one commanding header with an intercept of a Nélson Semedo crossfield ball. The former England man, though, was unable to stop Daniel Podence’s run-then-shot which forced De Gea into a sharp save. From the subsequent corner United’s goalkeeper next had to leap towards his top right-hand corner to repel Rúben Neves when he blazed from 20 yards out. Wolves were a blur of gold. Podence nipped in and Aaron Wan‑Bissaka toed the ball out for another corner. When United threatened a breakaway from this, Jones passed straight into touch. “Control” has been Rangnick’s mantra yet United enjoyed zero. After Semedo became the latest Wolves man to burn De Gea’s fingers from close range, a sequence involving Ronaldo, Scott McTominay and Wan-Bissaka ended in Sancho’s effort being blocked. Podence next slipped by Jones, swivelled, and tested De Gea’s reflexes with nothing close to the Rangnick high press in evidence. When Semedo did exactly this on Sancho suddenly Raúl Jiménez was keeping De Gea honest – once more – from distance.
Remarkable, too, was how Edinson Cavani, McTominay, Wan-Bissaka and Ronaldo could commit schoolboy howlers. The right-back did so in a phase that allowed Wolves to break before Ronaldo’s intended backpass of a header went close to setting-up Jiménez for the opener. A Cavani 30-yard attempt that sailed over José Sá’s goal summed up United before the interval: toothless. Francisco Trincão being stymied at the death by Jones at close range was Wolves in microcosm: impressive. So the visitors continued in the second half. Podence and Jiménez were thorns up-front and a Saïss 50-yard surge from centre-back posed United another problem. Only Greenwood’s rapier thrusts appeared to offer the insipid home outfit a chance of what would be a shock strike yet when Fernandes came on it was the England youngster who was hooked.
This caused boos and Rangnick’s thought-process baffled – Sancho had been far less effective. Still, Fernandes soon crashed the ball off Sá’s bar, and Ronaldo headed in – he was offside – then hit a chance wide when racing clear. These misses were costly – Fernandes had an added-time free-kick beaten away by Sá, too. By the final whistle, huge credit had to go to Bruno Lage and his team. But Rangnick now has to show what he possesses as this was the poorest outing yet under him. He may wish to point to the five unbeaten matches before this reverse, but all of these were against moderate opposition.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report;sports
5693;5693;5693;1412;5763;5763;When will Omicron peak in the UK and is the modelling wrong?;2022-01-03;['Linda Geddes'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Science', 'UK news'];"The family gatherings have disbanded, the new year’s hangovers have lifted. Despite record Covid infection figures over the holiday period, evidence that the rate of increase in cases may be slowing has prompted speculation that London, at least, may be close to reaching “peak Omicron”. Boris Johnson is said to be obsessed with this hypothetical time point, seeing it as crucial to how the Covid variant may play out nationwide. If hospitalisations follow the same trajectory and peak without the NHS being overwhelmed, the prime minister’s decision not to impose lockdown-style restrictions before the holiday period may be vindicated. Johnson is correct that peak Omicron, when it comes, will be an important moment. “The reason it matters when it peaks – and particularly when cases peak in the over-50s – is it’s likely that a week later we’ll see the peak in hospitalisations, and roughly two weeks later, we’ll see a peak in the number of deaths. It’s helpful, because it helps us to plan ahead,” said Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge’s MRC epidemiology unit.
In London, cases appear to have stabilised, or even fallen during the past two weeks. New hospitalisations also appear to have stabilised in recent days, with 319 people admitted with Covid-19 on 31 December, compared with 450 the day before, and 511 the day before that. “We would guess, based on what case numbers are doing in London, that the peak in hospital admissions should be this week, and nationally, maybe a week later,” Ali said. This is roughly in line with the scenarios outlined in modelling studies, which suggest Omicron cases will peak in early-mid January. However, the magnitude of the peak appears to be significantly lower than some of the worst case scenarios predicted. For instance, according to modelling data published by the University of Warwick on 30 December, hospital admissions should by now be approaching about 5,000 a day in England. Yet, according to the latest figures, the number of Covid-19 patients admitted on 1 January was 1,819, down from 2,370 three days earlier.
This does not necessarily mean we should disregard such models, as some hawkish MPs have suggested. Ali said: “Modelling, post-vaccination has become extremely difficult. And trying to predict people’s behaviour, well, they don’t even try to include that in the models, so, inevitably, they’re not going to be able to predict what’s going to happen. “Instead, they give a variety of scenarios, which are necessary because we have to have some idea of the range of possibilities. But when the range is so wide, it doesn’t really help policymakers, because the difference between 100 deaths a day and 6,000 deaths a day is just so huge.” Although the gloomiest predictions may have not come to pass, experts caution that we are not out of the woods yet. Some of the slowing could be a reflection of altered behaviour in the run-up to Christmas, when concern about escalating Omicron cases and a desire to spend the festive period with older relatives prompted many to scale back social activities and behave more cautiously. They may also have been less likely to get tested in the run-up to Christmas – assuming they could access a test. Now Christmas is over, some of us may have relaxed our behaviour. Whether we will see a surge in cases as a result of new year’s celebrations will not become apparent for about another week, as it takes five to six days on average after exposure to the virus for symptoms to develop, and then a further couple of days for people to seek a test and receive the results.
The return of children to schools this week – many of whom remain unvaccinated – may also lead to a surge in cases owing to increased mixing. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The Warwick model suggested that cases would peak early January. But it is still impossible to say. We will probably only really know in retrospect a couple of weeks later. “What we can say is that the rate of increase has slowed dramatically for early mid-December, otherwise we would be seeing several millions of infections a day by now and that would have been impossible.” “Taking all this together, I don’t think we have peaked yet, but I think we are not that far away – or at least I hope so,” he added. A further fly in the ointment is that younger age groups accounted for the majority of Omicron cases during early-mid December, but increased intergenerational mixing over Christmas could yet trigger a surge of infections in older adults. Also, because Omicron is better at infecting people who have been vaccinated than Delta, proportionately more vulnerable older people are likely to fall ill.
The good news is that most of these people have now received a booster dose, and their levels of immune protection should remain high for a few months yet – though we will not yet know whether they will require yet another dose. The ramped-up booster programme has been under way for several weeks, meaning many younger individuals should also soon have additional layer of immune protection, if not already. The combination of this vaccine-induced protection and so many people having been infected means we will eventually we will hit peak Omicron, after which cases should begin to fall. This will be cause for celebration, but for as long as significant numbers of people around the world remain unvaccinated, the global death toll from Covid will continue to rise, and the chances of further variants emerging will remain. So, although the battle with Omicron may be beginning to turn in the UK’s favour, the wider war against coronavirus continues.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/when-will-omicron-peak-in-uk-and-is-the-modelling-wrong;science and technology
5699;5699;5699;1418;5769;5769;Ofsted inspectors could ease the school staffing crisis | Letters;2022-01-03;['N/A'];['Teaching', 'Education', 'Ofsted', 'Schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Politics'];"In its response to the staffing crisis in schools (Combine classes in case of Covid staff shortages, DfE tells teachers in England, 2 January), there’s one resource that the government has yet to tap into – the inspectorate. If Ofsted is not going to inspect “secondary schools or colleges in the first week of term”, why not deploy the inspectors to teach in them, and why not for as long as the health crisis affects staffing levels? Instead of telling teachers that their provision is “inadequate” or “requiring improvement”, the inspectors could lead by example and show staff how “outstanding” teaching can be done. There are clearly not enough inspectors to fill all the vacancies that will be caused by the pandemic, but Ofsted has around 1,800 employees across eight regions, most of whom could be redeployed to where the need is greatest, in those schools and colleges serving the most deprived communities. This policy would cost nothing, it would be hugely beneficial to those institutions and pupils in improving the quality of their education, and it would also act as a useful means of updating inspectors about the challenges of working in them. Politicians are forever claiming that they don’t have a magic wand to solve complex problems, but this measure is the closest they are likely to get to a partial solution that could be enacted immediately. What’s not to like? Frank Coffield Emeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of Education • Nadhim Zahawi has told schools to “utilise all your available teaching and non-teaching workforce to maximise on-site education for as many pupils as possible”. It would seem that schools are being seen by the Department for Education as simply holding places to keep children off the streets and away from homes so that their parents can go to work. Few state schools have classrooms large enough to “merge classes”, but since five of the current six ministers in the DfE went to independent schools, they may not realise this. “For a classroom to qualify for a government air purifier, the DfE says it must show a ‘sustained’ CO2 reading of 1,500 particles per million or higher for a week when occupied,” your report says. So, while teaching a merged class, a non-teacher needs to count air particles. Help! Michael Bassey Emeritus professor of education, Nottingham Trent University • If Robert Halfon is really concerned about children’s “wellbeing, mental health and anxiety”, he will get behind evidenced-based measures, such as mask-wearing, to help keep them in schools. Disruption caused by illness, school closures and a succession of unfamiliar teachers is bound to be extremely damaging to young people. To date there has been no serious government effort in the UK to improve ventilation in schools. However, the evidence is incontrovertible: masks help to cut transmission. Many students will be relieved to be in classrooms where others are wearing masks, especially those in clinically vulnerable families who carry the burden of knowing they could bring home a virus that could kill. None of this is ideal; pandemics aren’t. As adults we have to stop undermining measures that will help protect students and staff and keep schools open.

Recent federal government reforms removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning some types of consultations providers will no longer be able to bulk-bill. They will have to absorb the costs or pass them on to patients. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Dr Vivienne James, a psychiatrist at Sydney’s Gordon Clinic, says she is “devastated” and her patients will be “distressed” about the changes, which came into effect on 1 January. “It is simply not financially viable for us to continue seeing these patients,” she said. “This will leave many patients distressed and, dare I say it, suicidal, as some of these people are extremely isolated and have little support. They will not be able to pay to see us and will have to be discharged back to their GPs. “Personally, I am devastated by these changes.” Grahame Gee, a credentialed mental health nurse, said it was “unethical” that he and his colleagues were “blindsided” by the changes, which were announced a couple of weeks before Christmas. His patients have complex mental health needs and many also have histories of physical and sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. “Most have limited financial means and struggle to pay gap fees,” he said. “Their recovery depends upon access to this service … I had patients in tears … Others said they would have to cancel their appointments.” On 13 December the federal health department announced $106m to make telehealth a permanent part of primary healthcare. On 16 December it announced changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme, including two new telehealth items, 17 amended items and the scrapping of 128 items, which included item 288 for video psychiatric consultations through GP referrals. Guardian Australia revealed how other changes would affect patients, particularly those with cancer.
Assoc Prof Vinay Lakra, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists president, said most of the reforms were welcome, but that fixing some gaps meant others appeared. “People living in a rural area couldn’t afford to see a psychiatrist, but [the rural loading] allowed them to see a psychiatrist without paying a gap. If you’re bulk-billing and that loading is removed, some providers will pass on the cost to the patients and patients might cancel their appointment.” The rural loading was introduced about 10 years ago to encourage the use of telehealth in country Australia, an incentive the health department says is no longer needed. Lakra said that before Covid, the psychiatric community wanted it phased out rather than removed and only phased out if there was another system in place to ensure affordability and accessibility. Covid “hasn’t gone”, he said, and the college wants the MBS item extended for another year. “Twelve months is enough time to prepare a plan … With item 288 there was not enough time,” he said. In a statement, the health department said the new arrangements consolidated telehealth into a single national program, “ensuring universal and equitable access”, and that rural patients will have access to other bulk-billing options.
The loading was to encourage the take-up of video consultations and help practitioners adopt new technologies. But according to the statement, there are about 10 times more telephone consultations than there are consultations that attract the loading and more than twice as many video consultations that do not attract the loading. “This is about improving access to video and telephone services provided by GPs, medical specialists and other health professionals that reflect clinical best practice and provides greater flexibility in the healthcare system, depending on the services required,” the statement said. “It is backed by an additional $106m over four years and part of a $308.6m investment by the government to support Australia’s primary care system.” • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/telehealth-changes-devastating-for-psychiatry-patients-in-regional-areas;health
5729;5729;5729;1448;5799;5799;Wild birds can be killed to protect game birds in England – new guidance;2022-01-03;['Helena Horton'];['Birds', 'Conservation', 'Hunting', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'England', 'UK news', 'Wildlife'];"Some wild birds can be killed in order to protect game birds bred for shooting in England, the government has ruled, in an update to guidance on general shooting licences. General licences give broad permissions to shoot certain species of wild birds to protect livestock, aid conservation, and preserve health and public safety. The new licences have been issued for two years rather than one, with government officials saying this is to provide “stability and certainty” to shooters. General licences are permissive licences, meaning users do not need to apply for them but they must comply with their terms and conditions when undertaking licensed acts. There has been debate over whether pheasants, partridges and grouse count as livestock, as they are wild birds, and so whether predators can be shot in order to protect them. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has released a new definition of “livestock” including these birds, to give explicit permission to shoot carrion crows, jackdaws, magpies and rooks. It reads: “‘Livestock’ is as defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 [Wildlife and Countryside] Act. For the purpose of this licence, this expression also includes game birds kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. This does not include supplementary feeding.” A Defra spokesperson said the change was made after gamekeepers asked for more clarity about whether game birds counted as livestock. The new language makes it clear that wild predatory birds cannot be shot under this licence in order to protect wild game birds that are not dependent on food and shelter from humans, but they can be shot under the licence if they are. The official added: “The new general licences have been updated to clarify when they apply and make clear when a game bird ceases to be livestock and becomes a wild bird. None of the changes alter the activities licence users are authorised to do. “We continue to work with stakeholders to ensure our licensing process is robust for wildlife and workable for users going forward.” Conservation groups raised concerns that the update could mean an increase in the killing of wild birds. The RSPB’s head of site conservation policy, Kate Jennings, said: “If this update to the livestock general licence goes beyond a reclassification of terminology and implies that it will lead to an increase in the killing of wild birds to protect game bird interests, then given the nature and climate emergency we find ourselves in, this would be a massive backward step for nature conservation in this country.” The general licences have been challenged by wildlife groups including the BBC presenter Chris Packham’s Wild Justice. His group has challenged the legislation and in 2019 managed to get it suspended. Wild Justice has since managed to secure changes including removing all gull species, and the places they can be used no longer include sites of special scientific interest and other nature reserves. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. The headline of an earlier version inaccurately said the law had been changed; it is the guidance on licences that has changed by introducing a new definition of “livestock”. The sub-heading and introduction was also amended to clarify this.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/03/law-change-allows-wild-birds-killed-protect-game-birds-england;environment
5734;5734;5734;1453;5804;5804;Newcastle confident of signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético for about £25m;2022-01-03;['Louise Taylor'];['Newcastle United', 'Atlético Madrid', 'Transfer window', 'Lille', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Newcastle United are increasingly confident of signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid by the end of the week and hope to open formal negotiations with the 31-year-old England right-back within the next 48 hours. Although Atlético rejected Newcastle’s initial offer for Trippier, a deal in the region of £25m is expected to be finalised after Diego Simeone appeared to abandon realistic hope of keeping him in the Spanish capital.
“Kieran Trippier is an extraordinary footballer who has given us a lot and we will try to keep him,” said Atlético’s manager. “We want him to stay, he’s an important player, but nowadays, when a player wants to leave, you can’t force them to stay. You can’t retain them.” Although Trippier started Atlético’s 2-0 home win against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, he appeared to wave farewell to the crowd at the end and was the last player to leave the pitch. With Chelsea potentially interested in Trippier, Eddie Howe is keen to seal the reunion with a player he signed for Burnley as soon as possible but Newcastle’s manager seems unlikely to have Sven Botman alongside Trippier in defence when Watford visit St James’ Park for a vital relegation “six-pointer” on Saturday week. Newcastle have had a bid rejected by Lille for Botman, a Netherlands Under-21 centre-half who has recently broken into his country’s senior squad. The French club appear determined to keep the 21-year-old, with an offer in the region of £30m currently insufficient to persuade them to part with a defender also admired by, among others, Milan. Although Lille have financial difficulties they are in the knockout stages of the Champions League, eighth in Ligue 1 and believe Botman remains vital to their European ambitions.
Howe also covets the Burnley centre-half James Tarkowski but, even though Tarkowski could leave Turf Moor for nothing in the summer, Sean Dyche appears adamant he will not countenance weakening his team’s survival chances by selling the 29-year-old to a relegation rival. With Callum Wilson’s torn calf muscle dictating that Howe is in the market for a centre-forward and a central midfield also on his shopping list, Newcastle hope to welcome a minimum of four signings.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/newcastle-confident-kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-25m;sports

In September 2021, the company completed a deal to acquire Bowie’s recordings from 2000 until his death in 2016, adding to the recordings it already owned from 1968 to 1999.
Just a small cache of recorded music made prior to Bowie’s late-60s breakthrough is now not owned by Warner Music. The company has been lavishly repackaging Bowie’s back catalogue in a series of box sets in recent years. The deal is the latest in a series of major acquisitions by various companies of the catalogues of pop artists, with Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and various members of Fleetwood Mac selling the rights for their songs for large cash sums. These deals allow the publishing companies to accrue income from royalties, as well as when music is licensed for use in films, TV and advertising. Terms of the Bowie deal have not been disclosed but the Bowie estate has historically closely controlled the use of his work. The 2020 biopic Stardust, about the birth of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona, was forbidden by the estate from using Bowie’s music. WCM co-chair Carianne Marshall said: “We were pleased that the estate felt that Warner Chappell has the knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature. All of our global leaders and departments are incredibly excited and primed to get to work with these brilliant songs across multiple avenues and platforms.” Another film that does already have the blessing of the estate is a forthcoming untitled documentary by film-maker Brett Morgen, who is using thousands of hours of rare and unseen live performance footage as its basis.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/david-bowie-publishing-rights-to-song-catalogue-sold-for-250m;business and economy
5746;5746;5746;1465;5816;5816;The UK is in danger of becoming a police state masquerading as a democracy | Owen Jones;2022-01-03;['Owen Jones'];['Protest', 'Police', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Insulate Britain', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Countries that succumb to authoritarianism rarely do so with a sudden dramatic flash, where one day freedom is there and then suddenly it isn’t. It is normally a process of attrition, of rights and liberties eroded by stealth. The political atmosphere becomes gradually more intolerant: hysteria is whipped up against dissidents, whose supposed transgressions are carefully selected to justify a new crackdown. The battle lines are defined between a law-abiding majority and an extreme fringe. This is what has happened in Hungary, governed by a party that once belonged to the Liberal International and now has set up a virtual dictatorship. It is the danger facing our own country, too. I spoke to 21-year-old student Louis McKechnie as he made a journey from the prison gates familiar to countless rebels before him. An activist involved with climate protest group Insulate Britain, he was imprisoned for six weeks after breaching an injunction against road blockades. “I got to the point where I was more terrified of the government’s inaction on the climate crisis than I was about any repercussions the courts would give me,” he said. He was “terrified” of prison, but far from deterring him, his incarceration has made him more resolute. Along with eight fellow activists, their imprisonment was a warning to anyone seeking to take up Britain’s long tradition of peaceful civil disobedience.
Insulate Britain is not popular, but then neither was Pussy Riot in Russia when they stormed a church in Moscow. Now all reasonable people would accept that Putin’s Russia is an authoritarian state – much more so than our own – and we would look to the imprisonment of those protesters as a case in point. But it is easier to recognise repression for what it is in other countries. The punitive measures deployed against Insulate Britain are an example of a country descending into an authoritarian mire. Imagine if another country introduced a law allowing the police to shut down protests for being too noisy or causing “serious annoyance”, allowing stop and search without any suspicion, banning specific individuals from joining protests and granting sweeping powers to the state to decide which protests are allowed. This is what the Conservatives’ police, crime, sentencing and courts bill in its current form allows for. Using the backlash against Insulate Britain, the government has toughened up the law. It exposes the laughable claims of some commentators that Boris Johnson’s guiding philosophy “is that he will not restrict our liberties unless there is an overwhelming reason to do so”, as one senior journalist put it. “It won’t stop people protesting,” as human rights organisation Liberty’s Emmanuelle Andrews put it, “but many more people who go out to protest will be at risk of arrest. It shrinks our ability to make our voices heard in quite an unprecedented way.” Banning orders can bar anyone convicted of more than one protest-related offence from exercising their democratic right. Protesters who attach themselves to others, the ground or an object (or who are deemed to intend to do so) face imprisonment. If a protest is thought to cause a huge public nuisance then stop and search can be used with impunity.
Note the Tory MPs who have defined temporary restrictions to prevent the spread of a deadly virus as transforming Britain into a police state. Like Marcus Fysh, who declared: “We are not a ‘papers please’ society. This is not Nazi Germany. It’s the thin end of an authoritarian wedge.” Or Tim Loughton, who said he did not want to live in “a society in which we ask for papers and deprive people of their liberty”. Yet they backed and voted for measures that strip away hard-won rights and freedoms, dramatically enlarging the ability of the state to deprive its own citizens of their liberty. The danger, as Liberty’s Andrews noted, is that it “changes the face of what democratic participation looks like: that only a protest ‘elite’ who are willing to get arrested” take to the streets. Insulate Britain’s Louis McKechnie may feel emboldened: but many more may be deterred. Indeed, it is inevitable that those most affected will be Britain’s marginalised communities. We know that Black Londoners are up to eight times more likely to be victims of stop and search; and that the Metropolitan police were twice as likely to fine Black people under Covid rules compared with white people. It’s not all over – the House of Lords will debate the legislation in January – but the course Britain is on is clear. From the policing bill to the nationality and borders bill – which further brutalises refugees and migrants and grants power to strip millions of dual nationality Britons of their citizenship – we are coming to resemble a police state cosplaying as a democracy. How gruesome to watch rights and freedoms our ancestors fought for at huge cost stripped away with barely a murmur. Whether we decide to replicate their courage to resist is up to us.

5761;5761;5761;1480;5831;5831;English cricket has much bigger problems to address than Joe Root’s captaincy | Mark Ramprakash;2022-01-03;['Mark Ramprakash'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Joe Root', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"Three matches and three heavy defeats into the series, the Ashes already lost, seven defeats and no wins in eight Tests in Australia as captain, and after a poor year for England’s red-ball team there are several obvious reasons for removing Joe Root from the England captaincy – but I would like him to stick around. In his book The Captain Class, the Wall Street Journal’s Sam Walker identifies the key characteristics of elite captains which include: extreme doggedness and focus in competition; a low-key, practical and democratic communication style; motivating others with passionate non-verbal displays; strong convictions and the courage to stand apart; and ironclad emotional control. England’s failures will bring criticism, but Root has many of the qualities you would look for in an ideal captain.
He is also incredibly popular among the playing group, meaning he can comfortably socialise with any of the players in his squad. He has a great sense of humour, which helps to put people at ease. Anyone going into that dressing room has a captain who is approachable, knowledgeable, and who they can learn from. What he needs is an experienced coach who is able to provide a vision and strategy across the England set-up, while also helping Joe with his leadership skills and his tactics, reviewing with him sessions of play and decisions made. Sometimes under Root there have been tactical missteps, both in individual sessions and across entire series. For example he went to Sri Lanka in 2018 wanting the team to play an aggressive style of batting, a different approach to many England sides against Sri Lanka’s spinners, and although that tactic worked in those conditions England then went to the West Indies wanting to continue in that vein. Against good, accurate swing bowling England started the series by being bowled out for 77 when a rather more orthodox attitude was needed. I have one particularly strong memory of Joe from later in that tour. England were 2-0 down when they arrived in St Lucia for the final Test, and though the team had the day off Joe wasn’t happy with the way he was batting so we went to the beautiful ground at Gros Islet and had two hours in the nets. It was probably my most enjoyable session as a coach, to be with a great player, to listen to how he spoke about the game and watch how he worked on it. I remember someone asking me when I first took over as England’s batting coach: “What on earth can you tell Alastair Cook?” With players of that calibre you don’t tell them anything, you try to ask the right questions so they problem-solve. In those two hours in the hot Caribbean sun Joe worked hard on his alignment, his bat path and his basics. My job was to listen, to encourage, support, and now and again to challenge. He scored a second-innings century as England won the third Test comfortably.
I think we have seen Joe improve as a captain, but while he has tried to be more proactive it isn’t a particular strength of his. Too often we don’t see him dictating terms through good captaincy. For example, he dismissed Travis Head in the first innings in Adelaide but has not bowled a single delivery at him since. I’m absolutely convinced that a captain such as MS Dhoni or Kane Williamson would have brought Joe straight on to bowl the next time Head came out. Small things like that can make life uncomfortable for a new batter, and show a flexibility in approach. Root also often fails to use his fielding positions to create doubt in the minds of incoming batters: stick a man short on the leg side when a batsman is on nought, put someone at silly point, try to build pressure. But regardless of how good a captain you are, if you’re consistently not scoring enough runs as a team you never have the chance to be innovative with your bowling attack. Problems with player availability and team selection have hindered England in the past year. The big one is Ben Stokes, one of the team’s core players, who missed too much cricket to come in and perform in this Ashes series. Jonny Bairstow has been marginalised despite having a good record as wicketkeeper-batsman, the gloves taken off him, not being consistently picked, and I think his confidence has been affected. His treatment contrasts with that of Jos Buttler, who has never given me the impression that either technically or in terms of mindset he is comfortable batting in Test cricket.
With the bat there is no doubt that Root has led by example. To score 1,708 runs in a calendar year, more than England’s next four highest scorers put together, is a monumental achievement, and his ability to focus on his own personal game despite wickets falling around him and the added concerns of captaincy is phenomenal. And he has also been able to transition from being incredibly successful in short‑form cricket to making thousands of runs in Tests, which for me demonstrates the importance of an orthodox technique. I remember watching Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul open for India last summer – two players with huge amounts of runs in the Indian Premier League, yet also able to open in a Test against Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in overcast English conditions. With a few exceptions most of the batters who have been able to move between formats have, like Sharma and Rahul, superb defensive technique, good judgment around off stump, and excellent concentration. When I visited India as assistant coach to England Under-19s in 2016 the insistence within the Indian structure on good batting basics was obvious. Meanwhile I spoke to an MCC coach recently who happily told me that when kids come to Lord’s he tells them to just smack the ball and have fun. There are many significant problems facing English cricket at the moment, and I don’t think Joe Root is one of them.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/english-cricket-has-much-bigger-problems-to-address-than-joe-root-captaincy-ashes-australia-england;sports
5776;5776;5776;1495;5846;5846;The Isle of Wight’s dinosaur hunter: we’re going to need a bigger museum;2022-01-03;['Hannah Devlin'];['Dinosaurs', 'Fossils', 'Palaeontology', 'UK news', 'Isle of Wight'];Some of us binged on box sets, others grappled with the challenges of home school and zoned out of Zoom meetings: for many, life under lockdown felt glum. But for Jeremy Lockwood, a retired GP turned palaeontologist, 2021 was a standout year featuring two big dinosaur discoveries and laying plans to make the Isle of Wight famous for its prehistoric inhabitants once more. “It was an absolutely thrilling time for me,” Lockwood said. Lockwood, 64, who retired as a family doctor in the Midlands seven years ago, was behind the widely publicised discovery of a new species of iguanadontian dinosaur with a distinctively large nose and a second species, nicknamed “the horned crocodile-faced Hell Heron”. At the start of the pandemic, Lockwood re-registered with the General Medical Council and volunteered to work. However, his daughter, also a doctor, pointed out that before vaccines were available, hospitals would not want people in their 60s walking around wards. So for the past two years, Lockwood has immersed himself in fossil hunting on the beach and sifting through boxes of bones from museum archives. In palaeontology, like astronomy, amateurs often work alongside academics and their scientific contributions are frequently recognised. On retirement, Lockwood decided to put his lifelong interest in dinosaurs on a formal footing and persuaded his wife to move to the Isle of Wight, where a steady stream of dinosaur fossils emerge from the cliffs as they are eroded. He contacted Prof David Martill, of the University of Portsmouth, about doing a PhD and was quickly accepted. “I felt I had to do something to keep me active,” he said. “I don’t think I could’ve just played golf or grown roses.” Lockwood is revisiting a golden era for dinosaur discovery with a focus on iguanodons, the first specimen of which was unearthed by Gideon Mantell, also a doctor turned palaeontologist, in Sussex in 1825. Some have assumed that the long timeline of discovery means that the understanding of British dinosaurs is essentially “done and dusted”. On the contrary, Lockwood said, certain dogmas have remained unchallenged. And modern methods, such as using software to cluster specimens into a most likely family tree, have not always been applied to earlier finds. Most dinosaurs found on the Isle of Wight had been traditionally assigned to just one of two species: the plant-eating Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis. After sifting through many hundreds of bones that had been sitting in boxes in the Natural History Museum and the Dinosaur Isle museum, Lockwood identified a clear outlier with an enormous bulbous nose. The finding suggests there were far more iguanadontian dinosaurs in the Early Cretaceous of the UK than previously thought and raises the prospect of tracing the evolution of different traits through time. “You can almost liken this huge collection of iguanadontian bones to several jigsaw puzzles that are all mixed up,” said Lockwood. “I’m trying to put together something that is meaningful.” Officially, Lockwood is doing his doctorate part-time, but acknowledges that he has become “a bit obsessed”. “Sometimes I’ll work for 16 hours a day for a few weeks,” he said. “You struggle to find time to cut the lawn and decorate your house, and friends and family have to put up with you talking about dinosaurs all the time.” Alongside his work on archive specimens, Lockwood also makes daily surveys of the beach to spot any dinosaur bones emerging from the cliffs. Winter is peak collecting season. “Certainly with winter storms eroding things, that’s when the big finds come in,” said Lockwood. He is also coordinating a bid to redevelop the Dinosaur Isle museum, by a charitable group that Lockwood chairs together with a German company, Dinosaurier-Park International, after the local council launched a tender process. “I’m trying to take over the museum,” Lockwood said. “The Isle of Wight undersells its dinosaurs. Most people are unaware that we’re Europe’s hotspot for dinosaurs and early mammals. We need a much bigger museum.” Lockwood said he has “great sympathy” for former medical colleagues still working on the frontline during the pandemic and is particularly annoyed by the “lazy GP stereotype” sometimes aired in media coverage. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. “You can see burnout happening all over the place.” Several doctors have got in touch to congratulate him on his recent successes. “Some of the nice tweets were from other doctors approaching retirement,” he said. “It’s really good to see that there’s a life after medicine.”;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/isle-of-wight-dinosaur-hunter-need-bigger-museum-jeremy-lockwood;science and technology
5789;5789;5789;1508;5859;5859;Apocalypse nowadays: the new wave of films about the end of the world;2022-01-03;['Alex Hess'];"['Film', ""Don't Look Up"", 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Climate crisis', 'Culture', 'Environment', 'Dr Strangelove', 'Independence Day: Resurgence']";"Which films kept you entertained over the holidays? Was it Silent Night, the sweary festive Britcom starring Keira Knightley? The courtroom drama Naked Singularity, with John Boyega as a crusading lawyer? Or did you watch Leonardo DiCaprio as a dorky astronomer in Don’t Look Up, a slapstick political satire? Whichever it was, I hope you poured yourself a large one, because none of those films are quite as light as they seem. All take place in the shadow of imminent Armageddon. That’s right: the end of the world is nigh, and it’s no longer the preserve of megabudget disaster movies or bleak survivalist thrillers. These days the looming obliteration of our species can just as readily form the backdrop to some governmental mockery or a boozy country-house drama.
Why the sudden change? After all, existential catastrophe is hardly a new subject for Hollywood, which has been churning out such tales for the best part of a century. Historically, though, they have largely come in the form of razzle-dazzle showstoppers, be it during the original disaster-movie boom, with titles like When Worlds Collide, or more recent CGI-fuelled fare such as The Day After Tomorrow. The more muted end-times films have been generally been left to less popcorn-hungry countries like Russia (The Sacrifice), France (Time of the Wolf, Delicatessen) and Canada (Last Night). But the mainstream movie industry has nonetheless made sure that even the most casual filmgoer will be well used to witnessing humanity’s spectacular destruction. We’ve seen it carried out by deranged scientists and comic-book villains, by robot uprising and cosmic collision, by viral outbreak and biblical flood, by dragons, birds and talking monkeys. And unsurprisingly, a genre predicated on the ultimate worst-case scenario has tended to reflect the anxieties of the time. Invasion of the Body Snatchers offered an allegory for McCarthyism; Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, with its nightmarish urban devastation, was the first truly post-9/11 blockbuster; Wall-E sounded the alarm about mass consumerism. The genre itself initially mushroomed during the cold war, when “mutually assured destruction” became a household phrase. Now it’s exploding again. According to the Wikipedia page listing “apocalyptic films”, there were more additions to the genre in the past decade than the previous two combined. In the last year alone the destruction of our planet has been either realised or threatened in sci-fi extravaganzas, family tearjerkers and chirpy animated romps. This year will bring more of the same: slated for TV are two cheerless visions of post-viral dystopia, The Last of Us and Station Eleven, as well as the Ronseal-titled Extinction. At the cinema, we’ll get the big-screen pageantry of Moonfall from disaster impresario Roland Emmerich, and a Noah Baumbach adaptation of Don DeLillo’s eco-fiasco novel White Noise.
But before all that, treat yourself to the best film of the festive season: The Humans, an understated chamber piece in which a dysfunctional family gather for Thanksgiving under a distinct atmosphere of – you guessed it! – creeping existential dread. The real drama, though, lies in the bickering of rival siblings, senile grandparents and sozzled patriarchs. It’s more evidence that end-times anxiety can now be treated as mundane, off-screen, secondary to the domestic fallout: call it kitchen-sink nihilism.
It’s a long way from the cigar-chomping triumphalism of Armageddon and Independence Day – both certified artefacts of Clinton-era America – but maybe this trend for quietly apocalypse-adjacent storytelling is to be expected in an era when the real-world headlines tell of survival bunkers, fire tornadoes and doomsday glaciers. Dr Strangelove’s breakneck bomb-ride was the response to a world where nuclear decimation could arrive at any moment; maybe this new mode of restraint reflects a reality where the unthinkable seems to be unfolding bit by bit, a matter of glum inevitability. Adam McKay’s climate-change satire Don’t Look Up takes its lead from Kubrick’s movie, invoking the apocalypse as an act of ridicule towards a complacent political class. But six decades on, the tone has shifted from anarchic glee to resigned exasperation. “Maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun,” says Jennifer Lawrence’s scientist. “Maybe it’s supposed to be unsettling.” It’s a credo that unites this current crop of films, which all provoke angst rather than excitement, defeatism rather than hope. This is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but a shrug. Or as Arnold Schwarzenegger grumbles in End of Days, while the scenario of the title closes in: “We have some real serious problems here – and we’re not solving any of them!” And when it comes to the annihilation of humankind, there’s a man who knows what he’s talking about.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/apocalypse-nowadays-the-new-wave-of-films-about-the-end-of-the-world;environment
5793;5793;5793;1512;5863;5863;Purity, passion, drama: darts’ renaissance continues in tournament for the ages | Sean Ingle;2022-01-03;['Sean Ingle'];['PDC World Championships', 'Darts', 'Sport'];"Forty years ago this month, at the height of darts’ first great tungsten rush, Jocky Wilson left Jollees nightclub in Stoke clutching a world title and a cheque for £6,500 – about £26,000 in today’s money. It is a measure of the sport’s renewed popularity that whoever lifts the PDC World Championship trophy on Monday night will pocket £500,000. And while the final ‘Oi, Oi, Ois’ are yet to ring out across Alexandra Palace, it is already safe to hail this year’s tournament as a vintage edition. When Michael Smith outpowered Jonny Clayton in a last 16 final-set tiebreak it was instantly hailed as a game for the ages. But such was the quality in so many subsequent matches, including Smith’s 5-4 victory against the world No 1, Gerwyn Price and Peter Wright’s 6-4 slugfest over Gary Anderson – during which Wright hit 24 180s, a record for a world championship match – it may not even have been the best encounter of the week.
Meanwhile a nine-dart finish was once so rare that in 1982 the sponsors offered £52,000 for anyone who could land it – eight times bigger than the winner’s prize. No one did. Yet when Price achieved the feat against Smith on Saturday it was the third of the tournament – a record. An average of a million people watched last year’s final. Would anyone be surprised if that figure was surpassed on Monday when Wright faces off against Smith? So what accounts for the popularity of darts? To these eyes its pleasures come from its purity – dart and board, eye and nerve – combined with its unremitting pressures. After all, there are few sports where the gap between perfection and failure is so slim; where the adrenaline surge of hitting a 180 can so abruptly morph into a public shaming if three darts for a double are spurned; where a player must think, to calculate where to throw next, but not overthink, as then the tension and heckling will buckle the mind with doubt. It is a sport with so many momentum shifts it could be played on a seesaw. And at the highest levels, when players throw for a leg or set or match every 90 seconds or so, darts becomes almost a combat sport. True, an opponent cannot hit. But they can constantly wound. It perhaps helps that darts remains a sport where you don’t have to be fast-tracked into an academy, or born with a silver spoon in your mouth. The Scottish player Peter Wright was a tyre fitter before making it as a professional in his mid-30s. His compatriot Gary Anderson, his opponent in Sunday’s semi-final, was a builder. With their pot bellies and tattoos, they look more like us than most elite sports stars.
Longevity, too, may play a part: incredibly Paul Lim, “the Singapore Slinger” who played alongside Wilson in 1982 was still good enough to play in this year’s world championship at 67. Wilson, of course, was the ultimate darting rags-to-riches-and-back-to-rags story. He grew up in desperate poverty, including years in a children’s home, before he began playing in the mid-1970s while on the dole. Famously he had no teeth. Early in his career his dentures fell out during a match and in the excitement he trod on them. When the Observer went to the 1980 world championship they found Wilson wandering about with “cans of beers in his pocket, needing a shave, and with bits of dried fruit in his pockets”. At one point a girl from the sponsor Embassy gave the players 200 cigarettes each for the night. “They smoke so many free fags all the week that they are coughing their hearts up by the end of it,” our man noted – including Wilson, who played with a cigarette lodged in his non‑throwing hand. But Wilson could play, and how. Two years later he beat John Lowe in the 1982 final despite arguments with the press, leaving the stage in tears after a row with Alun Evans, and the roof of his council house in Kirkcaldy collapsing during the tournament. “It was not a particularly good final,” Matthew Engel wrote in these pages. “Lowe was off by a millimetre or so, and millimetres are more significant in darts than in any sport except mountaineering.” That victory allowed Wilson to buy a house of his own. Tragically over the years his drinking (the commentator Sid Waddell famously quipped that Wilson would “win darts matches when other people would have been in intensive care”) took its toll and the Scot ended his days back in the council estate where he grew up.
Meanwhile a sport that was once the sole preserve of pubs and working men’s clubs is now attracting interest from academics. One recent study examined 29,381 matches and found that, if both players could win the match with just one dart, performance at youth and amateur level worsened by 10%‑26%, while for professionals it dropped less than 1%. That is a striking finding given the abuse that top players face at crunch moments. It has been particularly bad in this 2021 tournament, with the sozzled crowd telling the Welshman Price that he was “a sheep-shagging bastard” and barracking and booing non-English players. The unwillingness of the announcers to properly call it out remains a lingering stain. Meanwhile another study showed observers could accurately decipher how a top darts player would throw based on their body language. Typically, faces showed more expression and anxiety – with preparation times shorter – before a poor throw than before a good one. Of course darts has its detractors. But even they would have to accept that a sport that has zig-zagged from boom to bust, schism to lengthy separation, and from resuscitation to renaissance over the past four decades is booming, and now as much a part of the Christmas and New Year furniture as hangovers and failed resolutions.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/darts-pdc-world-championship;sports
5816;5816;5816;1535;5886;5886;Country diary: On this hazy morning, the distant hills are barely visible;2022-01-03;['John Gilbey'];['Rural affairs', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Trees and forests', 'Birds'];"Ahead of me at the far end of the path, just where it drops into the next valley, the wind has corralled a drift of dry leaves between the hedgerows. It fills the space behind the gate almost ankle deep, so that opening it sweeps a quadrant clear to mark my passage. The air is still and cold, the grass fringed with lines of frost, distant sounds seem unusually close at hand. Ivy weaves across the bank below the beech wood, bright green against the dead brash of the woodland floor, with early light reflecting from the glossy cuticles of the leaves.
I pause and look eastwards along the valley of the Afon Rheidol. A few sheep look up from the pasture before realising I’m not carrying anything remotely edible – certainly not a rattling bag of grass nuts – and return to their stolid routine. A thin mist hangs between the trees that mark the course of the river, fading into the veil of haze which softens the distant hills. The sun has finally climbed above the horizon, but is still low in the sky – and a single red kite beats across the hillside in its search for breakfast. At the end of each pass the kite makes a sharp right-hand turn, the sun lighting up the russet of its underside as it wheels around.
After the recent storms I’m relieved to see an old friend has survived. An ancient tree, split by time and weather into multiple trunks, and with an almost fractal crown, stands resolutely at the end of the hedgerow. Sheltered from the north and west by the steep hillside, only a scattering of twigs have fallen since I was last here, so the outline of the tree against the light retains its barely balanced complexity. I wander on down the lane under the bare chestnut trees, looking across at the field where gorse has begun to invade the lightly grazed pasture. Even at the turning of the year the gorse is, as usual, in flower – a scattering of yellow gently lit by the milky sunshine. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/03/country-diary-on-this-hazy-morning-the-distant-hills-are-barely-visible;environment
5822;5822;5822;1541;5892;5892;British DJ escapes prosecution after sparking New Zealand’s first Omicron scare;2022-01-03;['Helen Livingstone'];['New Zealand', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"A British DJ who triggered New Zealand’s first Omicron scare after breaking home isolation rules will not be prosecuted for the time being, authorities say. “The Ministry of Health does not plan to refer this case to the police at this stage,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it “needs to balance the deterrence effect from any potential prosecution with enabling an environment that does not discourage future cases from assisting with the public health response to Covid-19”. Robert Etheridge, also known as DJ Dimension, arrived in New Zealand on 16 December and spent seven days in one of the country’s managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities, where he returned three negative Covid test results, Stuff reported.
After leaving MIQ he was required to spend three days in home isolation but did not wait to receive a negative day-nine test – as also required – before entering the community. According to the ministry, he visited a series of venues in Auckland over two days including nightclubs, a shopping precinct and restaurants before receiving a positive test result on 27 December and being returned to MIQ. Etheridge, who had been due to play at the Rhythm and Alps festival near Wanaka last week, apologised to “those who I have inadvertently put at risk as a result of my misunderstandings”. “I realise the gravity of the situation and I am deeply regretful to those who have been impacted.” In an earlier statement he said: “After completing my 10-day isolation, and of the understanding that I had completed my quarantine, I entered the community.

5828;5828;5828;1547;5898;5898;Russia ‘very likely’ to invade Ukraine without ‘enormous sanctions’ – Schiff;2022-01-02;['Martin Pengelly'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Nato', 'US news', 'US foreign policy', 'US national security', 'US Congress', 'US politics', 'World news', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Joe Biden', 'Biden administration'];"Russia is “very likely” to invade Ukraine and might only be deterred by “enormous sanctions”, the chair of the US House intelligence committee said on Sunday.
Adam Schiff also said an invasion could backfire on Moscow, by drawing more countries into the Nato military alliance. “I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring Nato closer to Russia, not push it farther away,” he said. After the California Democrat spoke, the White House said Joe Biden had spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.” On Twitter, Zelenskiy said: “The first international talk of the year with [Biden] proves the special nature of our relations.” He also said the joint actions of Ukraine, the US “and partners in keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchisation were discussed. We appreciate the unwavering support of Ukraine.” Russia has amassed around 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Biden told Vladimir Putin the US would impose serious sanctions if Russia attacked. Talks are scheduled for Geneva on 9 and 10 January. But amid tensions heightened by both sides’ possession of nuclear weapons, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that if “the west continues its aggressive line, Russia will be forced to take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our security”. Russia has for years complained about Nato encroachment. Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, which guarantees collective defence, but Nato has expanded eastwards since the fall of the Soviet Union and Kiev urgently seeks admission. Russia invaded Ukrainian territory in 2014, annexing Crimea. The US has supplied “small” arms to Ukraine. On CBS’s Face the Nation, Schiff was asked what would stop Putin ordering an invasion. “I think that it would require enormous sanctions on Russia to deter what appears to be a very likely Russian invasion of Ukraine again,” Schiff said. “And I think our allies need to be solidly on board with it. Russia needs to understand we are united in this.”
An invasion, Schiff said, would see “more Nato assets closer to Russia. [It] will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve”. Schiff said he had “no problem” with “going after Putin personally”, but thought “sector-sized sanctions will be the most important”. Asked if he thought scheduled talks had any chance of averting an invasion, he said: “I fear that Putin is very likely to invade. I still frankly don’t understand the full motivation for why now he’s doing this, but he certainly appears intent on it unless we can persuade him otherwise. “And I think nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him, and that’s exactly what we need to do with our allies.” Reuters contributed to this report";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/russia-invade-ukraine-enormous-sanctions-schiff;politics
5834;5834;5834;1553;5905;5905;Thomas Tuchel refuses to guarantee Lukaku return to Chelsea team;2022-01-02;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Chelsea', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Thomas Tuchel refused to guarantee that Romelu Lukaku will be given his place back after the striker was dropped for Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Chelsea host Tottenham in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Tuchel will decide whether to bring Lukaku back into the fold only after holding further talks with him on Monday. The manager was left fuming after the £97.5m forward went public with his unhappiness at Stamford Bridge in an unauthorised interview last week and he hinted that he could leave the Belgian out again against Spurs.
“He’s our player, he will stay our player, we will always protect our player,” Tuchel said. “First we need to evaluate the situations, not listen to media or pressure, understand what he said and why he said it. “Then we will take the decision if he is good to go for Wednesday. I cannot tell you right now because we need to talk and understand the situation more and on we go. Once the situation is clear he will stay our player and we protect our player.” Lukaku had caused a storm by questioning Tuchel’s system and saying he wants to return to Internazionale one day. The comments went down badly at Chelsea and it is understood Tuchel, who held talks with senior players before picking his team, had the backing of the dressing room after omitting the club’s record signing. “I don’t take decisions in my office,” Tuchel said. “I have players to listen to and hear their opinions about what they think and I make my decisions once I hear them out. It’s their club and their team. It’s not a personal thing for me.”
Tuchel, who would not say what he wants from the meeting on Monday, was asked if he had intended to make a stand against Lukaku’s behaviour. “It’s not Chelsea like but it’s also not the worst thing in the world,” he said. “I don’t feel personally attacked. On Saturday new statements appeared and it got too big, too much noise, and we lost the focus of the match. “We wanted to protect Romelu from a rash decision because we need to speak with him, read the full interview and stay calm. It was simply the decision to protect the match like this. It was too much noise. This was clear that he will not be in the squad.” The result dealt a major blow to Chelsea’s and Liverpool’s hopes of catching Manchester City. Liverpool appeared to have revived their title prospects after goals from Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah put them 2-0 up but Chelsea levelled through Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic before the break.
Chelsea were aggrieved that Mané was still on the pitch to score the opener after the Liverpool forward escaped with a booking for an elbow on César Azpilicueta in the first minute. “It’s a clear red,” Azpilicueta said. “I don’t care if it’s five seconds into the game – he doesn’t look for the ball, he just wants to hit me with the elbow. I don’t understand. We are getting a lot of decisions against us.” City are 10 points above Chelsea and 11 clear of Liverpool, who have a game in hand. However Pep Lijnders, who stood in for Jürgen Klopp after Liverpool’s manager tested positive for Covid-19, refused to admit that the race is over. “We never look at others,” Klopp’s assistant said. “The title race is only decided on the last match. We have to focus on ourselves. That’s how we always did it. We only focus on the next game. This is how we became champions and won the Champions League.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/thomas-tuchel-refuses-to-guarantee-lukaku-return-to-chelsea-team;sports
5835;5835;5835;1554;5906;5906;Twitter permanently suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account ;2022-01-02;['Martin Pengelly'];['Republicans', 'The far right', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"The personal Twitter account of the Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been permanently suspended, for violating policies on Covid misinformation.
The action against Greene on Sunday came under the “strike” system Twitter launched last March, which uses artificial intelligence to identify posts about the coronavirus misleading enough to cause harm. Two or three strikes earn a 12-hour account lock, four strikes prompt a weeklong suspension and five or more can get an account permanently removed. Twitter had previously suspended Greene’s account for periods ranging from 12 hours to a week. She was issued a “fourth strike” this summer, for saying vaccines were failing. “We’ve been clear that … we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokeswoman said on Sunday. The congresswoman’s official account remains active. The Republican is a determined controversialist and extremist who courts controversy and confrontation. On social media, she has voiced support for racist views, QAnon conspiracy theories such as the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and calls for violence against Democrats including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Last February, the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called Greene’s embrace of conspiracy theories and “loony lies” a “cancer for the Republican party”. The Democratic-led House ejected her from committee assignments. In July, Twitter suspended Greene for a week after Joe Biden urged tech companies to take stronger action against bogus vaccine claims that the president said were “killing people”. Twitter has said it has removed thousands of tweets and challenged millions of accounts. Greene has regularly been fined for refusing to follow Covid guidelines in Congress, including mask-wearing on the House floor. In a statement on the Telegram app on Sunday, she called Twitter “an enemy to America” and said it could not “handle the truth”. She also accused Twitter of seeking “a communist revolution” and said: “Social media platforms can’t stop the truth from being spread far and wide. Big tech can’t stop the truth. Communist Democrats can’t stop the truth. I stand with the truth and the people. We will overcome.” Greene said her account was suspended after she tweeted statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a government database which includes raw data. Among Greene’s final tweets was one that falsely referenced “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths”, according to her Telegram account, which appears to mirror her now-banned Twitter feed. More than 825,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, out of a caseload of nearly 55m. Many states are experiencing a surge of cases and disruption to everyday life caused by the highly infectious Omicron variant. On Sunday, Biden’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, said the US had been seeing almost a “vertical increase” of cases, now averaging 400,000 a day, with hospitalisations up too. Resistance to vaccinations and other public health measures has driven the pandemic and inflamed political tensions. Last week, Greene boasted on Twitter about talking to Donald Trump by phone. She said she had received the former president’s permission to clarify his stance that he is against vaccine mandates though he encourages people to get the shot and booster. Trump was booed by some audience members in Dallas on 19 December, when he said he had received a booster shot.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-permanently-suspends-account;politics
5836;5836;5836;1555;5907;5907;Glorious chaos at Stamford Bridge shows City are too good for the rest | Barney Ronay;2022-01-02;['Barney Ronay'];['Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Well, there goes the league title. Happy new year everyone! But hey, what a way to go. For the second time in two-and-a-half weeks Liverpool came to London and played out a wild, impossibly moreish 2-2 draw against occasionally brilliant, occasionally flawed opponents. This was no doubt an agonising watch for Jürgen Klopp in self‑isolation; just as it was 90 minutes of full-body torture for Thomas Tuchel, who spent the afternoon leaping up like a furious clockwork woodpecker, combination-punching invisible demons, and at one point hurling a bottle of orange energy drink thrillingly into an advertisement hoarding.
For Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge follows the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And so the ledger will report four points dropped: the kind of matches where title races are lost, seasons bookended. And yet it didn’t feel like a day for regrets. A five-month extended victory lap for the reigning champions presents a problem for the Premier League and its broadcast partners. It might well reopen the question of exactly how City have managed to build this extraordinary position of strength, a squad with no weaknesses. Some will point to questions the Premier League feel have yet to be answered over resources and expenditure, questions that are designed, at bottom, to preserve competitiveness. City’s fans might reply by rolling their eyes and pointing to Chelsea’s own absent £100m striker. One thing is clear. Flawed teams produce brilliant games. Those spaces, the mis-steps, it’s where the oxygen gets in. And this was a game where amazing things just kept happening. On 56 minutes Liverpool’s defence cleared a corner high into the night sky, Diogo Jota took the ball as it bounced, scrabbled back to his feet under pressure, and laid the bail off to Mohamed Salah. From 35 yards Salah produced something hilariously good, a driven chip-shot that drew, in turn, an outstanding stretching leaping save from Édouard Mendy. In that moment this didn’t feel like a football match, more a kind of display, a trick-shot bonus feature, Evel Knievel leaping a row of municipal buses. In reality the idea that this match represented a title-race eliminator was always fanciful. Chelsea haven’t looked like contenders since the start of November. Liverpool had won six of their last eight, but will now be losing their first-choice attackers. And in the end, it’s not you: it’s them. It’s the unwavering excellence of Manchester City, a team that continue to make something very difficult look very easy indeed.
Stamford Bridge was a noisy, gusty place at kick-off. With Romelu Lukaku at home watching Real Madrid, Thomas Tuchel went with that infamous “other system” also known as the shape that won Chelsea the Champions League: seven primarily defensive players, plus three in attack to press and cover. The early exchanges were hilariously error-prone, culminating in Trevoh Chalobah stooping to head clear Diogo Jota’s pass and ending up with his nose grazing the turf, somehow, in defiance of all physical laws, heading the ball off his own shoelaces. The ball broke to Sadio Mané. He buried it.
If anything captures Liverpool’s edge of brittleness and brilliance it is the interaction between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah, arguably the outstanding single attacking combination in English football over the past decade. It was from there that Liverpool made it 2-0 with a startling moment of synchronised movement and passing physics. Salah started the move, funnelling the ball back to Alexander-Arnold. As Chelsea’s defenders slackened a little, Salah had already begun to sprint, sniffing out a sliver of space, a fault in the stitching. Alexander-Arnold released a wonderfully weighted, backspun pass straight into that same corridor. At which point Salah produced another perfect little miniature. His first touch stunned the ball into his stride. The second wasn’t a touch at all, but a feint, an opening of the hips that transformed Marcos Alonso into a kind of goal-doorman, dipping a knee, scrolling his hand, formally inviting Salah into the Chelsea six-yard box. The finish was effortless, a lifted dink-prod on the run. Mateo Kovacic pulled one back with another stunner. Everyone who has ever kicked a ball has caught one like this just the once – leaning back, adjusting his feet, punting it up and then back down in a perfect parabola to clank in off the far post. But not, perhaps, in a brutally tight Premier League game in front of the watching millions, with just one shot, one moment to catch the sun. Chelsea’s equaliser moments later came down that same Liverpool right flank. Frankly, it all seemed a little too easy. Salah lost possession. Alexander‑Arnold was caught dawdling in a half space. N’Golo Kanté was able to help the ball on for Christian Pulisic who conjured a fine finish of his own, arcing the ball over Caoimhin Kelleher with a perfectly lobbed instep touch.
And the fact is neither of these teams is at the level of City, whose football has a kind of light around it right now, something clean and perfectly ordered, who have won 11 games in a row by passing and moving their opponents into a state of exhausted impotence. It would be absurd to denigrate a team this good for being, in effect too good, for winning games in a way that is so beautifully planned and drilled it seems to creep ever closer to a place where variables are removed and the result is, in effect, inevitable. City are a thing of beauty, too. And on the ragged, thrilling evidence of Stamford Bridge, just too good for the rest.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/02/glorious-chaos-at-stamford-bridge-shows-city-are-too-good-for-the-rest;sports
5839;5839;5839;1558;5911;5911;Tom Woolstencroft and Maro Itoje help Saracens break Northampton’s spirit;2022-01-02;['Gerard Meagher'];['Premiership', 'Northampton', 'Saracens', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"“Same old Sarries, always cheating,” came the chant from a Northampton supporter in the crowd. It is unclear whether he was moaning about the legality of some of their defensive work or perhaps making reference to how their salary-cap scandal has been referenced a lot of late, but he got one thing spot-on: this was without question the same old Saracens. The Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, bristled at the idea that a win such as this for Saracens was inevitable when Northampton found themselves camped in their opponents’ 22 for large spells of the first half, only to go in at the interval at 6-6. We have seen it so many times before, however, that there was little surprising about the manner in which Saracens weathered the storm and, with Alex Lozowski finishing with 20 points, pulled clear.
This sort of performance, particularly on their travels, has been the hallmark of Saracens’ return to the Premiership. They have the defensive resilience to soak up prolonged periods of pressure before edging in front and delivering the telling blow as their opponents get increasingly desperate. Here it was Lozowski’s try early in the second half and Tom Woolstencroft’s score from a driving maul that ensured victory for Saracens – Maro Itoje’s late effort making for a thoroughly demoralising afternoon for Northampton. It might have been different had Northampton managed to convert one of their chances in the first half – Boyd was adamant that repeatedly opting against kicking at goal was the right approach – and their supporters certainly felt that the referee Adam Leal ought to have shown a yellow card following a flurry of Saracens penalties. He did not, however, and after Northampton again opted for a scrum under the posts he penalised the home side – much to Boyd’s frustration. Boyd said: “He didn’t have enough nuts, did he? I mean it was a clear hinge. There was only one side under pressure in that series of scrums. At the end of the day we only got six points and they got 30. We had half a dozen opportunities in the first half, they had three and scored three tries. That’s the difference between the two sides.”
Northampton can regroup, at least safe in the knowledge they are not the only side to suffer this kind of defeat against Saracens. Bristol were also kept tryless at home in September but they probably ought to have played the conditions better. They were not without positives – George Furbank was excellent at full‑back – but just as was the case last time out against Harlequins at Twickenham, a touch more pragmatism could make all the difference when the heavens open. Saracens, meanwhile, have cemented their grip on second spot. Jamie George made a successful return to the side from a knee injury – perhaps his most valuable asset was the manner in which he communicated with Leal when his side were under the pump – and Alex Goode again showed his class at fly‑half, standing in for the injured Owen Farrell, who was in the coaches’ box, barking out instructions to his side. In a further boost for club and country the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, revealed Farrell could make his comeback on 23 January, two weeks before England’s Six Nations opener. Lozowski and Dan Biggar traded a pair of penalties in a first half notable for Northampton’s ambition despite the torrential rain and Saracens’ ability to hold firm in the trenches. Furbank in particular was a threat with the ball in hand, but Saracens were resilient with their backs to the wall. Given Saracens reached double figures in penalties against inside the first half, however, maybe Northampton’s grievances were not without foundation.
Saracens then struck with the first try four minutes after the restart. Goode was the architect, straightening through half a gap before offloading to Lozowski, who slid for the line early and had just enough momentum to get there. He converted for good measure for a seven-point lead. There was no little endeavour from Northampton but as the half wore on there was increasingly an inevitability to the Woolstencroft try that broke Saints’ spirit. It occurred moments after the Saints replacement Conor Carey had been sent to the sin-bin and before Itoje splashed over for good measure. “When you’re under the pump, in front of a great crowd as Northampton have, in your 22 as often as we were you need your senior players to step up and I thought across the board ours did,” McCall said. “I thought we showed a lot of fight, grit and resolve. Just a really good hard-fought away win.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/northampton-saracens-premiership-rugby-union-match-report;sports

5864;5864;5864;1583;5936;5936;When grit isn’t great: letting go rather than pushing through can help our wellbeing |  Gaynor Parkin;2022-01-02;['N/A'];['Mental health', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Health & wellbeing'];"Is it possible to let that go? Is there someone else who can help you? Could you defer it for a week? To each of these queries and other similar ones, Mary gave a firm shake of the head and an even firmer “no”. This was a pattern. Our sessions had a real “groundhog day” feel to them. Mary would arrive looking harassed and tired, tell me how frantic her week had been and how many things there were still to do. We tried problem solving and planning, prioritising and all manner of productivity hacks. Nothing shifted. Mary’s struggle was also too familiar. She reminded me of many other high-achieving people I have worked with who had sought help for exhaustion, or health difficulties or burnout. One of their hallmarks is seemingly endless resources of grit. American psychologist Angela Duckworth is well known for her research on the phenomenon of grit: Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity and plateaus in progress. Her studies indicate that grit is more predictive of success and achievement in areas like education and business than intelligence or natural ability. Greater grit is associated with people sticking it out through difficult periods and staying longer in a job. Interestingly, research also indicates that those with higher grit are happier and more satisfied with their lives. This finding certainly didn’t hold true for Mary. Is there a downside to too much grit? A 2015 study found that people with high levels of grit often persist with difficult tasks to their own detriment. Participants had to solve as many puzzles as they could – but some of the puzzles were unsolvable. Grittier individuals spent more time attempting to solve unsolvable puzzles and solved fewer overall than their less gritty counterparts. The researchers’ conclusion? There is value in knowing when to quit.
Discussing this knowledge at an intellectual level is one thing. Translating it into a felt sense that some change is possible is much harder. One of the shifts in my work with Mary came after a good discussion about strengths and vulnerabilities. Often we use our strengths to protect ourselves from experiencing our vulnerabilities. Perhaps I over-work to keep feelings of vulnerability at bay, or book myself up with social engagements to avoid noticing I’m feeling alone. It’s smart coping, but it has a downside. Overusing strengths can mean we can rely on them too much, or use them too often, or miss noticing that they are not so helpful any more. Mary’s grit was definitely a strength and it was definitely over used. Gently, to make sure we didn’t trigger too much emotional distress, we brainstormed what the grit might be protecting her from. Mary’s protections again reminded me of other high achievers: protecting her from asking for help; protecting her from feeling vulnerable or not in control; protecting her from feeling that she had somehow failed if she didn’t nail every challenge. Another important insight was helping Mary to recognise that she is living and working in an environment that reinforces grit. Our western culture celebrates the qualities of persistence and striving. We love stories of people triumphing over adversity of all kinds.
We are also quick to criticise anyone who appears to “give up”. The great basketball player Michael Jordan declared: “If you quit once it becomes a habit. Never quit.” Not persevering is seen as the “soft option” or taking the easy road out. For Mary, moving away from too much grit then needed to be an individual journey but also a shared experience. Another young woman I worked with who was a successful athlete gave a presentation on grit to her team and coaches to spark better conversations about persevering and also recovery, when to push and when to pause. When we speak freely about our struggles with family, colleagues and friends, we are better able to identify when someone else, or ourselves, might need a gentle nudge towards pausing instead of pushing. This means we don’t need to walk the path alone. We know from psychological research that we are more likely to succeed and lift our wellbeing with new behaviours if we seek to “add” rather than eliminate (ie set ourselves an “approach” goal rather than an “avoidance” goal). Supporting Mary to practise some active “letting go” , asking for help, learning to ease up on how much she could get done in a day, and to find new hobbies that are more about experiences and being rather than achievements all helped to create some small shifts. And my athlete pulled back from competitions for a period of time to study and have more time with friends. When she returned, her form and performance were better than ever. If you have too much grit, I hope reading this gives you permission to gently check in with yourself (and maybe others). Is this useful for me? When is it not? What else could I do instead? And what other strategies might I learn that enhance my wellbeing rather than deplete it? Interested in how “gritty” you are?

Lukaku angered Tuchel by going public with his frustrations with life at Chelsea and saying he would like to return to Internazionale one day. It is understood that the Belgianwill be left out of the matchday squad entirely against Liverpool.
Tuchel has not hidden his displeasure with Lukaku’s comments, which were aired in an unauthorised interview with Sky Italia on Thursday night, and it is understood he remains “livid” with Chelsea’s record signing. The German has held talks with Lukaku, who left Inter for £97.5m last summer, but he could yet decide to take disciplinary action. Chelsea were caught unawares when Lukaku’s remarks about his difficulties adapting to Tuchel’s system were published. The interview is understood to have taken place three weeks ago and was intended to help Lukaku build bridges with Inter fans, but it ended up causing unrest at Stamford Bridge. The club are likely to back Tuchel if he punishes Lukaku, though the manager could settle on fining the forward rather than in effect giving him a one-game ban. It is a huge gamble for Tuchel to drop Lukaku. Chelsea are 11 points behind Manchester City and need to beat Liverpool to stay in the title race. Kai Havertz is a contender to start up front in place of Lukaku. In a press conference for Sunday’s game Tuchel said that were it not for injuries and Covid‑19, Chelsea would be much closer to Manchester City in the Premier League title race and said they “will not stop trying” to hunt down Pep Guardiola’s side between now and the end of the season.
Chelsea have won one of their past four league games, with the latest setback being Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Brighton, when Danny Welbeck rescued a point for the visitors at Stamford Bridge with an injury-time header. On the same evening, City made it 10 league victories in a row with a 1-0 triumph at Brentford, extending that run with a 2-1 win against Arsenal on New Year’s Day. Tuchel says competing with rivals who have turned themselves into a “winning machine” in recent years is proving difficult. Nonetheless, he is adamant Chelsea have what it takes and are only being hampered by a lack of personnel. Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva, N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Ruben Loftus‑Cheek have been out with injury in recent weeks while Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic have been unavailable for selection having tested positive for Covid. There were more setbacks against Brighton when Reece James sustained a suspected torn hamstring that rules him out of Sunday’s encounter with Liverpool, while Andreas Christensen suffered a back strain that makes him a doubt for the same game. “When you look at 2021 [overall], we are 20 points behind and you have to be careful that you’re not over-ambitious and don’t get frustrated by not catching them,” said Tuchel of City. “They know what it takes to produce high-point seasons over and over again. It’s quality all over the club. It’s a machine, a winning machine.
“Maybe it’s a longer race than one season to catch Man City because they will not stop improving. But the huge difference at this moment is with injuries and Covid. I am absolutely convinced that if we are in the same place without having key players out for weeks we [would have] more points and be in the back of them [City]. “That’s why there’s no need to get negative, no need to lose faith. The opposite – we will stay hungry. We will not stop trying.” Tuchel said this period of his tenure as Chelsea manager – the first anniversary of which is this month – has been challenging but, overall, he remains in good spirits, seen most clearly when he was asked who he thinks most people in Germany will want to win when he and Jurgen Klopp go head-to-head. “If you have a full stadium and put Jürgen in it, he could arrive without a team and it would still be full with people laughing for two hours,” Tuchel said with a smile. “That’s his gift, that’s what makes him special. I cannot do it. I will never try.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-will-not-stop-trying-to-hunt-down-manchester-city;sports
5897;5897;5897;1616;5969;5969;A wounded PM and ailing economy force England to ‘go Swedish’ on Covid | Larry Elliott;2022-01-02;['Larry Elliott'];['Business', 'Economics', 'Coronavirus', 'Economic policy', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'NHS'];"Government policy towards Covid-19 has come full circle. For now, at least, England has returned to the Swedish way of dealing with the pandemic. Tough, officially imposed lockdowns are out. Trusting the people to do the sensible thing is back in. Whether this approach will survive the expected surge in hospitalisations from Christmas and New Year revelries remains to be seen. Boris Johnson is the master of the screeching U-turn and with the number of infections hitting new records pressure on Downing Street to act is growing. We have been here before. Back in the early days of the pandemic the prime minister was minded to copy Sweden, a country that imposed few restrictions and decided early on that it needed to learn to live with the virus.
The prime minister’s flirtation with the “Swedish experiment” was brief, and at the end of March 2020 a draconian lockdown was imposed. Ministers knew this would have a dire impact on the economy but felt the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed left them no choice. A paper published in the online journal Scientific Reports last year examined what would have happened had Britain followed the Swedish approach. Even assuming the public here would have been as willing to adhere to non-mandatory recommendations as the Swedes (a pretty big assumption) the UK death rate would have at least doubled. This time, the decision is a lot less clearcut, not least because vaccines are providing protection from the virus. The news from South Africa, one of the countries where Omicron first surfaced, has also been encouraging. While more transmissible, the new variant has resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths. Case numbers, after rising rapidly, have started to decline. A degree of caution is needed when comparing the two countries, because South Africa has a much younger population than Britain, and it is summer rather than the middle of winter there. Even so, it is clear the government has set a high bar for imposing further restrictions. The prime minister’s weakened political position is one reason the government has gone Swedish. The risk of causing serious damage to the economy when it is looking particularly vulnerable is another, because this is going to be a tough year for the British public. Inflation is rising, interest rates are going up, and energy bills are expected to rocket in the spring just as Rishi Sunak’s increase in national insurance contributions comes into force. The cumulative effect is a whopping cut to living standards. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank the average household is going to be £1,000 a year worse off. Those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit by soaring gas and electricity bills. In the circumstances, it is easy to see why the government is reluctant to add to the economic pain by imposing tougher restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. Fresh curbs mean slower growth and a hit to the public finances. They would also test the resilience of the labour market. The Swedes came in for a lot of criticism for their go-it-alone approach. While death rates were much lower than the initial pessimistic forecasts, they were still higher than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries, where tough restrictions were imposed. Moreover, the initial hit to the economy was as severe in liberal Sweden as it was in locked-down Denmark. That said, as the second anniversary of Covid’s arrival looms, governments are beginning to see merits in the Swedish approach. In part, that’s because Sweden now has a lower death rate than countries that went down the full lockdown route, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy. It is in the bottom half of the EU league table for deaths once the size of population is taken into account. Economic recovery has been pretty brisk. The UK is still struggling to get back to pre-Covid levels of output: Sweden had managed that by the middle of 2021. But there are other factors, too. Sweden has avoided the problem of lockdown fatigue and has not caused damage to the life chances of its children because schools were kept open for under-16s throughout the pandemic.
All of which suggests the Scientific Reports paper will not be the last word on the Swedish experiment. There have been precious few upsides to the pandemic but one of them is that it has thrown up rich country-by-country data for academics from all disciplines – epidemiologists, economists, educationalists, sociologists – to examine and argue about. Even within countries different approaches have been tried. The four constituent nations of the UK have exercised their own powers, so it should soon be possible to assess the impact of closing nightclubs in Scotland and Wales, but not in England, for New Year’s Eve. EU countries have varied in their approach, while the US provides 50 states to study. What is clear is that no one country got everything right and all made mistakes, unsurprisingly enough given they weren’t expecting a global pandemic. It is also obvious, as time passes, that governments – be they in London, Edinburgh, Rome or Paris – are only tightening restrictions with reluctance. In a way, that’s a backhanded compliment to the Swedes for perhaps being on to something right from the start. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. While Sweden kept schools open for under-16s throughout the pandemic, upper secondary schools for older students underwent periods of closure.

5929;5929;5929;1648;6001;6001;Licorice Pizza – Paul Thomas Anderson’s joyously nostalgic coming-of-age tale;2022-01-02;['Mark Kermode'];['Drama films', 'Film', 'Paul Thomas Anderson', 'Haim', 'Culture', 'John C Reilly', 'Bradley Cooper'];"There’s something propulsively intoxicating about the films of Paul Thomas Anderson. Watching Punch-Drunk Love left me in exactly the state described by the title; Inherent Vice demanded to be inhaled rather than watched; I wanted to wrap myself in the poisonous couture of Phantom Thread. Anderson’s latest takes its title from a hip record store (reportedly named after an Abbott and Costello gag), and appropriately enough the result spun me round like a record. This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucas’s American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge. Screen newcomer Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) is Gary Valentine, a high-schooler with a Brian Wilson haircut who’s also a child actor and go-getting entrepreneur. “Where are your parents while all this is happening?” asks Alana (musician and feature first-timer Alana Haim), the twentysomething Gary meets when she’s working as an assistant to the school photographer, and whom he declares to be “the girl I’m going to marry one day”, despite her insistence that “we are not boyfriend and girlfriend”. When Gary needs a chaperone to accompany him to a New York TV special, Alana (upon whose expressively reactive face the movie rests) goes along for the ride, only to fall for his fantastically smug co-star Lance (Skyler Gisondo). But Gary has his sights set on higher things – a waterbed business (“liquid luxury for you!”) in which Alana becomes his partner, keeping them together even as she insists that they will never be “together”.
Partly inspired by the early-life adventures of film and TV producer Gary Goetzman, Licorice Pizza pinballs between seemingly random episodes, taking us from a teenage fair (where John C Reilly cameos as Herman Munster) to the Encino hills via fiery motorcycle stunts with movie stars (Sean Penn as a William Holden-esque screen veteran) and close calls with police and politicians (Benny Safdie as mayoral hopeful Joel Wachs) – all played out against the end-of-days background noise of the Opec oil crisis. There’s also a completely unhinged encounter with Jon Peters, the hairdresser turned producer whom Bradley Cooper plays as a wild-eyed cross between Charles Manson and Hart Bochner’s sleazy executive from Die Hard. Bizarrely, what begins as a reprise of the drug-crazed Alfred Molina scene from Boogie Nights mutates unexpectedly into an LA-bound remake of The Wages of Fear, with kids instead of dynamite as the truck’s volatile cargo. What keeps it all grounded is the fact that, in the midst of all this madness, our central odd couple remain entirely believable. From the strangely infantalising hubbub of Alana’s family (played by Haim’s real-life relatives) to Gary’s peculiar half-man/half-boy existence, Licorice Pizza makes us accept a relationship that has something of the dysfunctional charm of Hal Ashby’s Harold and Maude. As for the eclectic jukebox soundtrack, in which tunes such as the Chico Hamilton Quintet’s Blue Sands play contrapuntally across tone-shifting scenes, that put me in mind of Ashby’s other masterpiece, Coming Home. “Do you think it’s weird that I hang out with Gary and his friends all the time?” Alana asks in a moment of blazed reflection, wondering how she wound up with a bunch of 15-year-olds. “It’s whatever you think it is,” comes the reply – and it’s a credit to the movie that we tend to agree. Elsewhere, there’s a divisively absurdist turn by John Michael Higgins as the proprietor of a Japanese restaurant, whose language skills extend only to a pantomime accent, and a killer appearance by Harriet Sansom Harris as agent Mary Grady, who tells Alana: “You remind me of an English pit-bull dog, with sex appeal and a very Jewish nose.” But this is Gary and Alana’s movie, and it’s them that we will remember: his open-faced smile; her left-handed scowl; the giddy way they run through streets together. “How did we survive?” asks Gary after one particularly reckless episode, a question most of us have surely asked ourselves. Like all the best evocations of times past, Licorice Pizza has no answers – only an enraptured sense of awe that makes Anderson’s joyous film feel like a very personal memory.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/02/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-andersons-joyously-nostalgic-coming-of-age-tale;entertainment and culture
5933;5933;5933;1652;6005;6005;Keir Starmer is making headway, but has he got enough to worry the Tories? | Anne McElvoy;2022-01-02;['Anne McElvoy'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Olaf Scholz', 'World news', 'Boris Johnson'];"If champagne socialism did not have such a bad rap, there should be a decent bottle or two open at Keir Starmer’s place this new year weekend. The party has its first consistent lead over the Conservatives: a seven-point advantage of the kind it requires to turn Labour’s doldrums into territory where it could conceivably claw back an election win from the long-running disaster movie. (The opposition was last in power when Eminem was topping the chart.) To his credit, Starmer has held his nerve in a gruelling house clean after the Corbyn era. Yes, there are still strong far left redoubts in Young Labour and the trade union movement, but the leadership has in essence won a battle to rebalance key roles. Indeed, a revivified Team Keir looks like a centrist revival. Rachel Reeves is an assiduous shadow chancellor who can test Rishi Sunak’s pain threshold this year as concerns over cost of living and failings by the government to offset energy price hikes deepen economic anxieties. Lisa Nandy is finally in the right job, taking on Michael Gove’s defence of the red wall seats in the elusive “levelling-up” agenda, and Yvette Cooper back to the big screen as a formidable cross-examiner of Priti Patel in home affairs. With fresh blood to public service briefs in Wes Streeting at health and Bridget Phillipson, as one of the front bench’s breakthrough talents, at education, Starmer is well placed to portray his party as ready to do more than carp at the failings of a stressed government. “More people have more doubts about the Tories,” says a message-bearer. “That gives us the chance to start to talk about the alternative and get a hearing.” A Starmer speech promising “security, prosperity and respect” is also intended to offset the impression of being the concerned-but-miserable party.
Opposition is about opportunity seized and the Tories have handed Labour a generous bunch of year-end disasters. Revelations of vast carelessness in No 10 about the wisdom of holding parties at the outer edge of the Covid rules, to put it generously, to anticipated strong personal criticism of Johnson’s conduct over loans to refurbish his living quarters when (another) report by Lord Geidt emerges in the next week or so remind us of the omni-mess. Add a byelection defeat in Shropshire of epochal proportions and Labour has clearly gained possession of the political ball by dint of government misjudgements. There are, however, some angostura bitters in this mix. Not to put too fine a point on it, Tories do not fear Keir and until they have reason to do so, Labour’s paper gains and more positive polling will remain unconsolidated. Why might this be? Speaking to Starmer advocates in his inner team, the dominant analysis is that Labour has earned the “right to be heard” in recent weeks: an opening in the public mind to arguments that previously seemed irrelevant. Pollsters for both parties conclude that many Johnson assets have turned sour, flipping into incomprehension or distaste. “It’s a bit like looking at the date you thought was incredibly sexy and great fun when you were 16,” observes one Starmerite. “The things that attracted you to them most are the aspects that in a different light can make you really dislike them later.” Yet to torture the metaphor, the electorate has to date someone and simply finding Johnson to be more peroxide than blond will not necessarily do it for his challenger. Starmer is seen as “decent” (not a Johnson asset) and reliable (ditto). The flipside is he can come across as a bit dull. In contrast to the leader he replaced after the Corbyn rout in 2019, there is something wavering in Starmer’s self-presentation that makes it hard for the public to “get” him . The “old” Starmer, a leftish student activist, is happiest empathising with the afflicted and the “crying injustices” of economic inequality. “New” Starmer needs momentum and some sense of va-va-voom. Crucially, the Starmer creed is gaining apostles. Peter Kyle, one of the veterans of the last Labour government re-establishing themselves as forces in the party, put it well in an interview with the Financial Times last week outlining tactical opportunities and the biggest outstanding task: “Our challenge is to light the fire.” In the coming year, which may well be the last before a general election (Brenda from Bristol’s “not another one” horror at early elections is not shared by the government, which is happiest on a war footing), the tactical question Kyle highlights is how broadly Labour should embrace a “progressive alliance” with the Lib Dems in England. Cautiously, would be my advice. Starmer has chosen well so far in terms of keeping out of marshy deal territory with the SNP over the prospect of another referendum in Scotland, not least because that opens a lot of questions that swing English voters would get exercised about. Also, the route to breaking up the union is not promising for Labour. Added to which, a volatile electorate is one to handle with care in trying to steer progressive choices at the ballot box. Standing down in unwinnable seats can have the opposite effect, leaving voters feeling “pre-owned” and surly. (It is also not much fun for candidates running a Potemkin race when resources are being syphoned elsewhere shadow cabinet booster visits are diverted.) So yes to being smart about cooperation when it comes to allocating resources in marginal seats, but the question for tacticians will be how widely this recipe can be applied. Perhaps another reason Conservatives, while rattled at Johnson’s errors, still find it hard to get too worried about Starmer is that he sits at times uneasily between the Blairite legacy and something vaguely to the left of Blair, while eschewing the excesses and economic irrationalities of Corbynism. This is a narrow path to tread and for mere humans outside the sectarian culture of Labour membership such gradations are more puzzling than enlightening. If Starmer is (rightly) channelling competence and pragmatism as core virtues, it muddies the waters when he defines his views on private sector involvement in the NHS by citing his dying mother making him promise his father would not “go private”.
I have no doubt this story is true and deeply felt, but that does not make it a shrewd one to deploy. Emotional stories are strong meat in politics, because they are seen to channel the strongest drives of politicians. It sounded either like a signal of a coming clampdown on private healthcare or a bit of a Dickensian throwback. In truth, large swaths of the NHS are already a public-private mix. The intention was vague and that is always dangerous for an opposition leader seeing to acquire a clearer profile. I doubt that Starmer would, for instance, intervene in the operations of outfits such as Totally Healthcare, which delivers out-of-hospital services (physio, podiatry and the like) and provides logistics to reduce waiting times to NHS trusts with no obvious downside. The popularity of out-of-hours GP services via apps or online services such as Babylon suggests a lot of the public are less than zealous about public-private demarcations. One way or the other, health and social care need core improvements in funding and efficiencies and a re-moralised and better trained and managed workforce. Better to start with the pressing issues than embark on a phoney war. More broadly, Britain’s place in the world should be fertile territory for the opposition. Bluntly, Starmer has a negligible profile abroad. (I am frequently reminded to explain who he is when being interviewed on British politics in Germany.) But centre-left revivals in the US and Germany are also an opportunity to return Labour to the global conversation. The revival of a declined centre-left party after years in the wilderness is encouragement for Starmer, given that Olaf Scholz too started out as a lawyer representing trade unions and has also adopted the “respect” theme to win over voters in depressed heartlands. He has shown that a quiet style, self-discipline and weaving coalitions of interest along with canny strategising can pay dividends. Whether dealing with the Ukraine crisis, the handling of Poland’s challenge to EU pluralist norms or how far to ally with the US under an increasingly inward-looking presidency without Britain’s Nato weight being taken for granted, Labour needs to sound like it can return to the top table of defence and security with public trust – hence the upbeat message to the armed forces and upbeat take on post-Brexit possibilities. The weakest areas for the Starmerism recipe are what it means for industrial strategy, beyond outbidding a likely pouring of Tory largesse into left-behind areas, and the quest for an economic and business strategy that can plausibly claim to cut through a muddle of post-Covid, post-Brexit schemes and sound like a solid prospect for a country that is bruised, but seeking resilience. To Starmer’s credit, he took on the job in awful circumstances and is now clear of the risks of leadership challenge. Labour’s prospects for power are still a work in progress, but are no longer a pipe dream. And if the Tories do not yet fear Starmer, they have started to notice he is around. In the long haul of opposition, that’s a small leap forwards. • Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/keir-starmer-gaining-traction-has-he-got-enough-to-trouble-tories;politics
5944;5944;5944;1663;6016;6016;New studies reinforce belief that Omicron is less likely to damage lungs;2022-01-02;['James Tapper'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Microbiology'];"A growing body of evidence indicates that the Omicron Covid variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Six studies – four published since Christmas Eve – have found that Omicron does not damage people’s lungs as much as the Delta and other previous variants of Covid. The studies have yet to be peer-reviewed by other scientists. “The result of all the mutations that make Omicron different from previous variants is that it may have altered its ability to infect different sorts of cells,” said Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at University College London. “In essence, it looks to be more able to infect the upper respiratory tract – cells in the throat. So it would multiply in cells there more readily than in cells deep in the lung. This is really preliminary but the studies point in the same direction.” If the virus replicates more in the throat, that makes it more transmissible, which would help to explain the rapid spread of Omicron. A virus that is good at infecting lung tissue, on the other hand, will be potentially more dangerous but less transmissible. Researchers from the University of Liverpool’s Molecular Virology Research Group published a pre-print on Boxing Day that shows Omicron leading to “less severe disease” in mice, according to Prof James Stewart. The paper showed that mice infected with Omicron lose less weight, have lower viral loads and experience less- severe pneumonia. “It’s one piece of the jigsaw,” he said. “The animal model does suggest that the disease is less severe than Delta and the original Wuhan virus. It seems to get cleared faster and the animals recovered more rapidly, and that ties in with clinical data coming through. “The early indications are that it’s good news, but that’s not a signal to drop our guard, because if you’re clinically vulnerable, the consequences are still not great – there are deaths from Omicron. Not everyone can rip their masks off and party.” The Neyts Lab at Leuven University in Belgium found similar results in Syrian hamsters, with a lower viral load in the lungs compared with other variants. Prof Johan Neyts said this may be because the virus was better at infecting humans than hamsters, or that it was more likely to infect the upper respiratory tract, or that it provoked less-severe disease.
A further pre-print, submitted to Nature last week by researchers in the US, also found that mice with Omicron lost less weight and had a lower viral load. And researchers at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research have found evidence that Omicron has changed the way it enters the body. Omicron was substantially likely to evade the immunity of people who had had two doses of the vaccine, but a booster dose gave a “partial restoration of immunity”. The slew of Christmas research builds on a study from the University of Hong Kong last month showing less Omicron infection in the lungs, and on research led by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge, whose team investigated blood samples from vaccinated patients. They found Omicron able to evade vaccines, but less able to enter lung cells. The latest scientific research comes amid a debate about how best to carry out home-testing. Last week, some scientists suggested that lateral flow tests (LFTs) might be more accurate if people took swabs from the throat as well as the nose. Prof Jennifer Rohn at University College London said that her experience of using LFTs was that she had tested negative using nose swabs but positive when taking a sample from her throat. That seemed to be supported by a study from South Africa showing that saliva samples subjected to PCR tests were better than nasal swabs at detecting Omicron. However, Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said the study was not significant enough for conclusions to be drawn. “This is a small study on acutely symptomatic, non-hospitalised patients. On the one hand it confirms previous studies indicating that salivary testing could be useful as a more easily performed sampling approach. I don’t think this study is significant enough to conclude anything about the behaviour of Omicron.” The UK Health Security Agency said there was no indication that rapid tests differed in their ability to detect the Omicron or Delta variants, although the tests were continuously monitored by researchers. “All lateral flow devices used by NHS Test and Trace have gone through rigorous validation and are proven to be highly effective at detecting Covid-19 in people,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently seeing high numbers of positive lateral flow device tests reported. This means we are detecting tens of thousands of cases that might otherwise have gone undetected.” • This article was amended on 3 January 2022 because an earlier version said: “If the virus produces more cells in the throat, that makes it more transmissible ...”.

Try these non-alcoholic drinks;2022-01-02;['David Williams'];['Wine', 'Food', 'Life and style'];"Guinness, 0.0%, from £4, 4x440ml can, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons There are two ways to approach a month off the sauce, as many of us have vowed to do this January. Either you go for non-alcoholic drinks that are their own thing, and always have been (of which more below). Or you can adapt what I like to think of as the Linda McCartney model: weaning yourself off your favourites with a clever simulacrum that doesn’t contain the substance (animal products for Linda; alcohol for you) you’re trying to avoid. As someone who would happily own up to being vegan-curious but not quite ready to move beyond flexitarian status, I’ve eaten my share of Quorn sausages, beetroot-blood burgers and fake chicken schnitzel- type things, and I’m impressed by just how far they’ve developed in the past couple of years. Realistic booze substitutes have moved on, too, with the choice now extending far beyond the lonely bottle of Clausthaler (itself much better than it was), and with the latest big brand 0.0% contender from Guinness coming extremely, satisfyingly close to the real thing. La Gioiosa Italian Sparkling White, 0.0% £5, 75cl, Morrisons Other convincing low-alcohol beers that I’ve found can fill in a flavoury gap without the alcohol include Estrella’s crisply refreshing Spanish lager Free Damm (from £4.50, 6x330ml, Sainsbury’s Morrisons and others) and two IPAs: Connecticut-basedzero-alcohol specialist craft brewer Athletic Brewing Co’s citrussy, balanced IPA (£10.99, 6x355ml, uk.athleticbrewing.com) and East Anglian brewer Adnams’s 0.5% version of its trusty Ghost Ship (£10.99, 8x500ml bottle, adnams.co.uk). What all four beers I’ve mentioned here (and other top-notch no-alcohol brews)get right are the richness of texture and depth of flavour : there’s nothing watery about them. This is something winemakers haven’t managed to achieve just yet. The best wines are low-alcohol (with around 7-9% abv)rather than no alcohol. The most drinkable zero-alcohol wines make up the textural shortfall with sugar and bubbles, so the sweetly fizzy end result of a wine, such as La Gioisa’s, is more fizzy pop than prosecco-alike. LA Brewery Strawberry & Black Pepper Kombucha, £35, 12x300ml, LA Brewery The most common advice that vegan chefs proffer to people making the switch to a plant-only diet (as, again, so many of us are doing for what I suppose I’m going to have to call ‘veganuary’ this year) is to try to break away from meat-centred thinking – don’t treat vegan cuisine as coping with something missing; think of it as an opportunity to celebrate all the many and diverse ingredients found beyond the meat counter. And of course, you can take the same approach to going alcohol-free. Admittedly, this is easier to achieve online: outside big urban centres, pubs and restaurants still rely on standard sweet fizzy drinks or mineral water as alcohol-free alternatives. Still, it would be hard I think, for any palate used to the complexity of the best alcoholic drinks to feel they were missing out if they were offered something as deliciously sweet-sour-spicy as the strawberry and black pepper kombucha (fermented tea) of Suffolk’s LA Brewery.

His FedEx executive, Chuck, is stranded on a desert island in the remote Pacific Ocean after his cargo plane crashes, with only a volleyball for company (which he names Wilson and personalises with a bloody handprint for a face). Chuck’s initial mishaps and despair give way to practicality and acceptance – the seven stages of grief, in effect – all orchestrated deftly by Zemeckis.

5969;5969;5969;1688;6041;6041;6m UK homes may be unable to pay energy bills after price hike, charity warns;2022-01-01;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Fuel poverty', 'Energy bills', 'Poverty', 'Society', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money', 'Ed Miliband', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Gas', 'Business', 'Commodities', 'Politics', 'Social exclusion', 'Energy industry'];The number of UK households living in fuel poverty could climb to the highest level on record by this spring unless the government moves to soften the blow of a looming record high energy bill hike, according to a fuel poverty charity. Around 4 million homes in the UK were already classed as fuel poor before a surge in global energy market prices triggered one of the steepest ever energy bill hikes in October, but campaigners are braced for a record increase in the numbers unable to pay their energy bills following another hike this spring. The charity National Energy Action warned that the double blow to household bills could cause at least 2 million more homes to slip into fuel poverty compared with the start of 2021, taking the total to 6 million households. This would be the highest level of fuel poverty across the UK since records began in 1996. The looming energy price hike has not yet been finalised by the regulator but Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action, told the Observer that the number of households in fuel poverty would “skyrocket” in April. This is expected to deepen the UK’s national energy crisis and compound the “year of the squeeze”, predicted by the Resolution Foundation last week, which threatens to trigger a “cost of living catastrophe” for hard-pressed families. Households are already paying record prices to put petrol in their cars, and can expect the cost of consumer goods to rocket as fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions take their toll on major companies. “Those on lowest incomes and in less-efficient homes will not just face financial hardship but intolerable living conditions, ill health and, for too many, a shortened life,” Scorer said. “This is not just conjecture. It will happen and we’ve had enough time to see it coming and act.” Energy market prices climbed steadily over 2021 before leaping to record highs in October and fresh record highs in December. The market rally has fuelled one of the steepest energy price hikes in the history of the UK’s liberalised energy market. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said: “Working people are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, food costs increase and the weekly budget stretched. The government must take urgent action to support those people struggling to pay bills.” Senior officials from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Treasury and No 10 have met with the industry regulator, Ofgem, and executives from the UK’s biggest energy suppliers in recent weeks to thrash out a plan to avert the looming national energy crisis. No measures have so far been agreed, and further meetings are scheduled for this week. The government’s energy price cap could allow the average energy bill to rocket further to almost £2,000 a year when it is reset in April, from £1,138 in the previous year, to help cover the cost of dozens of failed energy suppliers, according to industry experts. Labour has called for VAT on energy bills to be cut as a first step to help every household this winter, and the party would also “ramp up ambition with our plan to retrofit 19 million homes” to make them more energy efficient and help bring down household bills. “It is a moral and social scandal that fuel poverty exists in modern Britain. But with national leadership, we can beat it – and ensure everyone has the warm, secure home they deserve,” Miliband added. A government spokesperson said protecting consumers was its “top priority” which is why it was keeping in place the energy price cap, alongside schemes such as the £500m household support fund, the warm home discount, winter fuel payments for over-65s and cold weather payments. Meanwhile several Conservative politicians have written to the prime minister, urging him to scrap taxes on rapidly rising energy bills. About 20 Tory MPs and peers have written in the Sunday Telegraph asking for help for consumers facing fuel poverty, including Craig Mackinlay, chair of the net zero scrutiny group of Conservative MPs, former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, and MPs Robert Halfon and Steve Baker. They argue that high energy prices “are felt most painfully by the lowest paid” and suggest VAT on energy bills and environmental levies which fund renewable energy schemes.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/01/6m-homes-uk-pay-energy-bills-price-hike-fuel-poverty;business and economy
5990;5990;5990;1709;6062;6062;‘Different from’ is correct and ‘iconic’ is meaningless: what I know after two decades as a subeditor | Susan McDonald;2022-01-01;['Susan McDonald'];['Language'];"After more than two decades as a subeditor, I know language is alchemy and there’s no exact prescription for good writing. But I also know grammar is central. Meaning can turn on a single word or punctuation mark and a little fine-tuning can prevent ambiguity and inconsistency. Just read this sentence and tell me grammar doesn’t matter: After being whipped fiercely, the cook boiled the egg. Almost everyone has a grammatical pet peeve, and commas attract a lot of attention. When they’re needed, they’re essential – compare “I’m sorry I love you” and “I’m sorry, I love you”. But haphazard or unwarranted commas can be distracting and even misleading. Jonathan Franzen wrote a whole essay on the “irritating, lazy mannerism” of comma-then, as in: “He dims the lamp and opens the window, then pulls the body inside.” I sympathise but I’m personally more irritated by comma-but and comma-too.
The Guardian style guide is clear on the Oxford comma (comma-and in a list); it’s definitely not needed in “he ate ham, eggs and chips”, although an essential distinction between these two sentences: I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling. I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling. But I give punctuation champion Lynne Truss the last word: “Don’t use commas like a stupid person. I mean it.” On non-comma matters, F Scott Fitzgerald thought the exclamation mark was “like laughing at your own joke” and should be done away with, and Milan Kundera claimed he once left a publisher for trying to change his semicolons to full-stops. (I’m a big fan of the semicolon; it encourages the reader to linger a little longer on the thought before it.) And Proust cringed at cliches: “It’s quite true that the sun is on fire at sunset, but it’s been said too often.” Some of my personal bugbears come up more regularly than others. “Compared to” is different from “compared with”. Use the first if you want to liken one thing to another, the second to contrast. And that reminds me: in my book “different from” is correct, “different to” and “different than” are not. “Who” and “whom” are both needed but not interchangeable. The same goes for less/fewer, like/such as and imply/infer. And there’s a simple rule for “that” v “which”: if the sentence needs the (restrictive) clause the word is connecting it to, use “that”, otherwise use “which”. (Some of the grammarati point to an irregular restrictive “which” that can replace “that” but I’m yet to be convinced.) If all of this sounds like so much nerdy nitpicking, I concede some arcane rules are just begging to be bent, although I would still argue you have to have a good reason. The Guardian says it’s fine to split infinitives because “stubbornly to resist so can sound pompous and awkward”. Ditto on ending a sentence with a preposition. And while strictly plural, “data” can take a singular verb, as in “data shows”, because how often do you come across “datum” anyway? Common sense should come into it, and so too aesthetics. Think of how the prose flows. If a sentence is long and inelegant, change it. Sometimes I use an en dash or even parentheses to break up a string of commas. And don’t dangle a verb at the end of the sentence, far from its subject. “How high will emissions from the project proposed for the northern region and the existing plants in the south and west be?” is just ungainly.
Words should sound right too. If you’re torn over whether the possessive of James takes a second S after the apostrophe – James’s – say it out loud. To quote Joan Didion, grammar is “a piano played by ear”. Some words have lost their meaning from overuse. I once edited out three appearances of “iconic” on a single day; “unforgettable”, “infamous” and “emblematic” stepped in admirably. Others become unusable if they’re loaded with an agenda. Politicisation is dangerous. As Orwell said: “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Language matters. It matters how laws and treaties are written, and whether coal is “phased out” or “phased down”. It matters that news is truthful and that literature inspires. Language reflects – and can even define – who we are. So a little respect, please, for its rules. • Susan McDonald is a news producer for Guardian Australia and a freelance writer";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/01/different-from-is-correct-and-iconic-is-meaningless-what-i-know-after-two-decades-as-a-subeditor;entertainment and culture
5993;5993;5993;1712;6065;6065;Dan Reeves, who coached four NFL teams to Super Bowl, dies aged 77;2022-01-01;['N/A'];['NFL', 'Dallas Cowboys', 'Denver Broncos', 'Atlanta Falcons', 'New York Giants', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"Dan Reeves, who won a Super Bowl as a player with the Dallas Cowboys but was best known for a long coaching career that included four blowout losses in the title game with the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons, died Saturday. He was 77. A statement released by his family through former Falcons media relations director Aaron Salkin said Reeves died of complications from dementia. The statement said he died “peacefully and surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta”.
“His legacy will continue through his many friends, players and fans as well as the rest of the NFL community,” the family said. Reeves was a versatile player who played a key role in the Cowboys becoming an NFL powerhouse in the 1960s under Tom Landry, but his own coaching career – stretching over three teams and 23 seasons – is where he truly left his mark on the league. Including a stint with the New York Giants, Reeves totaled 190 coaching victories – the ninth-most in NFL history. But he was never able to win the biggest game of all, going 0-4 in the Super Bowl, each of them by double-digit margins. Reeves, Marv Levy and Bud Grant are the only coaches to lose four times in the Super Bowl. “Dan Reeves leaves a lasting legacy in our game as a player and coach,” said Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who fired Reeves from his final job in 2003. “His track record of success in Dallas, Denver, New York and Atlanta over several decades speaks for itself, marking a long and successful life and career in football.” Just 37 when he took over as coach of the Broncos in 1981, Reeves acquired quarterback John Elway in a trade and built a team that made three Super Bowl appearances, earned six trips to the playoffs and won five AFC West titles over his 12-year tenure. But Denver never won an NFL title under Reeves, losing 39-20 to the Giants in the 1987 Super Bowl, 42-10 to Washington in 1988 and 55-10 to the San Francisco 49ers in 1990 – still the most lopsided loss in the game’s history. Despite those defeats and a bitter parting after the 1992 season, Reeves is remembered fondly in Denver, where the Broncos inducted him into their Ring of Honor in 2014.
“Coach Reeves set the foundation for the Broncos’ decade of dominance in the 1980s and championship tradition for years to come,” the team said in a statement. “Reeves coached the Broncos with integrity, character and toughness along with sincere appreciation for his players and coaches.” After a falling out with Elway and allegations that the star quarterback had colluded with then-offensive coordinator (and eventual head coach) Mike Shanahan to force a change, Reeves was fired by the Broncos. He took over the Giants in 1993 and led the team to the playoffs in his first season, but that would be his only postseason appearance in New York. He was fired after four seasons but quickly caught on in 1997 with the Falcons, a homecoming of sorts for the Georgia native. In just his second season with a franchise that had experienced little success, Reeves guided a team known as the ‘Dirty Birds’ to a 14-2 record in the regular season and their first trip to the Super Bowl. After Reeves underwent emergency heart surgery, the Falcons beat the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in an overtime thriller at the Metrodome to claim the NFC championship, prompting the coach to attempt the arm-flapping dance that star running back Jamal Anderson and other players had made the team’s trademark. “My guy!” Anderson wrote on Twitter. “I am going to miss DR, a first class human, and a most excellent coach. My thoughts and prayers are with (his wife) Pam, his family. A family man first. Respect & love, RIP Coach Reeves!” Reeves again came up short of a championship, losing to Shanahan, Elway and the Broncos 34-19. Reeves engineered a trade that brought Michael Vick to the Falcons and made his final playoff appearance in 2002, when Atlanta became the first road team to win a playoff game in Green Bay. But Vick was injured during the 2003 preseason, and Reeves was fired after the team won just three of its first 13 games. He ended his coaching career – and 39 uninterrupted years in the NFL – with a record of 190-165-2.
Reeves remained in Atlanta after his retirement, most notably serving as an adviser to Georgia State when it launched a football program that now plays in the Sun Belt Conference. Daniel Edward Reeves was born in Rome, Georgia, but grew up in the Americus, in the southwestern part of the state, where he played football, basketball and baseball in high school.
Reeves attended college at South Carolina, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback from 1962-64 and also played baseball for the Gamecocks. Better known as a runner than a passer, Reeves was not drafted after college. He signed a free-agent deal with the Cowboys, who initially wanted him to play safety but wound up moving him to running back. Reeves emerged as one of the team’s key players just as the Cowboys were establishing themselves as the successful franchise that would become known as ‘America’s Team’. He started all 14 games at halfback in 1966, leading the Cowboys in rushing with 757 yards and eight touchdowns. Dallas made its first playoff appearance but lost to the Green Bay Packers in a 34-27 shootout for the NFL championship, missing a chance to play in the first Super Bowl. The following season, Reeves rushed for 603 yards and five TDs, again starting every game, as the Cowboys made another run to the playoffs. Again, they were thwarted by Green Bay one win shy of the Super Bowl, losing to the Packers on a touchdown in the closing seconds of the famed ‘Ice Bowl’ game at frigid Lambeau Field. A knee injury in 1968 limited his effectiveness, and Reeves played only a limited role the rest of his career. But Landry recognized his abilities off the field, asking Reeves to serve as a player-coach while runner such as Duane Thomas and Calvin Hill took on more prominent backfield roles. The Cowboys made their first Super Bowl during the 1970 season, losing to the Baltimore Colts on a last-second field goal, but finally won the championship the following year with a 24-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Reeves retired as a player after the 1972 season, becoming a full-time assistant on Landry’s staff. As a head coach, Reeves was known for his gruff, no-nonsense approach and an offensive philosophy that favored a physical running game. But he also coached two of the game’s most dynamic offensive players, Vick and Elway, defying those who labeled him as old-fashioned. With his distinctive Southern drawl, Reeves could be honest to a fault, such as when he spoke openly of the rift that led to his departure in Denver – and opened up a lot of old wounds – during the lead-up to the Falcons facing the Broncos in the 1999 Super Bowl. “There’s still a lot of hurt that won’t ever go away,” Reeves said. “You never will forget those things.” But Reeves rarely held grudges, even with members of the media that he had clashed with. In his later years, he would gladly take phone calls to discuss the issues of the day, once joking when a reporter identified himself, “OK, what did I do wrong now?” Reeves is survived by wife Pam, his high school sweetheart; children Dana, Lee and Laura; as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Funeral arrangements have yet to be announced.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/dan-reeves-death-nfl-coach-falcons-broncos;sports
6008;6008;6008;1727;6080;6080;Sands of time are slipping away for England’s crumbling coasts amid climate crisis;2022-01-01;['Andrew Anthony'];['Climate crisis', 'Norfolk', 'UK news', 'Science', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Flooding', 'Coastlines'];"From a distance, the beach at Winterton-on-sea in Norfolk looks like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, with hundreds of grey bodies lying motionless across the sand. On closer inspection, it becomes clear they are not fallen soldiers but a huge colony of seals taken to the land for pupping season. It’s an amazing annual sight that draws tourists and nature-lovers from across the country, but another process is taking place that is pushing people back – the growing threat of coastal erosion. Just along from where the armies of grey seals lay with their white pups, there used to stand the Dunes Cafe, a much-loved beach facility with a large and loyal clientele. A year ago it was demolished to prevent its imminent collapse as a result of land lost to sea and storms. The ground where it stood is, like the cafe itself, no longer there. It’s a story of disappearance taking place all along the eastern coast of England, but particularly in East Anglia, that bulbous protrusion jutting into the North Sea. That climate change and rising sea levels take their toll on the landscape is an old story, but one with an urgent new twist. “The sea level’s been rising since the last ice age, 20,000 years ago or so,” says Jim Hall, professor of climate and environmental risk at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “And it’s going faster. We’re probably not seeing its effect very much yet on the coast, though we will in the future.”
A 2020 report by the Committee on Climate Change, on which Hall sits as an expert on coastal erosion and flooding, found 1.2m homes at significant risk of flooding and a further 100,000 subject to coastal erosion by 2080 – which, although it sounds safely distant, will be within the lifetime of most of those born so far this century. Two years ago, the US-based climate change research group Climate Central went further. It produced a map showing areas of the UK at risk of being underwater by 2050. They included sections of north Norfolk, all of the Lincolnshire coast and much of Cambridgeshire, along with parts of East Yorkshire, Merseyside and the Bristol area. According to the group, this would happen even if “moderate” attempts were made to combat climate change. Such predictions are based on highly complex, and disputed, modelling, yet there are significant warning signs that such an outcome is growing rapidly more plausible. Last month, scientists monitoring the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, an ice shelf the size of Great Britain, warned it is in danger of collapse. “It’s being melted from below by warm ocean waters, causing it to lose its grip on the underwater mountain,” said Peter Davis from British Antarctic Survey and the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. He said research suggested that the ice shelf will begin to break apart within two decades. Should there be a complete collapse, it would lead to a highly consequential rise in sea levels of 60cm. That may be a worst-case scenario, but it will almost certainly have a notable impact on the British coastline.
In a sense Norfolk is a real-time lesson in how weather and sea can drastically alter a landscape. After the Dunes Cafe was dismantled, a chef called Alex Clare set up a mobile silver Airstream cafe to cater to locals and visitors at the car park next to where the cafe once stood. He’s had to move the Airstream four times in eight months, as sections of the dunes on which the car park sits have collapsed into the sea under pressure from storms and high tides. “In the last two weeks,” Clare told me, “a strip about as long as this caravan has disappeared. You hear about erosion, but you don’t know what it means, what it involves, until you witness it. And it’s a shock to see the physical transformation.” The car park owner has tried to slow the erosion by laying down large concrete blocks on the beach, but it’s the definition of a losing battle. Winterton’s coast possesses a bleak beauty, enhanced by the fact that the village sits back from the sea, behind a broad wall of dunes. By contrast, at Hemsby, a mile or so south, the town, with its amusement arcades and fairgrounds, stretches all the way to the shoreline. Four years ago, there was a line of seven chalets close to the edge of the sandy cliffs that drop down to the beach. They all had to be knocked down as the land beneath them began to fall into the sea. The local council is looking at sea defences, but the only workable answer involves large-scale investment and a major process of sandscaping. That is what took place at Bacton, 15 miles north along the coast from Winterton.
A four-mile-long dune was built to protect Bacton Terminal, which supplies around a third of the UK’s gas and had been moving steadily closer to the cliff edge, literally and metaphorically. Designed by the Dutch engineering company Royal HaskoningDHV, it involved the placement of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand along the beaches near the terminal. The design relies on the sand being shifted into place by wind, waves and tides. The Dutch are world leaders in land reclamation and protection, having over the years reclaimed more than a sixth of Holland’s landmass from the sea. “In the long run,” says Professor Hall, “any coast protection is temporary. We’ve been doing engineering to protect the coast for a very long time. Almost half of the UK coast has some kind of protection – sea walls, revetments, promenades, that kind of thing. The Victorians were inveterate promenade builders.” Such protections don’t stop the sea rising. They merely fix, for a while, the point of the shore profile. At Happisburgh, near Bacton, wooden revetments did that job, until they collapsed 20 years ago, leading to a sudden and damaging exposure to the sea. “Once you lose [the protection], there’s a lot of pent-up erosion capacity,” says Hall. Although there is growing media coverage of coastal erosion, it’s as Alex Clare said: knowledge of the thing isn’t the same as experiencing it. “There’s a bit more recognition that the sea level is rising fast,” says Hall. “But I don’t think coastal communities have really understood what the future holds.” He believes there should be an “honest conversation” between government, local government and the affected communities.
While the money required to protect cities like London and Hull will have to be found, that’s not likely with isolated villages. When I visited Norfolk last month, the locals seemed fatalistic or in denial, pointing out that the situation was worse somewhere else, either up or down the coast. As I drove back, it began to rain, and that night the weather deteriorated. The next day there was a large landslide at Mundesley, near Bacton, with a huge chunk of the cliff face collapsing on to the beach. Above it, houses stood on the precipice, their future looking about as secure as Norwich’s position in the Premier League. As Pete Revell, station manager at Bacton HM Coastguard, said, Mundesley was viewed as stable by comparison with nearby Happisburgh, and the landslide came as “a bit of a surprise”. It certainly shocked local resident Antony Lloyd, who said he was “very nervous and agitated about any further incidents.” He was finding it hard to sleep and thought he would have to move. Of course, the occasional landfall or loss of beachside chalets is hardly cause for national panic. But like canaries in a coal mine, the inhabitants of the villages strung along Norfolk’s shifting coastline are a warning of a worrying future. There are processes under way whose outcomes are unavoidable, and those that can potentially be arrested. But it will require unblinking foresight and long-term action, neither of which are our national strong suits. If you take the path north from Winterton’s beach car park you come to the roped-off seal sanctuary. Beyond, seals and their pups lie still and vulnerable in the dunes, hundreds of yards from the shore, as if waiting for the sea to rescue them. And come it will, not now or next year, but much sooner than we care to think.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/sands-slip-england-crumbling-coasts-erosion-rising-sea-levels;environment
6016;6016;6016;1735;6088;6088;Juliet Davenport: Good Energy founder spreads her wings and her expertise;2022-01-01;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Energy industry', 'Green economy', 'Renewable energy', 'Business', 'Energy'];"Juliet Davenport may have made a lucky escape from the energy supply market. The founder and former chief executive of green power supplier Good Energy ended her 20-year tenure last February, months before an unprecedented surge in global energy prices left the industry reeling. But then, it’s not unusual for Davenport to be ahead of the curve. Set up in the late 1990s, Good Energy was one of the first “challenger” suppliers to compete with the behemoths of British Gas and others, which had been created by privatisation. It was also a pioneering investor in renewable power, and an early champion of small-scale community energy ventures. “I think you can become a bit of an institution if you’re not careful,” she laughs. In the bar of an upmarket central London hotel, Davenport is taking a break from the schedule of meetings she has to attend as one of the energy industry’s busiest non-executive directors. Few such boardroom figures have a pedigree quite as green as Davenport’s. She founded Good Energy, the UK’s first supplier of 100% renewable power, in 1999, and the company has boasted ownership of the UK’s first commercial onshore windfarm since 2002. She is married to Mark Shorrock, the entrepreneur behind the controversial Swansea Tidal Lagoon, * * * CV Age 53 Family one daughter, one stepdaughter. Education MA Physics, Oxford University, MSc Economics, Birkbeck. Last holiday Cornwall, to Delabole, site of the UK’s first windfarm. Best advice she’s been given “Try to work with people you like on things that interest you.” Biggest career mistake “Hiring people just on their credentials.” Word she overuses “Cool.” How she relaxes “Riding and reading – I’m still working on doing them simultaneously.” * * * and has weathered a long-term public squabble with fellow energy maverick Dale Vince, including an attempted boardroom coup by his company, Ecotricity, earlier this year. Having stepped back from the day-to-day running of Good Energy, Davenport sits on the boards of a string of companies that are helping tackle the climate crisis. Perhaps her most notable role is as chair of rooftop solar innovator Atrato Onsite Energy, whose flotation in November made it the first company with an all-female board to list on the London Stock Exchange. Davenport says she was no longer content with “turning up and doing the same thing” when she realised that, after decades of hard-learned lessons in the industry, she could spread her wings and help new energy firms navigate the market. Good Energy was in need of some new skills too – notably in digital innovation. Proving that sometimes being ahead of the curve means recognising when others are further ahead, Davenport said she wanted to bring in “someone who was better at digital than I could ever be”. She remains a director of the London-listed company, which she says is in a good position to weather an energy crisis in which dozens of small suppliers have gone bust. The company has always hedged its exposure to global commodity prices by buying plenty of energy in advance, she says, and has negotiated supply deals directly with local renewable energy projects, which also helps to establish a fixed price. At the root of the industry’s crisis, she adds, are small energy companies which have failed to maintain the support of investors by differentiating themselves in a busy market, along with a string of problems with how that market is regulated. So is the growing criticism of the industry watchdog, Ofgem, justified? Absolutely, comes the matter-of-fact response.
“We’ve been having conversations with the regulator around various areas related to competition in the market for probably the past six or seven years,” she says. “The biggest issue was that [Ofgem’s] key performance indicator for success was the number of suppliers in the market, and the amount of switching between suppliers. That has always been a problem.” The clarion call for households to help address sluggish competition in the energy market by shopping around for the cheapest deal unleashed a flood of poorly financed suppliers and unsustainably low energy deals. This race to the bottom has left more than 4 million households in need of a new energy supplier after record prices caused 26 companies to collapse. “The UK needs energy companies which are prepared to invest in the future,” Davenport says. “If you’re constantly competing on price alone, you can’t invest.” As chair of Atrato, Davenport has her mind on investment: it’s just weeks since the rooftop solar venture raised £150m in an oversubscribed market listing. The company plans to use rooftop solar installations to unlock the largely untapped potential of commercial properties. Its strength lies in bringing together staff who have “a significant understanding of the commercial property market” with experts in renewable energy development. In time, Atrato expects to create standardised contracts that can make the still-niche decision to fit a leased office block with solar capability a “plug and play” option. “The original Good Energy headquarters was owned by a pension fund,” she says. “I remember trying at least once a year to put solar on the roof and completely failing, because the [owners] were so far removed and just didn’t want any complications. “Now a lot of corporates have a commitment to using renewables, and installing projects on their own site is part of fulfilling that. Helping them navigate the way forward if they don’t own their building is a huge part of that. The energy market has to be about making things easy for consumers.” The Atrato ethos echoes in some ways that of Good Energy, which for decades made it easy for households to play a role in the growth of renewables by choosing a tariff from a company that invests directly in renewable energy projects. “The question is how fast we can do it,” she says. “And how standardised we can make this process. If we keep everything as simple and repetitive as possible, we can move faster.” Energy companies that can “enable” consumers to decarbonise their energy use because it’s the easier option are the ones to watch, Davenport believes. “For many years I saw big companies and government try to do big projects because that’s what they can control. But so much can be done on a decentralised level if you can get inside the head of a consumer,” she says. In her next chapter Davenport plans to do just that, all over again.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/juliet-davenport-good-energy-founder-spreads-wings-and-expertise;business and economy
6026;6026;6026;1745;6098;6098;US experts question whether counting Covid cases is still the right approach;2022-01-01;['N/A'];['US news', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus'];"Some US infectious disease experts and public health officials are questioning whether to continue using the number of coronavirus cases as a metric for determining which mitigation efforts are appropriate, as data suggests Omicron is less severe but much more contagious than previous variants.
Those experts argue that the US has reached a stage in the pandemic where reports of dramatic surges in case counts prompt unnecessary worries and that government officials and the public should instead review death and hospitalization data when considering precautions. Case counts “are causing a lot of panic and fear, but they don’t reflect what they used to, which was that hospitalizations would track with cases”, said Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. However, other infectious disease experts say that while they are encouraged by data from South Africa showing that its recent Omicron wave was not accompanied by a significant increase in deaths, the virus continues to strain hospitals in the US, therefore the number of Covid cases remains a vital measurement. The US on Thursday had more than 580,000 new Covid cases, the second time this week that the country has broken its record for daily Covid cases, according to New York Times data. But over the past two weeks, while the number of Covid cases in the United States has increased by 181%, the number of hospitalizations has increased by 19% and the number of deaths has decreased by 5%. “It seems to be less virulent for two reasons,” said Gandhi. “One, we seem to have so much more immunity in December 2021” than during previous waves, and “there are now five laboratory studies that show that it doesn’t seem to infect lungs very well”. In reporting data on Covid, health departments should now take the same approach as they do with influenza, Gandhi said. That means releasing hospitalization and death data but not numbers concerning case counts because, like with the flu, it’s not possible to eliminate the virus, therefore we should only focus on its severity, she said. “Once you have accepted the virus is endemic, just like influenza, then you never track cases because we never screen like this for any other viruses, we track what is causing disease and getting people hospitalized,” Gandhi said. Other countries are now implementing an approach that is not focused on case counts. For example, in Canada, which has also seen record numbers of Covid cases recently, Dr Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference Thursday that the government agency would no longer focus on daily case counts. “We no longer need to identify and have public health manage every single case of the variant because for most people, that will result in relatively mild illness, so we need to focus our efforts and resources on our most vulnerable groups,” said Strang. “Omicron is all around us and we have to recognize that you could be exposed anywhere … It’s about managing and slowing down the spread but not eliminating it.” The Philippines government also announced this week that it would stop posting case updates on social media, which was similar to an approach employed by Singapore, according to Hawaii Public Radio. But in the US, there are parts of the country where hospitals remains overwhelmed, largely because of unvaccinated patients with Covid. In Maryland, for example, which saw a more than 500% increase in Covid cases and 50% increase in hospitalizations, at least six hospitals have implemented crisis-mode standards of care, according to the Baltimore Sun. At Johns Hopkins Bayview medical center, which saw a 360% increase in patients hospitalized with Covid in December, that means rescheduling elective surgical procedures and opening additional space to treat Covid patients. Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, still sees case counts as an “important leading indicator”, he said. “With Omicron are surges are so big, even if it’s on average … much less severe than previous variants, the sheer number of cases is such that hospital systems are going to be overwhelmed and there is risks to individuals because it’s so likely you will be infected.” Mara Aspinall, a biomedical diagnostics professor at Arizona State University, also said case count data remains important because it prevents the public from overreacting or underreacting to the pandemic. “The challenge we have had this whole time is finding that balance between keeping our physical health in check, but our mental health and the economy moving forward, and it’s all with the best information” that we are able to do that, Aspinall said. For Gandhi, that balance lies in health departments tracking case counts internally and only alerting the public on hospitalizations and deaths. “The reason we tracked cases is because we were hoping we could eliminate the virus, but it’s not in the nature of the virus to eliminate it,” said Gandhi. “The country hasn’t totally transitioned to this idea that we can’t eliminate it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/us-covid-case-counts-omicron;health
6031;6031;6031;1750;6103;6103;Time to stockpile olives? Shortages as delis are hit by new Brexit import rules;2022-01-01;['Toby Helm', 'Tom Wall'];['Brexit', 'European Union', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'Boris Johnson', 'Food', 'Life and style', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Consumer affairs'];"After a few minutes in the queue spent eyeing up the best on offer at the local deli, it is decision time. Maybe some of the wonderful Parma ham from Italy? With a few slices of Spanish chorizo? And a piece of brie from that farm in Normandy … oh, and definitely some of the black olives from Greece. The government may be making light of new and burdensome Brexit rules and regulations affecting imports to Great Britain from the EU that came into force on 1 January, but organisations representing small UK firms are not. The firms are worried about the impact on their businesses – and about the choices that will be available to their customers at their favourite specialist stores – on the high street. The Federation of Small Businesses cites local delicatessens, many of which import from small specialist suppliers in the EU, as the type of operators that could be adversely affected. “The classic example is your high street deli that is importing delicacies like, say, chorizo from Spain or parmesan from Italy,” says James Sibley, the federation’s head of international affairs. “For them, the thought of having to register for these systems is daunting and the process is expensive, so we’ve a lot of concern there. For those small businesses directly affected, we have picked up a lot of worry.” The hit to small EU exporters to the UK could be similar to that experienced by UK exporters to the EU over the past year, many of which simply gave up selling goods to the continent because post-Brexit export rules made it too much of a bother and too expensive to carry on. From the beginning of last year UK exporters faced extra paperwork, and added costs, and their customers were stung by resulting higher prices – despite the claims by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other Brexiteers that leaving the EU would reduce regulation and lead to lower prices. Now, Sibley says, the effects could be similar for small importers to those that faced UK exporters in 2021. “It is the inverse of what has happened to UK exporters over the past year. We know that a fifth of our exporting members have stopped exporting to the EU, because of that disruption.” Rules that came into force January 1 require businesses (in most cases those receiving the goods in the UK, but in some those sending them here) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021. The process will require the exporter to acquire and then submit an Eori number (economic operators registration and identification number) to their UK customers so the importers can then input a lot of data and send it off to the UK authorities. If the goods arrive with incomplete paperwork, they can be seized, confiscated or sent back. Sibley says there is evidence that many EU exporters are unprepared for what is about to hit them. “What we are hearing is that there are some EU traders who are not ready for any of this even to the extent of not having this number, so that is a concern.” Then on 1 July this year, more regulations and checks will come in. “From then, exporters will also need export health certificates or veterinary certificates if they are exporting products of animal origin or foodstuffs. That is a point at which some EU exporters might just say, ‘You know what, forget this. It is not worth the hassle’.” Sibley adds: “Also in July you will have physical inspections of goods at border posts in the UK, so again that could lead to delays because you will essentially have a vet with a clipboard going through the lorry saying ‘this is right, this is fine, (or not)’.” Business groups say the problems will affect mainly smaller operators, as bigger concerns can afford to pay customs agents or freight forwarders to handle the paperwork for them.
On UK high streets, some shop owners are already worrying about gaps appearing on their shelves in 2022, and about rising prices. El Colmado, Bristol’s only Spanish deli, imports pretty much everything: chorizo sausages, huge serrano hams and glossy green olives. Its owner, David Pavon, expects more disruption and rising prices when importers are required to make real-time custom declarations, input details of food imports into various customs systems, and obtain special codes for lorries to board ferries. “Logistics problems have increased during the past year already because of the havoc coming into England,” he says. “So I imagine in January we’re going to see even more delays, because if a lorry driver needs to sit in the border for six hours or more, we will need to pay his wages. We are paying customs agents in Spain and here to input the information [required for import], which increases the price as well.” Pavon, 41, has already put his prices up – and expects to have to do so again in 2022. “They are still going up and you will see an increase and an increase,” he says. “Someone is making money along the way but you and me are going to have to pay for it.” The wholesalers supplying delis and specialist food shops have similar worries. Reading-based Cotswold Fayre, which supplies hundreds of premium food lines, including European favourites such as stollen and panettone, to independent retailers throughout the UK, has been forced to budget for delays and cost increases on imported goods instead of investing in creating new jobs. “It’s not what we want to do – I would rather spend on starting another shop, but if we have to we will [absorb extra costs],” says Paul Hargreaves, the company’s founder. Hargreaves, who recently met his local MP, Alok Sharma, feels that the government does not understand the impact of Brexit on British businesses. “[Ministers] are not in the real world. They think things are a lot easier than they actually are. That is highly frustrating,” he says. “If they had to experience it for themselves, perhaps there might have been a bit more effort to do a better Brexit deal. The perception is that the ideology [of Brexit] is more important than the practicalities to businesses in the UK.” • The headline and text of this article were amended on 1 January 2022 to correctly refer to Great Britain rather than the UK in specific reference to the new regulations.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-shops-fear-gaps-shelves-brexit-import-rules-prices-shortages-delis;business and economy
6036;6036;6036;1755;6108;6108;Mother of murdered sisters hopes to meet PC jailed for crime scene photos;2022-01-01;['Jane Clinton'];['Police', 'London', 'Metropolitan police', 'UK news', 'Race'];The mother of two sisters who were murdered in a London park said she wants to meet one of the police officers who took selfies at the scene and shared the images. The Ven Mina Smallman, the first black woman to become an archdeacon in the Church of England, who was guest editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, also spoke of the pain of losing her daughters Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, in June 2020. Deniz Jaffer, 47, and Jamie Lewis, 33, who were serving Metropolitan police officers, had been ordered to guard the murder scene. However, it emerged they had taken photos, some showing the bodies, and shared them in two WhatsApp groups. Jaffer resigned from the Met in August, while Lewis was sacked by a disciplinary tribunal. Last month Jaffer and Lewis were each jailed for two years and nine months. Danyal Hussein, 19, was jailed for life in October – with a minimum of 35 years – for the murder of the sisters. Smallman said she had forgiven him. Since her daughters’ deaths, she has campaigned on violence against women and for equity on how victims are seen. When asked what she felt about a police system that produced and allowed two serving officers to photograph her daughters as they did, she replied: “I’m repulsed by them, if I’m honest, and I can’t wait to meet Jaffer. “He said he’d like to meet with the family and I don’t believe he thought that that could happen, but it will because he said he wants it to happen. I’m going to give him that invitation.” The family have planted a cherry tree at Fryent country park in north-west London, where the women were murdered. In October, following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the Met police apologised to the family for failing in the way it responded when the two women were reported missing. The IOPC found that a missing persons log was incorrectly closed and inquiries were not progressed. The Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said a better response would have saved their family and friends “immeasurable pain”. Smallman told the Today programme “having to fight to find your own children” was horrendous. Asked by the presenter Mishal Husain if the guilty verdicts had allowed her now to “turn a page in some way”, Smallman said: “No, not yet. I think it is probably too soon. I’m looking forward to that time when we can just start grieving. But we don’t know what that looks like yet. “I’ve said once before, it’d be great to have no news, good or bad. We just would like a flat line, just to gather speed and to find our way through the grieving process.” She added that there had been times when she no longer wanted to “be here” and that they had been “dreading” Christmas, but added that her campaigning had helped her. “If anything, this has kept me going,” she explained. “This has given me a reason to stay with it and try to ensure that another family doesn’t have to go through what we’ve been through.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/mother-of-murdered-sisters-hopes-to-meet-pc-jailed-for-scene-photos;politics
6038;6038;6038;1757;6110;6110;Click and collect: my insatiable passion for auction websites;2022-01-01;['Eva Wiseman'];['Collecting', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Design', 'Art and design', 'Interiors', 'Culture', 'Homes'];"Last year I stood in the shallows of my house, a place now ankle-deep with books, pots, pictures and lamps, and I thought: I want more. More books, more pots, more pictures, more lamps. I’d barely left the house in months but still I’d managed to accumulate a warehouse-worth of new tut. I say new – it was all old, nothing made after perhaps 1989, nothing that had not been through at least two previous owners, at least one of those owners now long deceased, the other having woken one day and found themselves a minimalist. Everything was bought, you see, at auction. Specifically at auctions that pre-pandemic I would not have thought to visit, but (after viewings became online-only) I found myself walking through at night, panting. My local auction house is a place out of time, a room Tetris-stacked with chests of drawers and boxes of Beatles magazines, the smell a specific combination of vape and dust. Every weekend I squeeze through the aisles, marvelling at the collections of erotic art or antique computers or nesting tables that have nested so long they have almost hatched. And every weekend I return home with another object that I didn’t need but needed immediately.
My boyfriend looks on with a combination of affection and disgust. His birthday card to me this year was a painting of a 70s lamp he is particularly unfond of, claiming its volcanic glaze looks like semen, and inside a poem which began, “Eva went to auction house, debit card in hand, to feed a strong compulsion that she couldn’t understand. For nightly on the internet and in person once a week, she would browse their sad collection of ugly furniture in teak.” There are five verses, he hates it this much. We live in a home of compromise, pottery and thick-spread affection: “Eva scooped the jizz lamp up as though she were its mother, and rushed it home to meet its ceramic sisters and brothers. Her partner was agog to see this totem of bad taste and asked her why she’d said she was just shopping for toothpaste. But even though he rolled his eyes he knew it was his duty, to love a thing that she loves, and to try and find its beauty.” I’ve tried to explain to him why I’m drawn to these things, and why they continue to fill our shelves. Partly, I say, because they are imbued with memory, partly because their quality is so much better than their Ikea alternatives, partly because there is no fixed price, partly because of the thrill of discovering treasure. You don’t buy things from auction – you win them. I try to bring home only things I know will bring me joy, but the problem is, so much does. I urge him to understand my love of auctions not as a problem but as a hobby. One that leaked online from real life, in that way things do today. I’m reluctant to encourage others to join me as an auction hobbyist because, of course, there is only one fabulous lamp for sale at a time, and there might be a wait of many months before a similarly jizzy one becomes available. But if I were to, if I were a better person and less worried by the competition, then I would recommend approaching the-saleroom.com (where auction houses the world over list their goods) as if visiting a gallery rather than a shop.
I’d advise people to relish the artfully random selection of tchotchkes and design, prioritising the pleasure of looking over the desire to purchase. Sometimes it’s exciting to type in an offensively low bid, because sometimes you win it – on the wall by our front door hangs a painting I bid £10 on, and after picking it up from an office piled with Matisse prints and Dalí objects, discovered the artist’s work hangs at the Whitney in New York. But on the rare occasion when you see something you want – something you absolutely must have – I’d recommend calling the auction house directly (to avoid the online commission) and if possible bidding live. Though that is a dangerous game, one that can leave you quite sick and poor. At night I scroll slowly through abstract landscapes and modernist chairs and mourning rings and haunted dolls, bidding low and often. What is lost when viewing virtually rather than walking through an auction house – the ability to pick things up and turn them over, to enjoy the dissonance of seeing an antique truncheon balanced on a meticulously carved Buddha, or a vintage Chanel hat perched on a very large bear – is gained by the many miles you can travel with your thumb. This week I bought another lamp. How to do it The Saleroom is used by more than 2,000 auction houses worldwide to sell art and antiques online. Live Auctioneers is a similar service and includes jewellery and fashion in available lots. This site features auctions from more than 50 countries. The online design platform 1stdibs also launched a seven-day auction system in December 2021. The site focuses on furniture, home décor, art.

6042;6042;6042;1761;6114;6114;Everton sign Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko on four-year deal;2022-01-01;['Andy Martin'];['Everton', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Dynamo Kyiv', 'Sport'];"Everton have confirmed the signing of the Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko for an undisclosed fee, with the Ukraine international agreeing a four-and-a-half-year deal. The left-back has won 21 caps for Ukraine and was a key part of the team that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.
Mykolenko said: “Moving to Everton is a big and important step in my life. I am 22 but I don’t feel like a youngster. I have experience of playing at European level and hope I will continue to improve as a player.” Mykolenko can also operate in central defence and as a wing-back and made his Dynamo debut aged 18, making his senior international debut a year later. He added: “I like to play on the front foot and get forward when I can. Modern football demands that full-backs are able to attack as well as defend. I think I am a versatile defender who can get up and down the pitch. But I believe desire and commitment are the most important attributes and I will aim to bring those qualities.” Mykolenko is expected to replace Lucas Digne, who has fallen out of favour with Raphael Benítez in recent weeks and has been strongly linked with Brighton and Chelsea. Meanwhile, Benítez has likened Dominic Calvert-Lewin to a new signing as the striker prepares to make his first appearance since August. The England international scored in the first three matches of the season, but a thigh injury and subsequent setback in his recovery has denied Everton his services until now. There will be a temptation, especially with Richarlison still sidelined by a calf problem, to put Calvert-Lewin in from the start at home to Brighton on Sunday. However, while Benítez is delighted to have last season’s leading scorer back, he has sounded a note of caution about placing too much expectation on him. “He’s a massive signing for us in the second part of the league,” he said. “If we bring him back and, a few weeks later, Richarlison, we have more options there, we can think of the second part totally different. I’ve explained before that one thing is match fitness that you can improve by playing games and the other thing is fitness.
“Fitness-wise he is getting better. Match fitness, we will see. Maybe he scores three goals in the first half and we don’t need to worry about his match fitness, but I think the issue will be how long he can play if he starts the game or, if he comes from the bench, how much impact he can have on the game. “We are considering all of these things but he is training really well and he is really happy because he is with the team and is ready to play and score goals.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/everton-sign-dynamo-kyiv-defender-vitaliy-mykolenko-on-four-year-deal;sports

Our supporters’ predictions for 2022;2022-01-01;['Mark Rice-Oxley'];['World news'];"Boris Johnson steps down, to be replaced by David Frost – or Jeremy Hunt, or Michael Gove, or Peppa Pig. French presidential elections are beset by civil unrest over pandemic restrictions. Russia mounts some kind of incursion in eastern Ukraine. China waits for an opportune moment to overrun Taiwan. And the world runs out of Greek letters to attach to Covid variants. Yes, it’s the time for pundits and predictions – a new year stretching ahead and no shortage of views on what it will deliver. Some things seem dead certs: elections in Brazil, the US, Hungary and France. A new Covid wave to grapple with. A platinum jubilee. A controversial World Cup – and Winter Olympics. But what about the unknown unknowns? We asked the Guardian’s 1 million supporters to make their predictions. The picture painted by a colourful spray of submissions was an alternative foretelling of the year ahead – and not hugely cheerful. Geopolitically, Ukraine and Taiwan seem most vulnerable, but there were also predictions of showdowns in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia and Iran, of something stirring on Russia’s border with the Baltic republics, and of deepening hunger in Afghanistan and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Donald Trump declares for the 2024 presidential race after the Republicans wrest back control of Congress; but populists and the far right fall into retreat elsewhere.
Everyone will have slightly more money – but that’s just another way of saying inflation will march upwards. Higher interest rates cause consumer pain around the world, and a Chinese property market collapse has a palpable financial impact. Food shortages bite. The UK government has to nationalise electricity provision, amid the wretched decay of privatised industries struggling with underinvestment. Businesses pursue purpose and sustainability like never before, mindful this is the best way to retain fleet-footed talent. An incipient desertion of Facebook and Twitter becomes a proper exodus; cryptocurrencies collapse in value faced with the twin threats of regulation and the issue of official digital currencies. Airports, supermarkets and lampposts become EV charging hubs. Gigabattery is voted word of the year, just ahead of microbiome, plyscraper, nanodrone and wolf warrior. There will be digital daemons for all. Rain patterns change and there are further startling weather events in unexpected parts. A cyberattack causes major infrastructure disruption. Billions of trees are planted, but not all of them in the right places. Horses are increasingly used as a method of transport.
Assisted dying becomes bigger business than ever, as planned death becomes something of a performance. There is a backlash against the availability of online pornography as a new social division emerges between sybarites and prudes. Fertility rates plummet amid a crisis over sperm counts. Overall, it will be a marginally better year than 2021. A survey of supporters found 50.5% optimistic about the new year, compared with 49.5% who were pessimistic. A selection of supporters’ predictions for 2022 Europe will be facing two tricky crises: the refugee situation in Belarus and newly sparked tensions in Serbia, both potential candidates for another war in Europe. Extreme civil unrest due to the harsh Covid restrictions imposed by the governments. War between the US and China over Taiwan.

You’ll be able to personalise the sound of your electric car and the streets will become a cacophony of Clash meets Tchaikovsky.

Insects will be the new crisps, until people realise how gross insect farming is. Coralie Wilson We’ll start to see a more purpose-orientated approach in business and in working life. The “great resignation” has encouraged many people to seek out work that feels personally meaningful to them, and I expect this trend will continue in 2022. As employees start to realign their working lives around a sense of personal meaning, it will eventually become clear to employers that purpose is a priority. This will encourage business owners and leaders to take a more intentional approach to strategy and management, figuring out what they can offer their employees and stakeholders, and working to make a meaningful impact in the world. Eloise Skinner Enough people will leave Facebook and Twitter to make them unviable. Nick Jones There will be bigger splits across society with those vaccinated v anti-vaxxers.

Anna-Laure Damongeot I see two major universal trends. The first that one half of the population of human beings of this world will evolve into a kinder and more generous species, grateful to have survived the worst existential crisis in our recent history. The other half, which has sunk into an alternative reality of viewing fellow people as enemies of their race, will have a rude awakening and lose considerable ground because their own clans will desert them even as their predictions keep getting exposed as hate and not facts. Aruna Hariharan A growing youth movement of authentic and knowledgeable activists who demand transformative change in our governance systems. Steve Martin Sinn Féin/Alliance form Northern Ireland government at Stormont in May causing civil war in the Conservative party as their negotiating stance on the NI protocol with Europe collapses. Further Brexit issues with border controls and supply chain problems ramp up the pressure on Johnson. He does not rise to the challenge and further infighting results in a leadership challenge. Paul Collins Julian Assange freed and allowed to return to Australia with his wife and two sons. Mariam Dessaive I predict that Boris will further seek to weasel his way out of No 10 because he doesn’t like being PM when it’s difficult. Kathy Duggan A major crypto crash, perhaps because of regulatory crackdowns and/or the introduction of one or more official digital currencies. Geoff Barnard A significant decline of the far right in many countries. A bigger “normality” of our lives facing Covid-19 (vaccination and weaker variants). A more severe crisis between western countries and China and Russia. Luiz Bastos I think that countries where there’s no free speech, a lot of corruption, poverty and very high Covid deaths will face big trouble (India, Egypt, Iran, even maybe Russia and China), if not in 2022 then in the next 10 years. Erika Claus Petiot Due to political embarrassment of stories of exploitation of overseas workers in Qatar, Fifa moves World Cup location to the more sensitive choice of Saudi Arabia, only after Belarus turned down the opportunity. Patrick Brosnan With four major Covid-19 variants in two years we can expect another two in 2022. Could be more with the lack of take-up of vaccines worldwide. Eventually, we’ll run out of Greek letters. Dave Bartlett There will be a series of scandals of older vulnerable people coming to significant harm as a result of the lack of social care availability. Peter Loose We’ll all move to the Orkneys to soak up the surplus electricity. As a result there will be a run on warm clothing especially puffer jackets.

The west subsequently does not know which way to turn. George Stephens China will begin to take serious measures on climate emissions, and Australia and Canada’s fossil industries will suffer accordingly. Norm Mohamid There will be a major disruption caused either by a cyberattack or by failure of GPS – caused by a large solar storm or a system problem. We have become far too dependent on technology that is vulnerable to widespread failure. Martyn Thomas More people than ever will give up on the US and Canadian costs of living and move to Mexico and Panama. Suzanne Gravelle 2022 is going to be significantly worse even than 2021 and 2020. Large increases in the price of food, fuel, energy, hospitality. Maybe even food shortages. More extreme weather events, including more, and worse, in the UK. Terrifying clampdowns on freedom of speech and the right to protest – eg “protesters” being imprisoned for sharing views and communicating with each other online. And who knows what is going to happen with Covid? The shocking thing is that, even with 2020 and 2021 being as awful as they have been, they are better than any year we’ll see for the rest of our lives. Cathy Eastburn The Covid variants will have to be named in Sanskrit, after we run out of Greek letters. Mike Allen I hate to say this, but there will be an increase in tensions over the Ukraine, Taiwan, and Iran’s nuclear programme. This will not be triumph of the west. The US will retreat from these facedown, and Ukraine will fall into the orbit of Russia, Taiwan will fall to China, without a fight, at the early signs of invasion, and Iran will find itself on the receiving end of Israeli attacks on its nuclear programme. Whether it retaliates effectively, along with its allies Hezbollah and to a lesser extant Hamas, will determine Israel’s fate. The 2022 elections in the US will lead to a return to Republican majorities in both ouses.

6091;6091;6091;1810;6163;6163;What the UK car and home insurance shake-up means for the price you pay;2022-01-01;['Miles Brignall'];['Insurance', 'Money', 'Insurance industry', 'Business', 'UK news'];"The biggest shake-up to the insurance industry for decades takes place on New Year’s Day, when insurers will be banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew their home or motor insurance than they would offer a new customer. The move will leave some customers better off, but others look likely to pay more. What’s this all about? After years of complaints that customers who regularly switched insurer were paying significantly lower premiums than those that renewed automatically, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said both sets of customers must now be offered the same price. The FCA had found evidence that insurers were attracting new customers with artificially low prices and then increasing premiums in subsequent years – a practice known in the trade as “price walking”. Insurers were also found to be cynically targeting customers who they thought were less likely to switch in future. This move is designed to end the two-tier insurance market that has grown up as a result. How will it work? If the regulations are applied as intended, a car or home insurance customer receiving their renewal notice at the end of the year will be quoted the same premium as if they apply to switch to that company from a rival insurer. Until now, insurers offered generous discounts in the first year – often at or below cost – to attract customers in the hope they would be able to increase their premiums in subsequent years. However, it is a bit more complicated than it first appears. Insurers must prove, on aggregate, they charge new and existing customers getting insurance via the same “channel” at the same price. In effect, this means that insurers can still charge different rates for customers who use different price comparison sites (channels) but they can’t favour new customers over existing ones.
What does this mean for prices? The move looks likely to be bad news for households that switched their home and car insurers each year – chasing the lowest new-customer premiums. There was nothing to stop people switching suppliers each year taking advantage of the discounted deals – and that is what millions of people have been doing. This group will undoubtedly end up paying more each year to insure their homes and cars, as those discounts will no longer be there. Conversely, the FCA said it expects loyal customers who renew policies automatically to save £120 a year each. Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, and one of those who helped to turn UK consumers into a nation of switchers, said: “My best guess is firms won’t just cut renewal prices to match those for newbies. Rates will meet nearer the middle as happened in 2012, when insurers were barred from gender price discrimination. This will mean savings from switching are likely to relatively reduce. “We’re still unsure of how this will work exactly, but prices for switchers are very likely to be relatively higher for January.” Overall, insurance prices will still rise (and sometimes fall as happened in the pandemic) but they should shift equally for all customers – rather than just those who switch regularly. Will it still be worth doing a price comparison at renewal? Yes and this is still the best advice. Insurers tend to target different segments of the market, and some may still want to attract you as a customer and will quote accordingly. The big savings gained by switching will probably be a thing of the past, but there will still be savings on offer. Expect insurers to continue to offer deals via the price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket, ComparetheMarket and so on. New entrants will still offer attractive prices to grab customers. It is worth noting that price walking has been particularly prevalent in the home insurance market where those renewing policies were often charged double or even triple what they would have paid as a new customer of the same firm. Anyone who has not swapped home insurance in recent years is advised to do a price comparison when they renew.

6096;6096;6096;1815;6168;6168;Tim Dowling: my 2021 in numbers – minus the two courgettes I poisoned my family with;2022-01-01;['Tim Dowling'];['Life and style', 'Family'];"Last New Year’s Day I found myself in the mildly paradoxical state of being relieved 2020 was finally over while still dreading the prospect of 2021. Twelve months on, I’m in the exact same position: the only thing preventing me from being glad to see the back of last year is the distinct possibility that 2022 will be worse still. A lot of this is, of course, subjective. The only way to accurately assess the goodness or badness of one particular year in relation to another is through the prism of cold, hard numbers. Here, then, is my personal statistical index for the year 2021, using the latest available figures: 100 Percentage of my adult offspring presently living with me, up from 66.6% this time last year. Initially, I considered this to be a 50% improvement – I was relieved to have them all under one roof, and it was also reassuring to have a generous amount of muscle in residence in times of need. But a stricter cost-benefit analysis – ie how much you spend feeding them versus the number of times you need help carrying a safe upstairs – proves a full house to be an expensive luxury.
27 Number of non-toxic courgettes successfully grown. In many respects it was a bumper season, but nobody remembers all those lovely, pale yellow, not even slightly poisonous courgettes I grew last year; just the two green ones that nearly sent my entire family to A&E after just a few bites. As far as I could work out, the poisoned variety were the result of accidental cross-pollination leading to a bad batch of commercial seed that produced courgettes laced with natural toxins that can cause – and I’m here to tell you, do cause – diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Also occasionally hair loss and death – rarely in both cases, although absolutely anything seemed possible that night. After that fateful event nobody would eat any courgette grown by me, even after I licked the end of each one to prove their non-toxicity. Now I lick the end of all courgettes, even the ones from the store, so I suppose a lesson of sorts has been learned.
6 Number of gigs the band I’m in played in 2021. It’s a lot more than the single gig we played between lockdowns in 2020, but rather less than the nine we were originally scheduled to play. One gig was cancelled and rescheduled three times, until it finally went ahead in October. We already have more than 20 gigs lined up for this year. I should probably practise. 4 Total number of injections received. This represents a huge increase over the previous year (0), the year before that (0) and the year before that (0). In fact, it’s almost certainly an annual record. I got my first vaccination jab in March and my second one in May. When I had the booster in November they asked me if I’d had a flu jab yet, and when I said no they gave me both, one in each arm. I walked out of that community centre feeling invincible, and woke up the next day feeling like crap.
1,063 Amount of money, to the nearest pound, that I spent on Covid tests in 2021. Again, it’s a big jump from 2020, when I spent nothing. I suppose one should average the total cost of testing across the whole pandemic, but in this case the entire sum was expended in an effort to get my family to the US for my father’s 100th birthday, the bulk of it on a single, ruinous trip to a drive-through testing centre in the States, 48 hours before our return. 19 By my reckoning, the total number of different names the old cat called me in 2021 in a bid to get my attention so I would feed it, or turn on the tap so it could drink from it. Those names included Mairead, Muireann, Meryl, Noirin, Noel and Joan, plus some minor spelling variations, none of which were even close to my actual name. Then, in August, the old cat died. RIP James. 1 New cats acquired. I thought it was too soon to replace the old cat with a new kitten, but I was overridden by four votes to one. It arrived in October and proceeded to wreak havoc upon our household. Months later, it still jumps out at me from hidden corners and it still stands on my plate while I’m eating. At least it doesn’t call me names. I sort of miss that, to be honest.

6154;119;119;119;186;186;COVID-19: UKHSA explains why cutting self-isolation to five days would be 'counterproductive';2022-01-02;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];['covid-19', 'coronavirus'];"Cutting COVID-19 isolation to five days would be ""counterproductive"" and exacerbate staffing shortages, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned.

Currently, people in England who test positive can get out of isolation if they receive a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven - with tests taken 24 hours apart. If they still test positive, they have to remain in isolation for 10 days.

This was cut from a full 10 days just before Christmas - but there are now calls to slash the period even further to five days, like in the US, due to increasing pressures on the NHS and workplaces.

Image: People who test positive have to self-isolate for 10 days, but if they test negative on days six and seven they can be released

However, the UKHSA has warned that cutting isolation even further could actually lead to more people being infected. In a blog post, it explained:

The time isolation starts in the US is different to UK

The UKHSA said we are ""not comparing like to like"" when looking at the self-isolation advice in the UK and US.

In the UK, the self-isolation ""clock"" begins when a person starts having COVID symptoms or gets a positive test, whichever is first.

But in the US, the advice is to self-isolate for five days once you get a positive test ""which may be some days after the first symptoms"", the UKHSA said.

Image: US President Joe Biden cut self-isolation in the US to five days but the UKHSA says it is not comparing 'like with like'

Shortening self-isolation would be ""counterproductive""

The UKHSA said its modelling suggests 10% to 30% of people will still be infectious on day six, ""depending on how soon after developing symptoms they received their PCR or lateral flow test result, and the result of their lateral flow test on that day"".

Therefore, the agency said its current assessment is making the isolation period shorter than seven days (including end of isolation assurance testing) ""would be counterproductive"".

It said that in some settings - such as hospitals - ""it could actually worsen staff shortages if it led to more people being infected"".

Image: People in England can get out of self-isolation early if they test negative on day six and seven

Omicron could change self-isolation period

The UKHSA said it will keep its position on self-isolation under review as more evidence comes in and the government monitors the impact of isolation policy on critical sectors.

But, it added: ""Our assessment may change as we continue to learn more about the features of the Omicron variant compared to, for example, the Delta variant.""

However, the agency said the current policy of allowing people to leave isolation after two negative tests on days six and seven ""is the optimal approach at present"".

It said this supports people who are ""unlikely to be infectious to go back to work and resume other activities, but continues to protect the wider population from infection"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220102170449/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-ukhsa-explains-why-cutting-self-isolation-to-five-days-would-be-counterproductive-12507722;health
6181;146;146;146;240;240;Migrant crossings: 2021 marks record year with more than 28,300 people entering UK via English Channel;2022-01-04;[];['migrant crisis', 'migrant crossings'];"Last year saw a record number of migrants entering the UK aboard small boats via the English Channel, latest data suggests.

More than 28,300 people made the treacherous journey in 2021 - triple the number for the year before, according to figures from the Home Office and analysed by the PA news agency.

The figures come as ministers are warned that arrivals will continue and more people will drown in the stretch of sea between France and Britain if the government pursues its current ""dangerous and callous"" immigration plan.

November - the record month for crossings

The highest number of crossings was recorded in November, when at least 6,869 people reached the country, with more than 3,100 of those arriving in the space of six days.

On 24 November, at least 27 people died when their boat, which was likened to a blow-up pool, sank in the Channel.

During the same month, a new daily record for the number of people reaching British shores aboard small boats was set when 1,185 arrived on Remembrance Day.

In 2020, the highest daily figure was 416 which was recorded in September of that year.

Overall, at least 28,395 people reached the UK aboard small boats in 2021, according to PA analysis.

Government plans to tackle the issue

The yearly figure comes despite the UK government promising millions of pounds to French authorities to tackle the issue and the announcement of a new plan for immigration under the Nationality and Borders Bill.

If passed, the bill, which is currently in the House of Lords for readings, would make knowingly arriving in the UK without permission a criminal offence.

Home Office minister Tom Pursglove MP said: ""Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel.""

He said the government is ""reforming"" its approach by ""making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws and UK taxpayers"".

Mr Pursglove added: ""The public has been crying out for reform for two decades and that's what this government is delivering through our New Plan for Immigration.""

What is the Nationality and Borders Bill, why is it so controversial and what do MPs want to change?

The government 'must wake up'

Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive at Refugee Action, said that the UK government's policy will lead to more deaths in the Dover Strait.

He said: ""People will continue to cross the Channel in flimsy boats, and smugglers will continue to profit, unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum here.

""[In November] we saw the deadly result of their strategy of keeping people out rather than keeping people safe, when at least 27 people died near our coast.

Image: A view of a warehouse facility in Dover, Kent, for boats used by migrants

""And yet the government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its anti-refugee bill, which will only lead to more people drowning. It must wake up and scrap this bill now.""

Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais which supports refugees living in northern France, said rising numbers of small boat arrivals in Britain reflect a shift away from attempts to cross by lorry.

She said: ""If the government were serious about stopping people smugglers, it would create a safe way for people to claim asylum and put people smugglers out of business once and for all.""

Despite the increasing numbers, the UK's small boat arrivals are a fraction of the number of people arriving in Europe.

At least 120,441 people arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean by land and sea in 2021, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine trials and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, helped develop the AstraZeneca vaccine in 2020.

Speaking a year on from the first time AstraZeneca was administered to a member of the public, Prof Pollard told The Telegraph: ""The worst is absolutely behind us. We just need to get through the winter.""

Asked about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's current handling of the crisis, with his relatively light restrictions across England, Prof Pollard said: ""(It) seems to be working so far. The system isn't falling over. But it's finely balanced.

""We can't fully answer whether he's got it right for some time.""

Image: Brian Pinker was the first person to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab on 4 January 2021

In the 12 months since AstraZeneca was injected into Brian Pinker, 82, a dialysis patient at Oxford's Churchill hospital, nine billion COVID doses, including AstraZeneca, have been given worldwide.

In the UK alone, 90% of over-12s have had their first vaccine and more than 80% have had two doses, while 33 million boosters have been given.

But Prof Pollard warned that giving boosters to people every six months was ""not sustainable"" and fourth jabs should not be offered until there is more evidence.

He said there was no point in trying to stop all infections and that ""at some point, society has to open up"", despite the ongoing threat from Omicron.

""At some point, society has to open up. When we do open, there will be a period with a bump in infections, which is why winter is probably not the best time. But that's a decision for the policy makers, not the scientists,"" he told the Telegraph.

""Our approach has to switch, to rely on the vaccines and the boosters. The greatest risk is still the unvaccinated.""

His comments come as chief executive of the NHS Confederation Matthew Taylor warned it is still too early to know Omicron's trend.

Writing in a blog post, he said: ""Although the data around Omicron is looking positive, it's not yet reliable and won't be until this seasonal period is truly over.""

He added: ""It is only five weeks since we first heard of this new variant, and it is only now starting to affect more older and more vulnerable people. Uncertainty abounds. For example, as far as I can tell, we have absolutely no idea whether Omicron is more or less likely than earlier variants to add to the huge numbers of people dealing with Long covid.""

On Sunday, the prime minister warned it would be ""absolute folly"" to say the pandemic is over - but said Omicron ""is plainly milder"" than other variants.

Despite a huge increase in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, Mr Johnson said the UK is in a better position than most other countries due to the ""very, very high level of vaccination"".

However, he said despite Omicron being ""plainly milder"" than other variants, the NHS is under pressure due to its high transmissibility - and the public must do everything they can to help relieve that pressure by following plan B measures.

The subpoenas to Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump to testify in the investigation were disclosed in a filing with a New York state court in Manhattan on Monday.

Letitia James also subpoenaed Mr Trump to give evidence.

Trump family lawyers asked a judge who has overseen disputes related to the probe to quash the ""unprecedented and unconstitutional"" bid.

They also asked the judge to block the subpoenas until Manhattan's district attorney finishes a related criminal probe that Ms James joined in May.

Her subpoenas come as part of her nearly three-year probe into whether the Trump Organization fraudulently inflated the values of its real estate holdings to secure bank loans, then reduced their values to lower its tax bills.

The probe has focused on several Trump properties, including the Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County, New York, the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, as well as an office building in downtown Manhattan.

Alina Habba, a lawyer for Mr Trump, accused Ms James of having ""weaponised her office"" through a ""political witch hunt"" that violates the former president's constitutional rights.

""Her actions are a threat to our democracy and I plan to hold her accountable to the fullest extent,"" Ms Habba told Reuters news agency.

'Delay tactics'

Another of Mr Trump's sons, Eric Trump, was previously questioned by Ms James' office in October 2020.

The former US president turned over the Trump Organization to his adult sons and the company's long-time chief financial adviser, Allen Weisselberg, when he became president in 2017.

Ivanka Trump previously worked for the Trump Organization before serving as a senior adviser in the White House.

Ms James has accused the Trumps of employing ""delay tactics"" to impede her probe.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Khan was considering extending the scheme to cover all Class B drugs - including ketamine and speed - but this was denied by a spokesman for the mayor.

The pilot would cover three London boroughs, reported to be Lewisham, Bexley and Greenwich.

The mayor's spokesman told Sky News that Mr Khan ""firmly believes that drug use, and its related crimes, are preventable and not inevitable"".

He added: ""We know that we'll never be able to simply arrest our way out of the problem, which is why we continue to work on schemes that provide young people with support and education, rather than simply putting them through the criminal justice system - with the aim of diverting them away from drug use and crime for good.""

Funding for the scheme is yet to be approved but the Telegraph reports it will be announced later this month.

It comes after the Metropolitan Police faced criticism over the weekend for sharing a video of officers testing Londoners for drugs on a night out.

The footage posted on Twitter showed officers on the streets of Shoreditch swabbing people's hands and searching a man whose face was blurred out.

The force said it was ""part of a wider operation to ensure the night time economy was a safe place for all"" but the video prompted hundreds of comments, with many questioning the legality of the police action and comparing it to the Met's decision not to investigate alleged COVID-rule breaking parties held in Downing Street.

One Twitter user wrote: ""Bit weird, because if they had drugs already in their system it would be a historic crime and we know you don't investigate those.""

Meanwhile, media law consultant David Banks asked the force: ""A lot of people are asking under what legal power you were doing this. Can you explain?""

A day after sharing the footage, the Met Police posted a lengthy statement explaining that the drug swabbing was part of a ""week of action"" in December to protect women's safety.

The force said it worked with two licensed premises to swab people for drugs, which was a condition of entry into the venues.

""It was made clear to those wanting to attend the venues that the swabbing was voluntary,"" the Met Police said.

The taking of ""non-consensual photographs or video recordings of breastfeeding mothers"" would be made a ""specific"" voyeurism offence in England and Wales, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.

The amendment to the Police, Crime Sentencing and Court Bill was put forward by the government on Tuesday after Labour MP Stella Creasy campaigned for legal reforms after being photographed breastfeeding her then four-month-old baby on a London Overground train near Highbury and Islington.

Those found guilty could face up to two years in prison and would cover situations ""where the motive is to obtain sexual gratification or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm"".

Another amendment to the statute was put forward so domestic abuse victims will be given more time to go to the police.

Ms Creasy welcomed the amendment and said: ""That breastpests can now be stopped is testament to the hard work of campaigner Julia Cooper, Jeff Smith MP, Baroness Helene Hayman and Lord Pannick.

""It also shows why we set up the This Mum Votes Campaign to get more mums into public life - because their experiences matter and when we listen to them in decision making, life gets better for all involved.""

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said ""no new mum should be harassed in this way"".

He added: ""We are committed to doing everything we can to protect women, make them feel safer, and give them greater confidence in the justice system.""

Creating a specific offence gives ""police and prosecutors the clarity and powers they need to ensure perpetrators face justice"", the MoJ said.

Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the amendment giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults.

Currently, the time limit on common assault cases is six months, meaning a prosecution has to be brought to court within six months of the alleged office.

But that could be extended to two years as cases can involve violence or threatening behaviour that leads to fear of attack, with victims reluctant to come forward.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper put forward the amendment last year after a woman in her constituency reported ""repeated domestic abuse but was told she had run out of time and nothing could be done"".

Ms Cooper said: ""We've been putting huge pressure on the government to lift the time limit so I'm glad they have now accepted our proposal to stop victims of domestic abuse being timed out of justice.

""We will keep up the pressure for more action.""

It comes as a minister told Sky News that ""around a million people"" are currently isolating as a result of COVID-19.

""We don't actually collect that data on a daily basis, but it's obvious if you look at how many people tested positive yesterday, about 215,000, that they'll all be self-isolating and obviously from the previous days,"" health minister Gillian Keegan said.

""So it's about a million people probably are self-isolating right now.""

Record numbers of daily cases have been reported recently, as the more transmissible Omicron variant of the COVID-19 continues to spread, with reports of staff shortages in the NHS and different sectors of the economy.

Lateral flow tests 'highly effective'

People experiencing the three official COVID symptoms - a high temperature, new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste - would still be expected to get a PCR.

But Sky News understands that those who test positive on lateral flow devices but do not have these symptoms will be told they do not need to take follow-up PCR tests.

It has been reported that health officials have drawn up plans to limit PCR tests to those with symptoms, allowing those who are asymptomatic - about 40% of cases - to return to work more quickly.

People who test positive on lateral flows will still need to isolate for at least seven days, and Ms Keegan told Sky News people will need to register their positive lateral flow results.

At the moment, people without symptoms who test positive on a lateral flow are asked to order a PCR test and to only begin their isolation period when they get the second result.

This effectively requires them to isolate for longer than seven days, especially if there are delays in getting the PCR result.

It is understood the move will be announced on Wednesday.

A UK Health Security Agency spokesperson told Sky News: ""We keep everything under review and any announcement will be made in the normal way.""

Government sources said lateral flow tests are ""highly effective"" and testing capacity needs to be prioritised.

Key workers across several industries that keep the country running will be required to take daily lateral flow tests, Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday.

The prime minister said 100,000 workers in England, ""from food processing to transport to Border Force"", will have to test every day they are working from 10 January.

Meanwhile, ministers are also expected to announce that pre-departure testing will no longer be required for travellers returning to the UK.

""We cannot continue to shut down entire workforces and our economies for the benefit of unvaccinated people,"" he said.

""If you are triple-jabbed I think you should be allowed to use your fair judgment.

""We need to, as quickly as we can, get to a world where people stay at home if they feel ill, like they do when they have flu, and return to work when they feel better…Ultimately we need to get rid of the isolation period altogether.""

The tennis world number one has been held up by a visa error amid a row over his medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination rules.

Djokovic, who has repeatedly refused to say whether he has been jabbed against coronavirus, confirmed on Tuesday he had received an exemption to allow him to compete in the Australian Open.

Trouble at the border

But on landing in Melbourne, Victoria, the 20-time grand slam winner was reportedly waiting for permission to enter the country after his team had applied for a visa that does not allow for medical exemptions for being unvaccinated.

When Border Force contacted government officials in Victoria to sponsor the visa, they refused to do so.

Australian media reported that the Serbian, who has won nine titles at Melbourne Park including the last three, was quizzed by Border Force officials in a room at Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport upon landing.

But Djokovic father, Srdjan, told his country's media that his son was waiting alone in a room at the airport under armed guard for a final decision on whether he could enter Australia.

""Novak is currently in a room which no one can enter,"" he told the B92 internet portal. ""In front of the room are two policemen.""

Acting sports minister Jaala Pulford confirmed the state government was not supporting his visa application to compete in the Australian Open.

Australian Border Force to decide

Meanwhile, home affairs minister Karen Andrews clarified in a statement that the Border Force would make the final determination.

It comes after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier said the tennis champion will be ""on the next plane home"" if he is unable to provide ""acceptable proof"" for a COVID vaccination exemption to play at the Australian Open.

""He has to because if he's not vaccinated, he must provide acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and to be able to access the same travel arrangements, as fully vaccinated travellers,"" the leader added.

'Slap in the face'

Rules in Victoria, where the tournament will begin on 17 January, stated players must be double-vaccinated against COVID.

Australians have called the decision to give the tennis star a medical exemption to enter the country ""a slap in the face"" after they endured months of harsh lockdowns.

But a possible explanation is that Djokovic contracted coronavirus for a second time at some point in the last six months, having previously caught it during his Adria Tour event in Belgrade in 2020.

That would negate the need for vaccination, according to rules published last year by one of two independent medical panels involved in the decision to grant him an exemption.

Happy New Year! Wishing you all health, love & joy in every moment & may you feel love & respect towards all beings on this wonderful planet.

6278;244;244;244;367;367;COVID: People turned away from hospital and forced to barter for food in China's latest lockdowns;2022-01-05;[];['covid', 'covid-19', 'china', 'coronavirus'];"Videos and images have emerged online reportedly showing Chinese citizens being denied hospital care amid the country's zero-COVID strategy.

They appear to show a pregnant woman suffering from complications being denied entry to a hospital, and a man suffering from a heart attack also being refused care initially.

In one post, a woman put a call for help out online after her father suffered a heart attack but was refused care as he came from a medium-risk location, despite having a negative PCR result.

Image: A daughter pleads for help on social media for her father

The post was later updated, detailing that her father did finally receive treatment, but that it came too late and that he sadly died.

It is an example of the wide array of hardships experienced by the people of Xi'an, a city almost the size of London at the centre of China's latest COVID outbreak.

It has been locked down for the past two weeks after reporting more than 1,600 cases.

A second city, Yuzhou, also entered lockdown protocols on Monday night after just three asymptomatic cases were detected there.

The incidents in Xi'an have been widely shared on social media sites such as Weibo.

It was on this site that a woman posted her pregnant aunt had been refused entry to a hospital on New Year's Day despite experiencing stomach pain, as she didn't have the necessary negative PCR result.

Staff finally admitted the woman two hours later when they saw that she was bleeding, the post said. The woman unfortunately lost the baby.

Image: An image from footage captured by the pregnant woman's husband

Further hardships have been documented online.

Several posts have shown how communities are bartering for food due to shortages. The image below shows someone swapping vegetables for sanitary towels.

Image: Residents of Xi'an have begun bartering essential items

Party officials have been harsh with anyone not adhering to the lockdown.

One man was made to read a letter of apology after pandemic workers stopped him escaping over a wall as he left his community to go food shopping.

There have been reports of officials beating citizens who were out on the street without good reason. Some have also complained that inadequate quarantine facilities are being provided.

Analysis by Tom Cheshire, Asia Correspondent State media here likes to compare the West's disjointed response to COVID - and its high death tolls - to China's discipline and low case counts. China has been remarkably successful in managing COVID. But what’s happening in Xi'an shows why China's approach would be impossible in the West. It's not just a question of democratic attitudes - many Western countries' citizens have shown their resolve in putting up with harsh lockdowns. But it's possible in China in a unique way. Most people live in large compounds, which are easily sealed off. There is a huge surveillance system in place to manage them. An army of police and baoan - semi-official security guards - are already at hand to enforce restrictions. And the overriding incentive for officials is to preserve the ""dynamic zero COVID policy"" - people’s welfare comes second. And then, if there are public complaints, it's relatively easy for authorities to scrub them from the internet, in a way that would be impossible in a free country. Which makes what we're seeing from Xi'an even more remarkable. Despite the censorship, and the social pressure to follow the party line, people's desperation is enough to break through. Many commentators abroad have wondered whether China's zero COVID policy is sustainable. Most Chinese people, living a safe and COVID free life, had found that idea ridiculous. But because of Xi'an, some here are now asking the same question.

One conversation on WeChat suggests some in Xi'an have been sent to neighbouring city Weinan to quarantine, where 18 people reportedly share a room and are supplied with only a quilt and a bucket of instant noodles per day.

Yet, communities have been pulling together.

The tweet below refers to a video of someone receiving food from the local community, where a woman explains she has received meat, eggs, and vegetables in supplies.

A local Xi'an resident said in the video, her community delivered free groceries to her family, including raw chicken legs, eggs, noodles and other vegetables during lockdown. pic.twitter.com/JFVZtxMUX4 — Yawen Xu (@YawenXu17) December 30, 2021

Food exchanges have also been established and people have volunteered to help others in the pandemic.

And there is hope the situation will improve - in recent days the number of COVID cases has fallen in Xi'an, suggesting the lockdown is working.

But beyond the hyperbole, and a year to the day since the event now known simply as ""January 6th"", the reality seems troublingly far from perfect.

That day in January 2021 shook the nation.

A coup attempt? An insurrection? An effort certainly by supporters of Donald Trump to change the result of the presidential election.

Donald Trump, who had that day told supporters ""if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore"" was the subject of impeachment proceedings.

He was banned from social media, and for a time he was an outcast in the Republican Party.

But 12 months on, Team Trump is as active as ever, as defiant as ever, and Mr Trump seems to have conquered the Republican Party from the bottom up.

""As President Trump likes to say, the real insurrection was the subversion of the American people's will on 3 November,"" Liz Harrington, the former president's spokesperson, told Sky News.

""That was the theft - Jan 6 was the protest. And I mean, there were probably a million people in Washington. They went to hear a speech where President Trump said, 'Go walk peacefully'.""

Image: Trump supporters rally at the US Capitol on the fateful day last January. Pic. AP

She was quoting the former president from a rally he gave outside the White House on the day of the Capitol riot.

Mr Trump had told the crowd at the start of a long speech. ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

At the end of the long speech, he told supporters: ""And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavours have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country... And I say this despite all that's happened, the best is yet to come.""

He continued: ""So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give.""

Was that incitement?

""No,"" Ms Harrington said. ""I mean, that's nothing compared to what people on the left say. And, you know, he's speaking metaphorically.""

A committee from the House of Representatives has been tasked with investigating the events of 6 January 2021.

There have been 350 witnesses interviewed, 52 subpoenas sent and over 35,000 pages of records received.

Among the evidence published are text messages between some of Mr Trump's closest allies - sent on and around 6 January.

It has emerged that Mr Trump's own son Don Jr and Fox News presenter Sean Hannity urged the president to intervene as the scenes on Capitol Hill were beamed globally.

""He's got to condemn this s*** ASAP,"" Don Jr said in a text message to then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, adding: ""He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.""

Over the year since that day last January, Donald Trump has been busy.

Despite being banned from Twitter and Facebook, he has remained in constant campaign mode, reaching his supporters via other means.

Many of them have also abandoned Twitter and Facebook for other more niche platforms.

At the rallies, he has continued to claim - against all facts but to audiences who believe him - that the election was stolen.

His critics called it the ""Big Lie"". He has neatly repurposed the phrase and thrown it back at them.

""In our view, in my view, the Big Lie is that Joe Biden got 81 million votes - the most in history. And yet now he's at… 22% of people want him to run again? How does that exactly happen?"" Liz Harrington said.

So is Mr Trump still of the belief that he won the election in 2020?

""Yeah, absolutely,"" she said.

Of the 65 post-election legal challenges brought by Mr Trump and his allies, all but one failed because they were unable to prove their allegations.

The one challenge that was successful did not involve fraud. It involved the time allowed to fix errors on mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania; it involved a small number of boxes and didn't alter the result of the vote.

But Ms Harrington said: ""No matter how many times you count the same stuffed ballot box, it's still going to be a stuffed ballot box. Recounts are very different than audits.""

Audits have not found fraud either.

The dominant view among historians and academics - those who would be dismissed as ""the establishment"" - is that democracy itself in America is in a perilous state.

Image: Mr Trump speaks at a rally in Wellington, Ohio in June 2021. Pic: AP

""Things are not fine, at least the way I see it,"" says Thomas Zimmer, a German historian and visiting professor at Washington's Georgetown University.

""Republicans did not conclude from the 2020 election that the experiment with Trumpism had failed. On the contrary, most Republican elected officials and the clear majority of Republican voters consider Joe Biden and the Democratic presidency as fundamentally illegitimate and they remain united behind Donald Trump.""

Professor Zimmer added: ""Republicans up and down the country have arrived at a point where they look at 6 January as a blueprint, as a trial run, for the next election, as a way to hold onto power.""

Donald Trump is keeping everyone guessing on his intentions. Will he run for president again in 2024?

""That's his decision to make, and as he likes to say, he thinks he'll make a lot of people very happy,"" Liz Harrington says

""He's very engaged and wants to continue to fight on behalf of the American people.""

Image: Liz Harrington, the former president's spokesperson

If a week is a long time in politics, then a year is an eternity. But that old adage notwithstanding, right now, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which Mr Trump does not get the Republican nomination if he wants it.

He may no longer be in the global limelight, but he continues to dominate the right of politics here.

A year since January 6th, from the bottom up, Donald Trump had positioned himself as the commanding force behind the Republican Party.

His legal team is appealing the decision, which will be made by a judge at 10am on Monday.

Here Sky News looks at Australia's border restrictions and why Djokovic has had his visa cancelled.

Is Djokovic vaccinated?

The world number one has repeatedly refused to reveal whether he has been vaccinated against coronavirus or not.

While he has said he is ""not against vaccines of any kind"", he claims: ""My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don't want. For me that's unacceptable.""

Image: Djokovic stands at a booth of the Australian Border Force at Melbourne airport on 5 January 2022

In a Facebook live discussion with other Serbian athletes, he added: ""Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel.""

But he said he would ""have to make a decision"" if they become compulsory.

Djokovic contracted coronavirus in June 2020 after the Adria Tour he organised around Serbia and Croatia was criticised for a lack of COVID protocols and was ultimately cancelled due to an outbreak of cases.

What was the reason for his exemption?

The state government in Victoria, where Melbourne Park is located, mandated full vaccinations for all players, staff and fans at the Australian Open unless there is a genuine medical reason.

Tennis Australia said Djokovic's request for an exemption ""was granted following a rigorous review process involving two separate independent panels of medical experts"". The reason he sought an exemption has not been revealed.

Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said 26 players or support staff applied for exemptions and a ""handful"" were granted.

Among the acceptable grounds were acute major medical conditions, serious adverse reaction to a previous dose of a COVID vaccine or evidence of a coronavirus infection within the previous six months.

Do you have to be vaccinated to enter Australia?

According to the Australian Department of Health: ""For travel into and out of Australia, travellers must provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination status.""

Proof of two vaccine doses can be shown using the International COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate, it adds.

The only exemptions are children aged 11 and under and those who ""can't get any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines for medical reasons"".

If you have been vaccinated overseas, the jab you had must be on the Australian regulator's approved list - which includes Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Sinovac.

Image: The Serbian national won last year's Australian Open in Melbourne

The Australian border only reopened in late 2021 in line with the country's strict restrictions for containing the virus and stopping cases being imported from abroad. They have meant thousands of families being kept apart for almost two years.

Now you can only travel there if you have an exemption.

Australian citizens, permanent residents, New Zealand citizens usually resident in Australia, and their family members are all automatically exempt - but they still must be vaccinated.

From 15 December 2021, ""fully-vaccinated holders of eligible visas"" have been allowed entry, as well as those granted individual exemptions.

According to the Department of Health website: ""Individual exemptions can be requested by travellers who are not holders of an eligible visa or who are unvaccinated, holding any visa type.""

Reasons for individual exemptions include people working on the COVID-19 response, in critical sectors, sponsored foreign nationals on the 'priority migration skilled occupation list', medical and allied health students or those in their final two years of an Australian secondary school.

You can also be given an individual exemption on ""compassionate and compelling"" grounds such as a family bereavement, or if you have a ""unvaccinated prospective marriage"" visa.

All exemption applications must be completed at least two weeks before you travel and you are not advised to do so until your documents have been approved.

What have other people said about Djokovic's case?

After Djokovic posted about his medical exemption on social media, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would be on the ""next flight home"" without proof he had been vaccinated.

After his visa decision was overturned, he told the press: ""All I can say is that the evidence (for) medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient.""

Serbian President Aleksander Vucic said Djokovic's treatment amounted to ""harassment"" and that he had phoned him to offer his support.

""In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice. Novak is strong, as we all know,"" he said.

Two-time quarter-finalist Tennys Sandgren, who is not playing the Australian Open this year because of the vaccination requirement, tweeted his support.

""Just to be crystal clear here. 2 separate medical boards approved his exemption. And politicians are stopping it. Australia doesn't deserve to host a grand slam,"" he wrote.

But Djokovic's long-time rival Rafael Nadal told a news conference on Thursday: ""The world has been suffering enough not to follow the rules.

""If you are vaccinated, you can play in the Australian Open and everywhere. I think if he wanted, he would be playing here in Australia without a problem.""

Daniil Medvedev, who is ranked number two behind Djokovic, added: ""If he had a fair exemption from the rule, well, he should be here; if he didn't, he shouldn't be here.""

What will happen to Djokovic now?

The world number one is now staying in an immigration detention hotel in Melbourne as he currently does not hold a valid visa.

A judge adjourned his appeal hearing on the final decision until 10am on Monday, 10 January.

If they refuse to allow his medical exemption, he will be deported immediately.

There are still seven days between the court hearing and the start of the tournament, which is the minimum period of time after your final vaccine dose to become eligible for a travel exemption.

This would mean if he chose to get vaccinated with the single-shot Janssen jab - his documents could be rushed through in time to play the tournament on 17 January.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220106182534/https://news.sky.com/story/novak-djokovic-why-is-tennis-star-being-denied-entry-to-australia-and-what-are-their-travel-rules-12510008;sports

In a post on Instagram, the star said the book is ""MY story about MY life"" and will include details of her time as a child actress and how she coped with being a teenage mother, as well as ""breaking generational curses"" and her efforts to ""give my children the childhood and family I always wanted"".

Set for release on 18 January, it comes two months after elder sister Britney Spears' monumental overturning of her almost 14-year conservatorship in November.

After Britney's first speech in open court earlier in the year - in which the star condemned the legal arrangement and those in charge of it, including father Jamie Spears - Jamie Lynn, 30, publicly come out in support of her sister, sharing a video in which she said she was ""so proud"" of her for ""using her voice"".

The following month, Britney, 40, issued a lengthy statement on Instagram, saying: ""Never forget who ignored you when you needed them and who helped you before you even had to ask.""

Known for starring in shows including Zoey 101 and Sweet Magnolias, Jamie Lynn's memoir was originally to be titled I Must Confess: Family, Fame, and Figuring It Out - referencing lyrics from Britney's debut hit ...Baby One More Time - but has since been changed, according to US media reports.

Sharing details of the book on Thursday, Jamie Lynn, a mother of two, said: ""MY story about MY life. From being a child actress, a teen mom, a young woman, battling my mental health, falling in love, finding peace, experiencing a true MIRACLE, getting back to my faith, breaking generational curses, creating my own family, and trying my best to give my children the childhood and family I always wanted.""

Britney Spears has been reconnecting with fans more and more after speaking out in open court in June and the court's decision to end her conservatorship in November.

Until then, the star's personal and financial affairs had largely been controlled by her father and others as part of the complex arrangement that began in 2008.

In December, Britney said her years spent under the controlling conservatorship have made her ""scared"" of people and the entertainment business.

On 6 January 2021, Trump supporters stormed the complex in Washington DC.

Five people died, 15 police officers needed hospital treatment and millions of dollars worth of damage was caused.

Politicians were forced to run for safety as the mob tried to disrupt the certification of Mr Biden's election victory.

Hitting out at Trump

Following the unrest, Mr Trump was accused of encouraging rioters to march to the Capitol after falsely claiming Mr Biden's victory over him in the 2020 election was ""stolen"".

Marking the first anniversary of the insurrection, Mr Biden launched a scathing attack on Mr Trump.

Speaking from the Statuary Hall of the US Capitol, he said the former president has ""spread a web of lies"" about the election.

""He's done so because he values power over principle,"" Mr Biden said.

Mr Biden blamed the former Republican leader for the attack - which has fundamentally changed Congress and raised global concerns about the future of American democracy.

""For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,"" Mr Biden said. ""But they failed.""

He said Mr Trump ""can't accept he lost"".

""Even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own attorney general, his own vice president, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said... he lost. That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.""

Mr Biden continued: ""He has done what no president in American history has ever, ever done. He refused to accept the results of an election.""

Condemning political violence

In his address, Mr Biden also asked Americans to close their eyes and recall what they saw on this date last year.

""Democracy was attacked,"" he said. ""We the people endure. We the people prevailed.""

He described the harrowing, violent scene of the riots, including the mob attacking police, threatening the House speaker, putting up gallows threatening to hang then-vice president Mike Pence - all while then-President Trump sat at the White House watching it on TV.

""Here is God's truth about 6 January 2021,"" Mr Biden said. ""They were looking to subvert the constitution.""

He asked the nation who they wanted to be as he reflected on the deadly event.

He said: ""And so at this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be.

""Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?""

He continued: ""We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognise the truth and to live by it.""

Trump responds

The former president has released a statement in response to Mr Biden's remarks, attacking the Democrat's leadership.

He said: ""Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open borders, corrupt elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America.

Image: President Donald Trump is pictured addressing supporters before violence broke out

""This political theatre is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed.

""Our country no longer has borders, has totally and completely lost control of COVID (record numbers!), is no longer energy independent, inflation is rampant, our military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan, was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States - and so much more.""

He added that the Democrats ""want to own this day of 6 January so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through their lies and polarisations"".

Analysis by Greg Milam, US correspondent Joe Biden never once referred to Donald Trump by his name but his anger at the former president over 6 January was evident. In the same hall where hordes of protestors had trooped exactly a year ago, Mr Biden condemned Mr Trump's ""big lie"" over election fraud and for putting ""power over principle"". Mr Biden painted a vivid picture of the horrors of last year and the risks to American democracy - the ""battle for the soul of the nation"" - but it remains an open question as to who was listening. Americans have made up their minds about the election and the events of 6 January, the polls show millions still question the legitimacy of Mr Biden's win and the likelihood of further unrest. For that reason, Mr Biden's speech and the commemorations of 6 January were about elections to come, the midterms in November and the presidential election of 2024. Because Mr Trump remains a looming figure on the electoral horizon and the extent of his influence is a burning question. The wounds of 6 January are a sign of a yawning chasm in American politics and no presidential address is going to bridge that divide.

Divide between parties

A series of remembrance events will be attended by Democrats throughout the day, in person and virtually, but almost every Republican on Capitol Hill will be absent - a stark reminder of the divide between the two parties.

While most congressional Republicans condemned the attack shortly after it occurred, most have stayed loyal to Mr Trump.

In December, the former president lost a bid to shield documents from a House committee investigation into the Capitol riots.

Documents including presidential diaries, visitor logs and speech drafts were ordered to be released after an appeals court rejected Mr Trump's arguments to keep the documents sealed.

The panel investigating the riots later revealed Donald Trump Jr texted the White House chief of staff during the Capitol riot, telling him his father had to ""condemn this s*** ASAP"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220106190743/http://news.sky.com/story/joe-biden-hits-out-at-donald-trump-as-he-condemns-political-violence-to-mark-one-year-since-us-capitol-riots-12510256;politics

Boris Johnson normally avoids grovelling apologies - but 2022 is already turning out to be another annus horribilis

Boris Johnson has spent most of his political career brazening it out and avoiding mea culpa moments, even at the bumpiest of times.

So for the prime minister to begin the year offering a ""humble and sincere"" apology to his adviser on ministerial interests over his behaviour around the Downing Street flat refurbishment is arresting.

The uncharacteristic and grovelling apology nods to the effort Mr Johnson has had to put into avoiding the scandal over funding of his renovations blowing up even further at the beginning of this year.

Image: The PM came under fire from Lord Geidt for not being clear about how his Downing Street flat refurb was funded

It was less than a month ago that the Conservative Party was fined nearly £18,000 for breaching electoral law over the refurbishment of the flat - the last thing Mr Johnson needed to kick off 2022 was Lord Geidt quitting over it too.

One potential blow-up avoided, the PM is nevertheless far from turning the page on his horrendous end of 2021.

The hit to his authority and leadership sparked by his mishandling of the investigation into former Conservative MP Owen Patterson's lobbying and the scandal of No 10 Christmas parties has not gone away. Problems have been put on ice rather than resolved.

Where he has begun to claw back some credibility with his MPs is over his decision not to impose further COVID restrictions in England over the Christmas period.

Holding his nerve - some would say he had little choice faced with a restive party and cabinet - won him praise from colleagues in the chamber this week.

The unpredictable, angry and rebellious mood on the benches that punctuated the end of last term has been replaced by studied scrutiny, and in the Commons this week the PM looked more poised than he has for weeks.

If he can ride the wave of Omicron in the coming few weeks (something the PM himself says will be ""very challenging"") without introducing more restrictions, Mr Johnson will no doubt feel emboldened and surely want to claim credit for leadership from a parliamentary party distinctly unimpressed with him and his No 10 operation of late.

But, with at least 24 hospital trusts now declaring a critical incident over Omicron strains, it is going to be a bumpy ride which could see the PM having to impose measures once more, however politically difficult that may be.

And even if he can ride this Omicron wave, he is still faced with the outcome of the independent investigation into the No 10 Christmas parties during COVID lockdowns of 2020, which could be another hammer blow for a prime minister whose reputation with the public has been seriously - perhaps irreparably - damaged.

Image: Two dozen hospital trusts have declared critical incidents as Omicron cases soar

The government - something ministers are acutely, painfully, aware of - is also facing a cost of living crisis on the back of rising fuel bills and inflation.

There was a reason that all opposition politicians used the first Prime Minister's Questions of the year to quiz Mr Johnson on the cost of living - they expect this to be the issue at the top of the public's agenda, and the government's most pressing problem, in the coming months.

There is no doubt that Mr Johnson has come back in 2022 with a fresh haircut and an air of determination about turning his fortunes around. But what his MPs are watching now isn't just how he performs, but the polls.

On current polling, up to 100 MPs who won seats helped along by Mr Johnson's patronage in 2019 are heading for defeat in the next general election.

If they conclude this prime minister cannot turn around their fortunes - the May local elections will be a litmus test - in the coming months, they may decide the party needs to change course.

That is something openly discussed between those MPs in those marginal seats. One of them told me this week they thought there was a one in three chance that Mr Johnson would face a leadership challenge this year.

So while the PM will be hugely relieved to turn the page on 2021 and begin 2022 holding on to Lord Geidt, another annus horribilis has only just begun.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220106200733/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-normally-avoids-grovelling-apologies-but-2022-is-already-turning-out-to-be-another-annus-horribilis-12510517;politics

But that's not the case for the Golden Globes in 2022.

The ceremony that kick-starts the awards race, usually the biggest in the run-up to the Oscars, is going to look very different after making headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2021, with criticism over diversity among its membership and allegations of inappropriate freebies being given to influence votes.

Image: Ricky Gervais has hosted the awards ceremony several times and is known for his acerbic takedowns of Hollywood stars

Despite the nominations being announced in December, the format of the 2022 show remains pretty unclear with just days to go.

Front-runners include Kenneth Branagh's Belfast, Jane Campion's Power Of The Dog and Steven Spielberg's West Side Story in the film categories, while Succession, The Morning Show and Ted Lasso are all nominated in several TV categories.

And Denzel Washington, Lady Gaga, Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman, Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kristen Stewart, Jason Sudeikis, Brian Cox and Jennifer Aniston are just some of the stars nominated in the acting categories.

But will the winners accept their awards, virtually at least if not in person? Here's what happened in 2021 - and what has changed for 2022.

Membership criticism

In February 2021, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - the organisation behind the Golden Globes - faced significant criticism after it emerged none of its members were black.

At the time, the voting body was made up of around 80 members, none of whom were black, a report in the Los Angeles Times found.

The HFPA quickly issued a statement to say it was working on ""an action plan"" to recruit black members and the ceremony went ahead in March rather than its usual January date, with the delay caused by the pandemic.

The Emily In Paris controversy

As well as diversity, questions were also raised around alleged discriminatory practices and whether relationships with Hollywood studios influenced the choice of nominees and winners.

The Los Angeles Times exposé reported on a ""culture of corruption"" at the HFPA, which included members ""exchanging votes for perks and access [to celebrities]"".

When it was revealed that the somewhat criticised Lily Collins series Emily In Paris - widely regarded as fun but lightweight - had scored two major nods, while Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed I May Destroy You had been snubbed, there was outcry on social media - even an Emily In Paris writer had something to say about it, writing an opinion piece for the Guardian.

In its report, the LA Times claimed that the Paramount Network, which produces Emily In Paris, had treated several Golden Globes voters to a lavish set visit that included a five-star hotel stay, with rooms costing about $1,400 (about £1,033) a night.

The backlash

Image: Tom Cruise reportedly handed back his three Golden Globes won in previous years. Pic: AP

In May 2021, the Globes' broadcast network, NBC, which had aired the awards for several years, said it would not be showing the ceremony in 2022.

Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise reportedly returned his three Golden Globe awards for his roles in Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born On The Fourth Of July in protest.

And Scarlett Johansson said she would no longer work with the HFPA unless it made significant changes, while platforms including Netflix, Amazon Studios, WarnerMedia and dozens of Hollywood's top publicity companies also called for reform.

Sky News understands that Netflix still does not believe the HFPA has gone far enough in its reforms, and that it did not enter any of its content for submission, despite the numerous nominations.

HFPA member Husam Asi gave a rare interview to Sky News, admitting a need for reform and saying bosses should be held accountable for the lack of diversity in the organisation.

Audience numbers for the ceremony had plummeted to less than six million US viewers - down from 18.4 million in 2020 - following a difficult year for the industry caused by COVID restrictions.

After particularly scathing take-downs by host Gervais in 2020, and the poor viewing figures in 2021, could the controversial history of the HFPA be the final nail in the coffin? Is real change in Hollywood on the horizon? Or will this be a one-off?

What's changed?

Image: Succession is a favourite in the TV categories. Pic: Sky UK/ HBO

The HFPA says it has worked ""tirelessly"" to make change and has ""completely overhauled its bylaws, implementing sweeping changes from top to bottom addressing ethics and code of conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, membership and more"".

The organisation said it admitted its largest and most diverse class to date in October, with 21 new and ""predominantly diverse"" journalists joining as members, and almost half its members are women.

""There are now people of colour involved in decision-making throughout the organisation - from major board decisions, to credentialing and selecting new members,"" it has said.

It has also brought in a ban on gift-giving from studios to its membership, in an effort to stop them apparently trying to influence the board.

Where and when does the ceremony take place?

Image: Few details have been released about who might be attending this year's ceremony

Despite the backlash this year, the HFPA has pressed ahead with the awards and the ceremony will be held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, starting at 6pm local time on Sunday (2am on Monday in the UK).

Who's hosting?

That, we don't know. Details are yet to be released, if there is even a host at all.

How can I watch?

Again, we don't know. Still waiting for the HFPA to get back to us on that one. With NBC dropped the ceremony and no other broadcasters coming forward to pick it up, we're not sure - watch this space.

Which celebs will be there?

You might be sensing a pattern here... we don't know. Hollywood stars have been largely silent on the nominations this year, and the HFPA - usually keen to highlight in advance the vast array of celebs confirmed for the red carpet - has not provided details.

However, it has confirmed there will be no red carpet this year, which gives the impression it's going to be a low-key night.

Sky News has contacted several nominees to see if they will be accepting their awards, even if only through social media.

But we do know who's nominated!

This, we can tell you. The films up for best drama are Belfast, CODA, Dune, King Richard and Power Of The Dog, while Cyrano, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, tick, tick... BOOM! and West Side Story are in the running for best musical or comedy.

In the TV categories, Lupin, The Morning Show, Pose, Squid Game and Succession are nominated for best drama, while The Great, Hacks, Only Murders In The Building, Ted Lasso and Reservation Dogs make up the shortlist for best musical/comedy series, and Dopesick, Impeachment: American Crime Story, Maid, Mare Of Easttown and The Underground Railroad all have nods for best motion picture.

For more on the nominees, see our complete list here.

What about COVID?

The rise of the Omicron variant has spoiled the party even more. The HFPA has said there will be no audience at the ceremony, with precautions being taken for ""select members and grantees"" who will be in the room.

They will need proof of vaccination and booster shot, along with a negative PCR test within 48 hours, and all guests will have to wear masks and be socially distanced.

What else has the HFPA said?

Not much. In a statement confirming when the winners will be announced, it said that in addition to the awards the ceremony ""will shine a light on the long-established philanthropy work of the HFPA"".

The organisation has donated $50m (about £37m) to more than 70 entertainment-related charities, film restoration, scholarship programs and humanitarian efforts over the past 25 years, ""many of whom were hit hard over the last two years as a result of the pandemic"", it said.

During the event, Kyle Bowser, senior vice president of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) Hollywood Bureau, will discuss the Reimagine Coalition - a joint five-year initiative to increase diversity, equity and inclusion across the global entertainment industry.

""Each year the HFPA and the NAACP Hollywood Bureau will collaborate on, fund, and support a series of trailblazing initiatives, with the overall goals of ensuring visibility of projects from artists of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; increasing diverse representation in the industry; and building pathways to inclusion for young artists and journalists of colour,"" the HFPA said.

Thirty-two experts will spend more than two months on board an American research ship to explore the crucial area where the enormous, melting Thwaites Glacier meets the sea.

The Britain-sized glacier has earned the nickname the ""doomsday glacier"" because of the threat its melting would pose to the world, with the potential to raise sea levels eventually by more than two feet.

It is already shedding around 50 billion tons of ice into the water a year and the British Antarctic Survey says it is responsible for 4% of global sea rise.

Given its potential to profoundly impact all parts of the world, the US and the UK are in the midst of a joint £37m mission to study Thwaites, the widest glacier in the world by land and sea.

It lies east of Antarctica's peninsula, far from any of the continent's research stations.

""Thwaites is the main reason I would say that we have so large an uncertainty in the projections of future sea level rise and that is because it's a very remote area, difficult to reach,"" said Anna Wahlin, an oceanographer from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

Speaking from the Research Vessel Nathaniel B Palmer, which was scheduled to leave its port in Chile hours later, she added: ""It is configured in a way so that it's potentially unstable. And that is why we are worried about this.""

The glacier is particularly vulnerable to melt because it is being melted from beneath by warming ocean water, it is losing its grip on the area where it attaches to the seabed, and it is breaking into hundreds of fractures, with some as long as six miles.

Ms Wahlin's team will use two robot ships - her own large one called Ran which she used in 2019 and the more agile Boaty McBoatface, the crowdsource named drone that could go further under the area of Thwaites that protrudes over the ocean - to get under the glacier.

Prospect of thundersnow

Forecasters are warning snow showers and lightning strikes could disrupt travel and cause power outages.

The prospect of thundersnow - a relatively rare phenomenon - is driven by the same conditions which cause thunder in the summer, the difference in temperature between the ground and the air surrounding it.

Robinson said: ""Thundersnow will remain a risk in the far North West, especially for northwest Scotland and Northern Ireland.

""Meanwhile, more general rain and hill snow will move into the windy South West.""

Coldest night of the winter so far

A temperature of -8C (17.6F) was recorded on Thursday morning in Topcliffe in North Yorkshire, making it the lowest temperature recorded in England this winter.

Blustery conditions made the temperatures feel colder for many throughout the day as air from the Canadian Arctic swept across the UK.

Milder weekend

The Met Office has forecast milder conditions going into the weekend.

A spell of wet and windy weather is forecast across all parts of the UK on Saturday, with heavy rain likely in most areas.

Sunshine and scattered showers will replace the rain across western areas by the afternoon.

Sunday is expected to be mostly dry with spells of sunshine across most parts, with some showers forecast for northwest Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Robinson said: ""It will be colder tonight than the one just gone. Expect a widespread frost across northern, eastern and central Britain, with icy stretches possible. Temperatures will rise in the West ahead of rain moving in.

""Saturday will be milder than recently, with temperatures above average for Wales and much of England. Expect an early high of 10-12C (50-53F) in the South West and around 6-9C (43-48F) in the North.

""Sunday will see temperatures around a degree or two down on Saturday, but it will probably feel warmer with more sunshine and lighter winds.

6421;389;389;389;550;550;COVID-19: France braces for protests as anger grows over tighter rules on COVID passes;2022-01-08;['amar mehta', '@amarjournalist_'];['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'france'];"Thousands across France are set to take to the streets today to protest against changes to the country's COVID-19 pass regulations.

Government officials confirmed on Tuesday that they plan to enact a law which would effectively block unvaccinated people from hospitality venues.

Until now, France has enforced coronavirus health pass, requiring people to show proof of a recent negative test or proof of vaccination for entry into restaurants, cafes and cinemas, as well as to board trains.

Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world

The new change will remove the option of showing a negative test, meaning unvaccinated people will be barred from hospitality venues or trains.

What are the changes?

France introduced a health pass last year that prevents people without a negative PCR test or proof of vaccination from entering hospitality venues, inter-regional trains and buses, and domestic flights.

But it now wants to turn the pass into a vaccine passport, which means only fully vaccinated people will have access.

""I won't send (the unvaccinated) to prison,"" President Emmanuel Macron said. ""I won't vaccinate by force. So we need to tell them, from 15 January, you won't be able to go to the restaurant anymore, you won't be able to down one, won't be able to have a coffee, go to the theatre, the cinema.""

Those opposed to vaccination undermine ""the strength of a nation"", Mr Macron added.

How is Omicron spreading across the world?

The plans have faced strong opposition from anti-vaccination campaigners and far-right and far-left groups, but have been backed by the government.

Protests are expected to take place across France today, with demonstrators opposing the latest COVID pass changes.

Violent protests broke out in Guadeloupe and Martinique, both French Caribbean territories, back in November when Mr Macron brought in a requirement for all healthcare workers to be vaccinated, a measure that is still in force in mainland France.

Macron wants to 'p*** off' anti-vaxxers

President Macron was quoted earlier this week in Le Parisien saying that he wants to ""p*** off"" unvaccinated people.

Image: Macron said he wants to ""p*** off"" unvaccinated people

Speaking to the newspaper, he said: ""The unvaccinated, I really want to p*** them off. And so, we're going to continue doing so, until the end. That's the strategy.""

Opponents to the plans have accused Mr Macron of behaviour unbecoming of a president. Opposition lawmaker Sebastien Jumel said the president ""deliberately chose to add hysteria to the debate"".

Macron is facing re-election in April. He hasn't yet declared his candidacy, but his intentions of doing so are becoming ever clearer. In the Le Parisien interview, he said: ""There is no false suspense. I want to.""

COVID-19 cases could reach peak in 10 days

On 7 January, Professor Alain Fischer, an official responsible for France's COVID vaccine strategy, warned that the peak would come ""primarily towards the beginning of the second fortnight of January, so if we work it out this would be in around 10 days' time"".

He also told France's LCI TV: ""I think we are coming to the peak of this new wave.""

The government now wants to turn this pass into a vaccine passport, which means only the fully vaccinated will have access.

Coronavirus patients are taking up more than 72% of France's intensive care unit beds, and most of them are unvaccinated.

There are more than 20,000 people hospitalised with the virus - a number that has been increasing steadily for weeks but not as sharply as the country's cases.

France registered 261,481 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, which was less than the record of more than 332,000 that was set on Wednesday.

The Australian newspaper reported that the world tennis number one has been denied any ""special treatment"" during his stay in immigration custody.

Djokovic is spending a third day in a Melbourne hotel that has doubled up as an immigration detention facility - a couple of miles from the luxury hotels where most Australian Open players are staying.

He is currently embroiled in a row over whether he is exempt from the country's COVID vaccination rules, and is facing deportation after his visa was cancelled.

Why is Djokovic being denied entry to Australia - and what are their travel rules?

Lawyers representing the 34-year-old are planning to appeal in court on Monday.

A summary of their case has indicated he tested positive for COVID-19 on 16 December and he had a valid visa and medical exemption from the organiser of the Australian Open.

He has also requested alternative accommodation so he could train for the tournament which starts on 17 January.

Djokovic, who has expressed scepticism about coronavirus vaccines in the past, wrote on Instagram yesterday: ""Thank you to the people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated.""

The furore meant the Serbian tennis star was unable to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on Friday - an important religious holiday.

A priest from the Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church in Melbourne had attempted to visit Djokovic, but was turned down by immigration officials because the hotel is under lockdown.

Supporters of the nine-time Australian Open champion have gathered outside the Park Hotel, waving banners as he remains cooped up inside.

'Maggots and mould in our bread'

About 30 asylum seekers are being housed one floor above Djokovic in the Park Hotel - and some of them have been held there for two years.

They were moved to Melbourne after being evacuated for medical treatment from Australia's controversial detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.

Even before Djokovic's arrival, the hotel had hit headlines amid allegations that maggots and mould were in the bread given to detainees.

The 32-year-old, who is originally from Iran, added: ""We are refugees, we are innocent people - we've not committed any crime. They just keep me like hostage here.""

The third and fourth floors of the Park Hotel were damaged by fire on 23 December - and during an evacuation, some asylum seekers ended up becoming infected with COVID because they were held together with quarantining passengers who had tested positive.

'Challenging weeks' ahead

Daily numbers of coronavirus infections in Australia are repeatedly breaking records as the Omicron variant spreads.

An unprecedented 45,098 new infections were reported in New South Wales, the country's most populous state, on Saturday - up from 38,625 the day before.

The surge has prompted New South Wales to reintroduce some restrictions, with dancing and singing in pubs and nightclubs now prohibited.

Health officials in the state believe cases may only peak at the end of January, warning: ""We have got some challenging weeks ahead of us. But we have been planning for this pandemic and continuing to reinvent ourselves for two years now.""

Wiltshire Police said it had already started ""obtaining statements and securing CCTV"" as part of its inquiries.

Swindon Town condemned the abuse and sent its ""heartfelt apologies"" to Mr Cole, adding that it was working with the police force to find those responsible.

""Racism has no place in the world and it is incredibly heartbreaking that this still has a place in our game.""

He added that those responsible will be ""punished accordingly"".

6450;418;418;418;590;590;Nearly half of Conservative members think Rishi Sunak would make better party leader than Boris Johnson - poll;2022-01-09;['sam coates', '@samcoatessky'];['boris johnson', 'conservatives', 'liz truss', 'rishi sunak'];"Almost half of all Tory members now believe that Rishi Sunak would make a better leader and could win more seats at the next election than Boris Johnson, an exclusive poll for Sky News has found.

A third of the Tory membership now think Mr Johnson should stand down as Tory leader. Almost four in 10 say they think he is doing a bad job.

Both findings mark a substantial increase in disaffection amongst members of the Conservative Party compared to the early stage of the pandemic.

The results come in a YouGov poll of 1,005 Tory members for Sky News conducted between 30 December and 6 January, the first such survey since July 2020.

What else does the poll reveal?

The data reveals how the overwhelming enthusiasm for Mr Johnson in the first year of his premiership is now waning, with members questioning whether Mr Sunak, the chancellor, or Foreign Secretary Liz Truss may be a better prospect in Number 10.

Problematically for Mr Johnson, his reputation as a vote winner is now being challenged by his own party, with less than a quarter of members saying the prime minister would be more successful than Ms Truss at the next general election, and just 16% saying that he would perform better than Mr Sunak

The poll found that the proportion who think Mr Johnson is doing ""well"" as prime minister has dropped from 85% in July 2020 to 61% today, while the proportion thinking he is doing ""badly"" increased to 38%, up from 5%.

In a sign that questions about the PM's probity are starting to affect the view of the Tory membership, 39% say he cannot be trusted to tell the truth, not much less than the 45% who say he can be trusted with the truth.

This has translated into questions amongst Tory party members over whether Mr Johnson should stay in office.

While 59% think he should remain as Tory leader, 34% say he should stand down, up from 9% in July 2020.

Regardless of their individual view, there are clearly doubts Mr Johnson will make it to the next election in 2023 or 2024: 47% say he is likely to be leader next time the country goes to the polls, 45% say it is unlikely.

Who do party members think should replace the PM?

Asked who they want to replace Mr Johnson in the event he stood down, only Mr Sunak and Ms Truss appear a long way ahead of possible rivals.

The chancellor comes top with 33% of the vote, Ms Truss on 25%, ex-foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt 8%, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove 6%, Sajid Javid 5% and Priti Patel joint with Dominic Raab on 4%.

A total of 46% of Tory members think Mr Sunak would be a better Tory leader than Mr Johnson, and only 16% worse, with identical proportions - 46% - thinking he'd do better than Mr Johnson against Labour in an election.

Ms Truss fares almost as well: 39% think Ms Truss would be better than Mr Johnson and 22% worse, with 33% thinking she'd do better against Labour at the next election and 24% worse.

Ms Truss fares better amongst Brexit voters than Mr Sunak, but the chancellor, who supported Brexit in 2016, appears to be able to appeal to Tory members who voted Remain.

A total of 63% of Tory members who voted Remain think Mr Sunak would be a better Tory leader than Mr Johnson, with only 6% saying he would be worse.

Mr Sunak also scores very strongly amongst members in Scotland and Wales, and does best amongst the under 50s.

Meanwhile, Europe experienced its hottest summer ever, in a season that saw extreme heatwaves in the Mediterranean, vicious wildfires in Greece and dramatic flooding in central Europe.

Preliminary analysis of satellite measurements by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service found that polluting greenhouse gas concentrations continued to rise during 2021.

Carbon emissions from wildfires in a year that saw blazes across North America, Europe and the Arctic amounted to 1850 megatonnes, fuelled especially by those in Siberia.

'A punch in the face'

Prof Rowan Sutton from Reading University said we should see the record-breaking weather events in 2021 such as the heatwave in Canada and floods in Germany ""as a punch in the face to make politicians and public alike wake up to the urgency of the climate emergency"".

And the continued increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere ""screams out that the underlying causes have yet to be addressed,"" he said.

Levels of climate-heating gases carbon dioxide and methane continued to rise in 2021, Copernicus said.

However they do not yet understand why levels of methane - a particularly potent short-term heating gas - are so high high. Its origin is hard to identify as it has many sources, from human-driven ones such as the exploitation of oil and gas fields, to natural sources such as wetlands.

'Nail in the coffin'

Professor Sir Brian Hoskins from Imperial College London said it has become ""difficult to say something new each time we see signs of another nail in the planetary coffin"".

He called the data ""yet another warning of what we are doing to our planetary home"".

""Real action to curb our greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and globally is desperately needed.""

Lars Findsen, 57, is among four current and former employees of the Danish intelligence services who were detained in December over the alleged leak.

Now Findsen is the only suspect to remain in custody while the Danish authorities continue to investigate.

Unconfirmed reports by state broadcaster DR suggest classified material was being passed on to Danish media outlets.

However, the case is being conducted behind closed doors - meaning the exact charges and details of the sensitive information have not been divulged publicly.

At a hearing in Copenhagen on Monday, Findsen described the situation as ""completely insane"".

He told reporters: ""I want the charges brought forward and I plead not guilty.""

Image: Lars Findsen, pictured second row far left, among foreign and defence ministers.

The news was revealed by Danish media after the court lifted a reporting ban.

A judge is due to decide how long Findsen will remain in detention.

DR claimed in 2020 that the Danish Defence Intelligence Service shared raw data from information cables with the US National Security Agency - potentially giving the organisation access to Danish citizens' personal data and private communications.

The public prosecutor's office in Denmark has declined to comment on the case.

In a separate case, the spy chief and four other officials were suspended in August 2020 after facing accusations of serious wrongdoing by an independent board overseeing the intelligence unit.

But the suspensions were lifted after an investigating commission rebuffed the allegations.

The charges are set to be the subject of a separate trial but prosecutors said scrapping the case would help victims get ""closure"" and avoid the ""trauma of testifying again"".

The offer to dismiss the charges came in a letter on Monday night to District Judge Alison Nathan.

Maxwell is alleged to have lied about her knowledge of Epstein's behaviour in a separate civil lawsuit in 2016. Each charge carries a maximum five-year jail sentence.

Maxwell, 60, was found guilty last month of trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and faces up to 65 years in jail.

She was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for Epstein to molest in massage rooms between 1994 and 2004 at his various properties.

In the letter, prosecutors also asked the judge to sentence Maxwell in about three to four months' time.

Defence lawyers oppose laying down any timetable as they have called for a retrial in the main case after two jurors who convicted her said they were sexually abused.

'Incontrovertible grounds for new trial'

They told Judge Nathan that the issue ""presents incontrovertible grounds for a new trial"".

Maxwell's lawyer's have been given until 19 January to formally explain their grounds for overturning the conviction. Prosecutors will have until 2 February to respond.

The prime minister and his wife Carrie are understood to have been among 40 people in attendance at the event in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, when outdoor gatherings were banned in England.

Answering an urgent question tabled by Labour about the party, Paymaster General Michael Ellis told MPs he has ""confidence"" in Mr Johnson's ""integrity and honour"".

Facing relentless heckles and laughter from opposition benches in the Commons, Mr Ellis said the PM ""takes this matter very seriously"" and repeated that an investigation is taking place which will include the gatherings on 15 May and 20 May 2020.

Senior civil servant Sue Gray is leading the ongoing inquiry into multiple allegations of COVID rule-breaking in Downing Street and other government buildings.

""It will establish the facts and if wrongdoing is established there will be requisite disciplinary action taken,"" Mr Ellis said of the investigation, adding that it ""would not be appropriate"" for him to comment further while it is ongoing.

To further laughter, Mr Ellis told the Commons: ""It is clear that in this country the same rules apply to everyone.""

""The prime minister is going nowhere. He retains the confidence of the people of this country,"" the paymaster general later added when asked directly if such a gathering in the Downing Street garden would have broken the government's own coronavirus rules in place at the time.

But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner, who had asked the PM to answer the urgent question, said Mr Johnson's absence from the Commons ""speaks volumes"".

""I think his absence speaks volumes as does his smirks on the media, the public have already drawn their own conclusions. He can run but he can't hide,"" Ms Rayner said, adding that there is ""no need for an investigation"".

""If the prime minister was there, surely he knew,"" she continued.

In response, Mr Ellis said ""there is a need"" for an investigation ""and that need is clear"".

The UK's largest airport said ""swiftly imposed"" action during the month to tackle the Omicron variant in the run-up to the festive season prompted uncertainty among travellers who faced additional bills for costly PCR tests.

It added that there was now significant doubt on when demand would return despite the subsequent lifting of UK rules last week governing pre-departure coronavirus testing for people arriving in the country.

People also no longer have to isolate until they get a negative PCR test, but will instead have to take a lateral flow test at the end of day two after arriving.

Heathrow urged governments to go further to help the wider travel sector gain traction.

Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: ""There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be reimposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away.""

Heathrow said it carried fewer passengers in 2021 than in 2020 when the crisis first took hold - with lockdowns globally forcing it to cut jobs and report a £2bn annual loss.

It said that 19.4 million passengers used the airport in 2021 - less than one quarter of the total for the pre-pandemic year of 2019.

The same day the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was pictured eating cheese and drinking wine in the gardens of Downing Street despite lockdown rules.

Mrs Jones told Sky News she feels a range of emotions on learning the news about the party.

""I feel upset, angry and also stupid that we followed the rules so closely. We felt it was so important to do so,"" she said.

""What is particularly infuriating now is that evidence is really mounting and it feels like it's time for the prime minister to put his hands up and accept and acknowledge that what they did was very wrong and very insulting to all those people, or families like ourselves, who made enormous sacrifices.""

Downing Street lockdown party: What were the COVID rules on May 2020?

Ruby had been treated for blood cancer for 10 months and was getting better.

Three weeks before she died, however, Ruby relapsed - and by that stage she was out of options.

Her mother said: ""We were lucky in that she was at home so she was able to see me, her father and her sister.

""But we were the only people other than hospice care staff who came in to look after her who she could see during that time.

""She couldn't say goodbye to her friends or grandparents, or cousins.

Image: Ruby Fuller was unable to say goodbye to her grandparents, cousins or friends in person due to lockdown restrictions

""They had to say goodbye on Zoom. That was very hard for Ruby but also for her friends and our family.

""And we did that because those were the rules. Now it appears those rules were for everybody except the government.

""We deserve better than this.""

If Ruby was alive now she would be ""absolutely spitting mad"", Mrs Jones said.

""She asked to be remembered by the motto Live Kindly, Live Loudly.

""She believed that being kind was the most important thing but she also believed very strongly in calling out injustice.

The family has set up a special fund in memory of Ruby, named ""Live Kindly, Live Loudly"", to raise money for research into T-cell lymphoma and leukaemia, which has so far raised more than £122,000.

Lord Evans, chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, gave a damning assessment of Boris Johnson's government's approach to standards and ethics as it faces another allegation of having a party at Number 10 while the country was locked down in 2020.

The former MI5 chief told MPs: ""We have seen a whole series of issues over the last few months: the Owen Paterson affair, the attempt to change the rules over standards investigations in the middle of the investigation into Mr Paterson's actions, the questions around the redecoration of Downing Street and particularly the very bad processes that were clearly in place for keeping Lord Geidt properly informed, the Greensill affair and now 'partygate'.

""All of those I think have demonstrated that there is at least a carelessness amongst people in government over standards issues, and possibly more than that.""

Image: Former minister Owen Paterson was caught up in a standards scandal last year for breaching lobbying rules

He said media reports and polling over the past few months show ""people are concerned about these issues"".

""People care and feel that those people who are representing them in parliament, those people who are being paid to undertake public roles should be living up to the standards that they profess to live up to,"" he added.

Hours before Lord Evans' appearance in front of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, a senior Conservative told Sky News claims Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie attended a drinks event at No 10 in May 2020 were ""indefensible"".

Less than an hour before the alleged garden party happened, the public was told from a room in Number 10 that they must adhere to the strict lockdown rules, which included a ban on outdoor group gatherings.

A Whitehall investigation into multiple allegations of coronavirus rule-breaking in both Number 10 and other government buildings has now been widened to include two alleged events on 15 and 20 May 2020.

Lord Evans also told the committee all methods of communication - including WhatsApp messages - regarding official business should be covered under disclosure requirements when being investigated.

Last week, the PM's independent standards' adviser Lord Geidt told of his ""grave concern"" about not being made aware of WhatsApp messages between Mr Johnson and a Tory donor while investigating how the PM's Downing Street flat was funded.

The PM had said he only discovered who had funded the refurb in February 2021, but the WhatsApp messages revealed Lord Brownlow accepting his request for more money for the flat in November 2020.

Lord Evans hit out at the use of WhatsApp by ministers, telling the committee: ""There is a responsibility on anybody who is conducting public business to be able to give an account of that.

""In principle, it doesn't seem like a very good idea for substantive public business to be being transacted on WhatsApp but you have to live in the real world and it probably is.

""I personally felt there may be other technical solutions that are better than WhatsApp for this purpose but that's beyond my remit.

""It is absolutely clear the responsibility is if you are conducting public business then there needs to be public accountability for that, irrespective of which channel you choose.

Miranda Fryer was the first to appear as the on-screen daughter of Kerry Bishop and adopted father Joe Mangel (Linda Hartley-Clark and Mark Little), arriving on Ramsay Street with her mum in 1989, aged 18 months, and starring in the soap for three years.

Following the character's departure from Neighbours, the part was recast as a teenager, played by Stephanie McIntosh.

Ms Fryer died in her sleep, aged 34, on 6 January, her family told TV Tonight in Australia.

According to their report, she was the first child actor ever contracted to the show, and was popular with cast and crew.

As an adult, she had completed a degree in nursing during the pandemic, and married her husband Arthur Pothitis in November 2020.

In a statement published by TV Tonight, her family said: ""True soulmates, Miranda and Arthur were making plans to start their family, when one day last week she went to sleep and never woke up. We do not know why.

""She had had some health issues with her heart, maybe her beautiful persona was just too good for this world of ours. We, who all loved her so much, shall treasure the memories she has left us with and mourn our loss forever.

""A beautiful child, stunning teenager, beautiful inside, and out... a woman, with so much love and happiness given and received. So many friends, so much still to offer this world, gone.""

Casting director and assistant producer Jan Russ, who worked on Neighbours from its launch in 1985 until 2008, according to IMDB, told TV Tonight: ""I feel so very sad to lose one of my cast and especially one so young as Miranda who spent her very young years on the show... I love them like my own and feel the loss when they pass.""

Russia, he insisted, has no intention to invade Ukraine. That is in the present tense. Of course, that could change if events do.

Ambassador Andrei Kelin also insisted that Russian troops need to be able to conduct exercises and be able ""to deter any kind of threat"". One of the big fears is of a confected casus belli.

Ukraine: We will defend ourselves against Russia 'until the last drop of blood', says country's army chief

Russian forces in the east of Ukraine, for instance, clash with Ukrainian troops and use that as an excuse to launch a much bigger military operation. Russian intentions would then be changed.

Ambassador Kelin also made much of NATO aggression.

NATO has pushed Ukraine to be aggressive and ""aggressively expanded closer and closer to our borders,"" he said.

An organisation that presents itself as defensive is seen as offensive by Moscow.

What was missing from the ambassador's comments was the thinly-veiled threat we heard yesterday here in Geneva from Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov.

He warned of unspecified consequences for security on the entire continent of Europe if Russian demands on NATO, Eastern Europe and Ukraine are not met. That sounded ominous.

Ambassador Kelin was sounding more conciliatory than the minister.

An investigation has been launched into a number of the alleged events that took place in Whitehall and Downing Street while COVID-19 rules were in force throughout 2020.

It was originally supposed to be led by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. But he has since been forced to recuse himself from heading the investigation after it was revealed a Christmas event was held in his own private office in December 2020.

The inquiry is now being led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, a former government ethics chief.

The investigation will cover the newest allegations of ""socially distanced drinks"" in the Downing Street garden on 20 May during the first national lockdown.

And it will look into the reported festive bash in Number 10 on 18 December, which initially triggered the ""partygate"" controversy and has led to a growing number of claims being made.

Ms Gray's inquiry might also include a number of other events that are alleged to have taken place.

What are the alleged events?

• 15 May 2020

The prime minister is reported to have joined Number 10 staff for a gathering in Downing Street.

According to both the Guardian and Independent, Mr Johnson was present for around 15 minutes and told one aide inside Number 10 that they deserved a drink for ""beating back"" coronavirus.

It was reported that about 20 staff drank wine and spirits and ate pizza following a COVID-19 news conference that day.

Some were said to have been in offices inside Number 10 while others went into the Downing Street garden.

An image published by The Guardian allegedly shows Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie drinking wine with the prime minister's key aide, Martin Reynolds, on the garden terrace that day.

Sources were quoted as saying that some staff drank until late into the evening.

Matt Hancock, who was then health secretary and had earlier that afternoon delivered the 5pm Downing Street news conference, was also claimed to have been seen at one point.

But both publications said there was no suggestion that either Mr Johnson or Mr Hancock drank alcohol themselves, or stayed late.

Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's former chief adviser, has insisted the photograph of himself, Mr Johnson, Mrs Johnson with the couple's newborn baby, and Mr Reynolds was not an example of rule breaking but was instead the continuation of a Number 10 meeting.

• 20 May 2020

Number 10 staff were invited to a some ""socially distanced drinks"" to ""make the most of the lovely weather"" during the first national lockdown, according to a leaked email seen by ITV News.

Mr Johnson and Carrie are understood to have been among attendees instructed to ""bring your own booze"" to the event by Mr Reynolds.

The email reads: ""Hi all, After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!""

Just an hour earlier Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden had given a Downing Street news briefing, telling people they could ""meet one other person from outside their household"" in a public place outside, providing social distancing was maintained.

It is believed that about 40 staff took up the invitation, with pressure mounting on Mr Johnson to address whether he attended or not.

The Metropolitan Police said it is ""aware"" of the reports and is in ""contact with the Cabinet Office"" over the matter.

Mr Cummings left Number 10 clutching a box of his belongings, halfway through England's second national lockdown.

According to Mr Cummings, despite the national lockdown, a party then took place in the Downing Street flat where the prime minister lives with his wife.

Number 10 has denied this.

The Times has also reported that separately that evening, the PM gave a leaving speech for his outgoing communications chief Lee Cain.

• 25 November 2020

The Treasury has confirmed ""impromptu drinks"" occurred when England was locked down due to rising coronavirus cases.

The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on November 25 last year, while officials worked on the autumn Spending Review.

A Treasury spokesman said: ""A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the Spending Review 2020.

""We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event.

""The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.""

At the time, non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home.

The Times said Chancellor Rishi Sunak was not at the event and it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.

During the second lockdown, the prime minister is reported to have made a speech at a leaving party for a member of staff.

Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education Susan Acland-Hood has confirmed to MPs that a party was held at the department which was also attended by then-education secretary Gavin Williamson.

The event, first reported by the Daily Mirror, was at a time when London was in Tier 2, with indoor mixing banned.

• 14 December 2020

The Times reported that a party was held at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) with Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and ""at least two dozen party aides and volunteers"".

It is described by the newspaper as a ""raucous bash"".

A Conservative spokesperson told Sky News: ""CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on 14th December. Formal disciplinary action was taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the campaign.""

• 15 December 2020

A picture has emerged of the prime minister is taking part in an online Downing Street quiz flanked by colleagues.

The image, published by the Sunday Mirror, shows a screen with Mr Johnson sitting in front of a laptop in the No 10 library.

Downing Street said the Conservative Party leader had ""briefly"" taken part ""virtually"" in the quiz.

The Sunday Mirror said the event happened on December 15.

In response, Labour accused the PM of presiding over a ""culture of disregard for the rules"".

Official guidance at the time stated: ""Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.""

The Sunday Mirror quoted a source who claimed many staff were huddled by computers, conferring on questions and drinking alcohol while the quiz was taking place.

It reported Mr Johnson surprised staff by turning up on screen as quiz master for one round lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""This was a virtual quiz.

""Downing Street staff were often required to be in the office to work on the pandemic response so those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.

""The prime minister briefly took part virtually in a quiz to thank staff for their hard work throughout the year.""

The Daily Mirror reported that Department for Transport staff held a Christmas party in a Whitehall office, although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was said not to have been involved in any gathering.

A DfT spokesperson said: ""Fewer than a dozen staff who were working in the office had a low-key, socially distanced, gathering in the large open-plan office after work on 16 December, where food and drink was consumed.

""We recognise this was inappropriate and apologise for the error of judgement.""

• 17 December 2020

Staff in the private office of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case took part in a virtual quiz.

Sky News understands the event was described as a ""Christmas party"" in the diary and involved six people in the office - those who had already been on a rota to be in the office - and around six people taking part at home.

The event lasted an hour with people enjoying snacks and drinks at their desks.

Although Mr Case did not take part, he is understood to have walked through the office to get to his personal office and so was aware of what was happening.

At the end of the day, he walked out and thanked staff in an address lasting five to ten minutes.

• 18 December 2020

Staff reportedly held a cheese and wine night in Downing Street, just days after after stricter Tier 3 restrictions come into effect in London - meaning people were not allowed to mix indoors with anyone outside their household or support bubble.

The party reportedly carried on until 2am with Secret Santa gifts exchanged.

Downing Street director of communications Jack Doyle is also said to have addressed staff and handed out awards.

Around 40 people were in attendance, according to sources who have spoken to Sky News.

A leaked video - filmed four days after the alleged drinks do - showed senior Downing Street aides joking about a ""fictional"" party.

It led to the resignation of Mr Johnson's adviser Allegra Stratton.

What other events are alleged to have taken place?

• Other cases

Meanwhile, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has confirmed that staff working for Therese Coffey drank alcohol and ate takeaways ""late into the evening"" on a number of occasions while coronavirus restrictions were in place.

It comes after the Sunday Mirror reported that political staff and officials frequently drank after work until the early hours of the morning, and ordered food to Ms Coffey's office at the DWP.

The newspaper said some of these evenings took place while hospitality and office parties were banned under COVID regulations.

The DWP has confirmed there were times when alcohol was consumed in a work space outside the cabinet minister's Whitehall office but stressed it took place while work was continuing past normal employment hours.

A source said the desks in the office were socially distanced and there was ""no party atmosphere going on"".

Who is now leading the investigation?

Sue Gray is a long-serving civil servant who was previously the government's ethics chief.

As director general of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office, she led an investigation into former prime minister Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green.

It prompted Mr Green's sacking in 2017 after he was found to have lied about pornography being discovered on his House of Commons computer.

Mussels, crabs, barnacles and algae are of particular concern because they can easily latch on to vessels' hulls, researchers from the University of Cambridge and British Antarctic Survey have said.

Their study monitored ship-borne human activities such as research, fishing, tourism and supply and found that, despite the region's isolation, boats from 1,580 ports around the globe visit Antarctica.

All vessels potentially expose the protected region to invasive, non-native species that threaten the stability of its environment, scientists said.

'Biosecurity measures needed'

The species - including mussels, barnacles, crabs and algae - attach themselves to ships' hulls, in a process termed ""biofouling"" and could arrive in Antarctic waters from almost anywhere in the world.

Lead author Arlie McCarthy, a researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and British Antarctic Survey, said: ""The species that grow on the hull of a ship are determined by where it has been.

""We found that fishing boats operating in Antarctic waters visit quite a restricted network of ports, but the tourist and supply ships travel across the world.

""We were surprised to find that Antarctica is much more globally connected than was previously thought.

""Our results show that biosecurity measures need to be implemented at a wider range of locations than they currently are.

""There are strict regulations in place for preventing non-native species getting into Antarctica, but the success of these relies on having the information to inform management decisions.

""We hope our findings will improve the ability to detect invasive species before they become a problem.""

The study found that of all the human ship-borne activities, tourism - even though it is regulated in the region - contributes to 67% of visits to Antarctica.

This is followed by research (21%) and fishing (7%).

The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

6629;601;601;601;820;820;Prince Andrew: Could the Duke of York be stripped of his royal and military titles?;2022-01-12;[];['prince andrew', 'royal family'];"The controversy surrounding Prince Andrew has led to serious questions about whether he should be allowed to keep his royal and military titles.

The Queen's second son has been accused of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 - allegations he vehemently denies.

Despite stepping back from public duties over his links to sex offender Epstein, Andrew has kept the title of the Duke of York, along with several honorary military roles.

But after a US judge refused to throw out Ms Giuffre's civil lawsuit against Andrew, Sky News looks at what the future may hold for the duke and whether he could be stripped of his titles.

Could Andrew be stripped of his Duke of York title?

Ahead of today's court ruling, palace officials had reportedly discussed plans to ask the Duke of York to stop using the title in the event he lost the lawsuit brought by Ms Giuffre.

However, royal commentator and biographer Christopher Warwick believes it is ""highly unlikely"" that Andrew will lose that title.

He told Sky News that while the Queen can appoint dukes, it takes an act of parliament to remove their titles ""which wouldn't cover Andrew or the monarchy in glory"".

Mr Warwick said the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act was introduced during the First World War to deprive ""enemy royals"" from retaining their British peerages and titles.

But he added: ""Andrew is not an enemy of Britain, so the Titles Deprivation Act wouldn't come into it.""

What has Prince Andrew been accused of?

Why has Andrew kept his HRH title but Harry and Meghan can't use theirs?

While Prince Andrew stepped down from public duties ""for the foreseeable future"" in November 2019, he is still referred to as ""His Royal Highness"" on the official Royal Family website.

This is in contrast to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who were asked to stop using their HRH titles when they announced they would not return as working members of the Royal Family in February 2020.

The Queen told Harry and Meghan that it was ""not possible"" for the couple ""to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"", which meant cutting their official links with military, Commonwealth and charitable associations.

However, Mr Warwick said he did not believe the decision to allow Andrew to continue using his HRH title can be compared to Harry and Meghan's situation.

""There was a feeling (the Duke and Duchess of Sussex) may cash in on being Royal Highnesses,"" he told Sky News.

""Harry and Meghan are making their own living. Because of that, the Queen did not want them to trade on being Royal Highnesses.

""Andrew, of course, is quite different. He's not making a living. Right now, he's not doing anything at all, except for facing Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit.

""It's not comparing like-with-like.""

Could Andrew be stripped of his military roles?

Following a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, Andrew has several honorary military titles. They include:

• Colonel of the Grenadier Guards

• Deputy colonel-in-chief of the Royal Lancers

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps

• Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers

• Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth

• Commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm

Image: The Duke of York, pictured in 2003, is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

Mr Warwick said the title of colonel of the Grenadier Guards was ""very close to the Queen's heart"" because she was given the role on her 16th birthday before Prince Philip was appointed in 1975, with Andrew succeeding his father in 2017.

In August, it was reported the Queen had ""let it be known"" she wanted her son to remain colonel of the Grenadier Guards.

But Mr Warwick said there was ""a feeling across the regiment that it's not appropriate to retain him"".

""It puts her in an invidious situation but of course, as his mother, what she's not going to do is turn her back on him,"" he told Sky News.

Image: The Queen decides military titles as commander-in-chief of the armed forces

In early January, a veteran of the Grenadier Guards called for the Duke of York to step down from his role as colonel of the regiment ""immediately"".

Former lance sergeant Julian Perreria told The Times that Andrew retaining the title ""will put a stain on the regiment's proud history and devalue the hard work of past and future generations of Grenadiers"".

As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, decisions on military titles rest ultimately with the Queen.

But those decisions are made on the advice of the military, according to Rupert Wieloch, a retired colonel who trained with Andrew for a year and spent more than 35 years with the Royal Lancers.

He told Sky News: ""The Army Board will look to see if he matches the role in terms of the integrity and values the Army stands up for.""

Richard Kemp, a retired colonel and British commander in Afghanistan, has said the Queen's sense of duty to the military could supersede her loyalty to her son.

He told The Times: ""If she decided it would be right for Andrew to forfeit his military titles, she will do so, putting her duty to the forces above any family considerations or personal views.""

Image: Prince Andrew pictured in 2015

Which charities and organisations are still linked to Andrew?

Although many relinquished their ties with him after 2019, Andrew is still listed on the Royal Family's website as being a patron or member of around 100 charities and organisations, including hospital trusts, cricket clubs and schools.

They include the Army Officers' Golfing Society, Berkshire County Cricket Club, Killyleagh Yacht Club, Horris Hill School in Hampshire, and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust.

Mr Warwick, however, believes it is ""highly unlikely"" that Andrew will return to ""any kind of public role"".

""I personally would be extremely surprised if he ever returned to public duties,"" he told Sky News.

""I don't think the public has an appetite for Andrew as a public figure, as a working member of the Royal Family.

""He's tainted. It's something that is so disastrous for any member of the Royal Family to be in that situation - friends with (Jeffrey) Epstein and (Ghislaine) Maxwell. Where's the judgement where Andrew is concerned?

""Who would want Andrew to return to public duties? Who would have the respect for him?""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220112170357/https://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-could-the-duke-of-york-be-stripped-of-his-royal-and-military-titles-12510879;entertainment and culture

Vice Admiral Andriy Tarasov called the threat from an amphibious assault ""real"" but told Sky News that Ukraine's armed forces would repel any such attempt.

He also accused the Russian navy and coastguard of increasingly hostile activity in a shared sea that connects the two countries, closing off stretches of water to Ukrainian maritime traffic for non-existent military exercises.

Image: Vice Admiral Andriy Tarasov called the sea threat from Russia 'real'

Russia at times used jamming devices in the Sea of Azov as well to disrupt the communications and navigational devices on Ukrainian vessels, the senior officer added.

It meant the ability of commercial ships to operate out of Ukrainian ports in the area has been restricted, with 70% of the sea out of bounds last month and the volume of goods able to move in and out dropping by up to 50% over the past eight years, he added.

Russian naval actions equate to 'economic warfare'

A second naval officer describes the Russian actions as a form of ""economic warfare"".

A large build-up of Russian forces close to Ukraine - which has raised fears in the UK, the United States and across the NATO alliance that Russia is planning a further invasion of its neighbour - included the sea border, Vice Admiral Tarasov, 51, said.

""The [Russian] forces can manage the paratroopers' landing,"" he said in an exclusive interview, speaking through a translator at a building for naval officers in the port city of Odessa, which sits on the Black Sea.

Image: Vice admiral Tarasov said Ukraine would repel any attempt by Russia to attack

""Their level of preparedness is quite high, and they constantly practice such actions at training areas, including in Crimea.

""If such forces have been assembled, we must be able to prevent them from having the opportunity to land. Given that they exist, then the threat is real.""

It is one reason why the navy is focused on rebuilding its fleet, which was decimated after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

The peninsula, which straddles the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, had been where the navy was headquartered and kept the majority of its ships - many of which were captured by Russia.

Ukraine 'grateful for UK support

The UK is an important ally, supporting efforts by Ukraine to buy new warships and weapons, including missiles, as well as renovate other naval bases, Vice Admiral Tarasov said.

Under an agreement finalised last year, Kyiv will be able to seek £1.7bn in loans from London for its plans.

""We are very grateful… We received a real opportunity to realise the [naval] strategy we planned back in 2018,"" the senior officer said.

Image: According to Vice Admiral Andriy Tarasov, Ukraine has focused on restoring its marine artillery since 2014

But acquiring new warships and constructing bases will take time - and the threat to Ukraine is now.

Yet the admiral said he was confident other parts of the Ukrainian armed forces would be able to help the navy defend its coastline if needed.

""If you want peace, you need to be ready for war,"" he said. ""Since 2014 we focused on restoring our marines and coastal artillery… We have restored their potential. At the moment, the forces we have on the coast are capable of fighting off any landing party of the enemy.""

Why was Mr McArdle fined?

Three friends who were worried about Mr McArdle decided to pop round to see him in March 2021.

They sat in the garden, stayed for an hour, and remained socially distanced.

The 50-year-old explained: ""Friends of mine said they felt I was down. I live alone, and they thought I'd been struggling, so they took it upon themselves to say we're going to pop round for an hour, we'll distance, keep it quiet, to perk me up basically - that was the plan.

""My friend Brian died at the start of lockdown. We couldn't attend his funeral, couldn't give him the send-off he deserved, because we were playing by the rules.""

When the police arrived, Mr McArdle said he and his friends ""felt quite threatened"", were ""treated like criminals"" and ""made to feel worthless"".

But they ""paid the fine instantly because we accepted what we did was wrong"", he said.

He added that he was ""happy to pay the fine"" but it ""should be the same for everybody"".

""We accept what we did was wrong, but it's one rule for us and one rule for them, as far as we can see.""

In scathing comments about the prime minister, Mr McArdle said: ""For me, they've been wriggling round for days thinking 'what are we going to come up with' and that's the best they've come up with - it's just an insult to the population and people who voted for him.""

Asked whether Mr Johnson should resign, he said: ""Without a doubt - 100%. I think anybody else would have gone by now - there's been members of parliament who've quit for doing a lot less than this.

""I just think he thinks he's infallible. It's time for Boris Johnson and the government to hold their hands up, stop wriggling and say, yes, this happened, accept fines, like the normal people have to pay their fines, and move on.""

In addition to security cameras, Mr McArdle said there must be a police presence in Downing Street ""24 hours a day"" and they have to get involved.

Scotland Yard is already in touch with the Cabinet Office.

Asked what he would say to Mr Johnson, were he to meet him, Mr McArdle said: ""I would say you're not fit to lead this country. Someone else must do it.

In fresh claims that will further fuel the ""partygate"" crisis threatening the prime minister's political future, it is alleged that Downing Street staff drank alcohol into the early hours at two leaving events in April last year.

These are reported to have been held the night before the Queen was forced to sit by herself at her husband's funeral at St George's Chapel in Windsor.

Image: A leaving event was held for James Slack, the PM's departing director of communications

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey repeated his call for Boris Johnson to resign in the wake of the latest allegations.

""The Queen sitting alone, mourning the loss of her husband, was the defining image of lockdown,"" he posted on Twitter.

""Not because she is the Queen, but because she was just another person, mourning alone like too many others. Whilst she mourned, Number 10 partied. Johnson must go.""

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had ""no words for the culture and behaviours at Number 10"", adding: ""The buck stops with the PM.""

At the time of the newly-alleged parties, the country was in a period of national mourning, and England was still under strict COVID rules that banned socialising with other households indoors unless you had formed a support bubble.

People in England were also prevented from meeting outdoors in groups larger than six, or from more than two households.

Those coronavirus restrictions also limited Prince Philip's funeral to just 30 attendees, as with other services, while only 15 were allowed to gather for wakes.

The Daily Telegraph reported that one Number 10 leaving event on 16 April last year was held for James Slack, the prime minister's departing director of communications, while another was for one of Mr Johnson's personal photographers.

According to the newspaper, the gatherings lasted beyond midnight and saw alcohol drunk with guests dancing along to music.

The events were held in two different parts of the Downing Street complex but later joined together in the garden with around 30 people attending both gatherings combined, it is claimed.

The newspaper's account of the parties also claimed that one attendee was sent to a nearby supermarket store with a suitcase to be filled with bottles of wine and brought back to Downing Street.

Another staff member was said to have acted as a DJ at one of the events, while another who was present is reported to have expressed fears that too much wine was being spilled on a carpet.

One eyewitness also told the Daily Telegraph that a staff member used and broke a child's swing in the garden belonging to Mr Johnson's son, Wilfred.

Downing Street did not directly deny the reports, although it is reported that the prime minister was not in Number 10 that day and was instead at Chequers, his official country retreat.

Image: Boris Johnson observed a minute's silence for Prince Philip while at Chequers on 17 April

Commenting on the leaving event for Mr Slack, a Number 10 spokesperson said: ""On this individual's last day he gave a farewell speech to thank each team for the work they had done to support him, both those who had to be in the office for work and on a screen for those working from home.""

The fresh claims are the first time that parties are alleged to have been held in Downing Street in 2021.

The prime minister is already battling accusations that Christmas parties were held in Number 10 in December 2020.

And, earlier this week, Mr Johnson admitted to attending a ""bring your own booze"" event in Downing Street during the first national lockdown in May 2020.

A fifth Conservative MP demanded the prime minister's resignation on Thursday night over the ""partygate"" scandal.

Andrew Bridgen, the North West Leicestershire MP and a committed Brexiteer who supported Mr Johnson for the Conservative leadership in 2019, said there was ""currently a moral vacuum at the heart of our government"".

He confirmed he had written a letter of no confidence in the prime minister to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs.

If a total of 54 Conservative MPs submit letters, Mr Johnson will be forced to face a confidence vote over his leadership.

6808;784;784;784;1048;1048;Prince Harry seeks judicial review after Home Office stops him from paying for police protection in UK;2022-01-15;[];['meghan markle', 'prince harry', 'royal family'];"Prince Harry has filed a claim for a judicial review over a Home Office decision to not to allow him to privately pay for police protection for himself and his family during a visit to the UK.

A legal representative for Harry said he wants to bring his son Archie and seven-month-old baby daughter Lilibet to visit from the US, but fears they will be ""unable to return to his home"" because it is too dangerous.

The duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill after he stepped down as a senior member of the Royal Family.

Harry is now arguing his private protection team in the US does not have access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his wife and children family safe.

The legal representative for the duke said in a statement: ""The UK will always be Prince Harry's home and a country he wants his wife and children to be safe in.

""With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk.""

The representative added: ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK.

""In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.""

Harry briefly returned from the US last July for the unveiling of a statue of his late mother Princess Diana.

The day before, he met seriously ill children and young people at a WellChild garden party and afternoon tea in Kew Gardens, west London.

However, it is understood the duke's car was chased by photographers as he left.

Harry has shared his concerns in the past about his family's safety after Diana died in a car crash after she was chased by the paparazzi in Paris in 1997.

The legal representative added: ""Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.

""While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220116020822/http://news.sky.com/story/duke-of-sussex-seeks-judicial-review-after-home-office-bans-him-from-paying-for-police-protection-for-archie-and-lilibet-in-uk-12517296;politics

Phil Booth, coordinator at MedConfidential, warned that increased monitoring of wastewater from sinks, drains and toilets, which can reveal infections and drug use, needs to be properly regulated.

""The concerns will be raised more by the mission creep, the feature creep, the ways in which these miniaturised technologies might get used and abused beyond the pandemic,"" he said.

""There needs to be regulation of every sort of technology that can have an effect on people's lives and on individual people.""

His claims follow the launch by a biotech company in York of what it calls a ""mobile surveillance platform"" to detect COVID in sewage from individual buildings.

The suitcase-sized equipment can be connected to any drain to send data remotely to a computer where it is interpreted using artificial intelligence.

The firm, Modern Water, says it has static monitors installed at 3,000 sites in 60 countries and can detect ""medicines, pesticides, personal care, [and] hormones"" in wastewater.

It began testing its Microtox PD mobile COVID monitoring system in UK municipal sewage treatment works last year.

Paul Ryan, chief business development officer at the firm's parent company, Deepverge, told Sky News he expects the new device to be available for hire within months to monitor COVID in buildings including schools, hospitals and hotels.

""This is about surveillance, this is about identifying the presence of COVID and other pathogens ahead of time,"" he said.

""I think there's a growing consensus that wastewater based epidemiology offers a whole new layer of information which allows national health surveillance.""

The testing of raw sewage has been dramatically increased since the discovery in 2020 that it contains remnants of the COVID-19 virus.

Last year the UK government's Joint Biosecurity Centre opened a new laboratory near Exeter which is now testing thousands of samples taken from sewage treatment works and individual drains every week.

A report published in September 2021 said the centre's Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection programme was covering approximately 40 million people in England.

The increased monitoring comes as the identification of illegal drug use from sewage analysis is growing, according to an EU report published last year into monitoring between 2011 and 2020.

The report ranked 80 European towns and cities, none of which are in the UK, for consumption of codeine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA, based on drug residues found in sewage.

""The results provide a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved,"" it said.

The UK Health Security Agency, which oversees the national wastewater monitoring programme, told Sky News its wastewater programme follows government data protection standards.

""The data provided to local and national decision-makers relating to COVID-19 is not considered personal data,"" the agency said in an emailed response.

""It cannot identify infected individuals or homes as it is designed to provide insights at a community level.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220116020822/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-technology-developed-to-track-spread-of-coronavirus-could-be-abused-privacy-campaigner-warns-12516018;science and technology

Andrew has been accused of ""victim blaming"" and ""gaslighting"" following the request, which includes confidential notes from her counselling sessions.

Ms Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew's former friend, to have sex with the duke and is suing him in a US civil court.

Image: Virginia Giuffre pictured with lawyer David Boies in 2019

Andrew - who was stripped of his military titles last week - has always vehemently denied the allegations.

The duke's legal team want to question Ms Giuffre's psychologist, Dr Judith Lightfoot, about her ""alleged emotional and psychological harm and damages"", including inspecting prescriptions and notes from their sessions.

They also want to quiz her on the ""theory of false memories"" and ask about Ms Giuffre's ""alleged childhood trauma and abuse"".

Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, hit out at the request, telling the Daily Mail: ""This is exactly what [Ghislaine] Maxwell tried. It didn't end well. People may misremember a lot of things, but they don't misremember sexual abuse by a prince of England.

""In addition, Prince Andrew needs to say that all the other people who saw them together also have 'false memories'.""

A source close to the duke told Sky News his lawyers' request was legitimate.

""Ms Giuffre put her mental health at issue by suing for emotional distress damages,"" they said.

""The duke's legal team are perfectly entitled to test her claims, determine her damages, if any, and see what she told her therapist or not.""

A lawyer specialising in cases involving violence against women criticised the request.

Dr Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and Cambridge academic, said it appeared Andrew was trying to use Ms Giuffre's medical records to discredit her.

""It's nothing more than victim blaming and gaslighting,"" she told Sky News.

""Looking through her intimate, personal records when she would have told that person that information in the strictest confidence.

""For that to be used, manipulated and twisted against her is likely to be harmful and extremely damaging, and probably will be traumatising.

""It's another form of abuse but this time through the court process.""

Dr Proudman said she hoped that Ms Giuffre opposed the request. ""It's a really low tactic,"" she added. ""It's the lowest of the low.""

The latest turn in the case comes after a judge rejected the prince's attempt to get the lawsuit thrown out. A civil trial is now planned for later this year.

Why judge rejected Andrew's bid to have lawsuit thrown out

Ms Giuffre's lawyers have sought witness accounts from Andrew's former assistant, Robert Olney, and a woman called Shukri Walker, who claims to have seen the royal ""with a young girl"" in London's Tramp nightclub.

Ms Walker allegedly saw the royal ""with a young girl around the time that (Ms Giuffre) contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub"", court documents say.

Ghislaine Maxwell - who recruited girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse - will be sentenced at the end of June.

Her defence team is pushing for a retrial after a juror admitted he told other jurors he was sexually abused as a child and used his experiences to persuade others to convict Maxwell.

6876;855;855;855;1127;1127;Eric Zemmour: Far-right French presidential candidate convicted of inciting racial hatred over migrant children comments;2022-01-17;[];['france'];"A far-right candidate in the French presidential election has been convicted of inciting racial hated over remarks about migrant children in 2020.

Eric Zemmour has been fined 10,000 euros (£8,350) and must pay several thousand euros in damages to anti-racism groups.

It's the third hate speech conviction for the ex-TV pundit, who is hoping to replace Emmanuel Macron in April off the back of anti-Islam and anti-immigration rhetoric.

Zemmour went on trial in November charged with ""public insult"" and ""incitement to hatred or violence"" against people due to national, ethnic, religious or racial origin.

The case centred on comments in September 2020 to broadcaster CNews about children who migrate to France without parents or a guardian.

He said: ""They're thieves, they're murderers, they're rapists. That's all they are. We must send them back. These people cost us money.""

Zemmour didn't withdraw his comments and insisted political debate should not be taking place in court. He also claimed prosecutors and anti-racism groups were trying to ""intimidate"" him.

It isn't the end of his legal troubles - on Thursday he will face an appeal trial on a charge of contesting crimes against humanity, which is illegal in France.

That follows a 2019 TV debate in which he argued that Marshal Philippe Petain, head of the collaborationist Vichy government during the Second World War, saved French Jews from the Holocaust.

Zemmour was acquitted last year, saying that his comments did negate Petain's role in the extermination, but that the court did not convicted him as he had spoken in the heat of the moment.

Lawyers plan to cite similar comments he's made recently as evidence in the appeal.

Zemmour's other convictions are for inciting racial hatred in 2010 after trying to justify discrimination against black and Arab people.

In 2016, he was convicted of inciting racial hatred over anti-Islam comments.

He has faced other cases but been acquitted.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220117162111/https://news.sky.com/story/eric-zemmour-far-right-french-presidential-candidate-convicted-of-inciting-racial-hatred-over-migrant-children-comments-12518459;politics

A plume of smoke can be seen rising from Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano in images taken before the eruption, with the volcanic island appearing to have all but disappeared afterwards.

Australia and New Zealand sent military surveillance flights to assess damage to the Pacific island nation on Monday after a towering ash cloud following Saturday's eruption prevented earlier flights.

UN humanitarian officials and Tonga's government have reported ""significant infrastructural damage around Tongatapu"", said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.

""There has been no contact from the Ha'apai Group of islands, and we are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands - Mango and Fonoi - following surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,"" Mr Dujarric said.

According to Tonga's government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi.

New Zealand's High Commission in Tonga also reported ""significant damage"" along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, where there are several holiday resorts.

New Zealand's military has sent aid deliveries of drinking water and other supplies but these have been delayed by thick ash on an airport runway.

The country is also sending two navy ships that will leave on Tuesday and has pledged an initial one million New Zealand dollars (£498,000) towards recovery efforts.

The UN World Food Program is also exploring how to bring in relief supplies, though one complicating issue is that Tonga has managed to avoid outbreaks of COVID-19. New Zealand has said its military staff are vaccinated and willing to follow Tonga's protocols.

Mr Johnson's latest comments come following claims from his former top adviser Dominic Cummings that the prime minister knew in advance about the Downing Street drinks party - which Number 10 has denied.

Mr Johnson said: ""My memory is going out into the garden for about 25 minutes, which I implicitly thought was a work event, and talking to staff, thanking staff.

""I then went back to my office and continued my work.

""I carry full responsibility for what took place, nobody said to me 'this is an event that's against the rules, in breach of what we're asking everybody else to do'.""

PM: 'I should have told people to go back indoors'

Mr Johnson admitted on reflection he ""should have looked around and told people to go back indoors"" after realising it was not a work event.

He said he wanted to ""repeat my apologies for misjudgements I've made"" after saying sorry in the House of Commons last week following mounting pressure over attending the event.

Asked about two parties alleged to have taken place on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, Mr Johnson looked down and appeared distressed.

""I deeply and bitterly regret that happened, I can only renew my apology to Her Majesty and to apologise for misjudgements made and for which I take full responsibility,"" he said.

Analysis: PM knows how much trouble he's in Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Boris Johnson looked beaten, distressed and out of options. His tone was intended to reiterate that humble apology which he says he gave in the House of Commons last week. But when we drove into the detail about what he did or didn't know, it was uncomfortable. He was clear he had no recollection of Dominic Cummings verbally warning him about the event on 20 May going ahead, or that he was warned that it could be in breach of guidelines. It will be up to Sue Gray to uncover the truth. But where is he right now? It's clear the prime minister is feeling the pressure and clearly understands the trouble he is in. For me, the most striking moment of the interview was when I asked him about those parties held on the night before the funeral of Prince Philip. He looked visibility upset about that. He hung his head and said he deeply and bitterly regretted that that happened. And he apologised to the Queen and to the country. I asked him repeatedly if it emerges that he misled parliament whether he would resign? He didn't rule it out. He said he would wait for the Sue Gray report. He was dodging the question, but it won't go away - and even then there's another question: can this PM hold on, or does his party think it's time to go? That is a very, very precarious position from him to be in.

Mr Cummings yesterday claimed Mr Johnson gave the May 2020 garden party the go-ahead so lied to parliament when he said he did not know, but the PM denied this.

Mr Johnson also said he only saw the email invite for the event from his right-hand man Martin Reynolds the other day, when it was revealed to the media.

The PM is facing calls for his resignation, including from some of his own MPs, over the issue but has said the investigation into the parties must be allowed ""space"" to be concluded.

Labour says PM 'clearly knows it's end of the road'

Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, reacting to the PM's interview, said he ""clearly knows it's the end of the road"".

""He's the prime minister, he set the rules, he didn't need anyone to tell him that the party he attended broke them,"" she said.

""If he had any respect for the British public, he would do the decent thing and resign.""

Five things we learned from Johnson interview Joe Pike Political correspondent @joepike His core defence is now ""nobody told me"" - the PM argues his team did not tell him Number 10 garden party was against the rules.

The PM specifically denied Dominic Cummings's claim that he lied.

The PM confirmed he personally apologised to the Queen for the raucous Number 10 parties held the night before her husband's funeral.

Mr Johnson also confirmed he has spoken to senior civil servant Sue Gray as part of her investigation into rule-breaking parties.

The prime minister did not rule out resigning.

Senior Tories leave open idea PM would have to resign if code breached

Senior cabinet members have said they believe Mr Johnson, but both Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Chancellor Rishi Sunak pointed out the ministerial code ""is clear on these matters"".

The code says: ""It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.

""Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister.""

Mr Sunak, when asked if he supported the PM unequivocally, got up and left without answering.

Before that, asked if he believed the PM, he said: ""Of course I do, the prime minister set out his understanding of this matter in parliament last week and I'd refer you to his words.

""As you know, Sue Gray is conducting an enquiry into this matter and I fully support the prime minister's request for patience while that inquiry concludes.""

The chancellor said he would not ""get into hypotheticals"" following Mr Cummings' claim Mr Johnson lied to parliament.

""I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgements that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.""

And then on the matter of the ""bring your own booze"" event in the Downing Street garden when social gathering had been explicitly banned by Mr Johnson and his team, the PM said in the interview that ""nobody said to me that this was an event that is against the rules"" ahead of time, challenging Mr Cummings' version of events.

But even if he hadn't know then - and what he knew when will be pored over when Sue Gray reports - how could he not see that tables laid up in the garden with food and booze and 40 attendees wasn't a party?

Does he really need Ms Gray to tell him that?

Isn't that a ridiculous defence that people will see straight through, particularly given that in May 2020 there wasn't any such thing as a ""work event"" anyhow. People were not allowed to socialise at work or in their own homes.

On Wednesday, Mr Johnson will face more questions at PMQs.

Sir Keir Starmer will no doubt ask the PM to repeat this denials about being alerted to the danger of the No 10 event ahead of time, in order to get it on the record in the House of Commons.

If evidence emerges to the contrary, the situation takes on another turn with even his chancellor acknowledging when pressed on Tuesday that ""the ministerial code is clear on these matters"" when asked whether the PM should resign if he's lied to parliament.

The atmosphere is beyond awful in parliament. Everyone is on edge.

There are a handful of MPs who have gone out to defend the PM, but the mood is desperate.

One senior Conservative told me this afternoon that he cannot find one person who doesn't think it's over for the PM and it's just a question of time.

""The question is when enough decide they want it over and how quickly,"" one figure told me.

""Those most focused are the ones facing local elections in May and are asking themselves whether than want to lose loads of councillors before they move against him or to go earlier.""

Another MP from the 2019 intake also told Sky News they think they are ""nearly there"" when it comes to these matters and believe the weekend was a turning point.

This particular MP said they give the PM ""a week"" before things move.

Of course, much will depend on the Gray report and also whether more revelations drip out in the coming days - Dominic Cummings has alluded to photos while MPs whisper about talk of even more parties in Downing Street.

But based on Tuesday's performance, you have to wonder whether the PM fears his time is up too?

He will no doubt keep on fighting for as long as he can, and hope that Sue Gray's report will give him enough cover to escape the corner he's in.

Perhaps it will come down to a ""he said, she said"" account of events with two men - Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings - giving their version of what happened and there is no smoking gun or piece of evidence that condemns the PM.

But even if - and it's a very big if - the PM can survive Partygate, can he ever recover the public's trust?

If his party concludes the electorate will not forgive nor forget, he will not be able to stay on as PM, whatever Sue Gray's findings reveal.

The consumer group said Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for six of the last 12 months while Lidl - the winner during 2020 - was the cheapest for five, including December.

It comes to its findings by measuring the price of a basket of everyday groceries.

Which? tracked an average increase of 3.4% across the major supermarket chains during 2021.

Waitrose prices increased the most - by 9.2% - and Sainsbury's the least, at 0.59%.

When it came to December and the run-up to Christmas, Waitrose was found to be more than £9, or 41%, more expensive than Lidl, at £32.85 for a basket of 22 items.

Lidl's basket came in at £23.29 compared with Aldi's £23.64.

The shopping list combined branded items such as Kenco coffee, Oxo stock cubes and PG Tips tea bags with own-label products including onions and milk, selected to ensure they were as comparable as possible across the retailers on factors such as weight and quality.

The findings were released as charities warn that millions more families are facing a stark choice between eating and heating amid a sharp rise in the cost of living, chiefly led by unprecedented increases in energy prices.

Footage shows the woman standing on the back of her almost fully submerged yellow car.

Around 12 letters were handed in this morning, according to Sky News political correspondents Sam Coates and Joe Pike.

They were from MPs who were part of a group of around 20 first voted in at the 2019 general election, many in traditionally Labour seats in the North.

They met last night to discuss their support of the prime minister after he claimed on Tuesday ""nobody told me"" the Number 10 lockdown garden party in May 2020 was against the rules.

Several other letters are understood to have been submitted ahead of today, with a handful of Conservative MPs confirming to Sky News they have done so.

The letters have been handed to Sir Graham Brady, head of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, who is the only person that knows exactly how many letters have been submitted.

For a Tory PM to be ousted, Sir Graham needs to receive letters from 15% of Conservative MPs, which at the moment is 54.

When that number is reached, a vote on the PM's leadership will be triggered. There are reports this could happen as early as today.

Millions of people tuned in last week across various channels to watch the PM give an explanation of that party in Number 10 on 20 May.

Today people were no doubt watching to see how he would perform as rumours now build that there could be a confidence vote against him triggered by his own backbenchers.

I should stress that no one really knows if and when that threshold of 54 letters to trigger a ballot will come, although the mood in the party seems to now be crystallising that he won't be the man to lead them into the next election.

As one Conservative political operative put it to me on Wednesday: ""Johnson won support because he could reach a wider base of voters as the Heineken politician who polled better than the party but now he is a drag anchor on colleagues so it really is a question of when not if.""

This is the context in which the PM came to PMQs, the opening of which dealt him the first of two material body blows as the Conservative MP for Bury South, Christian Wakeford, opened the session by defecting to the Labour Party.

Sir Keir Starmer was beaming, Mr Johnson's benches fuming with colleagues shocked and incensed by the defection.

But that a Tory MP and former councillor crossed the floor to the Labour benches - that is extremely difficult for any PM.

Image: Christian Wakeford has defected to the Labour Party

Labour party sources are telling me this is Operation Domino, implying there is more to come, while Tory sources suggest Mr Wakeford's shock defection helped the PM, in the short term at least, prompting some to perhaps reconsider putting letters in as tribal politics kicked back in.

And the PM did fight back during this PMQs, putting in a far more buoyant performance to MPs than he did in our interview on Tuesday, when he appeared downcast and defeated.

But he was soon deflated once more by the powerful - and dangerous - intervention from Tory grandee David Davis, who became the first Conservative MP to tell the prime minister to go in an electrifying moment.

A Labour operative sent me a tweet - dated 2018 and linked to Brexit - from a Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries minutes after the former cabinet minister made his move: ""David Davis is ex SAS. He's trained to survive. He's also trained to take people out.""

Image: Boris Johnson is unpopular with some of his own MPs after it emerged he attended a Downing Street party during lockdown

These two painful bookends to PMQs - despite the PM showing some fight - speaks to the precariousness of his position.

The uncertainty in Westminster is crippling, the mood almost unbearable and the relationship between the government and rebels is getting deeply unpleasant.

There is talk that Mr Wakeford was sent over the edge by whips threatening the future of his seat with boundary changes.

One rebel told me that the briefing, backbiting and bullying was only serving to harden resolve and deepen splits.

A group of the 2019 intake are ready to put in letters, resigned to the reality that Mr Johnson is more likely to lose them their seats than save them in the next election.

There's been fevered speculation that they might move before the Gray report, but one informed figure tells me ""more excitable"" colleagues have been implored to wait for the Gray report to be published, as any confidence vote ahead of it would be foolhardy. Mr Johnson would win it - and they wouldn't be able to call one again for another year.

But the real question now is whether Boris Johnson, however hard he fights, can secure his political future beyond a stay of execution.

Some of his cabinet supporters are convinced he can, with one cabinet minister telling me on Tuesday night that he's going to face an incredibly bumpy four weeks but can make it to the other side.

Mr Johnson suggested he would start treating COVID more like the flu, saying: ""There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don't place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu.

""When Plan B was introduced in December, there were 7,373 patients in hospital in the UK. The latest data this week shows there are 18,9791.""

Dr Nagpaul went on to warn that ending mandates on mask-wearing would ""inevitably increase transmission"" and place the most vulnerable at a higher risk.

The committee said it also wants to find out what she knows about her father's efforts to pressure then-vice president Mike Pence to reject the 2020 election results.

The panel said this includes a telephone call she witnessed between them on the morning of the riot.

Keith Kellogg, who was Mr Pence's national security adviser, allegedly told investigators he was there and heard Mr Trump question whether Mr Pence had the courage to delay the congressional counting of the electoral votes.

The Constitution makes it clear that a vice president's role is largely ceremonial in the certification process

Ireland expresses concerns about Russian Navy military exercises

Meanwhile, Ireland has raised concerns about planned Russian Navy military exercises that are due to take place at the start of February.

The artillery drills will take place in international waters but within Irish-controlled airspace and the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

All civilian aircraft will be routed away from the area while the exercises take place.

In compliance with legal requirements, Russia has informed Ireland's aviation authorities of the planned drills in advance.

Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has raised the issue with Russian ambassador to Ireland Yury Filatov and is expected to discuss his concerns with other EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.

""Under international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, states are entitled to carry out naval exercises in another state's EEZ,"" said Mr Coveney.

""The Irish Aviation Authority was informed of the exercise via standard procedures and has issued a statement to that effect.

The partygate inquiry, which is being carried out by civil servant Sue Gray, could determine Mr Johnson's fate as the country's prime minister.

Many Tory MPs have said they will wait to see the investigation's findings before making a decision on whether to push for a vote of no confidence, which could see him forced out of Number 10.

However, some rebel MPs have indicated they will submit letters of no confidence to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, whatever the report finds.

Under party rules, once the total number of letters reaches 54 - 15% of Tory MPs - Sir Graham must call a vote of confidence in the leader.

Ms Gray's findings are not expected to be released on Monday but could come out any day this week.

Allies of Mr Johnson say there have been efforts to bolster his defences and protect his position ahead of the report's publication.

They believe there may still be a way through, providing Ms Gray does not explicitly state the prime minister was aware of any rule-breaking going on in Downing Street.

""There are still a few sharks in the water that we need to navigate... but the immediate danger has receded,"" one ally told Sky News.

The prime minister has spent the last two days at Chequers, his countryside retreat, calling MPs to try and shore up support.

Downing Street has already said he will come to the Commons after Ms Gray's report is published and take questions from members of parliament.

The report may also lead to renewed calls for the Metropolitan Police to open a criminal investigation if there is clear evidence that COVID restrictions were breached.

Among the events Ms Gray has been investigating is a ""bring your own booze"" do in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 during the first lockdown.

The PM has admitted he attended but said he thought it was a ""work event"" - an explanation that was met with widespread criticism.

Dominic Cummings - Mr Johnson's former top adviser - is set to be interviewed by Ms Gray today, according to reports.

An unnamed source told The Daily Telegraph that Met officers have also provided ""a lot of information"" to Ms Gray.

When asked when significant this material was, they added: ""Put it this way, if Boris Johnson is still prime minister by the end of the week, I'd be very surprised.""

Reorganisation and numerous sackings

Meanwhile, there are reports that a reorganisation may take place within Number 10, with the potential for numerous sackings among key staff, after the report has been published.

Cabinet ministers and senior Conservatives say that a culture change will be needed within Downing Street whatever happens.

""And it is clear that we need a better relationship between Number 10 and the Conservative Parliamentary Party, and the whips' office.

Calls for an inquiry into Islamophobia

Also this week, the prime minister is facing calls for an independent inquiry to be carried out into allegations made by former minister Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked from her ministerial position because of her Muslim faith.

Downing Street has said that an investigation will only be launched if Ms Ghani makes a formal complaint.

However, the President of Conservative Muslim Forum and Tory peer Lord Sheikh told Sky News an external inquiry was needed, saying the issue ""goes to the heart of the attitudes of some people in the party"".

Over the weekend two cabinet ministers - Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi - also backed calls for an inquiry.

Mr Zahawi said the claims needed to be ""investigated properly"" while Mr Javid said Nusrat Ghani ""must be heard"".

Making a statement on the coronavirus rule change in the Commons, the transport secretary said those who have had two doses of an approved vaccination or one dose of a Janssen/J+J vaccine will no longer need to take a pre-departure or post-arrival test.

The change will be introduced in time for the half-term break.

Travel testing rule change

Mr Shapps told MPs 2022 will be ""the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past"".

Advertisement

He said: ""It means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form.""

The latest coronavirus news from the UK and around the world

Those who are not fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arriving in the UK and will not have to isolate, the transport secretary also confirmed.

The move comes after chief executives of the UK's largest airlines urged the government to end coronavirus-related travel restrictions due to the impact they were having on the travel industry.

The bosses pointed to evidence that the Omicron variant is in retreat, and argued that current measures have a ""limited effect"" in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, Huw Merriman, said it is a ""landmark day for international travel"".

Image: The airline industry has welcomed the news

Shapps: Move will make travel 'easier'

Announcing the changes in the Commons, Mr Shapps told MPs: ""We promised we wouldn't keep these measures in place a day longer than was necessary and it's obvious to me now that border testing for vaccinated travellers has outlived its usefulness, and we're therefore scrapping all travel tests for vaccinated people.

""Not only making travel much easier but also, of course, saving about £100 per family on visits abroad, providing certainty to passengers, to carriers and (the) vital tourism sector for the spring and the summer seasons.""

Mr Shapps told MPs the current definition of fully vaccination for the purposes of inbound travel to the UK - two doses of an approved vaccination or one dose of a Janssen vaccine - will remain in place ""for now""

He also confirmed that 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel.

In addition, Mr Shapps told MPs the UK is also set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations.

""That will include countries like China and Mexico, bringing the vaccine recognition total to over 180 countries and territories worldwide,"" the transport secretary said.

He added that reconnecting to key markets will not only ""boost"" the UK economy but also help the aviation industry to ""take back to the skies"".

Mr Shapps said the government intends to move away from ""blanket border measures"" to a ""more sophisticated and targeted global surveillance system"" and that a ""strategy"" to do so will be set out ""next month"".

Travel industry welcomes news

easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren welcomed the news, adding: ""We believe testing for travel should now firmly become a thing of the past.""

He continued: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee-jerk reactions to future variants.""

Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, added: ""As the barriers to travel come down, demand goes up.

""Reservations for spring and summer holidays are roaring ahead, but this latest news means we can expect demand to soar for the February half-term. Let us hope we can put the last of the lockdown obstacles behind us and make 2022 a comeback year to remember.""

Image: Grant Shapps said the government intends to move away from 'blanket border measures'

And Tim Alderslade, chief executive of airline industry body Airlines UK, said the announcement was ""a landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plc"".

Earlier, the prime minister said the rules could be lifted because the country was ""moving through the Omicron wave"".

""So what we're doing on travel, to show that this country is open for business, open for travellers, you will see changes so that people arriving no longer have to take tests if they have been vaccinated, if they have been double vaccinated,"" he told reporters.

Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, Baroness Warsi welcomed the PM's announcement of an inquiry but said she hopes ""a culture change comes off the back of it"".

The former Conservative Party co-chair said she ""wasn't surprised"" at Ms Ghani's allegation ""for two reasons"".

""One, because what has happened to Nus Ghani is an open secret in Westminster - me and many, many colleagues have been aware of this for many months and the way that she has struggled to be heard.

""But secondly, because the pattern in Nus's case is very similar to what I have seen in hundreds and hundreds of other complaints that have been made to the party about Islamophobia.

Analysis: MPs fear PM will not be able to survive scandals as Ghani's claims expose instability in No 10

""And the pattern is this - that the issue of Islamophobia is seen as far less serious than other forms of bigotry, that when the issue is raised that the response is quite aggressive and colleagues feel threatened and ostracised and feel like it will be a career ending issue.

""They always push this into bureaucracy and the onus is put back on the complainant and the victim rather than those who are told about this dealing with the matter proactively - and no action is usually taken until the media shine a spotlight on it.

""And all of those ring true with almost every case that we have seen within the party and they ring true with Nus's case.""

Image: Baroness Warsi says 'a culture change' is needed

Baroness Warsi added: ""An allegation of Islamophobia at the heart of government is even more disturbing... because in the end, the Conservative Party will have an impact on its members - and there are, what, a couple of hundred British Muslims who are members of the Conservative Party.

""But the government acts in the interests of all its citizens and there are nearly four million British Muslims in this country who are looking at government right now and thinking 'is it possible for a minister to lose her job simply because of her Muslimness?'

""And it sends a shiver down their spine to think that this is the kind of thing that could be happening at the heart of government.""

In the immediate aftermath of Ms Ghani's comments, chief whip Mark Spencer said he was the whip in question.

Image: Mark Spencer has denied claims by Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked from her ministerial role because of her faith

He described her allegations as ""completely false"", adding: ""I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.""

Asked if Mr Spencer could stay in his role while the inquiry is carried out, the PM said: ""This is something I take personally extremely seriously, I took it very seriously 18 months ago, we must wait and see what the investigation produces.""

Ms Ghani has also claimed that when she raised the matter directly with the PM, he told her he could not get involved.

An orange-brown knobbly newt with a racing stripe down its back, which was first spotted in a 20-year-old photo, was found in Thailand, along with an orange and grey rock gecko.

In Vietnam and Cambodia, a big-headed frog was found and in Burma, a colourless cave-dwelling fish was discovered.

The word's first succulent bamboo, whose stem can inflate and deflate during the dry and wet seasons, was also among the newly-found species after being identified in Laos.

A plant with a pungent odour from the ginger family that was first found in a shop in eastern Thailand, a mulberry tree from Vietnam, and a series of begonias from Laos and Burma have also been described as new species.

""They require out greatest respect""

Regional wildlife lead at WWF-Greater Mekong, Dr Yoganand Kandasamy, said more than 3,000 species have been spotted in the area in the past 24 years.

She added: ""The Greater Mekong region is no doubt a world heavyweight contender for species discoveries.

""These species are extraordinary, beautiful products of millions of years of evolution, but are under intense threat, with many species going extinct even before they are described.

""They require our greatest respect, utmost attention, and urgent actions to protect their habitats and minimise exploitation.""

WWF-UK's director of science Mark Wright urged governments, who will meet for the UN global biodiversity summit later this year, to commit to halting and reversing the destruction of nature by 2030.

He added that the new findings show the ""extraordinary diversity and inventiveness of nature"" but also serve as a ""timely reminder of the extreme jeopardy that so many of these species and habitats face.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126050825/http://news.sky.com/story/more-than-220-new-animal-and-plant-species-discovered-in-greater-mekong-wwf-says-12525571;environment

The Falcon 9 booster from Elon Musk's space company has been drifting since February 2015, when it helped put a weather satellite into orbit.

It's now expected to hit the moon on 4 March at 2.58km/s, according to Bill Gray - a data analyst who tracks near-Earth objects.

He said it's the ""first unintentional case"" of space junk hitting the moon that he is aware of.

Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan Dowell confirmed the expected collision.

""For those asking: yes, an old Falcon 9 second stage left in high orbit in 2015 is going to hit the moon on March 4. It's interesting, but not a big deal,"" he tweeted.

The moment of impact will not be observable as it's forecast to hit the far side of the moon.

""The bulk of the moon is in the way, and even if it were on the near side, the impact occurs a couple of days after New Moon,"" Mr Gray said in his blog.

However, he said there will be a short viewing window of a day or two in early February when it ""will be bright, close and moving fast"".

These final observations should allow experts to refine the impact point to around a kilometre, possibly better, and the new crater may allow scientists to learn something about the geology of that part of the moon.

As well as large pieces of space junk such as the Falcon booster, NASA says there are about 23,000 pieces of debris bigger than a softball orbiting Earth at speeds of up to 17,500mph.

Last December the prime minister dismissed claims made by a former Foreign Office official that the government prioritised animals over people as ""complete nonsense"".

But new emails released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Afghanistan crisis, suggest Mr Johnson did personally authorise rescue efforts for pets and animals.

In other news, emails just published by @CommonsForeign re the Afghan evacuation refer to the PM giving personal authorisation for the Nowzad animals to be evacuated.



This was denied by No10 spokesman. pic.twitter.com/tvzx8Gi6vG — Tamara Cohen (@tamcohen) January 26, 2022

What do the new emails say?

On 25 August 2021, an official working for Foreign Office minister Lord Goldsmith sent an email to the Foreign Office ""special cases"" team regarding the possible evacuation of an unnamed animal charity.

In it the official writes: ""Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated, [animal charity - name redacted] are hoping to be treated in the same capacity"".

This appears to support claims made last year in written evidence by whistleblower Raphael Marshall, a desk officer at the Foreign Office, that the department ""received an instruction from the prime minister"" to use ""considerable capacity"" to help animals leave the country that were being cared for by Nowzad, run by Paul ""Pen"" Farthing.

""There was a direct trade-off between transporting Nowzad's animals and evacuating British nationals and Afghan evacuees, including Afghans who had served with British soldiers,"" he said.

Asked about this at the time, the PM said: ""No, that's complete nonsense.

""What I can tell you is that Operation Pitting, to airlift 15,000 people out of Kabul in the way that we did over the summer, was one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more.

""The role of the Foreign Office, the role of Border Force, everybody involved in it, the Home Office officials, they did an absolutely outstanding job, processing very difficult, very complex claims, incredibly quickly.""

Image: Pen Farthing, founder of British charity Nowzad, called for the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan

Mr Farthing launched a campaign to get his staff and animals out of Afghanistan as the Taliban overran Kabul, using a plane funded through donations.

The UK government sponsored clearance for a charter flight, which sparked claims that animals had been prioritised over people.

Asked about the new emails, the PM's official spokesman said: ""It remains the case that the PM didn't instruct officials to take any particular course of action.""

This was reiterated by a Number 10 spokesperson, who said: ""The prime minister had no role in authorising individual evacuations from Afghanistan during Op PITTING, including Nowzad staff and animals.

""At no point did the prime minister instruct staff to take any particular course of action on Nowzad.""

I did not authorise & do not support anything that would have put animals’ lives ahead of peoples’. My position, which I made clear publicly, was that the UK should prioritise evacuating people. I never discussed the NOWZAD charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM — Zac Goldsmith (@ZacGoldsmith) January 26, 2022

Lord Goldsmith tweeted: ""I did not authorise & do not support anything that would have put animals' lives ahead of peoples'.""

He added that he ""never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM"".

And Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""at no point"" was he told by Mr Johnson to ""evacuate Pen Farthing, his workforce or his pets"".

""As I made clear at the time, we were not going to put pets before people and as the actions showed, Pen Farthing left last and his workforce had to leave after the evacuation was concluded via other means,"" he said in a statement.

Image: The defence secretary denied the government 'put pets before people'

""The evacuation was a Ministry of Defence led operation, supported by application processing by the Home Office and FCDO.

""The idea that an environment minister and his officials had any authority or responsibility in the running of the evacuation is ludicrous.""

However, Dominic Dyer, an animal rights campaigner who lobbied the prime minister to evacuate Pen Farthing and his animals, told Sky News that Boris Johnson ""played a key role in the evacuation operation"".

He said the newly-released emails ""vindicate what I've been saying since August"" - that ""there were clear lines being given by senior officials that the prime minister was giving strong support to the project"".

Asked why the PM denied it, Mr Dyer added: ""It became a difficult situation, with Ministry of Defence seeing problems with the whole operation... there was a lot of tension between different Whitehall departments.""

PM told to come to Commons and face MPs

Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Sky News: ""This goes back to the moral authority of the prime minister and whether the prime minister tells the truth.""

He said the PM should face MPs and answer questions.

""His authority, integrity and honour are on the line. He should come to the chamber and defend it,"" Mr Bryant said.

Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said: ""Once again, the prime minister has been caught out lying about what he has been doing and deciding.

""He should never have given priority to flying animals out of Afghanistan while Afghans who worked for our armed forces were left behind.""

Layla Moran, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said the ""damning revelation shows that Boris Johnson has once again repeatedly lied to the British people"".

""Boris Johnson's house of cards continues to come tumbling down.

The rules introduced over the Christmas period due to the rise of the Omicron variant have lapsed.

The other nations in the UK are also moving to less stringent restrictions, but are not opening up to the level of England.

The advice for pupils and staff to wear masks in classrooms was removed on 20 January, and work from home advice eased on 19 January.

From 27 January in England Events and venues will no longer be required by law to use the NHS COVID pass - but can still use on a voluntary basis

Face coverings no longer legally required by law in any setting, except public transport in London where they will remain mandatory. Public health guidance will continue to advise using face coverings in “crowded and enclosed spaces”

Masks will no longer be advised by the Department for Education to be worn in communal areas - although local directors of public health have some leeway to reintroduce measures

Any local introduction of face coverings must be routinely reviewed and “removed at the earliest possibility”

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The tireless efforts of NHS and care staff, and the army of volunteers, as well as the phenomenal response of the British public means over 37 million people have been boosted. I want to thank everyone who has come forward to get boosted now.

""Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to Plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country.

""As we learn to live with COVID we need to be clear eyed that this virus is not going away so if you haven't already - please come forward for your first, second or booster jab.""

Face coverings will still be mandatory on Transport for London services.

And supermarkets Sainsbury's and Waitrose will be asking people to continue wearing masks in their shops.

On Tuesday this week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that, from 4am on 11 February, there will be no requirement for vaccinated passengers arriving in England to do post-arrival lateral flow tests.

Those who are not fully vaccinated - two jabs, or a single Janssen jab - will need to test before they depart for England, and take a post-arrival PCR test, and complete a passenger locator form.

But they will no longer need to isolate, or complete a day eight test.

Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland announced the reopening of nightclubs and scrapping social distancing this week.

Work from home is still being advised, and face coverings remain on public transport and in indoor public places.

Crowds are set to return to Welsh sporting events in the next fortnight, and nightclubs will also reopen.

Nightclubs reopened this week in Northern Ireland, although a domestic COVID certificate was still required for entry.

Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ""The recent decline in community case rates and individuals requiring hospitalisation is encouraging and it's thanks to the public, who have taken up vaccination and followed the Plan B measures closely, that we've got to this point.

""However we should not be complacent. The pandemic is not over yet and we will need to remain cautious to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.

""I encourage everyone to get the vaccine as soon as they can, to continue testing regularly with lateral flow tests - particularly before periods of high risk and before seeing anyone who is vulnerable - and to take a PCR test if they have symptoms.""

The team's official accreditation had arrived in the UK from Jamaica last Friday but delays releasing them for delivery had been jeopardising their chances of making their flights to Beijing on Friday.

However, on Thursday the airport told Sky News: ""We are pleased to have resolved the issue and successfully delivered the items. We wish them all the best in the games.''

It is the first time in 24 years that Jamaica has had a four-man bobsleigh team at the Winter Games and the very first team that entered in 1988 inspired the hit film Cool Runnings.

Mr Watson told Sky News they ""want to become the best Jamaican team in history"".

But it was a story about dogs and cats that threatened to take over in August 2021 as Pen Farthing desperately tried to get the dogs his charity Nowzad had rescued, and his staff, out of Afghanistan.

Supporters raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to charter a flight to evacuate them but former marine, Mr Farthing, then accused the Foreign Office of blocking the evacuation flight.

Eventually, Mr Farthing and his animals left Afghanistan on 28 August, two days before the final British evacuation flight as part of Operation Pitting. Some of his staff were not allowed into the airport by the Taliban, despite being granted British visas but made it out through Pakistan.

Controversy at the time

While Mr Farthing had a lot of support as he tried to get the animals and his staff out, there was also major criticism of him and the government's response.

One of the main issues of contention was claims animals' lives were being placed above human lives, with hundreds of Afghans eligible to be evacuated by the British left behind.

The government was accused of allowing British troops to divert their attention from evacuating people to help with getting the dogs out and using up valuable time when humans could have been evacuated.

Mr Farthing was also accused of threatening Defence Secretary Ben Wallace's special adviser, with a leaked voicemail accusing him of blocking the flight and warning he would ""destroy"" him if he did not approve the flight immediately.

The charity head apologised and said he did that ""out of frustration"" but denied the other claims, saying his charter flight did not need troops, was paid for privately and was given the go-ahead by the government.

Did Boris Johnson personally intervene?

At the time, the PM denied he intervened to get the dogs out and on 27 January said it was ""total rhubarb"" he approved the airlift.

But Dominic Dyer, a friend of Mr Farthing's who co-ordinated the Nowzad evacuation, said he lobbied Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, who is a friend.

Mr Dyer said he was in no doubt she persuaded her husband to intervene.

Then Raphael Marshall, a former Foreign Office employee involved in Operation Pitting, gave written evidence to parliament that the Foreign Office had ""received an instruction"" from the PM to use ""considerable capacity"" to help evacuate the animals.

He also alleged British soldiers were put at risk to help them.

But Mr Farthing denied this, telling the government Mr Marshall's evidence is ""unverified"" and ""nonsense"".

Why has the issue raised its head again?

As part of an ongoing inquiry into the Afghanistan evacuation, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee released relevant documents at the end of January 2022.

This included an email to the Foreign Office evacuation team from an official saying Nowzad had ""received a lot of publicity"" and ""the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated"".

In December 2021, Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" he had intervened.

One of the newly released documents, from Mr Raphael to the committee, said a colleague told the team ""we are doing the dogs"" and the PM had issued this instruction in an emergency COBRA meeting or National Security Council meeting.

He also told the committee ""several"" colleagues messaged on Teams saying the PM had instructed them to ""call forward Nowzad's staff for evacuation"".

The employee said Ms Harrison, who is also the MP for Copeland, made clear to the company that she worked for the prime minister - repeatedly referring to ""the boss"" and the firm felt it was obvious her requests came with the PM's backing.

7510;1506;1506;1506;1949;1949;Britney Spears conservatorship: Star Trek icon Nichelle Nichols and pop-art pioneer Peter Max - is #FreeBritney just the beginning?;2022-01-29;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['britney spears', 'star trek'];"In November 1968, the black actress Nichelle Nichols shared what was a milestone on-screen kiss with her white Star Trek co-star William Shatner.

While African-American actresses before her had often found themselves typecast in roles such as maids or housekeepers, Nichols' Lieutenant Uhura was light years ahead of her time. The kiss, aired just a year after the US Supreme Court had declared interracial marriage legal, was groundbreaking.

The star would often be asked in interviews about meeting Martin Luther King following the first series in 1966, and would recall with a twinkle in her eye how it was he who encouraged her to stick with Star Trek when she was thinking of leaving for Broadway. And Barack Obama once confirmed he had a crush on her when he was young, she cheekily told the world on Twitter in 2012.

A pioneer whose impressive CV doesn't stop with her acting career, Nichols also worked with NASA, helping to recruit women and those from ethnic minorities to become astronauts.

The meaning of the word ""uhura"" in Swahili is freedom, but there are some arguing that this is not the case for Nichols now. Aged 89 and suffering from dementia, she is sadly stuck in the middle of a legal fight that is gaining traction as the whole world is suddenly familiar with the word at the centre of it: conservatorship.

Britney Spears' case, famously brought to an end after almost 14 years at a momentous court hearing in November, has shone a spotlight on the thousands of others living under the legal agreements, also known as guardianships, across the US.

Spears, who was just 26 when her conservatorship was established, is a very different case to most, as the legal arrangements usually apply to much older people. However, the star's story has undoubtedly raised questions about how conservators should be appointed and assessed.

In the months before her case came to a head, the issue was also highlighted in the film I Care A Lot, starring Rosamund Pike, which told the story of an unscrupulous court-appointed guardian preying on her wealthy elderly wards.

Other celebrities who have lived under conservatorships include The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson in the 1990s, actor Mickey Rooney and US radio DJ Casey Kasem before their deaths, as well as actress Amanda Bynes more recently.

Guardianships that are disputed leave relatives, friends, associates at war - and those they are put in place to protect stuck in the middle, even if both sides do believe they have their loved-ones' best interests at heart. Nichols' case is one of them. Artist Peter Max, a US countercultural star of the 1960s and '70s whose art is said to be worth millions of dollars, is another.

Now, those seeking to ""free"" Nichols, Max and more have the support of the grass-roots campaigners who without question helped Spears' fight: #FreeBritney. In Max's case, his daughter has Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart on board, too.

How many people do conservatorships affect in the US?

According to a 2018 report by the US National Council On Disability, there were an estimated 1.3 million active adult guardianship or conservatorship cases in America at the time, with courts overseeing at least $50bn (about £37bn) of assets.

Each state has its own set of guardianship laws. According to the US Department of Justice, guardians are put in place by a court to make personal and/or financial and property decisions when an individual cannot make those decisions themselves. The aim is to protect the vulnerable - but should be a last resort, the DOJ says, as they remove an individual's legal rights and restrict independence.

US family and divorce lawyer Christopher Melcher, who is based in Los Angeles, says it is hard to know how many conservatorships run smoothly or not as most involved are not famous like Spears or Nichols or Max, so are not high-profile. However, he believes there are flaws in the system.

Image: #FreeBritney campaigners pictured outside the court on the day the star's conservatorship was lifted in November 2021

""A conservatorship is taking control from one adult and placing it in the hands of another,"" he says. ""That's done to protect the person, but then also provides the opportunity for abuse because this is done through a court order but the control is happening on a constant basis outside the presence of the court.

""There's going to be decisions made for this person. They're going to have their friends and family potentially excluded from them. They're going to have their bank account taken away from them.

""Another thing to understand is that we as adults have the right to make bad decisions. And so if our parent, our elderly parent, wants to give their money away or wants to be involved with a new romantic partner or wants to gamble it, they can do that. And the child who expects that inheritance, of course, is going to be anxious and want to keep that from happening. But if it's just poor decision making, that's not a basis for conservatorship.

""The only way that we can put a conservatorship over another is when they are subject to undue influence or fraud or unable to care for basic needs for food, clothing and shelter. It has to be at that level.""

Does this happen in the UK? In the UK, there is a similar law called a deputyship, in which someone is granted the ability to make decisions on behalf of someone lacking mental capacity. Under UK law, you can apply for a deputyship over someone who has severe brain damage or illness, dementia or severe learning disabilities, according to The University Of Law. This can also be granted under two types of deputies: property and financial affairs or personal wellbeing. However, the law in the UK is far more restricted than US conservatorship law, the university says.

#FreeNichelle

Outside the Stanley Mosk court house, the very same court house that heard Spears' case, protesters earlier in January rallied to #FreeNichelle, as they did for the singer for years.

Actress and producer Angelique Fawcette, a friend of Nichols', claims the star was forced into a conservatorship by her son, Kyle Johnson, also an actor, in 2018, which she describes as coercive.

Image: Nichols gave her friend Angelique Fawcette, who contests her conservatorship, away on her wedding day

She is supported by organisations including Kasem Cares, set up to help those fighting elder exploitation and isolation, of which she now is a board member; Secure Women, and the Touch Of Rose Project, born out of the #FreeBritney movement in order to help others.

Fawcette claims Nichols' money has been mishandled and that her home was sold against her will. There are also others who have fought the conservatorship separately.

Lawyers for Johnson did not respond to Sky News' requests for an interview. However, in a statement posted on a GoFundMe page, Nichols' younger sister, Marian Smothers, says it is not Johnson that her sibling needs protecting from, but others fighting the conservatorship. She set up the GoFundMe page to cover legal fees related to the case, which so far has raised more than $180,000.

It is a messy, complicated fight involving allegations from both sides that is now dominating Nichols' final years.

Fawcette's objections to the conservatorship were over-ruled at the court hearing earlier in January, but she has vowed to keep going. She claims Nichols, who gave her away at her wedding, asked her to ""have her back"" years before the legal agreement was put into place.

""I think that a lot of people, they tend to believe family because that's our culture. But what has occurred in Britney Spears' case is that we have now seen an actual case where the family members are not always working in a manner which would benefit the conservatee,"" she said.

An alternative to conservatorship

Fawcette concedes Nichols does need some help, but believes it does not need to be so controlled. ""I don't believe in conservatorship,"" she says. ""Conservatorship strips you of your human and civil rights, you have no say in anything that you want to do. I believe in supported decision making.""

#FreeBritney campaigner Megan Radford, one of the first to use the phrase back in 2009 as she believed even back then that all was not well with the star's conservatorship, is supporting Fawcette.

""The most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing to me is that she was truly a pioneer in the civil rights movement, with her role as Lieutenant Uhura and then her work recruiting minority scientists and astronauts for NASA,"" she says. ""She did all of this work to ensure the civil rights of other black Americans in this country and now she has been completely stripped of her own civil rights. It's not okay.""

#FreePeterMax

During his career, Peter Max has presented portraits to everyone from Bill Clinton and Taylor Swift, and has been the official artist for major events including the 1994 World Cup, the Grammys and the Super Bowl.

Photo agency archives show him pictured at gallery and social events with everyone from Yoko Ono to Prince Edward to Quincy Jones over the years, and his work has been featured on stamps, magazine covers and album sleeves by artists including Yes and Aretha Franklin.

Now 84 and suffering from dementia, he has been in a guardianship for several years but the problems started in 2019; in his case, his guardians are attorneys appointed by the court.

His son, Adam, supports the legal arrangement, while his daughter, Libra, is contesting it. The courts in New York have heard that Max consents to the guardianship and have so far denied his daughter's motions to end it.

In the latest development, Max's current personal guardian, Barbara Lissner, is suing Libra for defamation. Like Nichols' case, it is a hugely complex situation. Despite the lawsuit, Libra says she is still determined to speak out.

""My father has a loving family and a loving community,"" she tells Sky News. ""There is no one in his life that is a danger to him. There is absolutely no reason we should have the government in our life.""

Initially, Libra Max was happy with her father's conservatorship, and says it worked well with the guardian who was initially appointed. However, when his original conservator retired, things changed, she claims. She says she and her brother, Adam, are now only able to see their father on supervised visits. Adam, however, supports the guardianship and says Ms Lissner is doing a ""wonderful job"".

Image: Max pictured at his studio in New York in 1986. Pic: AP

He says visits are regular and it is not that they are supervised, but rather it is ""medically necessary"" for caregivers to be on hand ""to be near him and watching him"".

Larry Flynn, who was appointed Max's property guardian in 2016, says the legal arrangement worked well for years and that there are ""no grounds to remove Ms Lissner, she's doing a fine job"".

The ""elephant in the room"", he says, is Peter Max's artwork, which he says is worth millions of dollars, and that he has worked on many guardianships but never seen one before ""where the manner in which people are approaching it is so dysfunctional"".

In a statement sent to Sky News, Phillips Nizer, the law firm appointed to represent Max's interests, said Libra Max's claims are ""demonstrably false"" and that Elizabeth Adinolfi, his court-appointed attorney ""would be the first to object if Peter's safety or well-being were at risk"".

Like Fawcette, Libra Max has shared videos of her father, which seem to suggest he does not want the conservatorship, on a #FreePeterMax channel on YouTube.

Image: Matthew Rosengart, the lawyer who took over Spears' case, signed up to the team trying to end Peter's Max's conservatorship following his result with the star

However, Phillips Nizer said that Max had ""expressed his preference for independent court-guardians"".

They continued: ""The independent court-appointed guardians are doing an extraordinary job under challenging circumstances, which include the ongoing efforts by Libra Max to disrupt the guardianship. To date, no court has validated her claims or granted her requests.""

The movement started by #FreeBritney

Teresa Kennedy, from the organisation Elder Dignity, says the question of why a conservatee should have to be isolated from family and friends, regardless of whether they need help with finances or not, often goes unanswered.

""Whether it's complicit or complacency, it doesn't really matter,"" she says, because those in power often ""won't listen to the 'crazy' family member"".

Image: Peter Max met Spears early in her career. Pic: Libra Max

She continues: ""You have to ask the question: if this was a child and there was any question about the child's guardian, wouldn't that guardian be removed?""

Coincidentally, Libra Max says her father met Spears after painting a portrait of the star early in her career, before either of them were living under conservatorships. Libra says Spears' case has ""given me a voice"".

Both Adam Max's lawyer Robert Johnson and Mr Flynn say Max's case is ""nothing like"" the Spears case.

""Britney is only 40 years old,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It's clear from her public appearance and public comments that she really didn't need a guardian or a conservatorship... Peter is an older man, so the necessity for a guardianship is a completely different scenario.""

But Libra Max says the outcome of Spears' case proves people were wrong to dismiss the star's fans. ""I think there's a lot more awareness now because of Britney,"" she says. ""[#FreeBritney campaigners] were sort of discredited as just 'crazy fans'. But they really started a very powerful, important social justice movement, a human rights movement.

""It's not in my nature to go public, I knew I was going to get backlash. It's whistleblower retaliation. It was very frightening and it was a hard decision. But the only thing that is going to solve this is exposure - just like Britney.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129030935/http://news.sky.com/story/britney-spears-conservatorship-star-trek-icon-nichelle-nichols-and-pop-art-pioneer-peter-max-is-freebritney-just-the-beginning-12526790;entertainment and culture

This weekend, he will consider a range of options to alleviate Russian aggression in the region, including further deployments and bolstering NATO's defences.

Tougher sanctions are expected to be announced by the Foreign Office on Monday, allowing the UK to target Russia's strategic and financial interests.

It comes as the future of Mr Johnson's premiership remains under doubt, as he awaits the report into parties at Downing Street and Whitehall.

It is understood the report - compiled by senior civil servant Sue Gray - will be sent to Number 10 shortly, as opposed to in a matter of weeks or months.

Meanwhile, the publication of the long-awaited Gray report - which could decide the PM's future - was thrown into disarray on Thursday when Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had opened a criminal inquiry.

The force has been accused of watering down the report as it asked Ms Gray to make only ""minimal reference"" to No 10 events which are subject to a criminal investigation, buying more time for Mr Johnson.

On Friday, the Met insisted it's not asked Ms Gray to delay her report or placed further restrictions on other events.

Lawyers have also criticised the Met's response, and some have questioned how the Met's investigation could be prejudiced if only lesser offences were being considered.

Publication of reports and other inquiries can often be delayed until a police investigation and any court case is concluded, typically to avoid prejudicing a jury.

However, if police investigate under coronavirus laws there would be little risk as the penalty for breaking lockdown rules is a fine and highly unlikely to result in prosecution.

Nazir Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor for the North West, said on Twitter: ""This is absolute nonsense from the Met Police.

Moscow has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine, while at the same time amassing some 120,000 troops near the border of its Eastern European neighbour.

Russia has also expanded its military build-up to include supplies of blood that would allow it to treat casualties - another key indicator that Moscow is preparing an invasion, sources told Reuters news agency.

The UK already has more than 100 troops providing training in Ukraine, 900 military personnel based in Estonia, and a Light Cavalry Squadron of around 150 people is deployed to Poland.

Sky Sports News reports that Eriksen is close to joining the west London club, just seven months after suffering a cardiac arrest in a game against Finland.

Eriksen left Inter Milan last month by mutual consent, after being suspended by the Italian medical authority from playing in Serie A due to a rule prohibiting the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) device.

Image: Players were distraught as Eriksen received medical attention

The 29-year-old had signed for the Italian giants in 2020 from Premier League side Tottenham, where he played for more than six years.

However, he has passed the required medical tests and is fit to play, and will become the first professional in England to play with an ICD fitted.

He had previously said that his heart condition is ""not an obstacle"" to playing, adding that athletes in England are left to work out their own risks.

Before heading to the Community Stadium, Eriksen had been training in Switzerland, as well as with his former side Ajax, preparing for a comeback.

He joins fellow countryman Thomas Frank at Brentford, who manages the team, as well as international teammates Christian Norgaard and Mathias Jensen.

Speaking to Danish media earlier this month, Eriksen revealed he died for about five minutes when he collapsed on the pitch last year, and that he aims to play in this year's World Cup in Qatar.

""My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar. I want to play. That's been my mindset all along. It's a goal, a dream,"" he said.

""Whether I'll be picked is another thing, but it's my dream to come back.

""Physically, I'm back in top shape. I want to prove I've moved on and that I can play on the national team again.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131000846/http://news.sky.com/story/christian-eriksen-set-for-remarkable-premier-league-comeback-with-brentford-after-cardiac-arrest-at-euro-2020-12529034;sports
7554;1550;1550;1550;2017;2017;Spotify to add 'content advisory' to podcast episodes about COVID after Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pull music in misinformation row;2022-01-30;[];['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'spotify'];"Spotify will now add a ""content advisory"" to any podcast episode which discusses coronavirus - after Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their music from the platform due to misinformation about COVID vaccines.

Chief executive Daniel Ek also said the streaming giant will publish its ""long-standing platform rules"", to be more transparent about ""the policies that guide our content more broadly"".

Young and Mitchell removed their music from Spotify because it hosts The Joe Rogan Experience (TJRE) podcast, which has discouraged young people from getting vaccinated against coronavirus and shared a number of false claims about the jab.

Prince Harry and Meghan later weighed in, claiming they expressed concerns about the spread of misinformation on the platform last April. The couple signed a multi-year deal with Spotify to host and produce podcasts in 2020.

What is Spotify going to do?

In a post on Spotify's website announcing the steps being taken, Mr Ek says: ""Personally, there are plenty of views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly... it is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.""

He then goes on to outline how any podcast episode about COVID will now be accompanied by a content advisory.

He writes: ""This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources.""

Mr Ek says the company will also begin publishing its platform rules, which were ""developed by our internal team in concert with a number of outside experts and are updated regularly to reflect the changing safety landscape"".

The rules tell contributors not to promote dangerous, deceptive, sensitive or illegal content on its platform.

The guidance adds that ""breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify"".

Mr Ek also said the company will ""begin testing ways to highlight our platform rules in our creator and publisher tools to raise awareness around what's acceptable and help creators understand their accountability for the content they post on our platform"".

Sussexes won't follow Young and Mitchell off Spotify

The statement comes as Prince Harry and Meghan said they will continue to work with the platform despite their concerns about misinformation.

The couple signed a lucrative deal with the streaming giant to host and produce podcasts, estimated to be worth around $25m (£18m), in late 2020.

A spokesperson from the couple's charity Archewell said: ""Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day.

""Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all too real consequences of Covid-19 misinformation on its platform.

""We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis.

""We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.""

Spotify acquired The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2020, reportedly for more than $100m (£77m).";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131000846/http://news.sky.com/story/spotify-to-add-content-advisory-to-podcast-episodes-about-covid-after-neil-young-and-joni-mitchell-pull-music-in-misinformation-row-12529130;environment

Ms Duffield, who has represented the seat of Canterbury in Kent since 2017, said the party under both Jeremy Corbyn and successor Sir Keir Starmer has ""offered me no support at all since I unexpectedly became an MP 5 years ago"".

A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The party continues to be in touch with Rosie Duffield and has offered her advice and support.""

I am aware of yet more personal, libellous, nasty and fictional crap being published about me again today. All published/written by ex and current @UKLabour members who are clearly absolutely obsessed by my private life for some reason. I have been subjected to this rubbish... — Rosie Duffield MP 🦕💜🦖 (@RosieDuffield1) January 30, 2022

Ms Duffield made the comments in a series of tweets, which she said had been prompted by ""yet more personal, libellous, nasty and fictional crap being published about me again today"".

The MP said this had ""all published/written by ex and current @UKLabour members who are clearly absolutely obsessed by my private life for some reason"".

""I have been subjected to this rubbish for several years now. It is obsessive harassment,"" she said.

Ms Duffield, who said she cannot afford to take libel action against those making the comments, hit out at the party's leadership, claiming: ""Neither the Labour Party or either the former or current Leader or the Whips' Office have done anything at all to stop it, to offer me any support, help or legal assistance.""

She praised Kent Police, the security team in parliament and the office of Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, but added: ""It is the Labour Party that have offered me no support at all since I unexpectedly became an MP 5 years ago.

""I am today considering my future in the Party very carefully.""

Ms Duffield missed the party's annual conference in September on security advice.

It came after reports she had received online threats from transgender campaigners.

Ms Duffield has previously been branded a ""transphobe"" on social media for making the comment that ""only women have a cervix"".

She has also been criticised for her opposition to transgender women being able to access single-sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges, school toilets and prisons.

But the MP said ""this issue in no way relates to my stance on women's rights"".

She added: ""I need support from the @UKLabour in Kent and against the constant stream of fictional and factional bile that is written about me.""
