6181;146;146;146;240;240;Migrant crossings: 2021 marks record year with more than 28,300 people entering UK via English Channel;2022-01-04;[];['migrant crisis', 'migrant crossings'];"Last year saw a record number of migrants entering the UK aboard small boats via the English Channel, latest data suggests.

More than 28,300 people made the treacherous journey in 2021 - triple the number for the year before, according to figures from the Home Office and analysed by the PA news agency.

The figures come as ministers are warned that arrivals will continue and more people will drown in the stretch of sea between France and Britain if the government pursues its current ""dangerous and callous"" immigration plan.

November - the record month for crossings

The highest number of crossings was recorded in November, when at least 6,869 people reached the country, with more than 3,100 of those arriving in the space of six days.

On 24 November, at least 27 people died when their boat, which was likened to a blow-up pool, sank in the Channel.

During the same month, a new daily record for the number of people reaching British shores aboard small boats was set when 1,185 arrived on Remembrance Day.

In 2020, the highest daily figure was 416 which was recorded in September of that year.

Overall, at least 28,395 people reached the UK aboard small boats in 2021, according to PA analysis.

Government plans to tackle the issue

The yearly figure comes despite the UK government promising millions of pounds to French authorities to tackle the issue and the announcement of a new plan for immigration under the Nationality and Borders Bill.

If passed, the bill, which is currently in the House of Lords for readings, would make knowingly arriving in the UK without permission a criminal offence.

Home Office minister Tom Pursglove MP said: ""Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel.""

He said the government is ""reforming"" its approach by ""making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws and UK taxpayers"".

Mr Pursglove added: ""The public has been crying out for reform for two decades and that's what this government is delivering through our New Plan for Immigration.""

What is the Nationality and Borders Bill, why is it so controversial and what do MPs want to change?

The government 'must wake up'

Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive at Refugee Action, said that the UK government's policy will lead to more deaths in the Dover Strait.

He said: ""People will continue to cross the Channel in flimsy boats, and smugglers will continue to profit, unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum here.

""[In November] we saw the deadly result of their strategy of keeping people out rather than keeping people safe, when at least 27 people died near our coast.

Image: A view of a warehouse facility in Dover, Kent, for boats used by migrants

""And yet the government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its anti-refugee bill, which will only lead to more people drowning. It must wake up and scrap this bill now.""

Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais which supports refugees living in northern France, said rising numbers of small boat arrivals in Britain reflect a shift away from attempts to cross by lorry.

She said: ""If the government were serious about stopping people smugglers, it would create a safe way for people to claim asylum and put people smugglers out of business once and for all.""

What about the rest of Europe?

Despite the increasing numbers, the UK's small boat arrivals are a fraction of the number of people arriving in Europe.

At least 120,441 people arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean by land and sea in 2021, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

6233;199;199;199;311;311;Taking covert photos of breastfeeding mothers could lead to two years in jail;2022-01-04;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];['domestic abuse', 'stella creasy'];"Taking pictures of breastfeeding mothers without their consent could result in a two-year jail sentence under plans to change the law.

The taking of ""non-consensual photographs or video recordings of breastfeeding mothers"" would be made a ""specific"" voyeurism offence in England and Wales, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.

The amendment to the Police, Crime Sentencing and Court Bill was put forward by the government on Tuesday after Labour MP Stella Creasy campaigned for legal reforms after being photographed breastfeeding her then four-month-old baby on a London Overground train near Highbury and Islington.

Those found guilty could face up to two years in prison and would cover situations ""where the motive is to obtain sexual gratification or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm"".

Another amendment to the statute was put forward so domestic abuse victims will be given more time to go to the police.

Ms Creasy welcomed the amendment and said: ""That breastpests can now be stopped is testament to the hard work of campaigner Julia Cooper, Jeff Smith MP, Baroness Helene Hayman and Lord Pannick.

""It also shows why we set up the This Mum Votes Campaign to get more mums into public life - because their experiences matter and when we listen to them in decision making, life gets better for all involved.""

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said ""no new mum should be harassed in this way"".

He added: ""We are committed to doing everything we can to protect women, make them feel safer, and give them greater confidence in the justice system.""

Creating a specific offence gives ""police and prosecutors the clarity and powers they need to ensure perpetrators face justice"", the MoJ said.

Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the amendment giving domestic abuse victims more time to report assaults.

Image: Yvette Cooper brought the domestic abuse amendment after a constituent was told nothing could be done for her

Currently, the time limit on common assault cases is six months, meaning a prosecution has to be brought to court within six months of the alleged office.

But that could be extended to two years as cases can involve violence or threatening behaviour that leads to fear of attack, with victims reluctant to come forward.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper put forward the amendment last year after a woman in her constituency reported ""repeated domestic abuse but was told she had run out of time and nothing could be done"".

Ms Cooper said: ""We've been putting huge pressure on the government to lift the time limit so I'm glad they have now accepted our proposal to stop victims of domestic abuse being timed out of justice.

""We will keep up the pressure for more action.""

The Australian newspaper reported that the world tennis number one has been denied any ""special treatment"" during his stay in immigration custody.

Djokovic is spending a third day in a Melbourne hotel that has doubled up as an immigration detention facility - a couple of miles from the luxury hotels where most Australian Open players are staying.

He is currently embroiled in a row over whether he is exempt from the country's COVID vaccination rules, and is facing deportation after his visa was cancelled.

Lawyers representing the 34-year-old are planning to appeal in court on Monday.

A summary of their case has indicated he tested positive for COVID-19 on 16 December and he had a valid visa and medical exemption from the organiser of the Australian Open.

He has also requested alternative accommodation so he could train for the tournament which starts on 17 January.

Djokovic, who has expressed scepticism about coronavirus vaccines in the past, wrote on Instagram yesterday: ""Thank you to the people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated.""

The furore meant the Serbian tennis star was unable to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on Friday - an important religious holiday.

A priest from the Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church in Melbourne had attempted to visit Djokovic, but was turned down by immigration officials because the hotel is under lockdown.

Supporters of the nine-time Australian Open champion have gathered outside the Park Hotel, waving banners as he remains cooped up inside.

Even before Djokovic's arrival, the hotel had hit headlines amid allegations that maggots and mould were in the bread given to detainees.

The 32-year-old, who is originally from Iran, added: ""We are refugees, we are innocent people - we've not committed any crime. They just keep me like hostage here.""

The third and fourth floors of the Park Hotel were damaged by fire on 23 December - and during an evacuation, some asylum seekers ended up becoming infected with COVID because they were held together with quarantining passengers who had tested positive.

'Challenging weeks' ahead

Daily numbers of coronavirus infections in Australia are repeatedly breaking records as the Omicron variant spreads.

An unprecedented 45,098 new infections were reported in New South Wales, the country's most populous state, on Saturday - up from 38,625 the day before.

The surge has prompted New South Wales to reintroduce some restrictions, with dancing and singing in pubs and nightclubs now prohibited.

Health officials in the state believe cases may only peak at the end of January, warning: ""We have got some challenging weeks ahead of us. But we have been planning for this pandemic and continuing to reinvent ourselves for two years now.""

The charges are set to be the subject of a separate trial but prosecutors said scrapping the case would help victims get ""closure"" and avoid the ""trauma of testifying again"".

The offer to dismiss the charges came in a letter on Monday night to District Judge Alison Nathan.

Maxwell is alleged to have lied about her knowledge of Epstein's behaviour in a separate civil lawsuit in 2016. Each charge carries a maximum five-year jail sentence.

Maxwell, 60, was found guilty last month of trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and faces up to 65 years in jail.

She was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for Epstein to molest in massage rooms between 1994 and 2004 at his various properties.

In the letter, prosecutors also asked the judge to sentence Maxwell in about three to four months' time.

Defence lawyers oppose laying down any timetable as they have called for a retrial in the main case after two jurors who convicted her said they were sexually abused.

'Incontrovertible grounds for new trial'

They told Judge Nathan that the issue ""presents incontrovertible grounds for a new trial"".

Maxwell's lawyer's have been given until 19 January to formally explain their grounds for overturning the conviction. Prosecutors will have until 2 February to respond.

Answering an urgent question tabled by Labour about the party, Paymaster General Michael Ellis told MPs he has ""confidence"" in Mr Johnson's ""integrity and honour"".

Senior civil servant Sue Gray is leading the ongoing inquiry into multiple allegations of COVID rule-breaking in Downing Street and other government buildings.

""It will establish the facts and if wrongdoing is established there will be requisite disciplinary action taken,"" Mr Ellis said of the investigation, adding that it ""would not be appropriate"" for him to comment further while it is ongoing.

To further laughter, Mr Ellis told the Commons: ""It is clear that in this country the same rules apply to everyone.""

""The prime minister is going nowhere. He retains the confidence of the people of this country,"" the paymaster general later added when asked directly if such a gathering in the Downing Street garden would have broken the government's own coronavirus rules in place at the time.

But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner, who had asked the PM to answer the urgent question, said Mr Johnson's absence from the Commons ""speaks volumes"".

""I think his absence speaks volumes as does his smirks on the media, the public have already drawn their own conclusions. He can run but he can't hide,"" Ms Rayner said, adding that there is ""no need for an investigation"".

""If the prime minister was there, surely he knew,"" she continued.

In response, Mr Ellis said ""there is a need"" for an investigation ""and that need is clear"".

""She asks if I have confidence in the prime minister's integrity and honour, and I do,"" he added.

Labour MP Dame Angela Eagle later quipped: ""Perhaps it would be faster if Sue Gray were to investigate the days there weren't parties.""

The Queen's second son has been accused of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 - allegations he vehemently denies.

Despite stepping back from public duties over his links to sex offender Epstein, Andrew has kept the title of the Duke of York, along with several honorary military roles.

But after a US judge refused to throw out Ms Giuffre's civil lawsuit against Andrew, Sky News looks at what the future may hold for the duke and whether he could be stripped of his titles.

Could Andrew be stripped of his Duke of York title?

Ahead of today's court ruling, palace officials had reportedly discussed plans to ask the Duke of York to stop using the title in the event he lost the lawsuit brought by Ms Giuffre.

However, royal commentator and biographer Christopher Warwick believes it is ""highly unlikely"" that Andrew will lose that title.

He told Sky News that while the Queen can appoint dukes, it takes an act of parliament to remove their titles ""which wouldn't cover Andrew or the monarchy in glory"".

Mr Warwick said the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act was introduced during the First World War to deprive ""enemy royals"" from retaining their British peerages and titles.

But he added: ""Andrew is not an enemy of Britain, so the Titles Deprivation Act wouldn't come into it.""

What has Prince Andrew been accused of?

Why has Andrew kept his HRH title but Harry and Meghan can't use theirs?

While Prince Andrew stepped down from public duties ""for the foreseeable future"" in November 2019, he is still referred to as ""His Royal Highness"" on the official Royal Family website.

This is in contrast to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who were asked to stop using their HRH titles when they announced they would not return as working members of the Royal Family in February 2020.

The Queen told Harry and Meghan that it was ""not possible"" for the couple ""to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"", which meant cutting their official links with military, Commonwealth and charitable associations.

However, Mr Warwick said he did not believe the decision to allow Andrew to continue using his HRH title can be compared to Harry and Meghan's situation.

""There was a feeling (the Duke and Duchess of Sussex) may cash in on being Royal Highnesses,"" he told Sky News.

""Harry and Meghan are making their own living. Because of that, the Queen did not want them to trade on being Royal Highnesses.

""Andrew, of course, is quite different. He's not making a living. Right now, he's not doing anything at all, except for facing Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit.

""It's not comparing like-with-like.""

Who's who in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal?

Could Andrew be stripped of his military roles?

Following a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, Andrew has several honorary military titles. They include:

• Colonel of the Grenadier Guards

• Deputy colonel-in-chief of the Royal Lancers

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps

• Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers

• Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth

• Commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm

Image: The Duke of York, pictured in 2003, is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

Mr Warwick said the title of colonel of the Grenadier Guards was ""very close to the Queen's heart"" because she was given the role on her 16th birthday before Prince Philip was appointed in 1975, with Andrew succeeding his father in 2017.

In August, it was reported the Queen had ""let it be known"" she wanted her son to remain colonel of the Grenadier Guards.

But Mr Warwick said there was ""a feeling across the regiment that it's not appropriate to retain him"".

""It puts her in an invidious situation but of course, as his mother, what she's not going to do is turn her back on him,"" he told Sky News.

In early January, a veteran of the Grenadier Guards called for the Duke of York to step down from his role as colonel of the regiment ""immediately"".

Former lance sergeant Julian Perreria told The Times that Andrew retaining the title ""will put a stain on the regiment's proud history and devalue the hard work of past and future generations of Grenadiers"".

As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, decisions on military titles rest ultimately with the Queen.

But those decisions are made on the advice of the military, according to Rupert Wieloch, a retired colonel who trained with Andrew for a year and spent more than 35 years with the Royal Lancers.

He told Sky News: ""The Army Board will look to see if he matches the role in terms of the integrity and values the Army stands up for.""

Richard Kemp, a retired colonel and British commander in Afghanistan, has said the Queen's sense of duty to the military could supersede her loyalty to her son.

He told The Times: ""If she decided it would be right for Andrew to forfeit his military titles, she will do so, putting her duty to the forces above any family considerations or personal views.""

Which charities and organisations are still linked to Andrew?

Although many relinquished their ties with him after 2019, Andrew is still listed on the Royal Family's website as being a patron or member of around 100 charities and organisations, including hospital trusts, cricket clubs and schools.

They include the Army Officers' Golfing Society, Berkshire County Cricket Club, Killyleagh Yacht Club, Horris Hill School in Hampshire, and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust.

Mr Warwick, however, believes it is ""highly unlikely"" that Andrew will return to ""any kind of public role"".

""I personally would be extremely surprised if he ever returned to public duties,"" he told Sky News.

""I don't think the public has an appetite for Andrew as a public figure, as a working member of the Royal Family.

""He's tainted. It's something that is so disastrous for any member of the Royal Family to be in that situation - friends with (Jeffrey) Epstein and (Ghislaine) Maxwell. Where's the judgement where Andrew is concerned?

Phil Booth, coordinator at MedConfidential, warned that increased monitoring of wastewater from sinks, drains and toilets, which can reveal infections and drug use, needs to be properly regulated.

""The concerns will be raised more by the mission creep, the feature creep, the ways in which these miniaturised technologies might get used and abused beyond the pandemic,"" he said.

""There needs to be regulation of every sort of technology that can have an effect on people's lives and on individual people.""

His claims follow the launch by a biotech company in York of what it calls a ""mobile surveillance platform"" to detect COVID in sewage from individual buildings.

The suitcase-sized equipment can be connected to any drain to send data remotely to a computer where it is interpreted using artificial intelligence.

The firm, Modern Water, says it has static monitors installed at 3,000 sites in 60 countries and can detect ""medicines, pesticides, personal care, [and] hormones"" in wastewater.

It began testing its Microtox PD mobile COVID monitoring system in UK municipal sewage treatment works last year.

Paul Ryan, chief business development officer at the firm's parent company, Deepverge, told Sky News he expects the new device to be available for hire within months to monitor COVID in buildings including schools, hospitals and hotels.

""This is about surveillance, this is about identifying the presence of COVID and other pathogens ahead of time,"" he said.

""I think there's a growing consensus that wastewater based epidemiology offers a whole new layer of information which allows national health surveillance.""

Image: Modern Water's new mobile surveillance platform

The testing of raw sewage has been dramatically increased since the discovery in 2020 that it contains remnants of the COVID-19 virus.

Last year the UK government's Joint Biosecurity Centre opened a new laboratory near Exeter which is now testing thousands of samples taken from sewage treatment works and individual drains every week.

A report published in September 2021 said the centre's Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection programme was covering approximately 40 million people in England.

The increased monitoring comes as the identification of illegal drug use from sewage analysis is growing, according to an EU report published last year into monitoring between 2011 and 2020.

The report ranked 80 European towns and cities, none of which are in the UK, for consumption of codeine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA, based on drug residues found in sewage.

""The results provide a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved,"" it said.

The UK Health Security Agency, which oversees the national wastewater monitoring programme, told Sky News its wastewater programme follows government data protection standards.

""The data provided to local and national decision-makers relating to COVID-19 is not considered personal data,"" the agency said in an emailed response.

""It cannot identify infected individuals or homes as it is designed to provide insights at a community level.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220116020822/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-technology-developed-to-track-spread-of-coronavirus-could-be-abused-privacy-campaigner-warns-12516018;science and technology;health

A legal representative for Harry said he wants to bring his son Archie and seven-month-old baby daughter Lilibet to visit from the US, but fears they will be ""unable to return to his home"" because it is too dangerous.

The duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill after he stepped down as a senior member of the Royal Family.

Harry is now arguing his private protection team in the US does not have access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his wife and children family safe.

The legal representative for the duke said in a statement: ""The UK will always be Prince Harry's home and a country he wants his wife and children to be safe in.

""With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk.""

The representative added: ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK.

""In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.""

Harry briefly returned from the US last July for the unveiling of a statue of his late mother Princess Diana.

The day before, he met seriously ill children and young people at a WellChild garden party and afternoon tea in Kew Gardens, west London.

However, it is understood the duke's car was chased by photographers as he left.

Harry has shared his concerns in the past about his family's safety after Diana died in a car crash after she was chased by the paparazzi in Paris in 1997.

The legal representative added: ""Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.

""While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not.

Andrew has been accused of ""victim blaming"" and ""gaslighting"" following the request, which includes confidential notes from her counselling sessions.

Ms Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew's former friend, to have sex with the duke and is suing him in a US civil court.

Andrew - who was stripped of his military titles last week - has always vehemently denied the allegations.

The duke's legal team want to question Ms Giuffre's psychologist, Dr Judith Lightfoot, about her ""alleged emotional and psychological harm and damages"", including inspecting prescriptions and notes from their sessions.

They also want to quiz her on the ""theory of false memories"" and ask about Ms Giuffre's ""alleged childhood trauma and abuse"".

Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, hit out at the request, telling the Daily Mail: ""This is exactly what [Ghislaine] Maxwell tried. It didn't end well. People may misremember a lot of things, but they don't misremember sexual abuse by a prince of England.

""In addition, Prince Andrew needs to say that all the other people who saw them together also have 'false memories'.""

A source close to the duke told Sky News his lawyers' request was legitimate.

""Ms Giuffre put her mental health at issue by suing for emotional distress damages,"" they said.

""The duke's legal team are perfectly entitled to test her claims, determine her damages, if any, and see what she told her therapist or not.""

A lawyer specialising in cases involving violence against women criticised the request.

Dr Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and Cambridge academic, said it appeared Andrew was trying to use Ms Giuffre's medical records to discredit her.

""It's nothing more than victim blaming and gaslighting,"" she told Sky News.

""Looking through her intimate, personal records when she would have told that person that information in the strictest confidence.

""For that to be used, manipulated and twisted against her is likely to be harmful and extremely damaging, and probably will be traumatising.

""It's another form of abuse but this time through the court process.""

Dr Proudman said she hoped that Ms Giuffre opposed the request. ""It's a really low tactic,"" she added. ""It's the lowest of the low.""

The latest turn in the case comes after a judge rejected the prince's attempt to get the lawsuit thrown out. A civil trial is now planned for later this year.

Why judge rejected Andrew's bid to have lawsuit thrown out

Ms Giuffre's lawyers have sought witness accounts from Andrew's former assistant, Robert Olney, and a woman called Shukri Walker, who claims to have seen the royal ""with a young girl"" in London's Tramp nightclub.

Ms Walker allegedly saw the royal ""with a young girl around the time that (Ms Giuffre) contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub"", court documents say.

Ghislaine Maxwell - who recruited girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse - will be sentenced at the end of June.

Her defence team is pushing for a retrial after a juror admitted he told other jurors he was sexually abused as a child and used his experiences to persuade others to convict Maxwell.

Chief executive Daniel Ek also said the streaming giant will publish its ""long-standing platform rules"", to be more transparent about ""the policies that guide our content more broadly"".

Young and Mitchell removed their music from Spotify because it hosts The Joe Rogan Experience (TJRE) podcast, which has discouraged young people from getting vaccinated against coronavirus and shared a number of false claims about the jab.

Prince Harry and Meghan later weighed in, claiming they expressed concerns about the spread of misinformation on the platform last April. The couple signed a multi-year deal with Spotify to host and produce podcasts in 2020.

In a post on Spotify's website announcing the steps being taken, Mr Ek says: ""Personally, there are plenty of views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly... it is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.""

He then goes on to outline how any podcast episode about COVID will now be accompanied by a content advisory.

He writes: ""This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources.""

Mr Ek says the company will also begin publishing its platform rules, which were ""developed by our internal team in concert with a number of outside experts and are updated regularly to reflect the changing safety landscape"".

The rules tell contributors not to promote dangerous, deceptive, sensitive or illegal content on its platform.

The guidance adds that ""breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify"".

Mr Ek also said the company will ""begin testing ways to highlight our platform rules in our creator and publisher tools to raise awareness around what's acceptable and help creators understand their accountability for the content they post on our platform"".

The statement comes as Prince Harry and Meghan said they will continue to work with the platform despite their concerns about misinformation.

The couple signed a lucrative deal with the streaming giant to host and produce podcasts, estimated to be worth around $25m (£18m), in late 2020.

A spokesperson from the couple's charity Archewell said: ""Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day.

1668;1668;1668;1668;1688;1688;What does Australia’s removal from the European Council’s travel ‘white list’ mean?;2022-01-24;['Calla Wahlquist'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Australian immigration and asylum'];"The European Council has removed Australia from the “white list”, a register of countries from which it recommends travel restrictions should be lifted. The council’s list of epidemiologically-safe third countries is non-binding and countries within the European Union are able to set their own border requirements, which may involve quarantine or testing requirements. What did the European Council decide? The European Council said on 17 January it had updated its list of countries for which travel restrictions should be lifted, and removed Argentina, Australia and Canada. The decision is non-binding on European Union member states and reviewed every two weeks. Under the criteria used by the European Council, all restrictions on travellers from a third country can be lifted if the rate of Covid-19 infections in the past 14 days is less than 75 in 100,000.
The criteria also states that if countries accept proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions such as testing or quarantine requirements, they should in principle lift restrictions on travel for all double-dosed international travellers. This decision to remove Australia from the list was made in the 14 days in which Australia’s daily Covid numbers shot up from 30,000 to more than 100,000. In the past week, Australia has averaged 274 cases per 100,000, a 20% drop on the previous seven days. The European Council criteria also includes an “emergency brake mechanism”. It states: “Where the epidemiological situation of a third country or region worsens quickly, in particular if a variant of concern or of interest has been detected, member states should adopt an urgent, temporary restriction on all travel into the EU”. At the moment, the list of countries for which European countries are recommended to allow not-restricted travel is: Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, and China, subject to confirmation of reciprocity. What does that mean for Australians planning to travel to Europe? The chief executive of Flight Centre, Graham Turner, says the removal of Australia from the EU white list will have “minimal effect on vaccinated Australians travelling to Europe”. “Each EU country has their own protocols and if you are vaccinated most do not require pre-departure testing and isolation at arrival,” he said. “I believe the indications are that within three to six weeks Australians will be able to fly to North America and UK/Europe without pre-departure tests and tourists will be able to fly here under the same conditions.” Cyprus, Greece and Italy have already said they will not restrict travellers from Australia. Germany, meanwhile, has listed Australia as a high-risk area since 9 January, but quarantine-free travel is still allowed for fully-vaccinated Australians who test negative after arrival. Does this affect travel to the United Kingdom? No. The United Kingdom is currently open to quarantine-free travel from all countries. If you are fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine and have a vaccine certificate, you are required to book and pay for a Covid-19 test before getting on your flight to be taken within 48 hours of your arrival in the UK. If you test positive you will be required to isolate but there are no separate quarantine requirements. If you are not fully vaccinated you must take a Covid-19 test within two days before travelling to the UK, and then book and pay for PCR tests to be taken on day 2 and 8 after your arrival. There is still no requirement to quarantine.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/what-does-australias-removal-from-the-european-councils-travel-white-list-mean;environment;health
1316;1316;1316;1316;1331;1331;Parents in NSW threatened with court action for keeping children home from school;2022-01-25;['Michael McGowan'];['New South Wales', 'Australian education', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Parents and parenting'];"Parents in New South Wales have been threatened with court action for keeping their children home from school because of concerns about catching Covid-19. Classes in NSW will resume next week after the release of the state government’s return to school plan on Sunday. While the government said the plan – which includes the use of rapid antigen tests and a rollout of about 20,000 air purifiers across the state – means students can go back to classes safely, some parents remain sceptical.
On Monday, the Guardian reported that a group of concerned parents plan to file legal action against the Department of Education over its refusal to grant them permission to keep their children at home because of fears about contracting the virus. Despite premier Dominic Perrottet insisting on Tuesday that it would be “ridiculous” to fine parents who keep children out of school, the Guardian has confirmed that the education department has denied numerous attempts by parents to seek exemptions for their children throughout the pandemic. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, Sterre Siegenbeek van Heukelom, a mother from the Illawarra region of NSW, was last year denied leave to keep her son home from school on the basis that she, not her child, was classified as being vulnerable to the virus. The correspondence – which is similar in tone to other advice given to parents – stated that advice from NSW Health was that there is “limited risk” in students bringing Covid from school into the home. It stated that exemptions would only be granted in cases where a medical practitioner “explicitly advises” the student should not attend classes. Despite later providing medical advice from her doctor, Siegenbeek van Heukelom’s requests for an exemption have continued to be denied. “In summary, your son is not ill, but lives with someone who is at increased risk,” one letter from the department to Siegenbeek van Heukelom stated. “Learning from home for your son can only be supported if clear and explicit medical advice stating that he should not attend school face to face is received.” Siegenbeek van Heukelom, who has health conditions which placed her in the 1b category during the vaccine rollout, said it was ironic that NSW Health advice about avoiding indoor gatherings did not apply to school settings. “With the transmission and rate of the virus going around in the community it doesn’t feel safe for me as someone who is vulnerable to the virus, and NSW agrees with me that enclosed spaces with many people not being able to socially distance and not being able to wear masks is not ideal,” she said.
The government has said that the social, educational and mental health benefits for students attending classes far outweigh the health risks associated with the virus, but the premier has repeatedly said he understands the anxiety facing some parents. Perrottet on Tuesday insisted that parents wouldn’t be punished for keeping children at home during the Omicron wave due to existing health concerns. “When we talk about parents being concerned [and] anxious, particularly in circumstances where their children may have underlying health conditions, we’re certainly not going to be fining parents,” he said. But parents have been threatened with legal action. In a letter sent by a principal to a mother with a pre-existing health condition who kept her child away from school last year, the threat of court action was raised because of “unsatisfactory attendance”. “I am required to make an application to the home school liaison program … for consideration of further action,” the letter stated. “An attendance officer may be allocated to work with you and the school to develop an attendance improvement program. “If you do not meaningfully engage with the attendance improvement program, or there is no improvement in [your son’s] attendance … the Department of Education and Communities may consider further action such as an application to the children’s court for compulsory schooling orders.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
In a statement, the Department of Education did not respond directly to questions about whether parents could be punished for keeping their children at home once term resumes due to a fear of contracting Covid. Instead a spokesperson said regular attendance at school for all students was “essential to learning and wellbeing”, and cases in which parents were concerned about their child’s attendance would be “managed collaboratively in partnership between schools and parents”. “When schools are open, all students should be at school unless they are unwell; or they have a medical certificate which states that they are unable to return to school due to an ongoing medical condition,” a spokesperson said. “These students can be supported to learn from home provided a valid medical certificate is supplied. “There are a range of options available if students are prevented from attending school, including the sick or general leave and exemptions from attendance under Section 25 of the Education Act 1990. We always act reasonably when considering leave explanations and exemption applications and will continue to do so.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/parents-in-nsw-threatened-with-court-action-for-keeping-children-home-from-school;business and economy;politics
425;425;425;425;432;432;‘Stranded’: horror month for Australian homelessness services as Omicron ravages sector;2022-01-29;['Luke Henriques-Gomes'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Homelessness'];"Stephanie Oatley recalls a day in late December when she needed to get a whole unit of young people experiencing homelessness tested for Covid. “We had a young person who started showing symptoms, and a second young person got an itchy throat,” says Oatley. “In the van they hopped. There was only one place open … They got there at 9am, and waited for nine hours.” Oatley is the chief executive of Platform Youth Services, which provides crisis accommodation to people as young as 12 in Sydney’s west, Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury regions. Like most sectors of the east coast economy, homelessness services have been ravaged by Omicron, leaving them without enough staff, forcing them to reduce services and to lock down their crisis accommodation. Some have been scrambling to find – and then fork out thousands of dollars on – rapid tests.
“Services feel that they have been stranded,” says Katherine McKernan, the chief executive of Homelessness New South Wales. She notes the government had acted quickly to provide hotel accommodation for the homeless during previous outbreaks. But the Omicron response has been lacking. “The processes in place for the previous lockdown have not been able to be implemented due the high number of cases and the overwhelmed health system,” she says, “and none of the arrangements for hotel accommodation provided to rough sleepers has been reinstated this time around.” In Platform’s case the situation has been particularly complex. Those staying in its crisis accommodation are aged between 12 and 17. As a result, Oatley says Covid-positive clients couldn’t move to a health hotel. Due to severe staff shortages, some employees were essentially forced to move into the crisis units during outbreaks “just to get us through”. “The big thing is staff shortages,” says Oatley. “We’d have one staff member that would come down with Covid and then nine staff would get Covid from that one case. The clients would have Covid. We’re a small service of 45 staff, we’ve had 16 key staff get Covid. “One of our houses has just been constant for three weeks,” she adds. Guardian Australia this week reported the findings of a Productivity Commission report that found that, pre-Omicron, nearly half of all people who seek help with homelessness in NSW were unable to get it.
McKernan says the “unprecedented number of cases in services” meant some services have been forced to “make really difficult decisions around reducing intake, reducing the number of clients in accommodation in order to enable clients to isolate”. She notes it’s already “unfortunately already a hugely busy time for homelessness services”. In Melbourne, Launch Housing, which runs four crisis accommodation services across the city, has been forced to twice lock down its facilities due to an Omicron outbreak.
“What that effectively means is that every time we have a Covid outbreak on site we don’t take new referrals,” says Andrew Hollows, a general manager at Launch Housing. In simple terms, an outbreak means for a short period some people who need crisis accommodation will not be able to receive it. These are, as McKernan says, “really difficult decisions”. Hollows says in these lockdown periods, Launch has been able to assist clients in other ways. “Even if they couldn’t go to crisis accommodation, they would still go to other accommodation options, or help them with financial assistance,” he says. “It wasn’t like we weren’t providing any response.” Peter Valpiani, chief executive of The Haymarket Foundation, which provides crisis accommodation and drug and alcohol services in Sydney, has done overnight shifts at its crisis accommodation as a result of the staff shortages. He says the Omicron crisis has flow-on effects for people the service assists.
“We had a gentleman that was a close contact because he lived in the same house as somebody who tested positive, and he had just gotten a job,” says Valpiani. “You can imagine someone who is putting their life together, just returned to employment, and as a close contact you can’t work.” Valpiani says the man had tested positive via a rapid test and was therefore denied access to the Centrelink pandemic payment, which at the time required a PCR test result. “He was in this position where he needed the money in order to pay his rent, to not become homeless again,” he says, adding that Haymarket offered the man financial support. Then there has been the RAT race. McKernan says Homelessness NSW and the sector had first requested access to and use of RATs as a way of supporting clients in August 2021. The NSW government is now in the process of providing services with free access to rapid tests and has indicated it will reimburse them for past purchases. But the past month has been tough, even more so for clients. Another challenge is that for some people experiencing homelessness, seven days of isolation can bring back trauma. “You’ve got people with, say, an incarceration history, so as soon as you say ‘hey, you’re locked up and you can’t leave’, that can cause sort of emotional triggers with people,” says Valpiani. “We have to do it in a really trauma-informed, sensitive way and look at ways in which we can provide bits of entertainment for people. Just to kind of get their mind off things, or to reduce anxiety.”
Importantly, all homelessness services Guardian Australia spoke to say that while they have battled outbreaks in crisis accommodation, no clients have become seriously ill or required hospitalisation. But Oatley says several rounds of isolation due to cases in the services have been tough on the young people who rely on her organisation. “Young people don’t like being contained in a bedroom,” she says. “We were lucky we had access to … Netflix, Xboxes, and we got a big donation of really good art supplies.” Oatley acknowledges that Omicron was always bound to cause havoc. But she insists the chaos that was wrought on homelessness services could have been avoided. “I think the government was just really irresponsible when they opened everything back up without the resources,” says Oatley. “That’s the sort of stuff that I got a bit frustrated with. The government has made all these decisions but without the resources to implement them.” Asked if, things have improved after a horror month, Oatley replies: “No, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. “School’s coming back. Our staff is coming back to work. We’ve got RAT tests. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. So can our young people.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/stranded-horror-month-for-australian-homelessness-services-as-omicron-ravages-sector;environment;health
4270;4270;4270;4270;4316;4316;Payout offers over Post Office IT scandal sent to less than third of applicants;2022-01-11;['Haroon Siddique'];['Post Office', 'UK news', 'Postal service', 'Politics', 'House of Commons', 'Business', 'Law'];Less than a third of Post Office workers who applied for compensation under a government scheme in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal have received a payout offer, almost 17 months after it closed, MPs have been told. The Horizon IT system installed by the Post Office and supplied by Fujitsu falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls, leading to 736 unsafe convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. The historical shortfall scheme (HSS) was set up in 2020, with a closing date for applications in August of that year, to compensate Post Office workers who had not been convicted but who had instead been forced to replace missing funds from their own pocket. Appearing before the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee on Tuesday, the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, said that there had been 2,500 applications to the HSS but only 777 offers had been made. He said the size of the panel dealing with claims was doubled in October, and was bullish about future progress. “From my perspective, we will get to 50% by the end of March and we will get to in excess of 95% by the end of the calendar year … I hope therefore that we will ensure that as many of those individuals who have come forward will be compensated and/or their families if not the individuals themselves.” Separately, those who have had a criminal conviction overturned are entitled to an interim compensation payment of £100,000, but Read said only 57 people had received the sum so far. He explained that this was because only 72 of the 736 people whom the Post Office acknowledges as having an unsafe conviction have had them overturned so far, despite attempts to contact them all. Read told the committee that the Post Office had not managed to contact 126 of the 736, while 214 had not responded to letters. Asked why they might not have responded, Read replied: “There will be many individuals who will want to put it behind them and won’t want to revisit it.” The postal affairs minister, Paul Scully, went further in his evidence to the committee. “There is a mistrust in this entire process, not just with the Post Office but with government, with everybody, because they’ve had 20 years of absolute hell,” he said. “So why would they trust authority in general?”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/payout-offers-compensation-post-office-horizon-it-scandal;business and economy;politics
390;390;390;390;397;397;Anthony Albanese accuses Morrison government of leaving business behind during Omicron wave;2022-01-30;['Daniel Hurst'];['Australian economy', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Australia news', 'Barnaby Joyce', 'Australian politics', 'Business', 'Coalition', 'Labor party', 'Coronavirus', 'Josh Frydenberg', 'Health', 'Aged care'];"Anthony Albanese has accused the federal government of failing to understand how badly small businesses are hurting during the Omicron wave, as the Coalition resists calls to provide extra economic support. The Labor leader said businesses were suffering from a “void of national leadership” after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, declared the government could not say yes “every time someone turns up and says I want money”. The New South Wales Coalition government announced on Sunday it would roll out a $1bn economic support package to help small- and medium-size businesses, but the payment will be capped at half of what was offered during the Delta wave.
The state treasurer, Matt Kean, said he was “very disappointed” that the federal government had declined to pour in funding. “In their absence we’re having to step up to the plate and do our bit to preserve those businesses and help our national economy,” Kean told the Nine Network on Sunday. Joyce said the federal government had “paid billions and billions and billions of dollars out” for pandemic-related programs including jobseeker, jobkeeper, stimulus to the airline industry and “it goes on and on and on”. “So I don’t think it’s penny pinching,” Joyce told Sky News on Sunday. The deputy prime minister argued the government could not “keep putting things on the credit card” and had to make “hard decisions”. But Albanese said the federal government was leaving business behind. “One of the things you notice around any shopping centre in the country is the number of empty shopfronts and business is really doing it tough,” Albanese told the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday. “You’ve had consumer confidence in decline. You’ve had people essentially imposing their own restrictions on their activity and that’s really hurting small business.”
Pressed on whether businesses should be getting more federal support now, Albanese said: “I would like to see, where the conditions are there that were the same for giving support before, why is it that this support has been completely withdrawn?” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued on Friday Australia was “transitioning to a new phase of our pandemic response” and “we’ve actually seen credit card spending in aggregate terms, 19% higher right now through January than what we saw during the Delta period”. But Albanese dismissed that argument, saying that is “because people are buying things online”. “It says it all about the treasurer and how out of touch he is, the fact that he doesn’t seem to understand how tough small business is do doing at the moment,” Albanese said. Albanese said Labor’s pledge to provide free rapid antigen tests would be subject to “limits based upon the health advice”. That could include a cap on the number of tests a person could receive each month, in order to “control supply”. “What you’ve had from this government is a ‘let it rip’ approach when it comes to the market delivering and the market hasn’t delivered.” The Labor party released a new policy on Sunday to increase Australia’s sovereign manufacturing capacity in medical essentials including testing equipment, masks, personal protective equipment and ventilators. The party is pledging to “give first priority to Australian-made medical technology for government purchases in consumables and equipment”. It also says it would instruct Labor’s promised $15bn National Reconstruction Fund “to make medical technology a top priority and work with the A Future Made in Australia Office to develop a national investment plan for healthcare essentials”. Albanese said Australia needed immediate supply “so some of that will obviously need to be overseas purchase”. “But the truth is that there’s one company in Brisbane that’s currently exporting 100,000 tests a day to the United States,” he said, referring to Ellume. “And they wanted to establish a manufacturing facility, they wanted to ramp it up here. They approached the federal government and the federal government wasn’t interested but the US government was.” When the Insiders host David Speers pointed to the fact that certain batches of Ellume’s Covid-19 home test kits had been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration in the US because of “higher-than-acceptable false positive test results”, Albanese said it was important to respect regulatory processes. “But the point here is, David, we need to manufacture rapid antigen tests here. One of the lessons of this pandemic is that we need to be more self-reliant.” The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, accused the Labor party of failing to do its “homework” before announcing “thought bubble” policies. Birmingham said the Coalition would act on advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration. “We saw today that Mr Albanese was spruiking a provider who has not yet received that TGA approval and who has faced a significant recall of products in the US,” Birmingham told reporters in Adelaide. “Now, of course, we urge that provider to continue to engage with the TGA, and if its case stacks up, it will receive approval.” The government also issued a statement claiming that Albanese’s comments about monthly limits on free free rapid tests represented a “backflip”. The health minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Angus Taylor, said Albanese’s “vague, sound-good pledge has collapsed”. Earlier, Albanese also indicated a Labor government would increase funding for aged care, without committing to specific amounts. Albanese pointed to the ongoing wage case before the Fair Work Commission, in which aged care providers and unions have quietly reached consensus on the increased complexity and value of aged care work. “The federal government should be making a submission to the commission supporting an increase in wages,” Albanese said. The Health Services Union – which is seeking a 25% wage increase for aged care – welcomed Albanese’s “hugely significant” comments. “In the short term it will lift the spirits of aged care workers,” the HSU national president, Gerard Hayes, said. “But in the longer term we need to lift wages to allow more workers to stay in the industry and stem the short staffing crisis.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/anthony-albanese-accuses-morrison-government-of-leaving-business-behind-during-omicron-wave;business and economy;politics
309;309;309;309;315;315;Failure to help struggling households will cost Tories dear | Larry Elliott;2022-01-30;['Larry Elliott'];['Energy industry', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Interest rates', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Energy bills', 'National insurance', 'Bank of England', 'Household bills', 'Money'];"Governments underestimate the power of celebrity at their peril. First it was Marcus Rashford and his campaign for hungry children. Now it is Jack Monroe pointing out how the official inflation figure bears no relation to the real cost of living increases facing the neediest households. The footballer and the chef have performed an important public service by highlighting, in a way that official statistics and thinktank reports can’t, just how tough life is on or close to the breadline. It is often said Britain is a wealthy country, which indeed it is. But if you rely on food banks it doesn’t really matter if house prices are going up and the stock market is booming. The poorest 10% of households in the UK have negative net wealth, because their debts are higher than the assets they own.
Monroe’s point about inflation is well made. The official measure of the cost of living does not reflect the lived experience of people across Britain and was never intended to. The consumer prices index doesn’t show whether those on low incomes are being affected by supermarkets cutting back on value ranges. Nor does it reflect the fact that richer households have savings to draw upon when times get tough. What’s more, as the Resolution Foundation has pointed out, soaring energy prices act as a form of deeply regressive tax, with the poorest households hit hardest. This is the background to the deepening cost of living crisis and what the government should do about it. One thing is already obvious: a toxic brew of rising housing costs, dearer energy and higher taxes means ministers have to come up with something. Doing nothing is only an option if they are prepared to risk oblivion at the next election. Certain things are set in stone. Next week, the regulator Ofgem will raise its price cap in response to the sharp rise in the global wholesale price of gas. Energy suppliers will be able to adjust their tariffs from April and the indications are the average household will be paying £600 a year more unless the government steps in to help.
Higher interest rates from the Bank of England are also inevitable and it would be a surprise if interest rates did not go up by 0.25 points to 0.5% this week. There is the likelihood of further increases as the year wears on. Despite the opposition of many Tory MPs, the planned increase in national insurance contributions – the £12bn health and social care levy – also appears to be done and dusted. Rishi Sunak could use the better than expected public borrowing figures to delay the increase by a year or abandon it altogether. Indeed, there is an argument that the Treasury would do better to allow the economy to get up a head of steam after the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic rather than putting the squeeze on too quickly. That was what George Osborne did after the financial crisis, with the result that the economy slowed and deficit-reduction targets were missed. Neither option appeals to the chancellor. Delaying the national insurance increase until 2023 would bring its introduction a year closer to the next election, and Sunak would prefer to be cutting not raising taxes by then. Scrapping the increase altogether would represent the sort of fiscal laxity the Treasury has traditionally loathed: governments spending money but reluctant to impose the tax increases needed to pay for them. Sunak is definitely not a fan of the idea that the only real constraint on government spending is inflation, and that the Bank of England can always print more money to pay the state’s bills.
Boris Johnson sometimes gives the impression he is a fan of modern monetary theory and, in any case, has a different time horizon to that of the chancellor. But this weekend’s joint article by the prime minister and the chancellor in the Sunday Times saying the national insurance increase “must go ahead” puts the issue to bed. Sunak will have his way – but at a cost.
It will not be easy for the government to dig itself out of a deep hole but the priority should be to help those on low and middle incomes cope with rising energy bills. There is money available to do this because the scarring from the pandemic has been a lot less severe than originally feared. On some estimates, Sunak has £50bn to play with, easily enough to counter the energy crisis. Labour has proposed making the warm home discount more generous and expanding the number of people eligible to receive it. This makes sense, as does the idea of cutting VAT on energy bills, a move that would help all households. Although Sunak will get his national insurance increase, it is bad economics as well as bad politics. The levy is a tax on jobs and inflationary, because businesses will either employ fewer workers or try to pass on higher costs to their customers. Income inequality is high in the UK but wealth inequality is even higher, and it gets harder to make the case that capital gains should be taxed more lightly than income when those paid modest sums are being asked to pay more national insurance or are having their personal allowance frozen. The cost of living crisis is happening and if the government is too timid in response, the economy will struggle to cope with rising energy bills, higher taxes and falling real incomes. There is a risk demand will slow from the spring onwards once the short-term boost from easing Covid-19 restrictions has played out. Concerns about higher debt interest payments that come from rising inflation may then be the least of the chancellor’s worries.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/failure-to-help-struggling-households-will-cost-tories-dear;politics;business and economy
4601;4601;4601;320;4657;4657;Raising a teenager is scary. Don’t be daunted and embrace the hard work | Andie Fox;2022-01-09;['Andie Fox'];['Parents and parenting', 'Family', 'Children'];"Raising my daughter through this teenage stage is scary and I don’t know if I will get through it These years in the thick of raising teenagers are a little like the first years of parenthood. You, once again, feel overwhelmed and incompetent. There is also the aloneness. Sometimes, when I admit to another parent that this is hard, harder than I expected, they lower their heads near mine and, with eyes widened, whisper urgently about something very worrying they are contending with as a parent. Their voices convey the relief of an honest conversation but also, the ache of big problems that cannot be immediately fixed for a child. The aloneness we felt when we were raising babies was about maintaining the facade that babies weren’t softening us too much or that the days were filled with nothing but joy. Now, the aloneness is about being discreet. Teenagers have a right to privacy and rebirth as they muddle along. While adolescent impulsiveness is entirely predictable, poor choices are still judged very harshly by the rest of the world. I do not know if the world is getting more complex to raise teenagers in or if it has long been this fraught. I don’t know, because like I said, no one talks about this part of parenting with much real honesty. I recently asked a close friend for advice. She was facing a tough time of her own as a mother, but she said, reassuringly, it is probably like that book we read over and over to our children when they were little: We’re Going on a Bear Hunt.
In the book, a young family go on an adventure to find a bear. The plot resembles the motivations you fabricate to keep the energy of small children up on long walks. We are walking, why? To find a bear, of course. When you are walking with small children even the simplest of walks present challenges. Every bit of mud or water that you manage to get through without a child falling over in it feels like an achievement. So, it always made sense to me that the book focuses more on the obstacles of the walk than the dangers of a bear. And each time the family is deterred by new terrain, the book repeats the mantra: we can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, we’ve got to go through it. When I used to read that story to my children, I assumed its appeal lay in the whimsical sense of drama and sing-song lessons in prepositions and spatial concepts. But maybe the book was written for parents? Rereading it as the mother of a 16-year-old daughter, it seems obvious that its true purpose is imprinting a script for living. And so, I now look with curiosity at the depictions of mother and daughter in the book. In one part of the story the family are making their way through an overgrown field. The mother and the little daughter, with their arms stretched towards one another, are holding hands but are swallowed chest-deep into long grass. Is the daughter showing her mother the way or is the mother helping her daughter through the grass? We cannot assume by this stage of parenting teenagers that we, as parents, always know what is best.
I am reminded of a quietly haunting poem by Lucille Clifton, My Mama moved among the days, describing the experience of being the child of a mother who is unravelling. The mother does her best – “she got us almost through the high grass” – before tragically succumbing to something terrible inside herself and running back into the grass alone. My own experience with mothering a teenage daughter is that there is a lot of push-pull. She still wants to hold my hand, but she is insistent that she knows the right way ahead through the long grass. So, when I look at that illustration in the Bear Hunt story, I see a mother trying to pull her daughter back from a dangerous course. I try to explain this fear to my daughter carefully, so as not to offend her. How it feels to not only be scared, as a parent, but also unexpectedly powerless. My daughter and I were walking our dogs off-leash, when I told her about a fear in the United States, real or imaginary, that dogs can be lured away from their owners by coyotes. Whether the dog follows a coyote for play or out of bravado, we cannot say, but the result is they underestimate the small, impish creature until finding themselves isolated and surrounded by a pack of them. Then, far from their owner’s protection, they are killed. Her mouth dropped in horror. That is how it sometimes feels to be a parent, I told her. I am trying to call you back, to warn you of the dangers in the world, but you are disappearing into the long grass.
Of course, my daughter is not like a pet. She is not mine; she is becoming her own person. And I deliberately sought not to raise my daughter to be too fearful of the world, lest she curb her participation in it as a young woman. But the youthful underestimation, my corresponding powerlessness and the collision of all this with a world not as kind as I hoped for my children are proving to be a daunting combination for me as a mother. What to do? When I am feeling engulfed, I remember the instruction of the book. The resistance and avoidance are their own pain. Reaching acceptance – that I will have to go through this and do the hard work involved – is the only way for me to get to the other side. My friend, if this is you too, I have these words for you: keep going. • Andie Fox is a freelance writer who writes about motherhood from a feminist perspective";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/10/raising-a-teenager-is-scary-dont-be-daunted-and-embrace-the-hard-work;business and economy;entertainment and culture

Our research into pregnancy in English prisons (there are no women’s prisons in Wales), published this week, has convinced me that imprisoning pregnant women is disproportionate, cruel and simply unnecessary. Most of the 22 women who responded to our survey were in prison because they had been recalled by the probation service, which means that at the end of a prison term they were placed under probation supervision for one year, but then breached their probation conditions so were sent back inside. Some of these “breaches” included a missed probation appointment, changing address and shoplifting (in this case, committed by a woman who was 30 weeks pregnant and was homeless, living in a car park – she was returned to prison for 11 weeks). Two women were in prison on remand, awaiting their trial. The most common offence was shoplifting. Four were there for drug offences. Other offences included fraud, perjury, robbery and affray. Five of the women were sent to prison at a very late stage of pregnancy: three at 36 weeks, one at 35 weeks and one at 30 weeks. Sending pregnant women to prison is unnecessary. Multiple countries, including Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia already have laws to prevent pregnant women going to prison. It is time for the UK to follow their example. English courts can and should use alternatives to imprisonment for pregnant women. If they were given community orders instead, the probation service would help them to access support, training, education and counselling at women’s centres, which offer support in a non-punitive setting. This kind of support is proven to be effective in helping women turn around lives that were previously chaotic. Non-punitive residential options, along the lines of therapeutic communities such as the Jasmine Mother’s Recovery in Plymouth and Phoenix Futures in Sheffield, should be created and sustained across England. I spent two days at Jasmine with the mothers and staff, and saw the nursery full of babies. The work they do is life-saving. It is accepting, non-judgmental and trauma-informed. This is what pregnant women in the criminal justice system need. In this all-female setting, women find protection from domestic violence, they care for themselves and for each other, for their unborn child, and for the baby once born. They receive highly skilled peer-mentoring and group counselling, which has proven to be effective in treating addiction. Out of court disposals are another alternative that police forces can use. They divert women from the criminal justice system, and, with the help of women’s centres, help them deal with difficult issues with their lives and avoid conflict with the law.
The law must change. Whenever a pregnant woman is in court, a protocol should be activated to alert the court to issues concerning the need to protect pregnant women, mothers and their children. There must be absolutely no committal to custody on remand (which means they are held until they appear in court), or sentencing of a pregnant woman without a full assessment of dependent children or pregnancies by way of a bail information report or a pre-sentence report. Level Up, Birth Companions and Women in Prison are campaigning to change sentencing laws so that no pregnant woman will be sent to prison, and have launched a petition calling for Dominic Raab, the justice minister, to change sentencing laws. The starting point must be that no pregnant woman should be in custody. If custody is decided upon, the reasons must be stated and justified in open court. The mother whose baby died in Bronzefield prison was there on remand. This vulnerable young woman – 18 years old, eight months pregnant and unwell – was remanded in custody awaiting trial, and it was her first time in prison. After her baby had died, she was granted bail. Why was remand in custody ordered in the first place? No court decision should endanger the life of an unborn baby.

2618;2618;2618;2618;2646;2646;Why are ministers obsessed with teaching children to read using phonics? | Alice Bradbury ;2022-01-19;['Alice Bradbury'];['Primary schools', 'Education', 'Schools', 'English and creative writing', 'Early years education', 'Literacy'];"Over the last decade the way in which children are taught to read in primary schools in England has fundamentally changed. The teaching of reading is now dominated by phonics, or more accurately “synthetic phonics”, where the focus is on teaching children the connection between phonemes (sounds) and letters. This teaching of the alphabetic code has always been part of learning to read, but our new research suggests it now dominates, to the exclusion of a more balanced approach involving reading whole texts and understanding the meaning of words. For example, children are given a statutory test when they are five or six called the “phonics screening check”, where they are given pseudo-words, or nonsense words, like “sut”, “blem” and “meck” to read. They do not need to know what these mean, but are judged to have “read” them correctly if they say the appropriate sounds. Yet this is decoding, not reading for understanding. Moreover, the inconsistencies in English spelling mean that children cannot only rely on phonics to read: common words like “the” and “she” have to be taught as exceptions. Our new research (written with Prof Dominic Wyse) found that the majority of teachers of children aged three to six were using a “phonics first and foremost” approach. In our survey of more than 2,000 teachers, teachers said that English as a lesson had been replaced by phonics, and that they were under pressure to “live and breathe phonics” to make sure their students did well in the phonics test.
The problem is that the evidence does not back up this push towards phonics. Our review of systematic reviews (that combine evidence from multiple studies) and of robust longitudinal experimental trials, published in 55 research papers, concluded that contextualised teaching of reading is the most effective way for children to learn. This involves combining phonics with reading whole texts, and focusing on understanding words and sentences. There is no substantial research base that supports the dominance of synthetic phonics. Internationally, England is an outlier in using this policy approach to teaching reading, and data from international assessment tests suggest that teaching reading in England may have been less successful since the adoption of the synthetic phonics approach. So how did we get to a point where thousands of children are being taught to read in a way which has no basis in proper evidence? The “reading wars” have a long history, but the shifts in England’s policy in the 2010s marked a new era of phonics dominance in England. This grew out of the recommendation in 2006 by Jim Rose that phonics be taught “discretely” as a separate skill, and the inclusion of phonics within the primary national strategy. However, a huge boost was given to phonics by the introduction of the phonics screening check in 2012, as it brought the particular skill of decoding into the system of judging and comparing schools. Dedicated phonics lessons and a focus on nonsense words have been found in classrooms ever since. The government has recently ratcheted this up further by asking inspectors to check that teachers in reception classes “teach children to read systematically by using synthetic phonics and books that match the children’s phonic knowledge”. The Department for Education has revised the list of “approved” phonics schemes, so schools have had to buy new schemes and sets of “decodable” books. The debate about the teaching of reading relates to a wider problem of education policy that proclaims to be evidence-based but instead relies on limited evidence selected on the whims of ministers. In an open letter with over 250 signatories, we are calling on the government to act on the evidence, and take on a more balanced approach. Teaching phonics has a place – because who would disagree that children need to learn about letters and sounds – – but by focusing on it to the exclusion of other skills, we are failing our children.

5559;5559;5559;1278;5626;5626;Schools in England may suspend certain subjects to cope with Covid;2022-01-04;['Sally Weale'];['Schools', 'Primary schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Health', 'England', 'Education policy', 'Department for Education'];"Schools in England could suspend the teaching of specialist subjects such as music as part of emergency timetable changes to cope with soaring Covid-related absence rates among staff, headteachers have been advised. As the new term got under way, most primary schools managed to reopen, but some heads reported difficulties as a result of sick staff and pupils having to isolate, and warned that the situation could deteriorate fast.
In secondary schools, mass Covid testing is under way as part of a staggered return for pupils over the next few days. Parents at some schools, however, have already been advised their children will move to online lessons because of a shortage of staff due to sickness. Head teachers raised concerns about the supply of lateral flow tests after an email from the Department for Education (DfE) received on Tuesday morning said orders for additional tests should be placed by 5pm the same day in order to secure deliveries next week. If placed after 5pm, they would be not delivered until the following week, starting 17 January . Secondary schools have been asked to carry out on-site tests of pupils initially, after which pupils and staff are required to test at home twice a week to try to limit the spread of the virus in schools. “Given that some schools haven’t gone back and others have only returned today it’s very short notice,” said one head teacher. “We’re OK for tests at the moment, but this is the fastest turn around yet.” The DfE said schools were asked to place orders ahead of Christmas and 31m tests were delivered to education settings in the final weeks of last term. A further 17.6m kits will be delivered by the end of next week and schools can request emergency supplies if required. Earlier this week, the department suggested that headteachers, faced with high levels of staff absence, should combine classes and teach in larger groups in order to keep children in school. It has now emerged that heads might also consider temporarily suspending the teaching of specialist subjects including music and relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) in order to free up staff for other teaching, according to a Tes report. Ian Bauckham, who chairs the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) and is also chief executive and director of the Tenax Schools Trust, outlined the proposal as part of a “case study” on a DfE portal for headteachers, seen by Tes. While high absence levels can be managed to a certain degree, Bauckham wrote, “a point is also reached where resources can be stretched too thinly and alternatives, however undesirable, become necessary”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said any such move would depend on absence rates. “It is likely that where schools are experiencing particularly severe shortages of staff they will need to take other action such as combining classes or sending home classes or year groups to learn remotely for short periods of time.” Parklands high school in Chorley, Lancashire, is one of a number of schools to move to blended learning this week because of staff off sick. A statement from the school reported in local media said: “Unfortunately, due to an increase in staff absence due to Covid, we have had to take the difficult decision to revert to blended learning, with one year group working from home each day this week.” Bauckham and the DfE have been approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/04/schools-in-england-may-suspend-certain-subjects-to-cope-with-covid;business and economy;health
597;597;597;597;605;605;Investment in adult literacy could play a major role in ‘levelling up’ | Letters;2022-01-28;['N/A'];['Literacy', 'Education', 'Children', 'Teaching', 'Secondary schools', 'Poverty', 'Schools', 'Society', 'Inequality', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"In her review of the TV programme Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51, Lucy Mangan notes that there are 8 million adults in the UK who struggle with reading. Also, as about 25% of state school pupils do not meet the expected reading standards by the age of 11, it seems that things aren’t going to improve any day soon. In 1999, Sir Claus Moser was commissioned by the government to produce a report on adult literacy and numeracy (known as the Moser report). In this he concluded that 23% of adults in this country had low literacy skills and recommended a national strategy to improve the situation. However, despite successive governments having spent billions of pounds on a variety of programmes to rectify this, in almost 25 years there has been little or no improvement. If we really do wish to “level up”, surely this is the one area where resources should be directed. One thing the investment in these various literacy projects has thrown up over the years is a huge amount of practical evidence, which can point the way to how future programmes could be successful. With 22% of the population living in poverty, it is surely the time to recognise the old adage and not just “give a man a fish” but to teach him to fish so that he may feed himself and his family for life. Improving adult literacy (and numeracy) is the starting point. Sue Hunter Brockenhurst, Hampshire • Like Lucy Mangan, I was moved by Jay Blades’ account of his struggle to read. I too weep at the numbers who fail, but I would take issue with the educational psychologist who stops short of explaining this failure by simply quoting the correlation between poverty/free school meals and illiteracy. It is not poverty or lack of parental support that causes a child in school to fail to read. In my experience as a special educational needs teacher, it was those factors which prevented many children from breaking through the far more damaging pressure of being forced to learn to read and write too young. No other language culture in Europe expects children to code and decode written language before they are six or seven years old. Our children have their confidence destroyed by being required at the age of four or five to read and write a language they have barely mastered speaking; that and the doctrinaire and narrow teaching method of synthetic phonics.

238;238;238;238;244;244;Up to 10,000 pupils in England missed whole autumn term last year, analysis finds;2022-01-30;['Richard Adams'];['Schools', 'School admissions', 'Children', 'Home schooling', 'Pupil behaviour', 'Education policy', 'England', 'UK news', 'Education'];"Up to 10,000 pupils missed an entire term of school last autumn, according to new analysis that estimates 128,000 children were withdrawn from state education in England in the year up to the January 2021 lockdown. The figures, based on data from schools collated by the education research group FFT Education Datalab, comes as the government wants new measures to boost attendance, while Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, has vowed to track down missing children. But FFT found that the number of children being taken off school rolls was no different from years prior to the pandemic, with most being home-schooled, moving to private schools or to other parts of the UK or overseas, soothing fears that the pandemic had caused a surge in children being permanently taken out of school.
FFT looked at attendance data from the rolls of more than 5,200 primary schools and 2,600 secondary schools – a third of the total state schools in England – and found that about 0.2% of children enrolled at the same school throughout last term did not attend a single session between September and the end of 2021. “These sorts of proportions would suggest something in the order of 10,000 pupils on the roll of schools who did not attend at all in the autumn term,” the analysis, by the FFT’s Dave Thompson, states. In total, 86,000 children who were on school rolls for at least a month in the autumn term were classed as “severely absent” after missing at least half of their time in school, including those absent because of illness. Those most likely to be counted as severely absent were pupils with special educational needs. Children with an educational health and care plan (EHCP) were many times more likely to have missed half of school in autumn compared with other pupils across all age groups. While politicians and de Souza have expressed alarm at the numbers of pupils withdrawn from school rolls during the pandemic, the data suggests that the overall numbers are similar to previous years. The FFT figures show that more than 128,000 children out of the nearly seven million of compulsory school age had been withdrawn from state school rolls in the year to January 2021 – slightly below the 129,000 withdrawn in the year to January 2020, before the start of the pandemic, and the same proportion as withdrew in the year to January 2019. Of the 128,000, 57,000 are estimated to now be home-educated, according to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, while a further 10,000 to 20,000 will have moved from the state sector to independent or private schools. The remaining 50,000 children may have rejoined schools in other parts of the UK, most likely Scotland or Wales, or moved overseas with their families. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said he wants to “end the postcode lottery of how attendance is managed in different schools and parts of the country”, with a new duty for schools to publish their plans to improve attendance. Schools are also being asked to join a new data collection trial that will share daily attendance status for each pupil with the Department for Education. The DfE also said it “remains committed to a registration system for children not in school” and plans to publish a formal response shortly.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/30/up-to-10000-pupils-in-england-missed-whole-autumn-term-last-year-analysis-finds;business and economy;politics
1003;1003;1003;1003;1015;1015;Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station;2022-01-27;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Nuclear power', 'UK news', 'EDF Energy', 'Suffolk', 'Business', 'Energy', 'Environment', 'Sizewell C'];Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station;business and economy;environment
5789;5789;5789;1508;5859;5859;Apocalypse nowadays: the new wave of films about the end of the world;2022-01-03;['Alex Hess'];"['Film', ""Don't Look Up"", 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Climate crisis', 'Culture', 'Environment', 'Dr Strangelove', 'Independence Day: Resurgence']";"Which films kept you entertained over the holidays? Was it Silent Night, the sweary festive Britcom starring Keira Knightley? The courtroom drama Naked Singularity, with John Boyega as a crusading lawyer? Or did you watch Leonardo DiCaprio as a dorky astronomer in Don’t Look Up, a slapstick political satire? Whichever it was, I hope you poured yourself a large one, because none of those films are quite as light as they seem. All take place in the shadow of imminent Armageddon. That’s right: the end of the world is nigh, and it’s no longer the preserve of megabudget disaster movies or bleak survivalist thrillers. These days the looming obliteration of our species can just as readily form the backdrop to some governmental mockery or a boozy country-house drama.
Why the sudden change? After all, existential catastrophe is hardly a new subject for Hollywood, which has been churning out such tales for the best part of a century. Historically, though, they have largely come in the form of razzle-dazzle showstoppers, be it during the original disaster-movie boom, with titles like When Worlds Collide, or more recent CGI-fuelled fare such as The Day After Tomorrow. The more muted end-times films have been generally been left to less popcorn-hungry countries like Russia (The Sacrifice), France (Time of the Wolf, Delicatessen) and Canada (Last Night). But the mainstream movie industry has nonetheless made sure that even the most casual filmgoer will be well used to witnessing humanity’s spectacular destruction. We’ve seen it carried out by deranged scientists and comic-book villains, by robot uprising and cosmic collision, by viral outbreak and biblical flood, by dragons, birds and talking monkeys. And unsurprisingly, a genre predicated on the ultimate worst-case scenario has tended to reflect the anxieties of the time. Invasion of the Body Snatchers offered an allegory for McCarthyism; Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, with its nightmarish urban devastation, was the first truly post-9/11 blockbuster; Wall-E sounded the alarm about mass consumerism. The genre itself initially mushroomed during the cold war, when “mutually assured destruction” became a household phrase. Now it’s exploding again. According to the Wikipedia page listing “apocalyptic films”, there were more additions to the genre in the past decade than the previous two combined. In the last year alone the destruction of our planet has been either realised or threatened in sci-fi extravaganzas, family tearjerkers and chirpy animated romps. This year will bring more of the same: slated for TV are two cheerless visions of post-viral dystopia, The Last of Us and Station Eleven, as well as the Ronseal-titled Extinction. At the cinema, we’ll get the big-screen pageantry of Moonfall from disaster impresario Roland Emmerich, and a Noah Baumbach adaptation of Don DeLillo’s eco-fiasco novel White Noise.
But before all that, treat yourself to the best film of the festive season: The Humans, an understated chamber piece in which a dysfunctional family gather for Thanksgiving under a distinct atmosphere of – you guessed it! – creeping existential dread. The real drama, though, lies in the bickering of rival siblings, senile grandparents and sozzled patriarchs. It’s more evidence that end-times anxiety can now be treated as mundane, off-screen, secondary to the domestic fallout: call it kitchen-sink nihilism.
It’s a long way from the cigar-chomping triumphalism of Armageddon and Independence Day – both certified artefacts of Clinton-era America – but maybe this trend for quietly apocalypse-adjacent storytelling is to be expected in an era when the real-world headlines tell of survival bunkers, fire tornadoes and doomsday glaciers. Dr Strangelove’s breakneck bomb-ride was the response to a world where nuclear decimation could arrive at any moment; maybe this new mode of restraint reflects a reality where the unthinkable seems to be unfolding bit by bit, a matter of glum inevitability. Adam McKay’s climate-change satire Don’t Look Up takes its lead from Kubrick’s movie, invoking the apocalypse as an act of ridicule towards a complacent political class. But six decades on, the tone has shifted from anarchic glee to resigned exasperation. “Maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun,” says Jennifer Lawrence’s scientist. “Maybe it’s supposed to be unsettling.” It’s a credo that unites this current crop of films, which all provoke angst rather than excitement, defeatism rather than hope. This is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but a shrug. Or as Arnold Schwarzenegger grumbles in End of Days, while the scenario of the title closes in: “We have some real serious problems here – and we’re not solving any of them!” And when it comes to the annihilation of humankind, there’s a man who knows what he’s talking about.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/apocalypse-nowadays-the-new-wave-of-films-about-the-end-of-the-world;environment;entertainment and culture

I’m not advocating that everyone maintains Christmas-level tippling every day and night past New Year’s Eve. But there is a reasonable line of thinking that says that this dark, cold, skint time of year may not be the best moment to deprive ourselves of one of life’s simpler pleasures. Moderation may be a more effective route to long-term healthy drinking, allowing us to lift our spirits with a glass or two of a moderately priced, delicious southern-sun filled red such as Indomita’s. Tesco Finest GSM, McLaren Vale Australia, 2017 (£9, Tesco) Chile remains one of the most reliable sources of inexpensive red wines of the softly textured kind that are the antidote to seasonal dankness – the sort that works as well on the sofa as it does at the table, such as Morrisons The Best Chilean Carmenère 2020 (£6.50), which makes it a good match for pizza. Also doing the job in the very specific category of ‘wines for TV and takeaway’ is the perfumed malbec from Argentina. Aldi Argentinian Malbec, Mendoza 2020 (£5.79) is one of the best-value versions of the style. Australia, too, has its way with the fruity, warming genre, although the best of the Down Under supermarket bunch tends to come seasoned with a lick of peppery spice, such as Tesco’s ever-excellent blend of grenache, shiraz and mataro. Domaine Gayda Chemin de Moscou, IGP Pays d’Oc France, 2019 (£25.99, Cambridge Wine Merchants) The GSM blend based on grenache and/or shiraz plus mataro and others is the base of many of Australia’s finest reds. But its origins are in southern France, producing wines that can feel like a transfusion of mood-boosting sunlight at this time of year. You can get some of that Mediterranean hillside feel in bottles from the Languedoc, such as Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Saint-Chinian (£9), or from the Rhône Valley, such as Marks & Spencer’s superb Les Closiers Lirac 2019 (£10). That’s true, too, of the latest vintage of one of my favourite wines from one of my favourite Languedoc producers. The darkly concentrated, blackberry, black olive, pepper and rosemary of Domaine Gayda’s Chemin de Mouscou, served with roast lamb, is my prescription for seeing off the winter blues.

1618;1618;1618;1618;1637;1637;Spice up your life! 22 sensational seasonings that aren’t salt or pepper;2022-01-24;['Tony Naylor'];['Food', 'Restaurants', 'Restaurants'];"Historically, Britain has been timid about table condiments. Salt and pepper are the standard duo in the UK, while an exhilarating array of flavourings is deployed globally to tweak cooked foods: traditional spices, evolving spice mixes, clever powders created by imaginative chefs. In deep midwinter, what could be better than sprinkling a dash of vibrant colour across your meals? Here are 22 ways to spice up your food in 2022. Dehydrated chicken skin “It will transform chips, fish, boring salads, anything,” enthuses Sam Grainger, the chef-owner at Belzan in Liverpool. On a greaseproof tray, flatten chicken skin, salt it and scatter with garlic and thyme. Place baking paper on top and a tray to weigh it down. Oven roast at 170C (150C fan)/335F/gas 3½ for 40 minutes, until the skin is crisp. Remove the top tray and paper, and continue to dry the skin in the oven at about 75C fan for a further eight hours. Let it cool on kitchen towels to absorb any oil. Pat dry. Using a blender, blitz the skin and a little coarse salt to a fine powder. Portion out your batch of powder – you could use an ice-cube tray or clingfilm “twists” – and freeze in an airtight container. Sumac “On Iranian tables, you’ll find salt, pepper and a shaker of lemony sumac to add floral acidity to dishes,” says Marwa Alkhalaf, the chef at Nutshell in London. Alkhalaf namechecks the sumac – a powder ground from the dried fruit of the sumac shrub – from Anjoman and Persia Food. “I like its sweet-sour flavour on ice-cream and fruit.” Furikake
“It’s very popular in Japan,” says Masaki Sugisaki, the chef-owner at Dinings SW3 in London. Furikake is normally used to transform steamed rice, but this crunchy, umami blend of sesame seeds and seaweed, seasoned with slow-roasted fish or egg, is a potential pick-me-up for drab salads or tuna-topped baked potatoes, too. Sugisaki rates the Noritama brand. Dukkah This Egyptian creation pivots around nutty flavours (sesame, almond, hazelnut, pumpkin, chickpea), toasted with herbs and spices (mint, cumin, coriander), which are pounded into a powder or a crunchier, chunky consistency. “Every family has their ratios and spice preferences,” says Mitshel Ibrahim, the chef-owner at Ombra in London. Dukkah was traditionally used as hummus dressing or to top dipping oils for breads and meze vegetables. But its “fragrant, gentle spice” is a versatile addition to breakfast eggs, soups, couscous and fried fish. Ibrahim recommends the stockist Persepolis, “a little shop of Middle Eastern wonders” in Peckham, south-east London, that ships nationwide. The tagline for its dukkah is: “So good you’ll want it on everything.” Gremolata This chiffonade of finely chopped garlic, lemon zest and flat-leaf parsley brings a fresh, savoury sheen to a number of dishes, says Esther Miglio, a co-owner of OWT in Leeds: “It works brilliantly on stews, fried chicken, roast vegetables, through salads.” Adjust ratios to taste, but two-thirds garlic cloves to one-third fresh parsley and the zest of one lemon will make gremolata for four to six people. Refrigerate for up to three days. Achar masala
Primarily a pickling mix, this crunchy combo of salt, chilli, asafoetida, mustard and fenugreek seeds, bound with a little oil, doubles as a dry Gujarati condiment. “It’s used on rice and dal,” says Mayur Patel, a co-owner of the Bundobust restaurants in northern England. “When I was a kid, my mum would smash up Seabrook’s ready salted crisps – their crinkles hold the masala better – and sprinkle achar and lemon juice into the packet. We’d have that on white-bread sandwiches.” In south India, “gunpowder”, or milagai podi, is considered similarly useful. A seasoned mix of roasted, ground coconut and lentils, it is best known for flavouring potatoes, but Avinash Shashidhara, the head chef at Pahli Hill in London says: “We use it on everything, even on ghee-buttered toast.” Powdered seaweed A fantastic salt alternative, saysGrainger: “It gives another layer, umami and flavour impact, without tasting like pure salt.” In a blender, with a little salt to help the grind, blitz sheets of seaweed (“nori or dulse work best”) into fine dust. “It’s great on fish or vegetable dishes.” Dunn’s River all-purpose seasoning From the US seafood seasoning Old Bay (a favourite of Ravinder Bhogal, the chef-owner at Jikoni in London) to lapsang souchong salt, there are numerous ways to titivate chips. A moreish mix of paprika, mustard and onion powder (among other spices), Dunn’s River’s all-purpose seasoning is recommended by Michelle Miah, a co-owner of the London restaurant Rudie’s Jerk Shack: “Some seasonings can be salty or overly flavoursome. Dunn’s has balance.” Phrik pon Roast, ground chillies complete khruang phrung, a quartet of Thai table condiments (including sugar, fish sauce and vinegar-pickled chillies) that enable endless customisation. Andrew Chongsathien, the owner of Brother Thai in Cardiff, uses phrik pon’s “exciting” smoky spice instead of orthodox chilli flakes. In a wok, roast long red dried chillies (shorter ones will be hotter) on a medium-high heat for three minutes, ensuring they do not blacken (open a window first). “When you start coughing, they’re done,” says Chongsathien. “When cool, grind the chillies in a pestle and mortar. I prefer coarse flakes.” In an airtight container, “they keep for ever”. Shichimi tōgarashi With its chilli heat, citrus peel, sansho pepper and roasted sesame savouriness, this aromatic, seven-ingredient topping is essential in Japan. “In good versions, you taste all the flavours in one,” says Kaori Simpson, the chef-owner at Harajuku Kitchen in Edinburgh. Use tōgarashi on noodles, soups, tempura and fried chicken, but not ramen: “It’s a no-no on Japanese versions of Chinese foods; instead, you have white pepper and chilli oil.” Espelette
“Black pepper is too aggressive,” says Josh Overington, the chef at Le Cochon Aveugle in York. He uses the “bittersweet, elegant heat” of this Basque chilli pepper. Traditionally used to cure jamón, espelette is great on eggs, asparagus, grilled chicken and bland foods, where its subtlety can shine. Gochugaru This sun-dried, ground Korean chilli, which gives kimchi its red colour, comes in a variety of consistencies and heats, but its “bright, fruity, slightly smoky flavour” makes it a versatile ingredient and table condiment, says Judy Joo, the chef-owner of the Seoul Bird restaurants in London. “I sprinkle it on everything from pizza to veggies,” says Joo. “Store it in your freezer to keep it zesty.” Cumin Used to season everything from boiled eggs to roast lamb, ground cumin and salt are the staple Moroccan table condiments, says Nargisse Benkabbou, a chef and the author of the cookbook Casablanca. Cayenne pepper is also offered – “to add heat without too much flavour”. Paprika “Agridulce [a Spanish sweet-and-hot paprika mix] is used on every fried egg of ours,” says Ben Wright, the owner of Porta in Chester. It also gives a smoky kick to fried potatoes or octopus. Paprika is big in Romanian cooking, too. Irina Georgescu, the author of the cookbook Carpathia, uses the smoked version alongside salt and pepper: “Sprinkle on potato salads, omelettes, fried fish and roast vegetables, especially carrots or parsnips, where spice – not salt – complements their flavour.” Chinese five-spice salt
“I’m a big fan of Cantonese-Vietnamese ‘spicy salt’ – classic five-spice with salt – used as a dip for fried and grilled poultry,” says Lap-Fai Lee, a Birmingham-based restaurant consultant and food tutor. “A good cook will make this fresh, doing enough for that meal.” In a hot pan, toast salt for 30 seconds with whole Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon or cassia, star anise, cloves and fennel seeds. The ratio is 2:1 salt to five-spice (the spices combined in equal amounts). For extra oomph, add MSG powder in equal quantity to one of the spices. “It’s not the same without it,” says Lee. Grind the mix into a fine salt and dip your meat delicately as you eat. Sal de gusano A Mexican salt made by roasting so-called “worms” (caterpillar larvae) found on the agave plant, then mixing them with salt and sometimes chillies. “I add it where I want smoky depth,” says Shaun Hurrell, the chef-owner at Barrio Comida in Durham. That might be sweetcorn, a steak or popcorn. Sal de gusano is available from Cool Chile Co. Burnt onion powder “A versatile workhorse,” says Alex Rushmer, the chef at Vanderlyle, a plant-focused restaurant in Cambridge. Peel red or white onions, separate the “petals” on a roasting tray and bake them in a process of “dehydration, caramelisation and controlled burning” at 160-190C (140C-170C fan)/325-375F/gas 3-5 for approximately one hour, until dried and dark brown. Keep an eye on their progress: “They should turn to powder when you squeeze them in your hand.” Blitz to a fine powder in a blender, store in a dark, airtight container for two weeks, then “sprinkle on anything you want to taste oniony. It’s an awesome seasoning for roasted nuts and would be great over white pizza, or sprinkled on a cheese crouton on french onion soup.” Za’atar This fusion of sumac, dried thyme, toasted sesame and salt (“characteristically bright and fresh, earthy and zesty,” says Calvin von Niebel, the executive chef at the Ottolenghi restaurants in London) is terrific when used to finish seafood, dusted over labneh or on pitta pieces or chips. Tajín
This zingy combo of chillies, salt and dehydrated lime (it is hard to find here but available online) is ubiquitous in Mexico. “It’s found in fine restaurants, at home on popcorn, on street stalls mixed with fruit or veggies. I love it on a grated carrot, beetroot and jicama yam slaw,” says Adriana Cavita, who will launch her eponymous London restaurant in spring.
Yaji Commonly retailed as “suya spice”, after the west African grilled meat skewers it regularly dresses, yaji comes in several varieties. It has core ingredients – chilli and onion powders, ginger, paprika and cloves – but there have been additions as its fame has spread from northern Nigeria. Garlic, explains Adejoké Bakare, the chef-owner at Chishuru in London, “was not common in the old days”. There is a specific yaji for cooking sauces (this includes dawadawa, fermented locust bean), while peanut-boosted yaji-kuli is used on those suya kebabs, hot off the grill. “It adds texture to the meat,” says Bakare, who grew up using basic yaji to season salads or, in combination with mai shanu butter, rice pancakes and couscous. Nut parmesan “A super-savoury seasoning with a cheesy nutritional-yeast flavour, and I add chilli for a kick,” says Bettina Campolucci Bordi, the author of the vegan cookbook Happy Food. To make a 75g sample, blitz 30g each of hazelnuts and almond flour with half a teaspoon each of salt and nutritional yeast, adding chilli flakes to taste. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to two weeks. “I keep it handy to season soups, pastas and roast veg, or as a toast-topping.” Chaat masala This tangy, spice mix (key ingredients: dried mango and black salt) is, of course, used in the potato, chickpea and gram-salad-cum-snack chaat, but it also seasons “everything fried”, says Gouranga Bera, the chef at Curry Leaf Café in Brighton. “Add chaat to pakoras and bhajis when they’re crisp, so the spices stick. Its sweet, sour, spicy taste is also delicious on grilled meats with lime or lemon juice.” Chaat masala’s addition of a “savoury note” to fruit salads has been a “revelation” for Curry Leaf’s co-owner Euan Sey, who suggests trying MDH’s chunky chaat masala as a premixed version: “I’m something of a fruit dodger, but I love fruit chaat.”";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/24/spice-seasonings-salt-pepper-britain-chefs-zaatar-yaji;business and economy;entertainment and culture
663;663;663;663;671;671;What wines to drink with Chinese food | Fiona Beckett on drinks;2022-01-28;['Fiona Beckett'];['Wine', 'Food', 'Chinese food and drink', 'French food and drink', 'British food and drink', 'Lunar new year', 'Life and style'];"With lunar New Year being celebrated next week, there’s a chance you might be having a Chinese meal over the next few days, but I wonder what you’re planning to drink with it. Wine-wise, at least, the same suspects – usually off-dry whites such as riesling and gewürztraminer – tend to get trotted out all the time, so I was particularly interested that this week’s guest contributor Amy Poon and her husband, Michael, who happens to work in the wine business, suggested some different options to go with her recipes. With the wok-roasted char siu, they went for a Saint-Estèphe, suggesting Château Capbern (Laithwaites, 15%), Château Meyney (Majestic, 13.5%) “to balance the rich, smoky flavours of the pork” (though, at £28 and £35.99, respectively, neither is what you’d call cheap), or a traditional Loire red such as a chinon or bourgeuil. And for her father’s classic zha jiang noodles, they recommend a rosé champagne or an English sparkling wine such as the Woodchester Valley in today’s pick. It depends, of course, on the type of Chinese food you’re eating. Supermarkets are still relatively conservative with their ready meals, so if you’re having sweet-and-sour chicken or chow mein, riesling might well be the answer, after all. But there are many dishes with which you could drink a red – the Chinese themselves are particularly keen on bordeaux, and in recent years have invested heavily in the region. Given that a range of dishes may be on the table at the same time, I find it most helpful to look at the overall style of the food, rather than individual dishes. If you’re having dim sum or delicate seafood dishes, for example, crisp, dry whites such as pouilly-fumé or sparkling wines tend to work best. Fizz is also good with anything deep-fried such as spring rolls and prawn toast. With more savoury, umami-rich dishes such as duck or braised meats, on the other hand, I’d definitely be inclined to drink a red. As well as bordeaux, I like a good pinot noir, although with the likes of beef in black bean sauce, I’d go for a bolder red such as a grenache. Meanwhile, with spicy dishes – mapo tofu or a chilli-spiked hotpot, say – I’d be more likely to drink the very forgiving grüner veltliner below , or a lager. And if you’re on the last couple of days of dry January, the 0.5% Lucky Saint would hit the spot. Another good alcohol-free option is sparkling tea, which I’ve mentioned before. I’ve just come across a delicious limited-edition one from Saicho called Eight Treasures. At £32.99 a bottle, it’s definitely not cheap, but it is made from a rare oolong and is beautifully packaged, so it’s ideal for a New Year gift.
Three wines to see in the new year
Woodchester Valley Brut Rosé 2018 £28.95 Woodchester Valley, 12.5%. Deliciously fruity, with a heady aroma of freshly picked strawberries and raspberries (so a good choice for Valentine’s Day, too).
Château Jouanin Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux 2019 £9 larger Co-ops, 13.5%. An appealingly soft, fruity bordeaux that would work really well with crispy duck pancakes.
Rainer Wess Grüner Veltliner Kremstal 2020 £9.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%. Austria’s grüner veltliner is a really versatile white that could take you through a whole range of dishes.

5021;5021;5021;740;5079;5079;‘They want to remove us and take the rock’, say Zimbabweans living near Chinese-owned mines;2022-01-07;['Nyasha Chingono'];"['Global development', 'Zimbabwe', 'Mining', 'Inequality', 'Human rights', 'China', 'Africa', 'World news', ""Workers' rights"", 'Mining', 'Environment', 'Asia Pacific']";"A convoy of trucks laden with huge black granite rocks trundles along the dusty pathway as a group of villagers look on grimly. Every day more than 60 trucks take granite for export along this rugged road through Nyamakope village in the district of Mutoko, 90 miles east of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. The air reverberates with blasts and heavy machinery noises as the mountain above the village is slowly reduced, slab by slab. Quarrying has been happening here since the 1980s. Mutoko stone is sought after for its lustre. It is a popular material for tombstones. An extension to the Danish royal library in Copenhagen, known as the Black Diamond, is clad in Mutoko granite.
The Buja people who live here say that as mining companies extract wealth from the mountain, they leave behind a trail of damaged roads and bridges, hazardous pollutants and dirty air. Cracks can be seen on houses and blast debris is everywhere.
Now 50 families in the village have been told by a Chinese mining company that they will have to leave their homes and land. People in four other villages in the district fear they will also lose their ancestral lands. Two families, including an 82-year-old villager and his wife, have already been relocated by Jinding mining company, which wants to build a polishing plant. “The 82-year-old man collapsed when he heard the news because he never anticipated it. He was later resuscitated at the hospital. This is how bad things are here,” says Claudine Mupereri*, 38. She says the man was told his house was within the area licensed to the mining company by the government. Zimbabwe’s Communal Areas Act gives the president power to decide the use of an area that makes up 40% of the country’s land, home to about 70% of the population. “These companies do not respect communities. If the government does not protect us, then where will we get the protection we need?” says Mupereri. Two other families were given $2,500 (£1,840) to rebuild their homes, but community leaders say this is insufficient. “There is uncertainty around this village. Right now, we do not have anyone willing to help us because our councillor does not want to help us. Anyone who dares to speak out is threatened. Whether they remove us or not, we are already scared to speak out,” says Anesu Nyamuzuwe*. The 40-year-old father of four fears losing five hectares (12 acres) of land, his only source of income. “I have a good farm with fertile soil. My farming always meets my household requirements. I had built a good home and I am close to Mutoko centre, so I am not sure if I will ever get such a piece of land again,” he says. “What is more important, investors or the villagers? We should have the right to reject these people from entering our community.”
Jinding mining company in China could not be reached for comment. A manager and interpreter at the company’s plant in Mutoko says families who live within the 500 hectares the company is licensed to mine will be relocated, but adds: “the people who are giving out the claims [to mining companies] have a problem. Why are they giving them [companies] so much land? This land is almost 500 hectares, I am sure they already know that people live in this place.” Zimbabwe has enjoyed a close relationship with China for decades. But the bond between the two countries solidified when western states imposed economic sanctions on Robert Mugabe’s government. As credit and investments dried up, China stepped in. In 2018, Zimbabwe-Chinese relations were elevated from “all-weather friends” to strategic partners, paving the way for Chinese investors to pour money into the country, particularly in the extractive industries, where they have been accused of paying little attention to environmental damage by environmental and human rights activists. Those living near granite mines say companies are failing to restore the land after extraction. Open pits are left uncovered, endangering children and wildlife. Zimbabwe’s government has been accused of turning a blind eye to complaints because, critics say, it doesn’t want to anger its biggest investor. Mineworkers speak of poor working conditions. At another mine in Mutoko, workers give accounts of beatings and poor pay. “Imagine going to work every day for over 12 hours and getting $50 at the end of it all. When I get home I am tired. My home knows no peace,” one worker tells the Guardian. “My friend was beaten with a steel rod and another 17-year-old boy had his arm broken after coming to work late. He was given $250 as compensation after villagers complained.”
In 2020, two workers were shot and wounded in Gweru, central Zimbabwe, allegedly by a Chinese miner after a quarrel over salaries. Evelyn Kutyauripo, a paralegal with the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela), who has been rallying villagers in Mutoko to resist evictions, says local officials need to protect people. “I blame the headmen and the councillors because they are working with the Chinese. They should stand with the community,” she says, adding that companies were taking from communities and not helping them develop. “They are not developing anything in the community. They should have a strong corporate social responsibility because they are killing our environment. We are suffering, our houses are cracking and there is pollution. The government should come to see what is happening.” Another Chinese mining company, Shanghau Haoying Mining Investments, is also causing unease among Nyamaropa villagers. Last year, the company was reportedly given a government licence to mine granite on tracts of land belonging to local people. “I hear they want to remove us so that they take the rock, which is underneath, but the people do not want to. They will have to use guns to remove us here,” says Gladman Murape*, 34. Shanghau could not be reached for comment. Richard Ncube, a legal officer at Zela, says people in Mutoko were “extremely worried” about evictions. “The major challenge is they are living in the dark, and they are not sure what is going to happen.” He said people were too scared to challenge the company. “We have gathered that most of the communities [in Mutoko] are afraid to come forward and take these matters to court due to intimidation and fear of being victimised,” says Ncube. Attempts to challenge the mining companies elsewhere in Zimbabwe have had mixed results.
In November, Heijin mining company lost its mining licence in Murehwa, a district about 55 miles from Harare, after local leaders complained to the government that the company planned to evict locals. In 2020, Zela was involved in the successful fight to overturn licences to mine coal in Hwange national park, the country’s largest national park, home to 40,000 elephants. Following protests, the government banned mining in all its national parks. However, in September, hundreds of people in Chikomba district, 80 miles south of the capital, were evicted from their ancestral homes to make way for a $1bn iron and steel mining project. The Zimbabwe government says it has not received any reports of abuse of workers in Chinese-owned mines, but it did encourage workers to report any incidents.
Deputy mines minister, Polite Kambamura, urged villagers to approach the ministry if they had problems. “We haven’t heard of any Chinese company which has relocated people in Mutoko. If villagers are not happy, they may approach our provincial mining office in Marondera or come directly to the ministry,” he says. “We understand that if ever there is a company that wants to relocate the people, they should engage the community, to buy that social licence from the community.” Kambamura adds that an environmental impact assessment – to ensure the environmental, social, economic and cultural issues related to any mining project are considered before it begins – must also be conducted by the company and should address any concerns. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Mutoko leaders were also approached for comment. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/07/zimbabwe-china-mines-pollution-evictions;environment;politics
4449;4449;4449;168;4500;4500;As violence in the Congo escalates, thousands of displaced people are in effect held hostage | Vava Tampa;2022-01-10;['Vava Tampa'];['Global development', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Internally displaced people', 'Africa', 'Violence against women and girls', 'United Nations', 'War crimes', 'Conflict and arms'];"In a bare and violent patch of land in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 75,000 people are living in what one UN field officer described as “hellish conditions”. Food and water are scarce. Even the flimsiest shelters are in short supply and sanitation is nonexistent. Girls have been raped by militiamen while attempting to find food in fields around the site. Ibrahim Cisse of Unicef says people here are in effect being held hostage. Rhoe – a remote camp of internally displaced people (IDP) approximately 45km northeast of Bunia, the capital of DRC’s Ituri province – is “a tragedy waiting to happen”, according to those who have visited. Ituri province is home to what is possibly Africa’s largest unexplored gold reserve, and in diplomatic circles has been called “the bloodiest corner of DRC”. But even by Ituri standards Rhoe camp is grim, and the significance of the UN’s appeal for urgent support here should not be underestimated. For many in Rhoe it will be not the first or even second time they have become refugees in their own land. The three DRC warlords convicted at the international criminal court (ICC) for their part in the ongoing violence – Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, the subjects, respectively, of the ICC’s first ever conviction, in March 2012, first case in which crimes of sexual violence including rape and sexual slavery were charged (although he was acquitted) and the longest sentence ever issued – began their killing careers here. In 2003, the EU deployed its first autonomous military intervention in Ituri. It was an attempt to shield a population not being protected by government or international peacekeepers. Now Ituri is burning again. A militia group known as the Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or Codeco, which distinguishes itself by its copious use of machetes and flamethrowers against civilians, is terrorising the population. According to UN briefings seen by the Guardian, the situation started to deteriorate on 12 November when Codeco began ramping up attacks on villages and within camps, placing pressure on already struggling relief operations. In one attack, in Tsuya, 1,296 houses were destroyed by Codeco militia. No one knows how many died. At around the same time, Codeco men armed with ageing AK-47s attacked the villages of Buki, Ngazba, Kpaluba, Tata and Litsinga; opening fire at random and torching houses. In Reta, in the furrows of Djugu territory, not far from the Drodro camp, a two-month-old baby girl was killed during a Codeco attack. Unicef says militiamen also destroyed three hospitals and two schools in the area, and have made any kind of humanitarian assistance impossible. Those who survived the assaults fled to camps at Tché and Drodro. On 21 November, Tché was attacked; 950 shelters were destroyed. Codeco also attacked Drodro, killing at least 35 and destroying 14 of the 18 housing blocks that sheltered IDPs. Over the last eight weeks militiamen have attacked at least four IDP camps in Ituri. These accounts shed light not only on the violence unfolding in Ituri but also reveal that at least 35,000 children, almost half of Rhoe’s population, are at risk of death through starvation or disease. What will happen to people without any food, including the 19 breastfeeding women who gave birth in the camp in December? Built to shelter 6,000 households, Rhoe was already a humanitarian tinderbox, hopelessly over capacity. Aid agencies can reach the camp only by helicopter. In December, Unicef counted over 14,000 households in the camp, making up a total of 75,000 people; there is one toilet for every 1,300 people and sewage flows openly.
Three cases of measles have been identified. People are dying of respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and malaria. There is no equipment to hold funerals. There is also only one clinic, run by Doctors Without Borders, with an adjacent twometre sq delivery room for women in labour. These conditions are alongside impunity-fuelled violence, starvation and displacement that has festered since 1996, leaving the government unable to keep its citizens safe, secure or fed. More than 27 million are facing starvation. Approximately 5.5 million people, including 3.2 million children and 1.2 million women, have now been displaced from their homes because of violence. In May 2021 DRC’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, declared a state of emergency in Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu. Yet Tshisekedi has appointed Floribert Ndjabu as his evoy for the region, a man who served 15 years in preventive detention on suspicion of the murders of nine UN peacekeepers in 2005. Last August, he employed another former rebel leader, Tommy Tambwe, three months before Tambwe’s militia gang M23 allegedly attacked Bukavu. Tshisekedi has promoted many figures the UN has labeled “red generals,” some of whom are under UN and EU sanctions for human rights violations, including Gen Gabriel Amisi, Gen Muhindo Akili Mundos, Fall Sikabwe Asinda, Thierry Ilunga Kibambi and Egide Ngoy. How can you protect civilians from violence if the very men who caused it are in power? Unicef says it needs $356m (£260m) to hold back hunger and disease in Ituri, including Ebola, measles, meningitis and cholera. But there has been no indication from London, Washington or Brussels that any programme will be funded. Everyone of course understands that money will only address the symptoms and not the fundamental problem. It is largely a question of political will: whether or not to send-in UN lawyers – not troops – to end the impunity still fuelling the ongoing violence, starvation and displacement.";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/10/as-violence-drc-democratic-republic-congo-escalates-thousands-are-effectively-being-held-hostage;environment;politics
2702;2702;2702;2702;2730;2730;Italian police arrest alleged Black Axe Nigerian mafia members over trafficking;2022-01-19;['Lorenzo Tondo'];['Global development', 'Sex trafficking', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Nigeria', 'Africa', 'Human trafficking', 'Law', 'Society'];"Four alleged members of the Nigerian mafia have been arrested in southern Italy after a young sex trafficking survivor spoke out against them. The men, who were arrested in Palermo and Taranto in the early hours of Tuesday, allegedly belong to the feared Black Axe, a cult-like criminal gang that emerged in the 1970s at the University of Benin, according to police. Investigators in Palermo who led the operation said the woman, who is also Nigerian, was forced into prostitution after taking part in an occult ritual bound up with traditional spiritual beliefs, known as juju, which bond victims to their traffickers and to any debts they will incur. “The suspects were charged with slavery, human trafficking, kidnapping and pandering [recruiting prostitutes],” the police said. The woman, whom investigators said was convinced by a Pentecostal cleric to report her captors to police, had been imprisoned, raped, blackmailed and forced into prostitution to pay a debt of about €15,000 (£12,500). Before she left Nigeria, like many other victims of sex trafficking, the woman had been made to undergo a traditional oath-taking ceremony involving complicated and frightening rituals often using the women’s blood, hair and clothing. Those carrying out the ritual, which has been found to have a profound psychological impact on victims, make it clear that failure to pay off those debts will result in terrible things happening to the woman and her family.
The abuse of religious and cultural belief systems in Nigeria has proved a deadly and highly effective control mechanism for traffickers recruiting women destined for the sex trade in Europe. A hugely profitable and well-organised criminal industry has been operating between Italy and Nigeria for more than two decades but the UN’s International Organization for Migration says it has seen a rise in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving in Italy by sea in the past few years, lured by the promise of work in the country. According to a Save the Children report last year Italy had 2,040 victims of sex trafficking – 716 of whom were registered in 2020 – with the majority of them Nigerian. Father Enzo Volpe, a priest in Palermo who has been helping Nigerian women for nine years, told the Guardian: “These women are terrified of the threats and the violence perpetrated by their captors. They fear not only for their lives but also for those of their families back in Nigeria.” “The problem,” said Volpe, “is that behind the slavery of these women there is a real mafia with members operating across the continent, who have total control over their victims.” Last year, Italian police arrested 30 people suspected of belonging to the Nigerian Black Axe mafia, which has been operating in many regions of the country, among them its suspected 35-year-old leader in Italy. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Just look at Barbados;2022-01-21;['N/A'];"[""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Global development', 'Barbados', 'Trinidad and Tobago', 'Climate crisis', 'World news', 'Environment', 'Americas', 'India', 'Liberia', 'Ellen Johnson Sirleaf', 'Caribbean', 'Africa', 'South and central Asia', 'Mia Mottley']";"There is a common misconception that the developing world is full of archaic values and that women struggle to have their voices heard. The more countries I visit and the more female leaders I speak to, the more I am convinced the contrary is true. In fact, those in positions of power worldwide could learn important lessons from these strong women when it comes to tackling some of society’s most pressing issues, including pandemics, the climate crisis, education and infrastructure.
Of course, successful female leadership in the developing world isn’t new. During her time as prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi was famously strong. In Africa, I met the highly respected former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was recognised among Time Magazine’s Top 100 Women of the Year in 2020 for her role in picking up the pieces of a damaged nation when she was elected in 2006. I am writing from South America and the Caribbean, having interviewed many female leaders, most recently from Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. The level of respect for female political and business leaders here is partly because they have had to dig deeper to prove themselves, which I believe is one key to their success – particularly during turbulent times. Since taking up office, Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley has changed the face of democracy in the country. She has been transparent, stands up publicly against injustices, and has created authentic ties between Caribbean countries. It is difficult to overstate what her commitment to collaboration across the region and internationally has done for Barbados, securing investment and developing infrastructure to enable a stable and sustainable economy during the Covid crisis. Countries like Barbados are often not the protagonist, yet Mottley put issues such as the climate crisis and international development to the front on the world stage. Such is the level of support for Mottley within the region that it is not uncommon for the president of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, to wake up at 5am to cook his famous fish curries and have them delivered by the next flight, as a gesture of care and support for her. I have also been struck by the role a “first lady” can play in sharing leadership. In Suriname, Mellisa Santokhi-Seenacherry has helped ensure that, through government policy, no one is left behind. A successful lawyer, she has promoted female leadership, empowerment and mental health with rigour. Guyana’s first lady, Arya Ali, has brought family back into the state house and work. She is committed to inclusivity, setting up countrywide schemes that support women and girls, those with disabilities and children, and is not afraid to look at the challenging issues of domestic violence and rape. This takes courage and heart – and she has these in abundance.
In other spheres, Guyana’s Annette Arjoon has been widely recognised for her environmental and community work. Arjoon is responsible for establishing one of the country’s first, and most successful, conservation NGOs, the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society – leading the way in preserving the natural environment for future generations. Trinidad and Tobago has this form of leadership in the private sector – the representation of female CEOs is greater here and in Jamaica than in the US. Trinidad and Tobago Business Hall of Fame award winner Angela Lee Loy continued to invest in training her employees during Covid and supporting them through the challenges of home working, giving parents the flexibility to work around home schooling, for example. “I firmly believe that if their home life needs support, then that should be our domain and area of concern, too,” she says. This approach certainly paid off. Her staff have remained engaged and loyal. It is not easy, and there has never been a linear upward path for female leaders. However, the women highlighted here are courageously carving a path and are a brilliant example to the world. The unprecedented disruption of the past two years has thrown a spotlight on leadership. These women are finding solutions to pressing global challenges with purpose, passion and people at the fore, and are improving the lives of their communities through harnessing the very qualities that make female leaders so successful.

1851;1851;1851;1851;1872;1872;Death threats and phone calls: the women answering cries for help one year on from Poland’s abortion ban;2022-01-23;['Weronika Strzyżyńska', 'Rosie Swash'];"['Poland', 'Abortion', 'Global development', ""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Health', 'Europe', 'Society', 'Women', 'World news']";"One year ago, on the night Poland introduced one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, the phone started ringing at the country’s most high-profile family planning organisation. Over the course of the evening, volunteers took calls from more than 20 panicked women who suddenly found their next-day appointments for abortions cancelled. One of the calls was from hospital staff at a loss over what to do about a woman who broke down after being told that her termination would not go ahead. “She went into a frenzy, got into the hospital lift and was going up and down, up and down, without stopping for an hour,” says Krystyna Kacpura, director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa). Staff at Federa were used to helping women navigate a hostile healthcare system in which legal terminations were already virtually impossible. But the new legislation put in place an almost total abortion ban in everything but name, allowing women to terminate only if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest, or if it represented a threat to life or health. At the time the legislation was brought in, about 1,000 legal abortions were carried out in Poland every year, 98% because of foetal abnormalities. This option was now closed to women. It was, says Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer for Federa, a devastating blow. Since its announcement, at least 34,000 women in Poland have managed to get abortions despite the ban, and hundreds travelled abroad for later abortions, facilitated by groups such as Abortion Support Network and Women on Web.
But now the women calling Federa for help are often in serious distress, many further into their pregnancy because they have discovered a problem at a second-trimester scan. Pregnancies are more likely to have been planned. “In the past, it was rare for us to receive calls from individuals in this state. This last year, it has been 80% of our work,” says Ferenc in Federa’s Warsaw office. “Every call is very emotional.” In the past year staff and volunteers at Federa, like many other women working as advisers, lawyers and activists in the pro-choice movement, have faced death threats, intimidation and legal challenges. Many have said they are exhausted by their increasing workload as they struggle to help women trying to access safe abortions. Ferenc says she is not afraid of the people who send bomb threats to her office or superimpose bullet holes on pictures of her face. “I’m more scared that one day prosecutors will launch an investigation against us,” she says. In the past, few Poles faced trial on abortion-related charges. The state largely turned a blind eye to illegal abortion services, with pages towards the back of newspapers filled with euphemistic adverts for private clinics offering “restoration of the menstrual cycle”. That changed when the new law came in.
A member of pro-choice group Abortion Dream Team became the first Polish abortion activist to face the prospect of trial in September, after a man notified the police that his wife ordered abortion pills online. The case is ongoing. Ferenc believes the latest changes did not fully appease the ruling Law and Justice party’s (PiS) religious base. “Before, abortion was not a topic, no one wanted to talk about it. Now the anti-abortion groups on whose support PiS is relying are demanding blood.” Marta Lempart – who is fighting 86 court cases under various charges – heads the pro-choice Polish Women’s Strike movement and says the new laws have targeted the women most at need of healthcare and support.
“Polish women with unwanted pregnancies are now in a better situation than those with wanted pregnancies but who are facing complications, because there is a working system completely outside of public healthcare for the former. But the healthcare system does not provide a service to the latter at all.” A further attempt to ban abortion completely and jail women who had terminations for life was rejected by the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament, but the government has since announced it would begin compiling a database of all pregnancies across the country, a move defended as a digitisation of existing documentation but which women’s rights groups believe is another natalist policy designed to control women’s lives and a sign that worse is to come.
Meanwhile, an underfunded and overstretched Polish healthcare system, accused of failing to provide women with reproductive care, is emboldened by the new laws. “Women are falsely told by doctors that contraceptive pills give them cancer, or that an IUD is dangerous for those who haven’t had children yet,” says Ferenc. She has begun advising women to record their conversations with doctors. One woman said that doctors treating her breast cancer repeatedly told her the illness was caused by an abortion she had months earlier. But Kacpura and others believe the legislation may also have had a chilling effect on doctors who are terrified of navigating the new law. She says, before the 2021 ruling, doctors would rarely contact her, but in the past year she has been answering their calls day and night. “No one [in authority] explained to the doctors what they should do,” she says. Sometimes, doctors call to pass on the numbers of patients they were not able to legally help. “I called one woman straight after she left the hospital. She was in an awful state, it’s hard to say what she would have done if we hadn’t reached her.” Agata Bzdyń, a lawyer who represents a number of women who have taken their abortion refusals to the European court of human rights, points to reports that Bielański hospital in Warsaw, which she says “has a reputation for still providing abortions”, has been under pressure from the government to hand over documents on the number of terminations approved. Bielański did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond the government, Roman Catholic lay groups continue to exert pressure for an outright abortion ban. The group Ordo Iuris (Order of Law) was one of the mobilising forces behind a citizen’s bill in favour of a total abortion ban, a move that was rejected by parliament but precipitated the ruling. Since 2016, the organisation has acted as official adviser to the PiS government in areas of reproductive rights and education. The organisation recently announced that it will provide legal representation to a man who is suing his wife for having an abortion, which Ordo Iuris argues violated the man’s right to family life.
The most shocking case of the past 12 months is that of a woman called Izabela, who died in November of septic shock while in her 22nd week of pregnancy. Doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, in south-west Poland, did not perform an abortion, even though her foetus would not survive, according to a lawyer for the family. “For now, because of the abortion law, they can’t do anything,” Izabela texted to her mother shortly before she died. An investigation found “medical malpractice” led to Izabela’s death and the hospital was fined . She is survived by a husband and daughter. Kacpura said she knows of several cases in the past year where the woman’s waters broke prematurely, as Izabela’s did, but doctors refused to perform a caesarean or induce birth. “A nightmare, because the foetus cannot survive but the heartbeat can continue for days, sometimes weeks, and the woman has to wonder whether she has already become a coffin.” Bartłomiej Wróblewski, a leading PiS parliamentary force behind the change in the law, said: “It is not true that this law puts women’s lives in danger, because nobody challenged existing provision of Polish law to rescue endangered life and health of the mother, even when it leads to the death of their unborn child.” Echoing other governmental and anti-abortion voices, he stressed that in his eyes there was no connection between Izabela’s death and the new abortion restrictions, instead putting the blame on doctors.
But Izabela’s death horrified the country and sparked fresh protests. It may have proved a turning point. Several polls have found the majority of people in the country oppose the 21 January ruling. Even those who are not pro-choice resent what they see as the Roman Catholic church overstepping the mark by creating political pressure for a ban, says Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at Sussex University. “About 40% of people in Poland still attend weekly mass, but that is not to suggest they are happy for the church to have more control of their lives,” says Szczerbiak. He believes the change in law may have shifted perceptions of the issue in Polish politics.
Ferenc echoes this. “We thought there was no political chance to change [the law around abortion]. The paradox is that it has changed for the worse, but that means we have a chance to liberalise the law too,” she says. A pro-choice citizen’s bill calling for abortion to be made fully available is gaining momentum. “We had an older gentleman come in whose wife told him to print the form from the internet and he got his friends to sign it, and then he came to deliver his 10 signatures,” says Lempart from her office on Wiejska Street, a few doors down from the Polish parliament. “Before, initiatives to collect signatures were mostly organised by groups and political parties. Now, I’d say 60% is just individuals collecting signatures.” Organisers say the citizen’s bill has reached the 100,000 signatures needed for official recognition and more signatures are coming in every day.

1635;1635;1635;1635;1654;1654;We can afford to reverse poverty and climate breakdown. What we can’t afford is the alternative | Kevin Watkins;2022-01-24;['Kevin Watkins'];['Aid', 'Inequality and development', 'Sustainable development goals', 'Global development', 'World Bank', 'International Monetary Fund (IMF)', 'Inequality', 'Society', 'World news', 'Economics', 'Global economy'];"“The peoples of the Earth,” Henry Morgenthau said, “are inseparably linked by a deep underlying community of purpose.” In July 1944, Morgenthau, the US Treasury secretary, was closing the Bretton Woods conference with a reflection on extreme nationalism and the failures of cooperation that had led to war. Cautioning against the pursuit of national interest through “the plan-less, senseless rivalry that divided us”, he outlined an accord for new institutions grounded in an appeal to shared humanity. Reading Morgenthau’s speech today is a jolting reminder of how a generation of political leaders sought to remake the world. The institutional architecture – the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and what became the World Trade Organization – that emerged from Bretton Woods may have been deeply flawed. But this was an attempt to underpin through practical financial and monetary cooperation the human rights and freedoms envisaged in the UN charter. Today we need institutions equipped to rise to the great challenges posed by Covid-19, poverty and the climate crisis. Yet political leaders gripped by vaccine nationalism, climate nationalism and economic nationalism are manifestly lacking the “community of purpose” their citizens and the world need in this moment of crisis. Nowhere are the failures more starkly evident than in the financial response to the pandemic. When Covid-19 struck, governments in rich countries acted decisively to contain the social and economic impacts. Fiscal rulebooks were torn up and monetary orthodoxies abandoned. Even the most conservative finance ministers responded to the crisis like Keynesians on public finance steroids. According to the IMF, economic stimulus measures equivalent to about one-quarter of GDP were implemented. Contrasts with lower-income countries could not be more striking. Most were unable to muster more than 1-2% of GDP in increased public spending, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected and economies trapped in a downward spiral.
Recession magnified pre-pandemic debt problems, leaving more than half of low-income countries either in, or at risk of, debt distress. Amid the public health crisis triggered by the pandemic, 43 lower-income countries were left spending more on debt than public health. The financing disparities have fuelled what some commentators have described as a Great Divergence. While rich countries have all but recovered the economic ground lost during the pandemic, average incomes in the poorest countries will remain below pre-pandemic levels until mid-decade. Meanwhile, budget austerity is reinforcing inequalities within countries as vital public services are cut. The human consequences have been devastating. Progress towards the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) has been thrown into reverse. The number of people in poverty has increased by more than 90 million. Two decades of progress towards universal health coverage have ground to a halt, raising the spectre of setbacks in child survival and maternal health. Malnutrition is rising. Disruption to education systems could leave 70% of children in the poorest countries in “learning poverty”, lacking the skills they need to escape their circumstances. It would be folly for citizens in rich countries to imagine they will be immune to the instability and insecurity that will accompany these reversals. Yet their governments have responded with a trickle of increased aid, which gives new meaning to the phrase “too little, too late”, and a conservative approach to the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions. To be fair, the World Bank and IMF have demonstrated leadership. Commitments for the poorest countries under the bank’s International Development Association (IDA) rose by a fifth in 2021, to $36bn (£27bn). The IMF has scaled up its programmes, underwriting a surge in emergency financing, and providing $14bn in zero-interest loans to poor countries. The fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, navigated a new $650bn allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) – a central bank reserve asset – through the G20. None of which is enough. Financing from the World Bank and regional development banks will provide limited protection against the fiscal retrenchment now in prospect. IMF loans are short-term and must be repaid. Under current allocation rules, two-thirds of the new SDRs will be allocated to rich countries that don’t need them.
In effect, we are fighting an SDG forest fire with financial water pistols. The IMF estimates that low-income countries alone will need an additional $550bn to get back on an accelerated recovery pathway. Meanwhile, recession and human development reversals have increased the SDG financing gap by 70% to about $4.2tn, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – and that’s without the additional $1tn needed to finance a green energy transition in developing countries. The time has come to reimagine a development financing system. More could – and should – be done on aid. The UK’s retreat on that front, most recently in slashing support for the IDA, has been profoundly harmful. But aid cannot substitute an international public finance system aligned to the SDG ambition. The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) should be deployed far more aggressively. Less risk-averse approaches to capital adequacy and modest increases in finance would enable MDBs to triple their lending portfolios to more than $1.3tn, helping to unlock the private finance for a green recovery and deliver investment in global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness. In a period of low interest rates, this is a no-brainer. So why is the G20 endlessly reviewing options instead of acting? The new allocation of SDRs has opened up opportunities now at risk of being squandered. Rich countries do not need the $433bn in additional reserves bestowed on their central bank balance sheets through the IMF. Recycling the SDRs through multilateral banks or other mechanisms could provide developing countries with the liquidity and finance they need to support an SDG recovery and a green transition. Debt relief is critical. If there is one lesson from the 1980s, it is that delayed action on debt is the route to a lost decade of development. With IDA countries scheduled to pay $35bn in debt servicing this year, much of it to private creditors, there is an urgent need to convert unpayable debts into investments in health, education and safety nets. The IMF and World Bank should now be equipped to buy back unsustainable commercial debts at a hefty discount. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, once dismissed the argument that Britain had reached the limits of affordable social provision with a simple rejoinder: “Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” As an international community we can afford to deliver on the SDGs and prevent climate catastrophe. What we can’t afford is the alternative.

But that suddenly changed when she spotted a man pointing a long lens camera towards her as she breastfed her baby daughter on a park bench in Greater Manchester. After twisting her baby out of view, feeling unnerved, and noticing he continued to stare, she approached the man to ask him whether he was taking photos of her. He replied that he had the right to do so, since they were in a public park. “I was just so shocked and turned away with my baby so he couldn’t get any more photos, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it – it was really bothering me,” Cooper said. Still rattled that evening, she called Greater Manchester police. Although sympathetic to her distress, they said there was no law against breastfeeding voyeurism, and as a result they were unable to help. But for Cooper the incident transformed her life. She no longer felt able to take her daughter out for long stretches of time, and would hide in her car whenever she needed to breastfeed her daughter. “I was left feeling so disgusted, disturbed and angry that this man had got away with taking photos of me and my daughter,” she said. “I only tried breastfeeding once in public again, and it just ruined the experience for me. I was looking at everybody around thinking: are they going to photograph me.” Distraught by the lack of action, Cooper turned to her MP, Jeff Smith, for help. Together with Stella Creasy, one of the few MPs who is a young mother and who has experienced breastfeeding voyeurism herself, he launched a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest, which has resulted in the creation of a new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which is being put before parliament on Tuesday. Cooper said the proposed new law would provide much-needed reassurance to mothers such as herself that “you can breastfeed in peace”. Creasy’s own experience of breastfeeding voyeurism took place on an overground train in London, when she noticed that a boy seated opposite her was filming her breastfeeding her baby. “You’re sat on the train and you think: what’s that person opposite doing? Then you realise with horror, you suddenly think: Oh my god, can you see anything? I just wanted to get out, I felt embarrassed, I felt humiliated and I wanted to get away,” she said. Creasy said that since the incident she had spoken to many young mothers who had shared similar experiences, and she thinks this may be connected with the UK’s comparatively low rates of breastfeeding. But she is pleased to now be able to tell them that “if you get breast pests in future they will be held to account”. “We need to make sure that mums know they can complain and that police forces should act,” she said. Women who spoke to campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed described their experiences of being stared at, filmed and photographed while breastfeeding. One recalled how a man had asked her: “Is it my turn next?” as she breastfed her three-month-old child. “I can imagine many women are anxious about breastfeeding in public and drawing attention to themselves at the best of times, but something like that could really put them off,” she said. Others described feeling unnerved by sustained eye contact for up to 10 minutes. One said the person “kept shifting to get a better look” and held her gaze when she tried to shame him into looking away, while another said she had felt so uncomfortable she had called her husband to collect her.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurism-mothers-story;health;politics
4712;4712;4712;431;4768;4768;I’m locked out of the allotment, but dream of new life and new planting | Allan Jenkins;2022-01-09;['Allan Jenkins'];['Gardening advice', 'Life and style', 'Gardens'];"New year, new plot, new soil. We have been exiled now from the allotment site for six weeks or so. Another six weeks – we hope – to go. Locked out from working land in winter, from digging and planting. Just being there. The garden rituals and camaraderie that get us through. I pine for the plot but we are currently persona non grata. A survey discovered asbestos on ours and another nearby allotment site. I suspect it is perhaps not uncommon in London. There were council plans at first to build raised beds but costs put paid to that. In mid-November, planning permission was given for the plots to be covered with geotextile and half a metre of new soil. The earth work we have done is now buried.
I walk close to the gate sometimes. I almost press my face to the future. Everything we could save is sitting waiting on the banks at the edge of the plots. Tree and other treasured plants have been potted. Impatient on our return. Structures have been packed away. Fruit cages now without fruit. Poles waiting for beans and peas. In homes around north London, cuttings and saved seed sit quietly. There will be work to do to bring the new soil to life. To invite worms to return. Organic matter to add. At least, for now, it is winter. I wonder about the foxes, the feral cats, the owls, our robins and other birds. Where the other gardeners are. What plans they’re making for the new growing season. We have uprooted fennel and verbena waiting in Howard’s greenhouse. At least now we will have to thoroughly sort the seed. New life will return. The new year will see the return of old and new allotmenteers. Heads full of plans. Plot 29 will be carefully unpacked. Much-loved plants from before will be re-homed. New plots and new planting. New life will return. Until then at least, there is last year’s amaranth seed to sort. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

3921;3921;3921;3921;3963;3963;‘A banana, concrete – those are good gifts’: the recycling group turning strangers into friends;2022-01-13;['Emma Beddington'];['Life and style', 'Ethical and green living', 'Facebook', 'Social media', 'Social networking', 'Society', 'World news'];"Who on earth wants fish tank wastewater, chicken poo, tumble-dryer lint, loo roll tubes, “a plaster mould of a Komodo dragon’s foot” or half a broken toilet? No one, you might think, but the Buy Nothing community begs to differ: these are all real “gifts” snapped up by more than 5 million members worldwide, who give away their unwanted items in the local community. It’s living proof that “one person’s trash is another’s treasure”, as Alisa Miller, the administrator of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group puts it. Miller offered her daughter’s broken toy birdcage with little hope anyone would want it; it was snapped up by a local flower-arranging enthusiast, and filled with succulents and trailing plants. Her co-administrator’s son is the current custodian of a toy helicopter that has been played with by five Buy Nothing families to date. Members ask for what they want and usually get it: anything from household appliances, furniture and gardening tools to clothes and baby gear. There is nothing unique or original about giving and getting stuff for free. It’s a practice as old as humanity. The juggernaut giveaway network Freecycle was founded in 2003 – but what distinguishes the Buy Nothing project from Freecycle, Freegle, Olio and their ilk is that the emphasis is less on stuff, per se, and more on community. In what Buy Nothing describes as its “hyperlocal gift economies”, users are encouraged to let items “simmer” rather than giving them away to the first person who asks, perhaps suggesting they share a joke or provide a story explaining why they would like the item. In addition to “gifts” and “asks”, users are encouraged to post “gratitude”, with a message or a picture showing what a gifted item has meant to them.
That could all sound insufferably twee, but the thinking behind it is fairly radical. It’s a “social experiment”, explain the project’s founders, Rebecca Rockefeller and Liesl Clark, from their respective living rooms in Washington state, effecting a fundamental shift in our attitude to material goods by building a sense of community, and treating items as community-owned and shared. “If you come at it from an angle of joy and human connection,” says Rockefeller, “you’re more likely to inspire lasting change than when you come at it from telling people: ‘You have to do without this.’” Clark, 55, and Rockefeller, 52, bonded as “Freecycle renegades”, Rockefeller says. She was trying to give away things (twigs, nettles) that her local Freecycle moderator did not consider suitable gifts; both were looking for a deeper connection beyond an anonymous back-door drop or pickup.
“We wanted more of that dialogue,” says Clark. Her attitude was shaped by her experiences as a film-maker, exploring mortuary caves on the Nepal-Tibet border with her husband and children. The objects they found there had been used, exchanged, appreciated and transformed over centuries. “It helped me understand a little more the practical side of reuse and how an entire culture could thrive without any stores.”
“The stuff is one thing, but the stories that go along with it – the humour, the poignancy, the memories – those are the things we really want from each other,” agrees Rockefeller. Both, too, were shocked at the tides of plastic detritus that washed up on the beaches of their home on Bainbridge Island. “It led us naturally to ask what role do we play in this and how can we lessen our impact?” The pair started out with an in-person gift exchange in a local park at weekends; they launched the first Facebook-hosted group in 2013. I’m speaking to them surrounded by the debris of a minimal, but not particularly mindful Christmas: cardboard packaging, return labels and scraps of wrapping paper. It’s a time of year characterised for many of us by a sugar rush and guilt slump of conspicuous consumption. Buy Nothing offers members tools and approaches to counter that sickly consumption hangover, but “Buy Nothing” is the name, not the aim. There’s no expectation or even aspiration that users will somehow forge a fully cashless economy. Indeed, during the pandemic, Buy Nothing changed its rules to allow members to give gifts of cash. “Quite literally, that’s a lifesaving gift you can give another person in a lot of cases,” says Rockefeller. “This was never meant to be an exercise in purity: that doesn’t serve us well. What serves us well is flexibility. A banana, a chunk of concrete or $10 – those are all good gifts.”
She speaks from personal experience: when the first Buy Nothing group was established, Rockefeller was an unemployed single mother. “I was having to go through the US social services system – it’s horrible and it’s intentionally meant to make you feel horrible about yourself.” Getting food and clothes for her children through Buy Nothing gave her financial breathing space. “I had money to go and buy a cup of coffee or a book, which would have been 100% unreachable for me.” Of equal importance, she says, was being able to gift bread she had made or foods she had foraged, which allowed her to “get some dignity back”. “The services we can provide are gifts in themselves,” adds Clark. “Gifts of time” (babysitting, gardening, lifts) and “gifts of self” (social meet-ups, offers to become a workout buddy) are a key element of the Buy Nothing experience.
From that first Facebook group, the community has expanded to 7,000 Buy Nothing groups with, at the most recent count, 5.3 million users in 44 countries as diverse as Guatemala, Iceland, Oman, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. On a slow day, Clark tells me, it gains 1,500 members. The greatest concentrations of communities are in Seattle and New York. There is also a huge, dynamic Australian Buy Nothing network. According to Buy Nothing figures, the UK has 50 active groups and approximately 40,000 members. Although Buy Nothing is described by Clark as “an open-source model”, most local groups operate on Facebook, for which Buy Nothing provides guidance, training and ground rules. A healthy pattern of organic growth, with occasional viral spurts, accelerated during the pandemic. For Clark, physical isolation made people more aware of a deeper kind of isolation. “There’s this ethic of self-reliance, that you fill your house with all the things you need as a family – there you are against the world. But then the pandemic came along. We quickly came to realise how lonely we actually are as a result of not sharing. What we’ve observed is that if people couldn’t physically get together, they’ve been able to virtually connect through sharing items and services.” Inevitably, this kind of growth creates challenges. As groups “sprout” – the Buy Nothing term for when they reach the maximum recommended capacity of 1,000 members and split geographically – redrawn boundaries have at times perpetuated or reinforced historic racial and socio-economic barriers. These issues have on occasion been compounded by the Facebook group structure where considerable power lies in the hands of local administrators, deciding who can join and what they can post. Clark and Rockefeller have addressed Buy Nothing’s failings, including the “flaws and racism we as co-founders built into the original structure of this movement”, as they said in a June 2020 statement. An Equity Team now provides guidance to groups on how to develop an “actively anti-racist and anti-oppression policy”, including trying to use geographical group boundaries to create diverse sharing communities.
Miller worked hard to avoid creating a silo of privilege in south-east London when creating the community in 2019. “This area has got huge wealth inequality. It couldn’t be more diverse, and we intentionally wanted to make sure that we straddled those areas; that was a critical goal.” The newly launched Buy Nothing app is designed to swerve the structural potential for inequity of the Facebook group model. Here, users choose their own geographical limits and create their own communities: “hyperlocal”, “neighbourhood+” or “surrounding areas”. “I’m really hoping our app makes this more accessible [to people] who have been unable for a variety of reasons to connect with it on other platforms, so we get a more diverse set of voices,” says Rockefeller. There are personal costs to growth, too. A network of nearly 13,000 volunteer administrators keeps Buy Nothing functioning, assisted by a core staff of a dozen, all working from their kitchen tables and living rooms. Clark and Rockefeller have always been unpaid volunteers. “I work weekends, in the holidays, in the hours when you’re supposed to be sleeping,” says Clark, who was able to make money from film-making initially. “There’s certainly some joy in it, but it’s become unsustainable.”
Rockefeller has taken on part-time jobs over the years to support her full-time commitment to Buy Nothing. “My kids look at it as their sibling,” she says. “It’s not just me and Rebecca,” adds Clark. “The key volunteers are an incredible group of, basically, women, who are doing this unpaid labour and it’s not the model we want to promote for the world. We need to get a little more creative with this.” They hope that the app will also allow them to capture data on what Buy Nothing does to reduce waste and waste management costs, thereby potentially enabling it to raise funds from municipalities. “We’ve never been able to study how much waste is being diverted from landfill,” says Clark. “Imagine if any given community could access that information?” Moving from the germ of an idea to a global structure is challenging, but for Clark and Rockefeller, the impetus and the motivation is as strong as ever. I ask about their most memorable experiences with Buy Nothing. Clark describes how musical instruments were collected and delivered to victims of the 2018 fire in Paradise, California. As a community, they had enjoyed making music together. Their basic material needs were met by big charities, but they missed having this creative outlet.
For Rockefeller, it’s a source of great pride that her brother-in-law’s community group suggested Buy Nothing as a first port of call when helping refugees from Afghanistan settle in their town. “We’re building this tool that I really believe will have the power to help us, as individuals, to participate in our collective survival,” she says. Over in south-east London, members of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group appreciate the new friendships and the sense of local connection. “It’s culturally so different from any kind of other free stuff group out there,” says Miller. “I love giving back to the community and turning to it when I’m in need of something” adds Elif Koç. “I can spend what I’ve saved for charity and other meaningful causes.” Their group has shared camping equipment and loaned books to children; it has supported a victim of domestic violence and a refugee in setting up home and providing clothing for their families. It does feel like a gentle revolution – one houseplant cutting or power tool at a time. As one member, Sarah Wilde, puts it: “I really like the opportunity to quietly rage against the machine.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/13/a-banana-concrete-those-are-good-gifts-recycling-group-turning-strangers-into-friends;environment;entertainment and culture
3476;3476;3476;3476;3513;3513;Tim Dowling: I fall asleep thinking about the impossibility of each of the repairs I am facing ;2022-01-15;['Tim Dowling'];['DIY', 'Family', 'Homes', 'Life and style'];"It is the season of things coming off in your hands: drawer knobs, door latches, cupboard handles. Everywhere is disintegration and fatigue, down to the very metal. Reach out, turn it, pull it towards you, and it’s yours. On Monday evening the youngest one snaps off the brass latch handle while trying to open the front door. He shows me the piece, shorn away by the force of his grip. “It’s not like I even pulled that hard,” he says. “How do we get out?” I say. We jam a screwdriver into the gap and find that with practice we can lever ourselves free. On Wednesday the cylindrical chrome wand that turns the kitchen tap from hot to cold comes loose from its socket while I’m washing up, screw threads somehow stripped. Nothing I do will make it stay, so I leave it in a saucer on a nearby shelf. The next day the youngest one pulls the handle off the back door, for good measure. “I guess I don’t know my own strength,” he says, presenting me with the remains. “Did you get bitten by a spider or something?” I say. I lift my glasses to examine in detail the grainy peaks and valleys of the fracture, a microscopic landscape contoured along unpredictable lines of tensile stress. “I was just trying to let the cat out,” he says.
“The thing is, the back door was our emergency exit in the event we lost the front door screwdriver,” I say, holding the handle to the light. “What is this, zinc?” I fall asleep thinking about the impossibility of each of the repairs I am facing. Some things, once sundered, cannot be rejoined. There is no such glue. Later I am woken by a loud, tearing crack. I run downstairs to the kitchen to find the dog in a state of distress, wearing the cat flap like a skirt. The front door lock mechanism is, it transpires, under warranty. A repairman arrives after the weekend and fixes it in a matter of minutes. By the time I get there to watch him work, he is gone. Everything else is my problem. These are questions, I realise, not of practical skill but of very precise online ordering. Measure twice and cut once, say DIY experts. I say: order the exact same handle and use all the old screw holes. Unfortunately there is rather more to know about door handles than I imagined. They come sprung and unsprung, for regular or multipoint locking systems, and there is no such thing as a standard size. The manufacturers are also curiously resistant to branding: nowhere on my handle can I find a mark to say who made it, even after taking it to bits. I spend two days educating myself, plus a further afternoon taking precise measurements, before I’m confident I’ve tracked down a suitable replacement. With a tremendous rush of satisfaction, I press Confirm Order. That evening I find my wife looking at new cat flaps online. “Don’t do that without me,” I say. “Why not?” she says. “Did you want to choose the colour?” “We need one that’s big enough for the dog, but small enough for the existing hole,” I say. “We need, in short, the exact same one.” “This one looks the same,” she says. “We do not go by looks,” I say. “I’ll get a tape measure.” On Friday afternoon my handles arrive. It feels like my birthday. I shred the packaging in excitement, pull out a handle and examine it closely: anodised silver, double sprung, multipoint compatible. Then I look down into the box. When my wife next passes through the room I have my head in my hands. “Wrong, all wrong,” I say. “Looks OK to me,” she says, poking the handle. “You have no idea,” I say. “Please don’t tell me,” she says. I call the number on the invoice. After many minutes, a voice answers. “Shelley speaking. How may I help?” it says. I tell Shelley my name and reference number. “The ProLinea, was it?” she says.
“Yes,” I say. “But I ordered the model with the 240mm backing plate. This is the 220.” There is a long silence at the other end. “Oh no,” says Shelley. “That’s not good.” Shelley, I realise, is the only person in the world who understands what I’m going through. She knows exactly how misaligned my screw holes are. “I’m sorry,” I say. “It’s not your fault,” she says. “I’ll get the right one out to you, but it won’t get processed now til Monday.” “That’s fine, Shelley,” I say. But I know that she knows I am crushed.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/tim-dowling-i-fall-asleep-thinking-about-the-impossibility-of-each-of-the-repairs-i-am-facing;business and economy;entertainment and culture
2996;2996;2996;2996;3029;3029;Caring for Covid face masks: bag it between wears and bin it when you’re done;2022-01-17;['Lucianne Tonti'];['Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style', 'Fashion', 'Coronavirus'];"Every time I leave the house, the refrain – phone, wallet, keys, mask – rattles around my brain while I search my bag for the essentials. Evidence that, despite how strange it felt to wear a mask way back in 2019, when we were worried about bushfire smoke inhalation, face masks have become firmly entrenched in our daily lives. Masks are proven to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission and help keep us safe at supermarkets and in between our table and the bathroom at restaurants, but they do need to be handled with specific care to remain effective.
Bag it up Most of us are quick to remove our masks when we sit down at a cafe, but Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales says you should wash or sanitise your hands before you touch your mask, and only handle it by the straps or ear loops.
When you’re not using your mask, rather than shoving it in your pocket or leaving it loose in your bag, put it in a ziplock or paper bag. If you have some disinfectant handy, you can give it a light spray before putting it away. Cloth no longer cuts it Although the “no touching” advice applies to both cloth and disposable masks, MacIntyre says that while cloth masks were fine for other variants, they “really do not cut it against Omicron”. This is because the Omicron variant is more transmissible, so a mask that fits and filters well provides much better protection. MacIntyre says it’s best to use P2 or N95 masks, or if these aren’t available, a blue surgical mask. In this video, occupational hygienist Kate Cole explains how to ensure you’re wearing your mask properly.
When to throw a mask out According to MacIntyre, there are two factors that determine when a mask should be thrown away. The first is obvious, if a mask is “visibly damp or soiled” throw it out. The other factor is the length of time you’ve worn the mask, which MacIntyre says shouldn’t be more than eight to 10 hours. Although this should be considered “a rough guide”, she says, that can be doubled in the case of “extreme shortages”.
How to dispose of a mask It should come as no surprise that disposable face masks are an environmental hazard. According to Dr Mohammad Saberian, a researcher from RMIT University, 6.8bn disposable masks are used across the globe each day. He says since disposable face masks are mainly made of non-biodegradable plastics, they could take 450 years to break down. The good news is, Saberian and his colleagues at RMIT have shown how disposable face masks could be recycled into road-making material. They suggest that once masks have been decontaminated they could be shredded and mixed with building rubble.
But Saberian says, “The main hurdle to recycling face masks and waste PPE is the lack of appropriate facilities and equipment in waste recycling facilities.” Face masks in Australia are put in the rubbish bin, collected with household waste and sent to landfill. Saberian says designated bins for face masks or waste PPE should be implemented, at least for busy locations like hospitals, aged care facilities and shopping centres. But MacIntyre says for now, you should make sure you dispose of masks in the rubbish bin: “Please do not litter or leave used masks lying around.” Caring for cloth masks
What about all the cloth masks we’ve begrudgingly collected? They are still better than wearing nothing, and need to be machine washed at 60C after each day’s use. That means if you are wearing cloth masks daily, you’ll need to have several on rotation. The founder of Maison Modulare, Chrys Wong, suggests machine washing “on a gentle cycle with like colours and like size articles” then using a tumble dryer, ironing or steaming the mask afterward, to provide further sterilisation. As for straps, “unfortunately, once the strap is detached from the mask itself, it’s very difficult to sew back,” she says. If you’re not handy enough with a needle and thread to unpick and resew new elastic yourself, you should take masks to your local dry cleaner or tailor to have the elastic replaced.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/18/caring-for-covid-face-masks-bag-it-between-wears-and-bin-it-when-youre-done;health;entertainment and culture
2896;2896;2896;2896;2927;2927;I have a wonderful fiance, but my libido has vanished – will it ever come back?;2022-01-18;['Pamela Stephenson Connolly'];['Sex', 'Life and style', 'Relationships', 'Mental health', 'Health'];I have a wonderful partner, and we’re getting married next year after three years together. We live together, and both work quite intense jobs. I’ve always been quite a sexual person, but recently my libido has fallen off a cliff. It’s like I don’t even have sex organs any more, which is a bit frightening. My partner has a high sex drive and I worry he is unfulfilled, despite saying he doesn’t mind. I think he takes it personally, but I love him very much. We are often not in the house at the same time and keep quite different hours because of his job. I have had a traumatic year, with a few bereavements and family illness, and wonder if this has affected my sex drive. My question is, how can I get it back? Bereavement and trauma are two fairly common reasons for lowered libido. This is normally temporary, but you need time to recover and heal. Help your partner to understand your lack of desire is not about him – ask him to be patient. And try not to let your anxiety about your libido escalate, as that could make things worse. Any kind of loss can lead to depression, and it could be worth seeking some therapeutic help if you don’t feel like yourself pretty soon. Like anxiety, depression is another likely culprit when libido drops. Many people have become depressed as a result of the losses of our time – lockdowns, health issues, curbs on our freedoms, financial struggles and job losses – and sexual problems often follow. Mental and sexual health can never be taken for granted. Now more than ever, we must find ways to soothe, nurture and sustain ourselves. This too shall pass.

1921;1921;1921;1921;1942;1942;Easy wins: spend five minutes a day to score an edible garden and an obscene amount of joy;2022-01-22;['Steph Harmon'];['Life and style', 'Gardening advice'];"After spending three decades murdering every plant I touched, I was astonished to find myself in lockdown with a functioning edible garden. Perhaps isolation taught me patience. Perhaps the pandemic made me more careful. It certainly helped that there were already veggies growing in raised garden beds when we moved in: from them I learned that part of gardening is watching plants die (some died! it was OK!), and from that I gained the confidence to plant more. My first tip is to start simple. Basil, dill, parsley, chilli, snow peas, lemon thyme, strawberries and mint are all hardy if you have good soil (did you know you can simply go out and buy an entire bag of worms? And then just chuck them in?), enough sun and remember to water each day. I keep my herbs and small vegetables in balcony boxes that hang above the garden beds, which grow zucchini, beans and tomatoes I can take little credit for; the beds were already irrigated.
My second tip is to keep it simple by way of cheap accoutrements that remove both guesswork and legwork. I have a big rubber tub ($4, Bunnings) collecting rain (free, La Niña). I have a soil meter ($17) that measures moisture, pH and light (a magical tool that tells you when to water and has kept my indoor plants alive as well). I plant seeds in a seedling box ($12) first, which keeps the weather off until they’re big enough to be moved. Once set up in their balcony boxes ($11), I scatter a smorgasbord of year-round flowers around them to lure bees that will pollinate the plants. Bees: also free! It is obscene how much joy this all brings me – and it takes around five minutes each day to tend. I run out every morning now with my dumb cute watering can ($20) to water everyone, trim off the dead leaves (it helps the plant focus on the living ones) and see if anything has happened. A new strawberry! A different flower! A bee! Look at this BEE! I yell all the developments at my bored partner and show him the tiny yield I have gathered in a tiny basket (so it looks bigger). Sometimes I wear a hat while I’m doing it, like some lady in a boring BBC show. It’s so much easier than I thought! And incredibly dull. I love it.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/23/easy-wins-spend-five-minutes-a-day-to-score-an-edible-garden-and-an-obscene-amount-of-joy;environment;entertainment and culture
329;329;329;329;335;335;There’s a new picture on our kitchen corkboard…;2022-01-30;['Séamas O’Reilly'];['Parents and parenting', 'Family', 'Life and style'];"I’ve pinned the ultrasound images of the coming baby to the corkboard in our kitchen. It’s the first thing we’ve pinned there for a while. We got it shortly after we moved in, thinking it would be a place for us to keep lists, or vouchers or important notices. Once it got filled up, we just stopped using it because we are deeply unserious people masquerading as adults and, in fairness, when our son was born we surrendered to chaos a little more freely than before. Now it stands as a fossilised relic of the concerns and appointments we were faced with between April and September, 2018.
There are inscrutable notes, written with great haste about important things, now indecipherable. There is the EKG printout from that time I called 111 about my bad back and they managed to convince me I was having a heart attack and sent some rather unimpressed paramedics to our house. There is a gift voucher, itself three years out of date, for a Spanish restaurant that went out of business during the first lockdown. Looking at all these things now provokes the same melancholy tinge of those site photos from Pompeii; whole streets excavated to find people locked in an arbitrary moment in time, buried under volcanic ash, but still sitting upright at desks, or churning butter, or inspecting the use-by date on their tapas vouchers. Beneath that is the ultrasound we got for our son, four years ago. It has decayed over those years, blown out by exposure to the kitchen window, so that his tiny, spongy form, once clear, is now scribbled and scratched beyond all recognition. Its edges have curled up like a Cornetto wrapper, as if melted by creeping lava. Beside them, the ultrasounds of his sister, which are sharp and clean and brand new, seem like they are from a future age. It’s a stark, slightly bittersweet marker of how much time has passed. At a glance, it looks as if we ordered our first baby on VHS, but switched to Blu-ray for the next. And just to the left of that there is an even more striking artefact. A single sheet of notepaper marked GRAB LIST, which details everything we were supposed to bring to the hospital four years ago. On it I’ve written READY, as if this list is in its final, perfect form and proves our preparedness for everything that came after. It is a touchingly naive document of the moment just before our son was born, since its contents speak to a more innocent idea of what those few days in hospital would be like. I clearly presumed listening to music would be a big concern, as I’ve written speakers twice. This time we have no grab list, and the Bluetooth speakers will likely stay at home. We know that the volcano is coming, at least. We just no longer pretend to be ready. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

5365;5365;5365;1084;5428;5428;Text appeal: Ceefax recreated by 20-year-old Northern Irish man;2022-01-05;['Jim Waterson'];['BBC', 'Computing', 'Television', 'Television', 'Media', 'Technology', 'Culture'];"If you find news websites too overwhelming, too fast and too full of distractions then this might be the solution: a recreation of the BBC’s Ceefax service featuring up-to-date headlines, an accurate weather map and the latest stock market prices. Nathan Dane, 20, has spent the last six years building a simulation of the BBC’s defunct text-based information service. It takes in data from the BBC’s existing website and repurposes it in the distinctively blocky font that was ubiquitous on television sets during the 1980s and 1990s.
“It’s as close a recreation as I can make it,” said Dane from his home in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, where he has a separate screen at his desk for showing news headlines from his recreation of Ceefax. “I do find it really useful myself. If I’m sitting in work eating my lunch I can just stick that on and get up to date. You’re not flicking about between websites – you have all the information you need on a page but without all the distraction.” At its peak, tens of millions of Britons used BBC Ceefax and its commercial equivalent, Teletext, to check news headlines, find travel information or wait an infuriatingly long time for a quiz answer to be revealed. Individual stories were often split across multiple pages, meaning it could take minutes to fully comprehend an article if you were unlucky enough to load halfway through a piece. Only a few sentences of text fitted on each screen, forcing writers to develop the skills to produce concise stories. But the limitations and slowness of a system designed in 1974 may be increasingly attractive in a world of unlimited choice, while the cluttered advertising-heavy designs of many modern websites have made people nostalgic for the simplicity of Ceefax.
The BBC closed the original Ceefax service as part of the transition to digital television broadcasts, with Northern Ireland being the last region of the UK to lose access. “We had Ceefax in this part of the world until 2012, which is probably the only reason I remember it,” said Dane, who works for a digital signage company. “I have a great interest in all the old broadcast-TV type stuff. It’s really the service that I remember looking through when I was wee.” Dane’s recreation features a weather map (page 401) based on data from the Met Office that accurately recreates the current forecast on a map of the UK using the limited Ceefax colour palette. The Premier League football table (page 324) is up to date. A selection of national, foreign and local stories can be accessed through the headlines section (page 101). Some fans have also set up YouTube streams looping through Ceefax pages with muzak in the background, recreating the way the BBC used to fill overnight schedules on its channels.
The small but thriving online Teletext community, which is centred on a group on the chat service Discord, already helps run a separate long-running service called Teefax – although it does not use the same BBC styling. There are also dozens of teletext artists who challenge themselves to use the limited colour palette. One of them, Dan Farriond, said: “It’s a great gateway because it’s very simple, it’s built on 1970s technology, it’s simple to get your head around technology-wise. It’s the pure aesthetic of it and the simplicity. You only have a limited number of colours. A lot of the design decisions are made for you.” Dane, who runs his Ceefax server from his home, said his service was remarkably stable. When Facebook went offline in November he proudly tweeted a story about Mark Zuckerberg’s company with the caption: “Ceefax, however, remains unaffected.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/text-appeal-ceefax-recreated-by-20-year-old-northern-irish-man;science and technology;entertainment and culture
2791;2791;2791;2791;2822;2822;Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s glee at general’s Covid diagnosis sparks outrage;2022-01-18;['Martin Pengelly'];['Fox News', 'Coronavirus', 'US news'];"The rightwing Fox News host Laura Ingraham has stoked outrage by announcing that the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff had tested positive for Covid-19 – and applauding as she did so.
One critic called the host a “merchant of death”. Another said he was “not sure when hate became a Christian value”. Gen Mark Milley became a target of rightwing anger after extensive reporting showed how he worked to contain Donald Trump at the end of his time in power, keeping US armed forces out of domestic affairs. Milley has also defended the teaching in military institutions of critical race theory, an academic discipline which conservatives have turned into a profitable election issue. On Monday, Ingraham introduced a section of her show called Positively Boosted, in which she gleefully recounts which vaccinated public figures have tested positive. Clapping and smiling, she said: “Triple-vaxxed joint chiefs chairman Mark Milley, our favorite Mark Milley, tested positive for Covid yesterday. “And who else? Gen David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, also positively boosted.” Earlier, a spokesman for Milley said the general was “experiencing very minor symptoms and can perform all of his duties from the remote location. He has received the Covid-19 vaccines including the booster”. A spokeswoman for Berger said: “The performance of his duties will remain unaffected.” More than 850,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, the vast majority unvaccinated. Federal authorities have repeatedly said that breakthrough infections are possible, particularly from the Omicron virus variant. Nonetheless, like other public health measures, the Biden administration’s armed forces vaccine mandate has become a target of conservative anger. On air on Monday, after a brief discussion of reports of a senior Vatican official also testing positive, Ingraham said: “We certainly hope they’re all healthy and fine. But stop pushing your mandates.” Amid widespread criticism, Kim Masters, an editor-at-large for the Hollywood Reporter, said Ingraham was “absolutely disgusting and so are [Fox Corporation chairman and chief executive] Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch for giving her a platform”. “These monsters are merchants of death,” Masters wrote. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America Magazine, said: “Laura Ingraham is often described as someone in favor of ‘Christian values’. “But the last time I checked, we’re supposed to love our enemies, not celebrate when they get sick. Jesus had compassion for the sick; he didn’t laugh at them. Not sure when hate become a Christian value.” Others pointed to Fox News’ own strict vaccination requirements for staff. Ingraham also made news on Tuesday with an interview with Northern Virginia magazine in which she said she was not yet ready to back Trump for president again. Asked about online criticism, she said she did not read it, adding: “I’m in a job where controversy is just part of the daily routine.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/18/fox-news-laura-ingraham-covid-mark-milley-outrage;politics;health
1430;1430;1430;1430;1446;1446;Adam Boulton: Sky News faces ‘existential’ crisis as TV habits change;2022-01-25;['Jim Waterson'];['Sky News', 'Sky', 'UK news', 'Media', 'Television industry', 'TV news'];Adam Boulton has said Sky News faces “existential” questions about its future as it grapples with changing audience habits and the long-term funding necessary to keep an intensive 24-hour operation on the air. “I know there are executives at Sky that take the view there will only be one news channel in the UK in 10 years’ time and it probably won’t be Sky,” the former Sky News’ editor-at-large told the Guardian. “Any corporation is going to ask, ‘What’s the point of Sky News? Is everything it’s offering being done by others anyway so we might as well not bother?’ Colleagues at Sky News think about it all the time. It’s existential.” When Rupert Murdoch sold the wider Sky business to the US media conglomerate Comcast in 2018, the new owners promised to fund the prestigious but lossmaking news service for a decade. Boulton, who left the channel last month after serving as editor-at-large, said Comcast had honoured the deal but the channel’s long-term future was unclear: “People are wondering what’s going to happen when the guaranteed funding under the takeover deal expires … the problem with the takeover arrangement was it put Sky News in aspic with the same funding and the same management.” Boulton, 62, is one of a number of big-name television news presenters who left their jobs at the end of last year, along with the likes of Andrew Marr and Jon Snow. He said there was less appetite for an authoritative “grey haired man that told you the news” and that it was time for baby boomers to hand over to a younger and more diverse set of presenters. However, having spent more than a quarter of a century as Sky News’ political editor, he defended the idea of authoritative “gatekeepers” in the media who can explain and contextualise events in real time. He said: “This is where my disagreement with [Sky News boss] John Ryley is sharpest. I think there is a general questioning of the whole notion of authority … There’s a feeling, which I think is John’s position, which is ‘put stuff out digitally and leave the public to decide what they want’. “John’s answer to that would be if you put the information out there with lots of digital analysis you’re still doing the job. My argument is that you’re not doing it in real time. I think it’s beneficial for society that’s there’s analysis and invigilation – not just post-fact but while things are happening.” An estimated 8 million Britons a month watch Sky News but most only watch briefly, meaning typical viewing figures during the daytime are nearer 100,000 people. It has also built up a substantial audience online. Asked about concerns from some Sky News employees that the channel’s coverage of the climate crisis is tipping over into campaigning, he said it was “basically benevolent” but did raise issues. “We had our chief executive appearing on a platform at Cop26, which we were sponsoring at a corporate level with Boris Johnson and [Joe] Biden and [Narendra] Modi. That made me think, really, how free are we to comment and analyse what they’re saying?” Boulton said he remained a believer in TV news but that the format needed to change, with audiences for traditional news bulletins continuing to fall. He said: “Sky is a fantastic company and should have a very good future. I wouldn’t say anything negative about it but all of us just have to look at changing markets. “This is not a static industry and nothing is for ever. You’ve got to recognise that these are the inevitable changes thrown up by technology.”;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/adam-boulton-sky-news-faces-existential-crisis-as-tv-habits-change;business and economy;entertainment and culture
5737;5737;5737;1456;5807;5807;David Bowie: publishing rights to song catalogue sold for $250m;2022-01-03;['Ben Beaumont-Thomas'];['David Bowie', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Music industry', 'Culture', 'Business', 'UK news'];"The publishing rights to David Bowie’s huge and peerless catalogue of songs have been sold by his estate to Warner Chappell Music (WCM), the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, in a deal worth at least $250m (£185m) according to anonymous sources speaking to Variety. Guy Moot, chief executive of WCM, said: “These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music for ever … We are looking forward to tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care as we strive to build on the legacy of this most extraordinary human being.” The deal means that Warner now owns the rights to Bowie’s songwriting itself, as well as to almost all the recordings of it. In September 2021, the company completed a deal to acquire Bowie’s recordings from 2000 until his death in 2016, adding to the recordings it already owned from 1968 to 1999.
Just a small cache of recorded music made prior to Bowie’s late-60s breakthrough is now not owned by Warner Music. The company has been lavishly repackaging Bowie’s back catalogue in a series of box sets in recent years. The deal is the latest in a series of major acquisitions by various companies of the catalogues of pop artists, with Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and various members of Fleetwood Mac selling the rights for their songs for large cash sums. These deals allow the publishing companies to accrue income from royalties, as well as when music is licensed for use in films, TV and advertising. Terms of the Bowie deal have not been disclosed but the Bowie estate has historically closely controlled the use of his work. The 2020 biopic Stardust, about the birth of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona, was forbidden by the estate from using Bowie’s music. WCM co-chair Carianne Marshall said: “We were pleased that the estate felt that Warner Chappell has the knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature. All of our global leaders and departments are incredibly excited and primed to get to work with these brilliant songs across multiple avenues and platforms.” Another film that does already have the blessing of the estate is a forthcoming untitled documentary by film-maker Brett Morgen, who is using thousands of hours of rare and unseen live performance footage as its basis.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/david-bowie-publishing-rights-to-song-catalogue-sold-for-250m;business and economy;entertainment and culture
6031;6031;6031;1750;6103;6103;Time to stockpile olives? Shortages as delis are hit by new Brexit import rules;2022-01-01;['Toby Helm', 'Tom Wall'];['Brexit', 'European Union', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'Boris Johnson', 'Food', 'Life and style', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Consumer affairs'];"After a few minutes in the queue spent eyeing up the best on offer at the local deli, it is decision time. Maybe some of the wonderful Parma ham from Italy? With a few slices of Spanish chorizo? And a piece of brie from that farm in Normandy … oh, and definitely some of the black olives from Greece. The government may be making light of new and burdensome Brexit rules and regulations affecting imports to Great Britain from the EU that came into force on 1 January, but organisations representing small UK firms are not. The firms are worried about the impact on their businesses – and about the choices that will be available to their customers at their favourite specialist stores – on the high street. The Federation of Small Businesses cites local delicatessens, many of which import from small specialist suppliers in the EU, as the type of operators that could be adversely affected. “The classic example is your high street deli that is importing delicacies like, say, chorizo from Spain or parmesan from Italy,” says James Sibley, the federation’s head of international affairs. “For them, the thought of having to register for these systems is daunting and the process is expensive, so we’ve a lot of concern there. For those small businesses directly affected, we have picked up a lot of worry.” The hit to small EU exporters to the UK could be similar to that experienced by UK exporters to the EU over the past year, many of which simply gave up selling goods to the continent because post-Brexit export rules made it too much of a bother and too expensive to carry on. From the beginning of last year UK exporters faced extra paperwork, and added costs, and their customers were stung by resulting higher prices – despite the claims by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other Brexiteers that leaving the EU would reduce regulation and lead to lower prices. Now, Sibley says, the effects could be similar for small importers to those that faced UK exporters in 2021. “It is the inverse of what has happened to UK exporters over the past year. We know that a fifth of our exporting members have stopped exporting to the EU, because of that disruption.” Rules that came into force January 1 require businesses (in most cases those receiving the goods in the UK, but in some those sending them here) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021. The process will require the exporter to acquire and then submit an Eori number (economic operators registration and identification number) to their UK customers so the importers can then input a lot of data and send it off to the UK authorities. If the goods arrive with incomplete paperwork, they can be seized, confiscated or sent back. Sibley says there is evidence that many EU exporters are unprepared for what is about to hit them. “What we are hearing is that there are some EU traders who are not ready for any of this even to the extent of not having this number, so that is a concern.” Then on 1 July this year, more regulations and checks will come in. “From then, exporters will also need export health certificates or veterinary certificates if they are exporting products of animal origin or foodstuffs. That is a point at which some EU exporters might just say, ‘You know what, forget this. It is not worth the hassle’.” Sibley adds: “Also in July you will have physical inspections of goods at border posts in the UK, so again that could lead to delays because you will essentially have a vet with a clipboard going through the lorry saying ‘this is right, this is fine, (or not)’.” Business groups say the problems will affect mainly smaller operators, as bigger concerns can afford to pay customs agents or freight forwarders to handle the paperwork for them.
On UK high streets, some shop owners are already worrying about gaps appearing on their shelves in 2022, and about rising prices. El Colmado, Bristol’s only Spanish deli, imports pretty much everything: chorizo sausages, huge serrano hams and glossy green olives. Its owner, David Pavon, expects more disruption and rising prices when importers are required to make real-time custom declarations, input details of food imports into various customs systems, and obtain special codes for lorries to board ferries. “Logistics problems have increased during the past year already because of the havoc coming into England,” he says. “So I imagine in January we’re going to see even more delays, because if a lorry driver needs to sit in the border for six hours or more, we will need to pay his wages. We are paying customs agents in Spain and here to input the information [required for import], which increases the price as well.” Pavon, 41, has already put his prices up – and expects to have to do so again in 2022. “They are still going up and you will see an increase and an increase,” he says. “Someone is making money along the way but you and me are going to have to pay for it.” The wholesalers supplying delis and specialist food shops have similar worries. Reading-based Cotswold Fayre, which supplies hundreds of premium food lines, including European favourites such as stollen and panettone, to independent retailers throughout the UK, has been forced to budget for delays and cost increases on imported goods instead of investing in creating new jobs. “It’s not what we want to do – I would rather spend on starting another shop, but if we have to we will [absorb extra costs],” says Paul Hargreaves, the company’s founder. Hargreaves, who recently met his local MP, Alok Sharma, feels that the government does not understand the impact of Brexit on British businesses. “[Ministers] are not in the real world. They think things are a lot easier than they actually are. That is highly frustrating,” he says. “If they had to experience it for themselves, perhaps there might have been a bit more effort to do a better Brexit deal. The perception is that the ideology [of Brexit] is more important than the practicalities to businesses in the UK.” • The headline and text of this article were amended on 1 January 2022 to correctly refer to Great Britain rather than the UK in specific reference to the new regulations.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-shops-fear-gaps-shelves-brexit-import-rules-prices-shortages-delis;business and economy;politics
1517;1517;1517;1517;1536;1536;Victoria Frank obituary;2022-01-24;['N/A'];['Communities', 'West Bromwich'];My mother, Victoria Frank, who has died aged 87, was part of the Windrush generation, settling in the West Midlands in the 1960s, and a community advocate committed to making a difference in society. She was determined to amplify the voices of others, whether that be assisting with rehabilitating ex-offenders, or influencing policy on resources for underrepresented groups. She was a key driver in the discussions that led to the creation of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre in 1985. The fifth child of eight, born in the parish of Longwood, in Clarendon, Jamaica, to Esmie (nee Mitchell) and David Reid, a supervisor at Moneymusk West Indies Sugar Cane Company, Victoria went to Alley school, then worked as a dressmaker before journeying to England in 1960. She settled in West Bromwich, where she had friends, and found work in a factory. By 1962 she had saved enough to send for her fiancé, Herman Frank, who later worked as a supervisor for a steel fabrication factory. They married the same year. In 1974 Victoria moved to the Smith Corona typewriter factory, then from 1986 worked as assistant to the nurse administering medical support at the Konix factory until 1991, when she left to set up a guest house for prison leavers with Herman. She cooked meals for the ex-offenders and assisted them with their rehabilitation and finding employment. In 1996 she began working for Sandwell council as an assistant manager in health and social care, until retirement in 2001. As a founding member of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre, Victoria served as treasurer, then vice chair for many years, and finally a short spell as chair before retirement. Her responsibilities included staff recruitment, funding negotiations and entertainment, and she initiated the creation of the Senior Citizens Luncheon Club, which is still operating. She was key to the centre winning a Pace (Public Award for Community Excellence) in 2004. Victoria was multi-talented, designing and sewing garments to create unique outfits, and making delicious rum cake and Caribbean food. She fought her entire life for more, and to be more. Hers was an inspirational life, leaving a true legacy in all she achieved for others. Herman died in 2010. Victoria is survived by their daughters, Eula, Rose, Bev and me, and three granddaughters, Louise, Samara and Merissa.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/24/victoria-frank-obituary;health;entertainment and culture
3275;3275;3275;3275;3311;3311;Panic as Kosovo pulls the plug on its energy-guzzling bitcoin miners ;2022-01-16;['Daniel Boffey'];['Cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'Kosovo', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Technology', 'World news', 'Energy', 'Europe'];"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency. From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices. “There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities. The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide. The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government. The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades. There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale. But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh).
Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs. Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”. “We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.” Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry. In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. “It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel. Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?” Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective.
Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware. While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain. “There are a lot of people who have invested in crypto mining equipment and it’s not a small investment,” cryptoKapo said. “People have even taken out loans to invest and the impact now is very bad on their lives.”";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners;business and economy;science and technology

4516;4516;4516;235;4568;4568;Home Office backing of women’s safety app is insulting, campaigners say;2022-01-10;['Alexandra Topping'];['Crime', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Women', 'Domestic violence', 'Society', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'Sexual harassment', 'UK news'];"Women’s safety campaigners have called the Home Office’s backing of an app that allows users to track their friends’ journeys home “insulting to women and girls”, arguing that it does nothing to tackle the issue of men’s violence against women. The new app provides anyone walking home at night with a monitored route on their phone. If the walker moves more than 40 metres from the route or stops for more than three minutes, the app asks if they are OK. If there is no reply, nominated “guardians” – normally friends and family – receive a notification on their phones to say there has been a deviation. They can then check on the person in question and alert the police if they are unable to do so. The Home Office minister, Rachel Maclean, said such schemes should be part of a wider plan to make streets safer for women and girls. “We need a whole-of-society approach to tackling violence against women and girls, and I welcome initiatives from the private sector that deliver on this aim,” she said. Anna Birley from Reclaim These Streets, which was set up after the murder of Sarah Everard, said safety apps did nothing to tackle the underlying problem of men’s violence against women. “The Home Office backing of this app is insulting to women and girls,” she said. “We already share our location, we already ask our friends to text us when they get home, we already wear bright clothes, stick to the well-lit routes and clutch our keys between our fingers. “It still isn’t enough. Women and girls, and the steps that we take to stay safe every day, are not the problem. The problem is that male violence makes us unsafe.” The free, not-for-profit app, Path Community, is being trialled by about 500 people including Metropolitan police officers in Southwark and Lambeth in south London. It creates routes avoiding unlit streets, alleys or areas known for antisocial behaviour and users can mark where they feel unsafe. Harry Mead, the creator, told the Guardian that anonymised information can then be shared with local councils and police to establish problem areas that may need more resources. The platform was also developing an education platform, he said.
“The underlying issue of men’s violence is the core problem and everyone has to help tackle it,” he said. “The app is designed to help with immediate concerns and help users feel safer. Path is our attempt to do our bit.”. Domestic violence campaigners have also raised concerns about safety apps that track movement being misused by abusers. They could “potentially extend an abuser’s reach beyond the home, controlling women in spaces they previously felt safe and free”, said the chief executive of Women’s Aid, Farah Nazeer. The Home Office and police and crime commissioners needed to work with the women’s sector to remove barriers to their safety, she said. “There is so much work to be done to increase survivors’ confidence in reporting abuse to police, tackle misogyny with public awareness and education and, of course, provide adequate funding to services supporting survivors,” she said. Mead said developers were very conscious of the issue of potential misuse and had designed the app to be as private as possible while providing maximum safety. Tracking only lasted for the duration of a set journey and users would always be contacted first to check if they were OK before a guardian was notified while a toggle to turn live tracking on and off was being developed, he added. The shadow minister for domestic violence, Jess Phillips, said: “This seems like a sticking plaster instead of dealing with the actual problem that is men’s violence against women.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said its Tackling Violence against Women and Girls strategy launched last year included initiatives and funding to target potential perpetrators and protect potential victims, including the pilot of the StreetSafe online tool, which allows the public to anonymously report areas where they feel unsafe.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/womens-safety-app-backed-by-home-office-is-insulting-experts-say;environment;politics
4287;4287;4287;6;4333;4333;Prince Andrew can sell Swiss chalet after settling £6.6m debt, say reports;2022-01-11;['Caroline Davies'];['Prince Andrew', 'UK news'];The Duke of York has settled a £6.6m debt with a French socialite allowing him to sell a Swiss chalet as he faces escalating legal bills over the sexual assault civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, according to reports. Isabelle de Rouvre, 74, who sold the property to Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, in 2014 for a reported £18m, said: “The war is over. He has paid the money.” Andrew and his ex-wife had agreed with Rouvre that Chalet Helora in the ski resort of Verbier in the Swiss Alps, would be paid for in instalments. But Rouvre claimed the two failed to make the final £5m instalment. Initially Rouvre agreed the final instalment could be deferred until December 2019, with interest accruing, but the Yorks still did not honour the agreement despite repeated demands, it was reported. Rouvre launched legal action in May 2020 in Switzerland to recoup the £5m plus interest owed to her. Andrew is said to have finally paid late last year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rouvre said she had sold the house to the Yorks about two months ago. “That is the end of the story thankfully,” she told the website. “The war is finished. It is the end of the matter. I have nothing to do with it now. That’s all.” She added: “It was about six weeks ago that the matter was closed. It was November. The second payment needed to be paid and that payment is now done. That’s it. You can be sure that’s it. It’s done.” A source close to Andrew said: “I can confirm that the legal action has been halted and that the chalet is being sold – but otherwise no comment on private financial matters.” The prince is now selling the property as he faces the lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal on three occasions after she was trafficked by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has denied the allegations. His ex-wife and the couple’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, stayed at the chalet over the New Year holiday. As a family, the Yorks had rented the seven-bedroomed chalet, which has an indoor swimming pool, for winter holidays before deciding to buy it as a nest egg for their daughters. Until the debt was settled, Andrew was unable to sell it. It is understood a buyer has been found and the sale is proceeding, but not yet completed. Andrew is awaiting a New York judge’s decision on his application to have Giuffre’s lawsuit against him dismissed.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/prince-andrew-sell-swiss-chalet;business and economy;politics
4021;4021;4021;4021;4064;4064;Royal Navy will fail without reform, says outgoing deputy chief;2022-01-12;['Ben Quinn'];['Royal Navy', 'Military', 'UK news'];The Royal Navy will fail without reform, the outgoing deputy of the service has said in a farewell message to personnel and civil servants in which he bemoaned what he said was as an inadequate status quo. V-Adm Nick Hine posted a candidly worded letter on Twitter in which he said change had to happen, and that he had sometimes despaired at the type of thinking around him. His time in the role corresponded with a period in which – as the Commons defence committee said in a report last month – spending on the navy and the wider military had been capped despite it facing changing threats and taking on additional responsibilities. “Please understand that the need for and, the value of change, is not a fantasy – if we don’t transform we will fail and we will lose. It is that simple,” he wrote, adding that he was also addressing “pedants and naysayers”. Those who had known him for a long time would know that his “big bugbear” was that “our great navy has lost its ambition”, he wrote. “I have despaired at times that collectively we had become self-censoring, risk-averse and lacking in curiosity, confidence and critical thinking skills. “We have these qualities but have allowed a rose-tinted view of tradition and a spurious belief that you can avoid risk by sticking to a failing status quo to avoid driving transformation.” The defence committee report identified a series a challenges the navy faces, including delays to crucial procurement programmes as a result of budget cuts, an increasing reliance on allies and successive governments prioritising of ships’ defensive rather than offensive capabilities. “When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines – well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities. This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities,” it said. “These significant challenges have not prevented the Navy delivering significant successes, most notably the commissioning of the two aircraft carriers and the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. However, they do raise concerns about the Navy’s ability to deliver the crucial transformations it has planned.” Boris Johnson selected the head of the navy as the next chief of Britain’s armed forces for the first time in 20 years in October, a choice intended to reinforce the UK’s post-Brexit switch in focus to the Indo-Pacific region. Downing Street also published an integrated review of defence and foreign policy earlier last year, a key feature of which was to call for a significant British re-engagement in the Indo-Pacific, which had been abandoned in the late 1960s. Sea power is seen to be at the heart of competing with China, which has the world’s largest navy. The UK signed a three-country pact with the US last month to supply long-range nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. A navy spokesperson, said: “Threats to the UK and our allies multiply every day and so it is critical the Royal Navy continues to transform to ensure that personnel and valuable resources are placed where they are needed most. “The government has made the biggest investment in the armed forces since the cold war. We will continue to modernise, ensuring we are ready to meet the future challenges.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/royal-navy-will-fail-without-reform-says-outgoing-deputy-chief;business and economy;politics
3755;3755;3755;3755;3796;3796;Met police won’t investigate alleged No 10 lockdown party;2022-01-13;['Sarah Marsh'];['Metropolitan police', 'Health policy', 'Coronavirus', 'Civil service', 'Boris Johnson', 'Cressida Dick', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Gray report'];"The Metropolitan police will not investigate alleged parties held at Downing Street in apparent breach of lockdown rules unless an upcoming inquiry finds evidence of criminality. The force said it did not normally investigate breaches of coronavirus regulations “long after they are said to have taken place”. The senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating allegations of parties held at Downing Street while the UK was in lockdown due to Covid-19. The force added that if this showed criminality took place then the police force would “reconsider” its stance. On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, admitted attending a gathering at 10 Downing Street on 20 May 2020, during the height of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. An estimated 100 people were invited, with about 30 believed to have attended. Johnson said he was there for 25 minutes. When the event took place, parties were banned and people were not able to see friends or family, even those unwell in hospital.
A spokesperson for the Met said the force was “aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the health protection regulations at Downing Street and Department for Education on various dates and has received correspondence in relation to this reporting”. It added: “The Met has ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office in relation to its inquiry. If the inquiry identifies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence it will be passed to the Met for further consideration.” An inquiry announced by the prime minister and led by Gray will also look into a party allegedly held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events. Several dozen people – a mix of civil service and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. The Met has previously been criticised for not taking action and “deferring to the powerful” against parties that took place. The Good Law Project has already started legal proceedings over the Met’s refusal to investigate reports of the Christmas party on 18 December 2020. The campaign group said that in letters between it and the Met, police said they had “relied on the government’s assurances that no rules had been broken” and “there would have been no point in interviewing No 10 staff about the parties because they would have refused to answer questions that exposed them to a risk of prosecution”. Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “You can have the rule of law, or you can defer to the powerful. But you can’t have both. Cressida Dick’s cat will know that multiple criminal offences were committed. It shames the Met, and ultimately all of us, that she refuses to investigate.” Police officers who saw laws broken while on guard duty at Downing Street would be expected to report it, the former Scotland Yard police chief Robert Quick said this week. He said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” Asked if officers could be told by their bosses to prioritise their protective duties and ignore the law, Quick said: “You could not give that advice to a police officer.” The Green party peer Lady Jones said the invitation to the May 2020 garden party, sent by Johnson’s top aide, Martin Reynolds, was troubling. “This garden party raises big questions for the Met police, as their officers must surely have monitored this gathering via their security cameras and been aware of the rules in place at the time,” she said. “The police are losing public trust with their attitude that there are lots of rules for us and no rules for Conservative ministers. Did Martin Reynolds consult with Met police officers about the Covid restrictions, or inform them of the event?”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/met-police-wont-investigate-alleged-no-10-lockdown-party;politics;health
1598;1598;1598;1598;1617;1617;Liverpool bomber had asylum claim rejected six years before attack;2022-01-24;['Josh Halliday'];['UK security and counter-terrorism', 'Liverpool', 'UK news'];The Liverpool bomber had an asylum claim rejected on multiple grounds six years before he attempted to detonate a homemade explosive outside a hospital, court documents show. Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, was killed when the bomb he was carrying exploded inside a taxi outside Liverpool women’s hospital on Remembrance Sunday last year. The Home Office twice rejected Swealmeen’s claims for asylum – once in 2014 and again in 2020 – and new details raise questions about why he was not pursued for deportation as long ago as 2015. Court documents obtained by BBC News show he claimed to be of Syrian heritage and in fear for his life, but was unable to give basic details about where his family lived or why they were in danger. Language analysis conducted by the Home Office concluded that there was a high likelihood that he was Iraqi and was “very unlikely” to be Syrian. Swealmeen travelled to the UK in 2014 on a genuine Jordanian passport, which gave his birthplace as Iraq and his date of birth as 11 October 1989. An immigration judge dismissed his asylum appeal in April 2015, writing in a ruling quoted by BBC News: “His account of his time in Syria gives the impression of someone quoting information that is in the public domain rather than having first-hand experience. “The appellant did not identify himself with any particular faction or indicate that he would be at risk other than in a general sense.” That ruling meant the Home Office had the green light to send Swealmeen back to Iraq or Jordan, as it had previously told him it would do. Instead, however, Swealmeen remained in the UK and is thought to have been moved to the Fazakerley area of Liverpool in late 2016. In 2017 he mounted a new asylum claim using a different name but that was rejected at the end of 2020, prompting another appeal in January 2021. Police believe that Swealmeen was plotting a terror attack by at least April 2021, when he rented a property and started buying parts needed for a bomb. Detectives believe it is most likely that he acted alone although counter-terrorism experts have said it is incredibly rare for someone to plan an atrocity for seven months without telling anyone. The case raises questions about why Swealmeen was not deported in 2015 when his first asylum appeal was rejected on several grounds, and he could have been spotted earlier as a danger to himself and others. The Home Office declined to comment on Swealmeen’s case but said: “We are fixing the broken asylum system. The ‘new plan for immigration’ will require people to raise all protection-related issues upfront to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/liverpool-bomber-emad-al-swealmeen-asylum-claim-rejected-before-attack;business and economy;politics
1276;1276;1276;1276;1291;1291;Rights groups call for statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Met;2022-01-25;['Damien Gayle'];['Metropolitan police', 'Gender', 'UK news', 'London', 'Police', 'Violence against women and girls'];"Women’s rights groups have called for a statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Metropolitan police after derogatory comments by officers about an academic while she was strip-searched showed how “deeply embedded” sexism is in the force. In CCTV footage published by the Guardian, police officers made disparaging remarks about Konstancja Duff while she was strip-searched at Stoke Newington police station. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was among the many people to express shock and outrage on Twitter, describing the incident as “disgraceful” and “strongly condemn[ing]” the officers’ behaviour and language.
On Tuesday, women’s rights campaigners said the episode was yet further evidence of institutional misogyny in the force. The Met has faced sexism scandals for decades but particularly in the nine months since Sarah Everard was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Wayne Couzens, an officer in an elite Met firearms unit. Anna Birley of Reclaim These Streets said the actions of the officers who strip-searched Duff, as well as the Met taking eight years to disclose the footage, “means this cannot be written off as yet another bad apple”. “By closing ranks to protect their own, and forcing Konstancja to have to fight so hard to simply get an apology, it’s clear that this is institutional, and as such amounts to nothing less than state-sanctioned sexual assault,” Birley said. “Misogyny in the Met police is systemic and cultural – and this is why we have been calling for the Wayne Couzens inquiry to be widened in scope and made statutory. Without this, we risk the Met yet again closing ranks, prioritising their own reputation over women’s safety and blaming a handful of named officers rather than the culture that created and protected them. “And in the meantime, the Met must urgently confirm that all officers involved will face robust and transparent disciplinary action – without this, how can women ever trust them?” Priti Patel, the home secretary, is facing a legal challenge over proposals for an inquiry into Couzens’ conduct as a police officer, with critics claiming it is too narrow in scope. The Centre for Women’s Justice began judicial review proceedings against her department in December, also calling for the inquiry to be put on a statutory basis. Duff’s case was a prime example of why that needed to happen, Debaleena Dasgupta, a solicitor with CWJ, said. Dasgupta added: “The CCTV footage in Dr Duff’s case shows how deeply embedded, and tolerated, sexism is in the Metropolitan police. A further question arises: why did it take so long for the police to provide that evidence, despite the earlier complaint proceedings? “This case will add to women’s mistrust in policing. It is another example of why, if Priti Patel is serious about restoring faith in the police, that her inquiry must be conducted on a statutory footing so it has the power to compel evidence and must be widened to look at all the relevant issues.” But for some campaigners, yet another inquiry into policing was not enough. Sasha McLean, of the activist group Sisters Uncut, said policing was a job that attracted and created people with “the proclivity for coercion and control”, and solving that required radical change. “We have to move beyond this idea that the police can somehow be reformed or changed internally, that if we just investigate and tinker around the edges we can make it slightly less sexist than it is already, because the issue is fundamental, it’s structural, it’s institutional, it has to do with the fact that police exist to coerce and control urban and working-class populations,” McLean said. “I’m not going to say that we don’t welcome scrutiny, but at the end of the day the investigation’s being conducted by the very people who rely on the police to protect their own power, so this investigation is hardly going to reveal that the police has got an institutional, fundamental problem that perhaps require a complete reworking and abolition of the institution.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/rights-groups-call-for-statutory-inquiry-into-misogyny-in-the-met;environment;politics
325;325;325;325;331;331;Out with Towie as Essex tries to shed its brash image;2022-01-30;['Tim Burrows'];['Essex', 'Gentrification', 'The Only Way is Essex', 'UK news', 'Society'];"What is it with Essex and makeovers? It was reported that the county council is to invest more than £300,000 to put its best face on and “challenge people’s preconceived ideas of how they see Essex on TV”. Council bosses wanted to banish thoughts of The Only Way Is Essex, fake tan and fast cars synonymous with the south of the county, replacing them with the Constable-country vistas, windmills and nice thatched cottages of north Essex. We’ve been here before. The council’s drive to combat the Essex stereotype is almost as old as the stereotype itself. In 1997, moves to improve the county’s image were reported in the national press. “Difficulties arise when overseas investors come to the UK, go to competitor locations, and hear jokes about Essex girls having more shoes than books,” said the head of the Essex Economic Partnership, Terry Conder. The council said it often received letters from residents about Essex’s reputation. As the new millennium arrived, Essex asked the government for permission to spend council tax payers’ money on improving its image and the council started its “Real Essex” tourism campaign. It spent £100,000 on a drive that claimed Essex was, borrowing from the old Mars bar adverts, the place to “work, play and rest”. Like today, they wanted to draw attention to Constable and quaint villages.
As with most disquieting elements of British discourse, Essex’s reputation was partly a creation of the rightwing press. Essex man was invented in 1990 via an anonymously published Sunday Telegraph editorial by Simon Heffer. The High Tory columnist grew up watching a new town, South Woodham Ferrers, being built on the edge of marshland downhill from his village. It soon filled up with Cockney emigres. West Ham United usurped the local passion for cricket. After a chance encounter with a loutish, Essex-based City worker on a train into Liverpool Street, he exacted revenge through a gross caricature depicting vomiting at the station. Heffer and other Conservatives didn’t hate Essex man, however. After all, he was the future of the party, and typified the age of upward mobility. His invention was useful for the Tories as it claimed working-class social mobility exclusively for Thatcherism, rather than it being part of a longer process you could trace back to the rise of Keir Hardie and Labour in metropolitan Essex in the late 19th century. The editorial freely admitted, too, that Essex was more an ideal than a location bound by geography: “For spiritual purposes, Essex is to be found all over the newly affluent parts of the outer London suburbs.” Essex man’s less industrious and more materialistic counterpart, Essex girl, soon formed part of the repertoire, rubber-stamped when the Ilford-born Sun journalist Richard Littlejohn ghost-wrote a grim little tome of misogynistic jokes, largely about the promiscuity of women half his age. The power of the Essex girl gave journalists the licence to pry into the sex lives of very young, even underage, girls.
So, does the council have a point? Essex, after all, was the fifth least popular English county, according to a YouGov poll in 2018. Kent, our neighbour just over the estuary from where I live in Southend, is frequently near the top of most-visited lists, Essex languishes nearer the bottom. Yet, in making this all about image, the council is ignoring other factors. Essex is still agricultural and, despite the excellent walks along its many public footpaths, much of its countryside is earmarked for private use. Thanks to its proximity to London, much of south Essex is either residential land or green belt. People still flock to Southend and Clacton on bank holidays but, more than tourism, Essex is a success story about the idea of making a home, from the postwar plotland dreamers building in former farmers’ fields to the influx of Eastenders to new towns such as Harlow and Basildon. Essex was inundated by the North Sea flood of 1953, with scores of casualties, and today great concrete sea walls keep the tide at bay in places such as Canvey Island. It is as if the council is following suit, building bigger and bigger defences to keep out the tide of representations. In truth, the stereotype is being eroded by the passage of time. The term Essex girl was taken out of the Oxford Dictionary in 2020. Essex man, so characterised by his daily commute to the City, has had to diversify into home working since the pandemic started. There is no “Real Essex” to be unearthed if we can just crack through the veneer of the mediated, overdone, “fake” Essex of TV lore. Because – and can I just shock you – I have seen Botox fillers in Constable country, too.

289;289;289;289;295;295;‘It’s upset a lot of people’: outrage after tidy-up of Scottish sacred well;2022-01-30;['Libby Brooks'];['Scotland', 'Heritage', 'UK news', 'Culture'];"At the end of a steep woodland trail, surrounded by sturdy beech and ash trees, a freshwater spring bubbles into a basic stone well, rippling in the low winter sunlight. On nearby branches and around the mouth of the well colourful cloth rags – or cloots – have been hung by visitors, as an offering to a water spirit or local saint and an entreaty to be healed. The clootie well near Munlochy, a village on the Black Isle peninsula across the Beauly Firth from Inverness, is a place of traditional pilgrimage and modern curiosity. It is also now a cause of community consternation, after a well-meaning stranger cleared away many of the offerings.
“I’m sure the person who cleared up thought they were doing something good,” says Claire Mackay, a herbalist who lives on the Black Isle, “but the fact they took it upon themselves, weren’t a local and did it without the permission of Forestry and Land Scotland [which manages the site] has upset a lot of people.” Some neighbours have fulminated on the community Facebook page – even suggesting the individual may henceforth be cursed for “desecrating” the sacred site – while others acknowledge the site was already in need of attention before the offerings were swiped last weekend.
The well had gathered an accumulation of eccentric offerings during lockdown, including bras, pants and a hi-vis jacket. The damage wrought by Storm Arwen in late November also blew down many of the cloot-covered branches.
Verity Walker, a local author and heritage consultant, can remember the “clootie trees” being trimmed or cleared when she passed the well as a child. It is an ancient tradition that now coexists alongside modern faiths, she says. “When my daughter injured her foot, I hung a sock – it has to be biodegradable and related to the part of the body that you want to recover.” Mackay is optimistic that the initial outrage can be channelled into a more organised approach to maintaining the site. “The clean-up should have been a community decision,” she says. “But now we can treat it as a clean slate and hope it has planted that seed about the need for people to leave more natural things.” Paul Hibberd, a regional visitor services manager for Forestry and Land Scotland, points out that there is already signage asking people to leave “only small, biodegradable offerings” at the well. Local rangers visit regularly to tidy and “remove the most inappropriate items”, he adds, but staff are aware this is a site that “people feel a very strong connection with”. The build-up of debris “also highlights how much plastic is in modern clothes”, Hibberd adds. “That’s part of the problem with items not breaking down.”
Clootie wells, which are also found in Cornwall and Ireland, date far back into pre-Christian times and the practice of leaving votives and offerings for spirits in wells and springs. The healing well at Munlochy has been linked to Saint Boniface, who worked as a missionary in Scotland around AD620, and is probably an example of early Christianity absorbing more ancient Celtic traditions. Pilgrims performed a ceremony that involved circling the well three times before splashing some of its water on the ground and saying a prayer. They would then tie a piece of cloth that had been in contact with the ill person to a nearby tree and, as the rag rotted away, so that person would be healed. There are plans for a community group to care for the area on a regular basis, with more than a hundred local people already expressing an interest. Mackay has plans for storytelling at the well and input from local historians, as well as outreach into schools to explain to children how to leave votives and cloots without harming the environment. “It’s a symbolic act,” says Walker, “an act of meditation and connection, an act of faith even if you’re not sure what you have faith in, and that’s only to be encouraged.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/30/upset-a-lot-of-people-outrage-tidy-up-of-scottish-sacred-well-clootie-offerings;environment;entertainment and culture
3831;3831;3831;3831;3872;3872;‘The system took my brother’: family demands answers in LA jail death;2022-01-13;['Sam Levin'];['Los Angeles', 'US prisons', 'US news', 'California', 'US policing'];"The family of Jalani Lovett, a 27-year-old who died in a Los Angeles jail last year, is demanding that the county sheriff’s department be held accountable and authorities release more information about the final moments of his life. Lovett died in solitary confinement in Men’s Central jail in downtown LA on 22 September. The county coroner released an autopsy report on Tuesday saying Lovett’s death was “accidental” and that he had fentanyl and heroin in his system. But Lovett’s mother and siblings, who have been fighting for months to get basic information from authorities about what led to his death, are left with major questions about the case. If Lovett died from an overdose, how did he access fentanyl while in solitary confinement? What were the actions of guards on duty that night, in a jail with a history of mistreatment? And why did it take so long for the coroner to produce the autopsy report, which the county sent to a reporter this week before the family obtained it? “I’m a grieving mother, but I’m also an angry mother,” Terry Lovett, 65, told the Guardian this week in an interview from her home in Oakland. She said the sheriff’s department, which runs the jail, had repeatedly ignored her family’s pleas for answers: “They have no regard for human life.”
“I want the truth to come out,” she added. “To me, this was murder. They killed my son.” Christian Contreras, a local civil rights attorney, filed a claim against the county on behalf of the family on Wednesday, the first step in a lawsuit, alleging “negligence causing wrongful death”, “deliberate indifference” in violation of the 14th amendment, an “inhumane killing” and more. A long wait for answers: ‘What are they hiding?’ Jalani Lovett, one of six siblings, grew up in east Oakland. He excelled at basketball and baseball as a teenager and won a poetry medal in school, his mother said. He was an aspiring rapper and a family man who was close with his nieces and nephews.
He ended up at Men’s Central jail in September 2019 for a second-degree robbery charge, and his mother said he had been held in solitary confinement in the months before his death. A sheriff’s spokesperson told the Guardian he was in a “one-man cell” and was not there for disciplinary reasons. Terry Lovett said a detective in the sheriff’s homicide bureau informed her on the morning of 23 September that her son “was found dead” in his cell at 10pm the previous night. The official added that authorities had found “drug paraphernalia” in her son’s cell, she recalled, but said the investigation was ongoing. The family received little information from officials in the following weeks, they said. One investigator initially told Terry it could take eight months for her to get an official report, she recalled.
About a month after the death, the family obtained photos from the coroner’s office showing Jalani’s body shortly after he died, which they believed showed signs of bruising and other possible injuries. Fueling their concerns further was a long history of scandals at the Men’s Central jail, with controversies including corruption and obstruction of justice cases and documented evidence of widespread abuse of incarcerated people. Jalani was housed in a section of the jail, the 3000 block, where guards have long been accused of being part of a “deputy gang” called the 3000 Boys, known for allegedly using excessive force. Vanessa Carter, one of Jalani’s sisters, said she talked had with her brother hours before his death and overheard him get into an argument with a guard, which also made the family suspicious. Combined with the photos and lack of information, the family questioned whether guards had beaten Jalani. Jalani’s official death certificate, issued a month after his death, listed his cause of death as “deferred”, meaning the medical examiner’s investigation was ongoing. It also listed the time of death as four hours earlier than what Terry was initially told, according to her records. The coroner’s report, released this week, noted he had a bruise on his neck and abrasions on his arms, but said there was “no external trauma” or “life-threatening injuries”. The report said deputies had found him unresponsive in his cell and issued Narcan and CPR. Lt Brandon Dean of the sheriff’s department told the Guardian that there were no signs Jalani had an altercation with guards, and that there was “nothing out of the ordinary” in his death. He declined to answer questions about how Jalani could have accessed fentanyl. Asked about the 3000 Boys, Dean declined to comment, saying it was not relevant to the case. The coroner’s report said the autopsy had been conducted on 28 September, one week after Jalani’s death. Contreras said he had filed a request for records in November, seeking footage, reports and the identity of the involved deputies, but had received no response. The coroner’s office sent the Guardian a copy of the autopsy on Tuesday before the attorney or Terry Lovett had seen it.
The family said they were skeptical of the coroner’s report. “There are too many inconsistencies. What is being hidden?” Lovett said after receiving the report. She said she planned to have an independent medical examiner review the records. ‘I want to stop this from happening to others’ Contreras lamented the lack of transparency in the case, which he said was common in jail deaths: “When someone in their own custody dies in highly suspicious circumstances, as opposed to meeting with the family and providing answers, the sheriff’s department advances further secrecy.” Carter, Jalani’s sister, said she believed deputies should face charges for her brother’s death: “They are supposed to ‘protect and serve’ and take care of people. We should not be scared of them, and they should be accountable for their actions, just like we are for ours.” She added that she wanted her brother to be remembered as a loyal family man who taught her son, now 14, how to walk and play basketball.
Ladell Dickerson, Jalani’s older brother, said that regardless of the cause of death, the county was to blame: “This is negligence. He was in their custody. He was under the authority of the sheriff. He was not in jail with a death sentence, but somebody in that jail either killed him or allowed him to die.” At a protest outside the jail on what would have been Jalani’s 28th birthday this week, Michelle Lovett, another sister, wished her brother a happy birthday, adding: “The system took my brother, but they will not take our right to know the truth.” Terry Lovett also lodged a complaint with the office of inspector general in November, but has not heard back. She said she was not confident that she would get justice for her son in LA county, but that she would keep fighting. She said she now spent most days trying to get information on the case: “I know I can’t bring my son back, but I want to stop this from happening to somebody else’s child.” In Terry’s final call with her son, Jalani was in a good mood, she said. He heard he would be transferring soon to state prison to finish his sentence. He was looking forward to leaving the jail, she said, and getting one step closer to coming home.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/jalani-lovett-la-jail-death;health;politics

They were all put up for auction by the former first lady – and as of early Wednesday, failed to rake in the target price of a $250,000 opening bid. Trump announced earlier this month that she would auction off the autographed hat, which she wore to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife during an official state visit in 2018. The auction also included a watercolor painting of herself wearing the hat and a non-fungible token, or NFT, of the painting. She insisted that all bids be made in Solana tokens, a cryptocurrency. When the auction concluded on Wednesday there were only five bids on the items, each around the minimum requirement of 1,800 Solana tokens. Although the minimum number of tokens was met, a steep dive in the crypto market over the last two weeks resulted in the final bid being approximately $170,000 – about $80,000 short of the opening bid threshold. “The auction winner will receive a personalized letter from Mrs. Trump, accompanying the hat and watercolor on paper and certifying authenticity. The NFT will be minted on the Solana Blockchain,” said a statement released earlier this month from the Office of Melania Trump. It said a “portion” of the proceeds derived from the auction would be given to provide people “who have been in the foster care community with access to computer science and technology education”. The auction collection, named “Head of State”, marks Trump’s second high-profile venture into NFTs and cryptocurrency. In December, she put up for sale an NFT titled Melania’s Vision: a watercolor painting of her eyes.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/melania-trump-auction-nft-hat-painting;business and economy;politics
5944;5944;5944;1663;6016;6016;New studies reinforce belief that Omicron is less likely to damage lungs;2022-01-02;['James Tapper'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Microbiology'];"A growing body of evidence indicates that the Omicron Covid variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Six studies – four published since Christmas Eve – have found that Omicron does not damage people’s lungs as much as the Delta and other previous variants of Covid. The studies have yet to be peer-reviewed by other scientists. “The result of all the mutations that make Omicron different from previous variants is that it may have altered its ability to infect different sorts of cells,” said Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at University College London. “In essence, it looks to be more able to infect the upper respiratory tract – cells in the throat. So it would multiply in cells there more readily than in cells deep in the lung. This is really preliminary but the studies point in the same direction.” If the virus replicates more in the throat, that makes it more transmissible, which would help to explain the rapid spread of Omicron. A virus that is good at infecting lung tissue, on the other hand, will be potentially more dangerous but less transmissible. Researchers from the University of Liverpool’s Molecular Virology Research Group published a pre-print on Boxing Day that shows Omicron leading to “less severe disease” in mice, according to Prof James Stewart. The paper showed that mice infected with Omicron lose less weight, have lower viral loads and experience less- severe pneumonia. “It’s one piece of the jigsaw,” he said. “The animal model does suggest that the disease is less severe than Delta and the original Wuhan virus. It seems to get cleared faster and the animals recovered more rapidly, and that ties in with clinical data coming through. “The early indications are that it’s good news, but that’s not a signal to drop our guard, because if you’re clinically vulnerable, the consequences are still not great – there are deaths from Omicron. Not everyone can rip their masks off and party.” The Neyts Lab at Leuven University in Belgium found similar results in Syrian hamsters, with a lower viral load in the lungs compared with other variants. Prof Johan Neyts said this may be because the virus was better at infecting humans than hamsters, or that it was more likely to infect the upper respiratory tract, or that it provoked less-severe disease.
A further pre-print, submitted to Nature last week by researchers in the US, also found that mice with Omicron lost less weight and had a lower viral load. And researchers at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research have found evidence that Omicron has changed the way it enters the body. Omicron was substantially likely to evade the immunity of people who had had two doses of the vaccine, but a booster dose gave a “partial restoration of immunity”. The slew of Christmas research builds on a study from the University of Hong Kong last month showing less Omicron infection in the lungs, and on research led by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge, whose team investigated blood samples from vaccinated patients. They found Omicron able to evade vaccines, but less able to enter lung cells. The latest scientific research comes amid a debate about how best to carry out home-testing. Last week, some scientists suggested that lateral flow tests (LFTs) might be more accurate if people took swabs from the throat as well as the nose. Prof Jennifer Rohn at University College London said that her experience of using LFTs was that she had tested negative using nose swabs but positive when taking a sample from her throat. That seemed to be supported by a study from South Africa showing that saliva samples subjected to PCR tests were better than nasal swabs at detecting Omicron. However, Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said the study was not significant enough for conclusions to be drawn. “This is a small study on acutely symptomatic, non-hospitalised patients. On the one hand it confirms previous studies indicating that salivary testing could be useful as a more easily performed sampling approach. I don’t think this study is significant enough to conclude anything about the behaviour of Omicron.” The UK Health Security Agency said there was no indication that rapid tests differed in their ability to detect the Omicron or Delta variants, although the tests were continuously monitored by researchers. “All lateral flow devices used by NHS Test and Trace have gone through rigorous validation and are proven to be highly effective at detecting Covid-19 in people,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently seeing high numbers of positive lateral flow device tests reported. This means we are detecting tens of thousands of cases that might otherwise have gone undetected.” • This article was amended on 3 January 2022 because an earlier version said: “If the virus produces more cells in the throat, that makes it more transmissible ...”.

Robert Etheridge, also known as DJ Dimension, arrived in New Zealand on 16 December and spent seven days in one of the country’s managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities, where he returned three negative Covid test results, Stuff reported.
After leaving MIQ he was required to spend three days in home isolation but did not wait to receive a negative day-nine test – as also required – before entering the community. According to the ministry, he visited a series of venues in Auckland over two days including nightclubs, a shopping precinct and restaurants before receiving a positive test result on 27 December and being returned to MIQ. Etheridge, who had been due to play at the Rhythm and Alps festival near Wanaka last week, apologised to “those who I have inadvertently put at risk as a result of my misunderstandings”. “I realise the gravity of the situation and I am deeply regretful to those who have been impacted.” In an earlier statement he said: “After completing my 10-day isolation, and of the understanding that I had completed my quarantine, I entered the community. To my shock and enormous concern, I unexpectedly received a positive test on day 12, two days after my isolation period had ended.” His case triggered outrage in New Zealand, which has frequently been praised for its pandemic response and which only recently lifted lockdown restrictions on Auckland, its largest city, after a Delta outbreak. Despite identifying dozens of close contacts, the ministry said on Monday that none had so far tested positive for the virus.

5693;5693;5693;1412;5763;5763;When will Omicron peak in the UK and is the modelling wrong?;2022-01-03;['Linda Geddes'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Science', 'UK news'];"The family gatherings have disbanded, the new year’s hangovers have lifted. Despite record Covid infection figures over the holiday period, evidence that the rate of increase in cases may be slowing has prompted speculation that London, at least, may be close to reaching “peak Omicron”. Boris Johnson is said to be obsessed with this hypothetical time point, seeing it as crucial to how the Covid variant may play out nationwide. If hospitalisations follow the same trajectory and peak without the NHS being overwhelmed, the prime minister’s decision not to impose lockdown-style restrictions before the holiday period may be vindicated. Johnson is correct that peak Omicron, when it comes, will be an important moment. “The reason it matters when it peaks – and particularly when cases peak in the over-50s – is it’s likely that a week later we’ll see the peak in hospitalisations, and roughly two weeks later, we’ll see a peak in the number of deaths. It’s helpful, because it helps us to plan ahead,” said Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge’s MRC epidemiology unit.
In London, cases appear to have stabilised, or even fallen during the past two weeks. New hospitalisations also appear to have stabilised in recent days, with 319 people admitted with Covid-19 on 31 December, compared with 450 the day before, and 511 the day before that. “We would guess, based on what case numbers are doing in London, that the peak in hospital admissions should be this week, and nationally, maybe a week later,” Ali said. This is roughly in line with the scenarios outlined in modelling studies, which suggest Omicron cases will peak in early-mid January. However, the magnitude of the peak appears to be significantly lower than some of the worst case scenarios predicted. For instance, according to modelling data published by the University of Warwick on 30 December, hospital admissions should by now be approaching about 5,000 a day in England. Yet, according to the latest figures, the number of Covid-19 patients admitted on 1 January was 1,819, down from 2,370 three days earlier.
This does not necessarily mean we should disregard such models, as some hawkish MPs have suggested. Ali said: “Modelling, post-vaccination has become extremely difficult. And trying to predict people’s behaviour, well, they don’t even try to include that in the models, so, inevitably, they’re not going to be able to predict what’s going to happen. “Instead, they give a variety of scenarios, which are necessary because we have to have some idea of the range of possibilities. But when the range is so wide, it doesn’t really help policymakers, because the difference between 100 deaths a day and 6,000 deaths a day is just so huge.” Although the gloomiest predictions may have not come to pass, experts caution that we are not out of the woods yet. Some of the slowing could be a reflection of altered behaviour in the run-up to Christmas, when concern about escalating Omicron cases and a desire to spend the festive period with older relatives prompted many to scale back social activities and behave more cautiously. They may also have been less likely to get tested in the run-up to Christmas – assuming they could access a test. Now Christmas is over, some of us may have relaxed our behaviour. Whether we will see a surge in cases as a result of new year’s celebrations will not become apparent for about another week, as it takes five to six days on average after exposure to the virus for symptoms to develop, and then a further couple of days for people to seek a test and receive the results.
The return of children to schools this week – many of whom remain unvaccinated – may also lead to a surge in cases owing to increased mixing. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The Warwick model suggested that cases would peak early January. But it is still impossible to say. We will probably only really know in retrospect a couple of weeks later. “What we can say is that the rate of increase has slowed dramatically for early mid-December, otherwise we would be seeing several millions of infections a day by now and that would have been impossible.” “Taking all this together, I don’t think we have peaked yet, but I think we are not that far away – or at least I hope so,” he added. A further fly in the ointment is that younger age groups accounted for the majority of Omicron cases during early-mid December, but increased intergenerational mixing over Christmas could yet trigger a surge of infections in older adults. Also, because Omicron is better at infecting people who have been vaccinated than Delta, proportionately more vulnerable older people are likely to fall ill.
The good news is that most of these people have now received a booster dose, and their levels of immune protection should remain high for a few months yet – though we will not yet know whether they will require yet another dose. The ramped-up booster programme has been under way for several weeks, meaning many younger individuals should also soon have additional layer of immune protection, if not already. The combination of this vaccine-induced protection and so many people having been infected means we will eventually we will hit peak Omicron, after which cases should begin to fall. This will be cause for celebration, but for as long as significant numbers of people around the world remain unvaccinated, the global death toll from Covid will continue to rise, and the chances of further variants emerging will remain. So, although the battle with Omicron may be beginning to turn in the UK’s favour, the wider war against coronavirus continues.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/when-will-omicron-peak-in-uk-and-is-the-modelling-wrong;science and technology;health
5172;5172;5172;891;5232;5232;The Afghan judge working to free her sisters left behind;2022-01-06;['Diane Taylor'];['Afghanistan', 'Immigration and asylum', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Taliban'];"Just under three weeks before the Taliban reached Kabul and took control of Afghanistan, 50 of the most powerful women in the country gathered outdoors in a shady spot to discuss how to deal with the approaching danger. Wearing colourful headscarves, some took notes while others listened intently to Fawzia, 48, one of the most senior female judges in Afghanistan. Holding a microphone, she spoke with urgency about the advancing threat and the need to protect the rights that female lawyers, women’s rights activists and journalists had spent decades fighting for. But they had no idea quite how quickly their precious freedoms were going to be lost. Fawzia and her family escaped from Afghanistan via Tbilisi, Georgia, after the main Operation Pitting airlifts had concluded. They are now being accommodated in a hotel in London under Arap, the UK government’s Afghan relocations and assistance policy.
Unlike asylum seekers, the Afghan families are treated more like tourists or business travellers. They are also not constrained by burly security guards standing with folded arms in front of the hotel entrance. Fawzia, her lawyer husband and their four children – aged 18, 16, 11 and nine – say they are very grateful for the sanctuary that has been offered them, and the British government has been very kind. But they do not know what the future holds. Like other Afghans brought to safety, they have been granted six months’ leave to remain in the UK. Details of what will happen after that are not known. Fawzia is energetically networking with other female Afghan judges and human rights defenders in exile, along with prominent female lawyers in the UK such as Helena Kennedy, to try to secure a safe exit for those who have not yet managed to escape. She is becoming increasingly anxious about the female judges still stranded in Afghanistan. She believes that while hundreds have escaped, 93 remain there. “The situation for these women is getting worse all the time,” she says. News that eligibility criteria for the Arap scheme are tightening fills her with dread, and she is urging international governments to do more to rescue women still in hiding in her home country. “We must ensure they can be brought to safety.” Fawzia says she has parents to thank for inspiring her to aim high and fight for what she believes in. Her father was a successful scientist with his own factory and the family lived in a large and comfortable home in Kabul. “When the Taliban was in control of everything the first time in the 1990s I did not leave our home for five years. It was a dark and sad time – women and girls lost all their rights,” she says. “I spent my time studying and growing vegetables like tomatoes and peppers in the garden.” Her parents emphasised the importance of girls getting a good education and a career. “By the time I was eight or nine years old I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,” she says. “My mother’s advice to me for when I was grown up was: stand on your own two feet, don’t stand on your husband’s feet.” After qualifying as a judge, Fawzia worked with her government’s ministry of women’s affairs and introduced groundbreaking protections for women and girls including safe houses for women so they could escape from violent husbands, and protections against forced and child marriages. Although life in Kabul after the Americans and the British drove the Taliban out after 9/11 offered more opportunities to women, things were still very dangerous for women like Fawzia who challenged the status quo. “All the time I was in danger in my work,” she says. “And so were the women I was trying to help. One time a violent man came to the court with a gun to shoot his wife who was trying to get justice for things he had done to her. As he pointed the gun at his wife I hit his hands to direct the gun away from his wife. The bullet missed her and she survived.
“Another time I was in the car with one of my children who was just six months old. Some people tried to kidnap my baby. I hid her under the seat to save her. “Everything is lost for women in Afghanistan,” she says. “The situation for them is much worse now than it was soon after the Taliban took over.” She is determined to continue raising her voice for her sisters who are in peril just as she did in Afghanistan. Her focus is on building the international network to support the women left behind. For her family’s future in London she is hopeful and optimistic. “In Kabul we lived in a big house. But now it doesn’t matter if we have a big house or a small house. For the first time since the Taliban took over Afghanistan I felt safe and slept well when we arrived in the UK. Here we can start again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/the-afghan-judge-working-to-free-her-sisters-left-behind;business and economy;politics
4566;4566;4566;285;4622;4622;No 10 partying in lockdown: who enjoyed what and when;2022-01-09;['Rowena Mason', 'Aubrey Allegretti'];['Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'Boris Johnson', 'Christmas', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Dominic Cummings', 'Gavin Williamson'];15 May 2020 Sources told the Guardian there was a “wine and pizza” party in the Downing Street garden and inside No 10 during the first lockdown when socialising was banned. It is understood to have taken place after a press conference, and was described as having had a celebratory feel with drinking late into the evening. After No 10 denied this, a photograph was obtained by the Guardian showing Boris Johnson, his wife and two officials at a table with wine and cheese, with another 15 officials in the rest of the garden with wine bottles visible. No 10 says Johnson had been having a work meeting and went up to his flat with his family just after 7pm that evening. 20 May 2020 Dominic Cummings lifted the lid on a May gathering in the Downing Street garden, with invites to a “social distanced drinks”, which is believed to have been organised by the civil servant Martin Reynolds. No 10 has not denied that Johnson and his wife attended, with reports of food on tables and drinking. Restrictions on social mixing were still in place at this point. 13 November – Boris and Carrie Johnson flat party This is the date that Johnson’s chief adviser, Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles. Sources have reported loud music and sounds of a party coming from the flat occupied by Johnson and his wife on this date. Cummings has alleged there had been “other flat parties” and suggested the pair’s “bubble” policy should be investigated. Asked if a party went ahead in his flat on 13 November, Johnson said: “No.” 27 November – Downing Street leaving do While England was still in the grip of its second national lockdown, a leaving do was organised in No 10 – said to have been for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Cummings. A source told the Guardian that Johnson had personally attended and given a speech, remarking on how full with people the room was, before leaving to continue working. 10 December – Gavin Williamson’s staff party When London was in tier 2, which only allowed socialising in groups of six outside, the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, threw a party in his Whitehall department. The most senior civil servant in the department, Susan Acland-Hood, attended and admitted that there had been a “work-related” gathering hosted in the canteen. She did not dispute people had been drinking wine, and appeared to blame Williamson for instigating the event. She recalled he had wanted to “say a few words” to thank staff after a difficult year. 17 December A quiz was held for members of the private office of Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, who was originally meant to be investigating the reports of parties in No 10. Invitations were sent out titled “Christmas Party!” and about 15 people were thought to be in attendance over Zoom. Responding to the claims, a government spokesperson said it was a virtual quiz with a small number of people from the office taking part from their desks. “The cabinet secretary played no part in the event, but walked through the team’s office on the way to his own office. No outside guests or other staff were invited or present. This lasted for an hour and drinks and snacks were bought by those attending. He also spoke briefly to staff in the office before leaving.” 18 December 2020 – Downing Street Christmas party A party was held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events, according to multiple sources after the Daily Mirror first broke the story. Several dozen people – a mix of civil servants and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. While Johnson’s spokesperson insisted no rules had been broken and then denied any party took place, a video filmed four days after the event was published by ITV. The leaked footage showed Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then aide, rehearsing for televised press conferences and laughing and joking with aides about a party on 18 December. Stratton all but confirmed the event had taken place by laughing it off as a “business meeting” but added: “It was not socially distanced.” 15 December 2020 – a festive No 10 quiz A Christmas quiz was also organised for No 10 staff, with invitations emailed to everyone who worked in the building. Some guests were said to have dialled in by Zoom but others apparently attended in person and sat in groups of six, some wearing Christmas jumpers. A photograph later emerged in the Mirror of the prime minister taking part. 25 December 2020 – Christmas Day socialising The prime minister’s “bubble” has come under scrutiny before, after his spokesperson did not deny that Nimco Ali, a close friend of Carrie Johnson, stayed with them over Christmas. One of the explanations offered was that Ali was considered part of the Johnsons’ childcare bubble. However, under the rules, the arrangement was meant to be purely for a second household to look after children, with the adults not meant to be socialising.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/no-10-partying-in-lockdown-who-enjoyed-what-and-when;politics;health
4098;4098;4098;4098;4141;4141;Omicron dims optimism as South America enters pandemic’s third year;2022-01-12;['Tom Phillips', 'Uki Goñi'];['Americas', 'World news', 'Brazil', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Argentina'];"As the pandemic’s second, gruelling year drew to a close and Covid rates in Rio de Janeiro plunged to levels unseen since it began, the Brazilian city’s health secretary, Daniel Soranz, celebrated a desperately needed respite. “We’ve been through such painful, difficult months … this is now a moment of hope,” the 42-year-old doctor said last November as carioca life regained some semblance of normality, hospitals emptied and the city’s effervescent cultural scene was reborn.
But the new year, and the arrival of the highly contagious Omicron variant, has brought Soranz and many others crashing back down to Earth as coronavirus cases surge across Latin America with consequences that remain unclear. “It’s really tiring,” Soranz admitted this week as infections in his beachside city soared to their highest ever levels and plans for Rio’s rumbustious annual carnival were cast into doubt. “This pandemic has been going on for almost two years. It’s exhausting. But there’s nothing to be done,” Soranz said, noting how 20% of Rio’s health workers – about 5,000 people – had been infected since December. Similar angst is being voiced around South America, which, having witnessed some of the pandemic’s bleakest moments – with bodies dumped in mass graves and patients starved of oxygen in overwhelmed hospitals – had been enjoying a long-awaited moment of optimism after becoming one of the world vaccination champions. Nearly 65% of South Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project, compared with about 62% in Europe and the US, and less than 10% in Africa. So far Argentina seems to be the South American country worst hit by Omicron. Over the last week it registered over 50% of South America’s daily cases, with just 11% of its population, and had the world’s seventh-highest number of daily cases. Although cases are rising in a straight line from a daily average of about 2,400 a month ago to more than 130,000 now, authorities say they are not unduly worried. Their assumption is that Covid has become an endemic disease and vaccination is the only necessary safeguard. The government is relaxing restrictions even more than last September when restaurants, football matches and entertainment venues reopened after a sharp dip in cases, and the outdoor mask mandate was lifted. “In the evolution of the disease you can see that it is really like chickenpox, the flu or that type of disease. The transition to the endemic will no longer require testing all cases and the role of isolation will change,” the health minister, Carla Vizzotti, told journalists on Tuesday. Health official Sandra Tirado predicted cases could begin to fall in the next two weeks and pointed to Córdoba province where Omicron infections were already coming down.
Arnaldo Dubin, an ICU doctor at a private Buenos Aires hospital, said he had deep misgivings about Argentina’s Covid policy and believed mask mandates had to return. “It’s horrifying. You have a very serious Covid situation that is paradoxically simultaneous with a total relaxation of safeguards.” Peru, which has one of the world’s worst per-capita death tolls, is also suffering, with more confirmed infections in the first week of January than during its ferocious second wave in early 2021. Other South American countries including Bolivia, Guyana and Uruguay have also seen infections jump while further north, Omicron appears to be rattling Mexico. On Saturday, a record 30,671 coronavirus cases were registered. On Monday, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced he had tested positive for the second time in a year and was isolating. “I think it’s the flu,” López Obrador, whose dismissive handling of the pandemic has been criticised, had told a press conference earlier in the day. He appeared without a mask despite admitting feeling hoarse. Brazil, which was already facing a major influenza outbreak, is also under pressure although a statistics blackout apparently caused by a hacking attack on the health ministry is hampering efforts to track the surge. Isaac Schrarstzhaupt, a data scientist who monitors Covid statistics, said Brazil was clearly careening into a new wave, with states such as Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo seeing a “vertiginous increase” in infections similar to that in Europe. “But [because of the blackout] we don’t know the scale of it and I fear we’ll only understand when hospitals start raising their hands to say: ‘Hey, we’re in trouble over here.’” Schrarstzhaupt warned: “Even if there’s a 95% reduction in severe cases, if we hit one million cases a day like the US, the remaining 5% will still be a very big number.” Rio’s health secretary said there was no doubt Omicron was driving a major Covid outbreak there. It had taken Omicron just 17 days to become Rio’s dominant variant, responsible for more than 98% of cases. Previous variants took more than 45 days to do the same. Soranz voiced apprehension about the coming days and could not confirm February’s carnival would go ahead. However, high vaccination levels seemed to be helping prevent a more dramatic crisis – as appears also to be the case in neighbours such as Peru and Argentina, and European countries such as Portugal. Ninety-six per cent of Rio’s adults have been double jabbed and 32% boosted. Soranz said 13 Covid patients were admitted on Sunday: 11 unvaccinated and two with only one shot. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen – but we can see it’s spreading much faster and that this is not being accompanied by severe cases or fatalities,” Soranz said, before adding a word of caution: “This could change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/south-america-covid-omicron-brazil-argentina;environment;health
3846;3846;3846;3846;3887;3887;Same-sex couple become first in Taiwan to legally adopt child;2022-01-13;['Helen Davidson'];['Taiwan', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Adoption', 'Children', 'Society'];"A married same-sex couple have become the first in Taiwan to legally adopt a child neither of them are related to, after they challenged local laws in court. Wang Chen-wei, Chen Chun-ju, and their daughter, nicknamed Joujou, were surrounded by press at the Taipei household registration office, as the couple formally signed adoption paperwork after a long battle. Clutching Joujou, her face hidden behind a hoodie, face mask and sunglasses, Wang and Chen told of their bittersweet victory. “I have everything now. I am married and just like heterosexual couples, we can have our own children,” Wang said. “But we were born to have and enjoy all of this, we are not a charity case. We shouldn’t have had to fight for it.” Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019, becoming the first jurisdiction in Asia to do so, but did not remove all inequalities for LGBTQI people. Full legislation rather than an amendment was passed. It includes a provision that allows someone to adopt a spouse’s biological child, but says nothing about adoption rights if neither partner is the biological parent. The provision does not exist in other marriage laws. The result is that in Taiwan any single person can apply to adopt a child, and any married heterosexual couple can apply together. But for married same-sex couple, the only option is to divorce and one of the couple adopts as a single person. They can then remarry, but current law does not allow the partner to adopt and be registered as a parent, leaving them without equal rights. “Gay adoptive families are forced to choose between children and spouses, and between adoption and marriage,” Chen and Wang wrote on Facebook shortly after signing the adoption papers.
Wang and Chen have been together for more than 16 years, and embarked on the adoption journey together. They delayed their marriage in order to complete Wang’s adoption of Joujou, and then took the case to court to have Chen recognised as a parent. On 25 December, the Kaohsiung juvenile and family court ruled that a child should not be discriminated against because of their parents status, and that the law did not expressly prohibit the adoption of adopted children. The ruling allowed Chen to adopt Joujou and be registered as a parent alongside Wang. Chu Chiajong, the director of advocacy organisation Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy, said the ruling was “brave”, in that the judge found his legal obligation was governed by the child’s best interest, and upon assessing Wang and Chen’s case, it meant the two parents were seen as equal under the law. “At the end of the day, someone finally acknowledged it’s all about a child’s best interests, not just about the rights of an LGBTI couple,” Chu said. “Now their daughter’s ID shows both parents name on it. It means she finally is legally under the protection of both parents, of both dads.” While the case has brought hope to LGBTQI couples hoping to start a family, it did not set a precedent and legal change is still needed, said Chu. But the solution is simple, Chu added: “We just need to fix one word in the same-sex marriage law, just the word ‘genetic’. If we get rid of that word it would allow LGBTQI couples to adopt.”
A bill proposed by the legislator Fan Yun has been stalled in Taiwan’s parliament for more than a year. “We are waiting for the submission … from the Ministry of Justice,” Fan told media on Thursday. Wang and Chen have always wanted two children but that is off limits until the law changes. Now they are married they cannot adopt, and if they divorced they would still have to go to court again to fight for dual adoption. “I hope that our first story of victory as a gay couple will serve as a foundation for the full practice of fair, equal treatment for other LGBT families,” said Chen.

3592;3592;3592;3592;3630;3630;Government in dispute with ‘VIP lane’ firm referred by Tory peer;2022-01-14;['David Conn'];['Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'Politics', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Society', 'Public services policy', 'Michelle Mone'];The government is in dispute over millions of surgical gowns supplied by the PPE business awarded £203m contracts via the fast-track “VIP lane” after a referral by the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, it has emerged. The health minister Edward Argar broke with more than a year of secrecy over the surgical gowns supplied by the company, PPE Medpro, telling Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, this week that the government was “in mediation” with the company. Previously, the last solid information provided about PPE Medpro’s products was in December 2020, when the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: “The gowns delivered by Medpro have not been distributed to the frontline.” DHSC sources said then that the gowns – delivered by PPE Medpro under its second contract, for £122m – were still being “evaluated” to ensure they met safety and quality standards. The Guardian recently reported that Lady Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, appear to have been secretly involved in the business of PPE Medpro, despite their repeated denials that they had any “role or function” in the company. The government revealed in November that Mone had originally referred the company in May 2020 to the office of her fellow Conservative peer Theodore Agnew, a minister responsible for procurement in the Cabinet Office during the pandemic. Agnew referred PPE Medpro to the VIP fast-track process for politically connected firms, and within weeks the DHSC awarded the company contracts totalling £203m. The VIP lane was ruled unlawful by the high court this week, after a challenge by the Good Law Project, with Mrs Justice O’Farrell ruling that it breached the requirement to treat potential suppliers equally. Argar refused earlier this month to tell Rayner whether the gowns supplied by PPE Medpro had been used, saying this was “commercially sensitive”. Asked by Rayner to clarify how this was deemed to be the case, the minister provided his answer on 11 January, saying: “The information is considered commercially sensitive as the department is currently engaged in a mediation process with PPE Medpro concerning their products, which involves confidentiality undertakings.” Mediation is a method of resolving contractual disputes to avoid litigation in the courts. Anthony Page, a director and the sole registered owner of PPE Medpro Ltd in the UK, who works for Barrowman in the Isle of Man, confirmed that mediation was ongoing over the gowns, saying via a lawyer that “a dispute was raised many months after delivery”. The lawyer said: “Our client vigorously defends its position in relation to the supply of the gowns that were supplied on time, at a very competitive price and fully in accordance with the contract.” He said the face masks supplied by PPE Medpro – under its first contract for £80.85m – “was all carried out without any challenge whatsoever at any time”. Rayner said: “This government has wasted millions on crony contracts doled out through the VIP lane, which the high court found was not just dodgy but outright illegal. “No wonder they are desperate to cover up the facts. But hiding behind the cover of commercial sensitivity just won’t wash with the public, whose money they were spending. We need to know if this PPE was actually used to protect NHS staff and what the government is doing to recover taxpayers’ cash if any of it was not.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “All PPE must undergo rigorous checks so they meet the safety and quality required. The department is undertaking work across the entire portfolio of PPE contracts to identify all instances of supplier non-delivery or product quality failure, and to recover the costs of undelivered or substandard PPE.” The spokesperson clarified that this referred broadly to all PPE, “not specifically to Medpro”, and declined to answer questions about the mediation or the PPE Medpro products, saying these details were “commercially sensitive”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/government-dispute-vip-lane-firm-referred-tory-peer-michelle-mone-ppe-medpro;politics;health
2746;2746;2746;2746;2776;2776;Cabinet expected to approve relaxation of plan B Covid restrictions in England;2022-01-18;['Peter Walker'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"Boris Johnson is expected to instruct millions to return to workplaces across England as he tries to placate furious MPs with a review of Covid restrictions that could end all rules introduced to combat Omicron. The cabinet will meet on Wednesday morning to examine Covid data and review plan B restrictions imposed in December amid the rapid spread of the variant, with Johnson set to update the Commons later in the day. While an official statement said decisions remained “finely balanced”, ministers are widely expected to approve the end of current advice for people to work from home where possible and the use of vaccine certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums. This would happen from 26 January, the pre-set review point for the plan B measures. It is also possible, if considered less likely, that the cabinet could drop the final plan B restriction which mandates masks on public transport and in shops. This move in particular would please many Conservative backbenchers, especially those in the influential Covid Recovery Group.
In defending Johnson from calls to quit over claims he knowingly took part in lockdown-breaching parties, supporters have repeatedly talked up his decision to avoid stricter restrictions as Omicron spread, saying hospitalisation figures have since proved him right. But while total confirmed cases have started to drop slightly in recent days, albeit remaining near 100,000 a day nationally, the wave of infections has hit regions at different times, with the north of England nearer the peak than places such as London. The director of public health for one city in the north of England said they would be extremely wary at the idea of plan B restrictions being removed so soon. “It does feel too early, certainly in the north,” they said. “We’re still seeing real pressure in hospitals, and people being off work. The idea of dropping everything next week just doesn’t seem sensible. If we tell people they can all go back to the office, we’ll just get even more people off sick. “I personally thought we shouldn’t have lost masks when we did last year – it was too soon. Every time you take something away and try to reintroduce it, public support is lost. I just wish there was a bit more time, so we can feel slightly more comfortable. It’s not just Covid, but all the pressures on the NHS.” Another worry, they said, was the possibility of a wave of new infections affecting vulnerable people who had received a Covid booster some time ago, with the protection beginning to wane. While ministers have talked up the idea of an end of restrictions meaning Covid is moving from pandemic to endemic status, like seasonal flu, the public health director said this was premature. “We’re just not there yet,” they said. “You don’t see cases rising in the way we have in the last few weeks if something is endemic. It’s got to be a much more stable position.” More widely, ministers are looking at phasing out all remaining Covid rules in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test, backed up by fines. This and other provisions, such as the requirement to give details to NHS Test and trace, are due to expire in March and could be allowed to lapse.
A No 10 statement setting out the plan for Wednesday’s decision noted that case numbers are still high, with 17,000 Covid patients in hospital in England. A government spokesperson said: “Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced. Plan B was implemented in December to slow the rapid spread of the extremely transmissible Omicron variant, and get more jabs in arms. “The Omicron variant continues to pose a significant threat and the pandemic is not over. Infections remain high but the latest data is encouraging, with cases beginning to fall.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/cabinet-expected-to-approve-relaxation-of-plan-b-covid-restrictions-in-england;politics;health

Prosecutors and the party confirmed on Wednesday the investigation into a preliminary suspicion of breach of trust after a report by the weekly publication Der Spiegel. A Greens spokesperson said the party’s six-member leadership, including Robert Habeck, the economy minister in Germany’s new coalition, and Annalena Baerbock, now foreign minister, were being investigated by the Berlin prosecutors. “The board members concerned and the (party’s) main office are cooperating fully with the public prosecutor’s office to clarify the facts quickly and comprehensively,” the spokesperson said. At issue is the role of the party leadership in approving the so-called corona bonus of €1,500 (£1,250) per person for employees of the party headquarters and leaders. The bonus was meant to compensate for the inconvenience caused by working from home and by renovation works at the building. Habeck and Baerbock are stepping down from the party leadership this month, something the Greens expect of government ministers. Internal party auditors have raised questions over the bonus payments to the leadership board, according to reports. The Greens said its leadership was entitled to make the decision but had since paid the bonuses back. It said the leadership and party headquarters are cooperating with prosecutors to clear the matter up. Prosecutors said there had been several criminal complaints from private individuals, which they were obliged to look into. The investigation was opened on 6 January.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/german-green-party-leaders-inquiry-covid-bonus-payments;environment;politics

The 33-year-old is one of tens of thousands of people with plans to study, work or join relatives in Japan who now find themselves “locked out” of a country that has maintained some of the world’s strictest travel restrictions throughout the pandemic. The latest measures, imposed at the end of November, apply to all arrivals except Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents – new students, guest workers, technical interns and, in some cases, the foreign spouses and children of Japanese nationals. Lewis Hussey had set his heart on studying in Japan before he graduates from university this summer. But the travel ban means the Missouri-based student has had to drastically rethink his plans.
“It’s incredibly disappointing,” Hussey, 26, said. “There have been times when it looked like Japan was about to open up, and then it didn’t. It’s frustrating because I could have considered other places. I feel like I’ve been cheated out of the opportunity to study abroad because of the inconsistent and nonsensical approach of the Japanese government.” The World Health Organization has urged countries not to impose blanket travel bans, warning that they were ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus and created economic and social misery. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, is unlikely to make significant changes to the border policy, however, after a recent poll showed 88% of the public believed the measure was “appropriate”. But it has not prevented Omicron from taking hold in Japan, which reported a record 46,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday. This weekend, large parts of the country, including Tokyo, will enter a quasi-state of emergency to relieve pressure on health services. Japan has imposed tight travel restrictions throughout the pandemic, with moves to relax them quickly undone by waves of infections driven by new variants. The only exception came last summer, when tens of thousands of athletes, officials and journalists arrived for the Tokyo Olympics. Aware of how mismanagement of the pandemic helped topple his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, Kishida is hoping that travel restrictions will play well among voters during upper house elections in July. Kishida recently said the ban would be extended until the end of February, but Jade Barry is bracing herself for more delays.
The 29-year-old was poised to fulfil her professional ambition of expanding her hairpiece business when the latest ban went into effect, forcing her to drop plans to scout locations in Tokyo for her new outlet. “I was devastated,” Barry said from her home near Chicago. “I cried all day and my kids were wondering what was wrong with mom. “I have been in love with Japan since I was little. Expanding my business there was a way of realising my ultimate goal of starting a life there. I still believe it’s a beautiful country, but to be banned for so long means I feel resentment towards the government.” Stranded students have found little sympathy among Japanese politicians but have received support from some business leaders, who say the ban will stifle innovation and threaten Japan’s long-term interests as more students look to other countries, including economic rivals such as South Korea.
Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of the e-commerce group Rakuten, has likened the ban to the isolation brought by the sakoku “locked country” policy during the Edo period (1603-1868). On the day Kishida extended the restrictions, Mikitani tweeted: “What is the point of not letting in new foreigners now? Do you want to shut Japan off from the rest of the world?” A letter to Kishida signed this week by hundreds of academics and experts in Japan-US studies, urged his government to relax border controls to allow educators, students and scholars to enter Japan. “They become the bridges between Japan and other societies. They are future policymakers, business leaders and teachers,” the letter said. “They are the foundation of the US-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japan’s core national interests. The closure is harming Japan’s national interests and international relationships.” “It’s frustrating,” said Imane, a 20-year-old Canadian student who has waited two years to begin her Japanese-language studies in Tokyo. “It’s been two years of wasting time, waiting for Japan to open its borders. “I love Japan so this is heartbreaking, but I can’t spend my whole life waiting,” added Imane, who preferred to use only her first name. “If Japan doesn’t open its borders this year I’m going to have to look elsewhere.” Her frustrations are shared by Vilhelm, a student from Lithuania, who gets up at 4.30am for online classes in international business studies at a university in Tokyo.
“The most frustrating part is that I can see no end to this,” said Vilhelm, who asked that his surname not be used. “I’ve invested in studying in Japan and I feel like it is treating me very unfairly. I still love Japan, but sometimes I forget why.” Barry took to social media to rally students and other stranded people behind a campaign to end the restrictions, with protests outside Japanese embassies planned for later this month. “To have the opportunity to come to Japan ripped away is devastating. And I can’t imagine what it’s like not to be able to see your child because of border restrictions. The uncertainty is no longer acceptable. This is literally ruining people’s lives.” The government responded to mounting criticism by opening the door, if only by a fraction. It will allow 87 students on government scholarships to enter in February, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said last week. But that leaves almost 150,000 others, mostly privately funded, who have been waiting up to two years to begin their studies. They will continue to live in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to begin their new lives in a country that has effectively become a Covid hermit kingdom. “Japan is damaging its soft power and its economy because it is punishing people who have a genuine interest in the country,” Ortez said. “It’s ruining its reputation. This will have long-term consequences for Japan.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/i-cried-all-day-the-anguish-of-people-locked-out-of-japan-by-covid;environment;health
1789;1789;1789;1789;1810;1810;Christ and cocaine: Rio’s gangs of God blend faith and violence;2022-01-23;['Tom Phillips'];['Brazil', 'Christianity', 'Gangs', 'Religion', 'World news', 'Americas'];"“Pastor, do you think we could hold a service at my house next Thursday?” the peroxide-haired gangster wondered, cradling an AK-47 in his lap as he took a seat beside the man of God. A few months earlier, the 23-year-old had bought his first home with the fruits of his illegal work as a footsoldier for one of Rio de Janeiro’s drug factions. Now, he wanted to give thanks for the blessings he believed he had received from above. “I’ve dodged death so many times. It was He who delivered me from evil,” the drug trafficker reflected as he began another 12-hour night shift on the frontline of the Brazilian city’s drug conflict. That Christian conviction was echoed all around the young outlaw, on walls adorned with frescoes of the Old City of Jerusalem and an extract from the Epistle to the Galatians: “Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” The gangster’s body celebrated his religion, too. One wrist carried a tattoo of a cross and the words “Jesus lives”. The other featured the motto: “May my courage be greater than my fear and my strength as great as my faith”. “They know theirs is a cut-throat world so they seek something to believe in,” said Elias Santana, a favela-based preacher who has made it his mission to save the souls of Rio’s ever more evangelical gangsters.
When Rio’s drug conflict exploded in the 1980s, Brazil’s evangelical revolution was still gathering pace and many gangsters looked to Afro-Brazilian deities such as Ogum, the God of war, for protection. Drug bosses frequented Afro-Brazilian temples, built shrines to Orixás and wore necklaces to show their devotion to the Umbanda and Candomblé faiths. Four decades later, many of those sanctuaries have been replaced with sculptures of Bibles and murals of the Last Supper, as a new generation of born-again criminals takes power, influenced by a brotherhood of pentecostal preachers. The sway those pastors hold over Rio’s so-called “narco-pentecostals” is unmissable in the hundreds of favelas controlled by gunmen from its three main gangs: the Red Command (CV), the Friends of the Friends (ADA) and, perhaps the most evangelical of all, the Pure Third Command (TCP). Drug lords, some regular churchgoers, have incorporated Christian symbols into their ultra-violent trade. Packets of cocaine, handguns and uniforms are emblazoned with the Star of David – a reference to the Pentecostal belief that the return of Jews to Israel represents progress towards the second coming. Gang-commissioned graffiti offers spiritual guidance and heavenly praise.
On one recent evening, a senior trafficker wandered into a service in suburban Rio, unarmed and unannounced, as a preacher read from the Book of John. “I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.” Surrounded by local children and their smartly-dressed parents, the gangster took a white plastic chair in the corner, bowed his head and began to pray. Nowhere is the evangelisation of Rio’s underworld more visible than the Complexo de Israel, a cluster of five favelas near the international airport governed by Peixão (“Big Fish”), a preacher turned drug peddler who takes his nickname from the ichthys “Jesus” fish. (The drug lord’s second-in-command is named after the Judaean prophet Jeremiah, while their troops are known as the Army of the Living God). In tribute to the area’s boss, a mural of the cartoon character Fishtronaut has been painted at one entrance, framed by a line from Psalm 33: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord”.
A neon Star of David, at night visible for miles around, sits on a water tower at one of the complex’s highest points. Nearby, on an outcrop looking south towards Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue, a Bible sits in a display case. “Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men,” reads its inscription, from Psalm 140. “Protect me from men of violence who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.” Police call Peixão, who is wanted for dozens of crimes including torture, murder and concealment of death, one of Rio’s most ambitious and iron-handed villains, whose fast-growing criminal empire makes a mockery of his purported Christian faith. In 2019 he was accused of leading the Bonde de Jesus (Jesus Crew), a gang of rifle-toting extremists who allegedly ransacked a succession of Afro-Brazilian temples. Afro-Brazilian celebrations have reportedly been outlawed in the Complex of Israel.
But some residents say the bling-averse gangster’s Bible-infused “doctrine” – which includes keeping the community’s streets tidy and well-lit, acts of charity to impoverished locals, discouraging swearing and drug use among gang members and a military-style focus on discipline – has improved life in a ghetto long neglected by the state. “There’s order in the favela,” said Juju Rude, a local rapper whose songs describe life in a community ruled by God-fearing gangsters. The Afro-Brazilian musician, who identifies as an evangelical Christian and has an Uzi tattoed on her belly, said she was troubled by Rio’s surge in faith-related bigotry and violence. “It’s not cool to see people prevented from practising their faith in the place where they live.” Overall, however, she thought life had improved under the favela’s current churchgoing administrator: “It’s new for everyone, an environment like this.”
Rio’s narco-pentecostals admit their often brutal line of work clashes with the scripture they profess to follow. As one top trafficker in another gang-run part of town lounged on top of a Honda motorbike surrounded by bodyguards with automatic rifles, he acknowledged the drug trade was an “evil” business that sometimes entailed horrific violence. But the gangster claimed his faith inspired him to minimise the barbarity, by trying to persuade fellow criminals to spare those who crossed them. “Those I can save, I save,” he said, remembering how he once persuaded a colleague not to murder a trafficker who stole a weapon and defected to a rival group. Instead, the traitor was forced to clasp his hands together, as if in prayer, and shot at close range, shattering his metacarpal bones but preserving his life. In another favela, a footsoldier with a Bible tattooed on to his chest spoke of how he enjoyed attending services at the God is Love pentecostal church, a fundamentalist congregation with temples across the US and Europe. “It makes me feel lighter,” he said, before racing away on his motorbike with an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. Christina Vital, an academic who has spent nearly 30 years studying evangelism’s advance into gangland Rio, said it was inevitable traffickers had embraced Christianity, given the breathtaking evangelical tsunami that has swept over Brazilian society during that time. Evangelicals now occupied key positions in the world of crime, just as they did in the media, politics, judiciary and culture, she said.
Nor was it surprising that vulnerable, marginalised young men sought guidance and compassion from the preachers searching Rio’s favelas for souls: “It’s such an awful, fragile life. They live in fear.” Vital said the consequences of the improbable fusion between crime and Christianity were unclear. There was evidence of “a certain containment” of bloodshed, she said, but the blending of religious intolerance with “staggering” gang violence was disturbing. Pastor Elias said he respected all faiths and believed his Godly crusade was helping pacify a city where hundreds of mostly young, black lives are lost each year. “This is Christianity’s duty: to save.” A week after being invited to bless the footsoldier’s first home, the preacher donned a garish magenta shirt and set off down winding, muddy passageways to the modest first-floor abode for which the criminal had paid 8,000 reais (£1,000). He squeezed inside, accompanied by half a dozen Bible-carrying helpers, and the group began to sing an anthem called “Oh! Jesus Loves me”. “Far from the Lord, I walked, on the path of horror. Never did I ask about Jesus. Nor did I seek His love,” they sung as the gangster bowed his head.
When the singing stopped, a female church member stepped forward and clutched the host’s arm as his girlfriend and mother – a cleaner just home from work – looked on. “God has chosen you. God is here right now!” the woman told him. “Just look at my goosebumps! God is here!” she proclaimed, her voice trembling as she summoned an angel to watch over the trafficker’s life. After 20 minutes of prayer and a reading from Psalm 23, the trafficker thanked his visitors over hotdogs and led them outside, visibly moved by their words. “It’s a life of loneliness,” said the pastor, “and Christ has come to free them from this servitude.” A warm breeze coursed through the favela’s narrow back alleys and for a moment the world seemed at peace – but the calm lasted only two hours. Shortly after midnight the crackle of gunfire woke residents, as traffickers stormed a nearby neighbourhood in the hope of expanding their domain. Another night of chaos and heartbreak in a city crying out to be saved.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/christ-and-cocaine-rios-gangs-of-god-blend-faith-and-violence;business and economy;politics
1652;1652;1652;1652;1671;1671;‘Stop nagging!’: Why China’s young adults are resisting marriage and babies;2022-01-24;['Vincent Ni'];['China', 'Population', 'Asia Pacific', 'Society', 'World news', 'Women'];"Early in January, China’s state news agency Xinhua posted a video reminding young Chinese men born in the year 2000 that they were eligible to get married. “Post 00s have reached legal marriage age,” it declared. The hashtag swiftly popped up in the top-searched list of Weibo hot topics, but many read it as the government’s attempt to put pressure on them. “Who dares to get married these days? Don’t we need to make money?” one questioned. “Stop nagging me!” said another. Under Chinese law, men can marry from 22 and women from 20. Young Chinese people’s mixed response to state media’s message came as the country faces what some analysts described as a “demographic timebomb”. Last week, China’s government reported its population growth rate had fallen to a 61-year low, with births barely outnumbering deaths in 2021, despite efforts to encourage Chinese couples to have babies in the last few years. “Young Chinese’s attitude towards marriage poses a big threat to Beijing’s effort to alter the looming demographic crisis,” said Dr Ye Liu, a senior lecturer at King’s College London’s Lau China Institute. “Coupled with a higher level of education and economic betterment, this will become a bigger headache in the years to come.” A growing number of young people across east Asian societies are delaying getting married as the region becomes more prosperous. Yet in urban China, this change has been especially swift, said Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine. Comparing Chinese census data in 1990 and 2015, Wang said that the share of never-married Chinese women in their late 20s had shot up by eight times in the span of 25 years. Census data from the years 2000 and 2010 show that college-educated young Chinese between the ages of 25 and 29 are most likely to be single. And women in developed Chinese cities, in particular, have fewer ambitions to get married. On social media and in daily life, the resistance to early marriage is strongly on display. In 2017, for example, a Shanghai-based chamber choir performance struck a chord with millions of young Chinese people facing the same dilemma across the country. The viral song Spring Festival Survival Guide – or What I Do Is For Your Own Good in English – told insisting Chinese parents: “My dear family, please just let me live my own life.” Vicky Liu, who is from northern Tianjin and was born in 1997, is one of those young Chinese. She said as soon as she graduated with a master’s in England last year, her parents began to arrange blind dates for her. “But I am an adult woman. I want a career and a good circle of friends. I just don’t want to be tied into a family life too soon.”
The attitude has alarmed the authorities further as the decline in population growth has become more evident in recent years. To reverse the trend, Beijing scrapped the decades-long one child policy in 2015, and last May it introduced a three-child policy. One economist, Ren Zeping, even suggested the government should print more money to fund a baby boom. Ren has been banned from posting on social media following this comment. But Ye Liu, of Kings College London, said that these policies are “masculine” and they are “disconnected” from the reality facing China’s generation Z today. “What they want is a better career future, an opportunity to have it all – career and family as well as self-fulfilment. Without these, it’s hard to convince them to have babies first,” she said. This is particularly the case with young Chinese women, she added. “Gen Z Chinese women have more education than previous generations. They are more likely to prioritise their career rather than get married after a university education.” Wang agreed and said that in reality, Chinese women were “severely under represented” in political and economic power. “China has a long way to go to create a more gender equitable society. But the difficulty here is that it is not achievable simply via the state issuing policy documents.” Yi Fuxian, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also the author of Big Country with an Empty Nest, said there were tangible measures the government could take to assuage the situation. “For example, job opportunities for young Chinese and help with the cost of living – in particular, the cost of property. The government should also make it easier for young couples to raise children.” For Vicky Liu, there is more to it. “[My parents’] logic is that as a woman I don’t have too long to find an ideal husband. For them, I have to get married, be pregnant and become a mother as soon as possible. Chinese parents simply won’t accept their daughters remaining single for too long.” With assistance from Xiaoqian Zhu";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-generation-z-resisting-marriage-and-babies;environment;entertainment and culture
1038;1038;1038;1038;1052;1052;Kurdish forces retake prison from Islamic State after six-day siege;2022-01-26;['Martin Chulov'];['Syria', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news', 'Kurds', 'Iraq', 'Islamic State'];"Up to 2,000 Islamic State inmates who had overrun a Syrian prison have surrendered to their Kurdish captors, ending a six-day siege that marked the terror group’s most dramatic stand since the collapse of its so-called caliphate nearly three years ago. The peaceful finale to the standoff on Wednesday was at odds with its bloody beginnings when up to 100 extremists tried to storm the facility in the northern city of Hasakah and free those jailed inside. The raid on Thursday night, which was led by two suicide bombers, led to days of intense clashes, which claimed the lives of close to 40 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces and about 30 jihadists, and forced more than 50,000 civilians to flee. It also drew attention to the fate of up to 700 boys and youths, who had been kept in a wing of the prison. Their condition was not initially clear, but there were no reports of further violence or deaths after alarm was raised for their safety on Monday after several US airstrikes and intensive gunfire.
Ahead of the surrender, global concern had continued to mount. “These children should never have been held in military detention in the first place,” said the Unicef executive director, Henrietta Fore. “The violence they are subjected to may amount to war crimes.” The UN said most of the children in the prison were Syrian and Iraqis, many of them orphans. However, the rest were made up of 20 other nationalities and their continued incarceration once again raised demands that they be repatriated. “None of them has been charged with any crime under national or international law,” said Fore. “The children of foreign nationals have received little to no support from their home countries.” After the surrender, the SDF posted photographs of rows of men standing outside the walls of the prison, many dressed in the distinctive orange overalls worn by alleged terrorists in prisons on both sides of the Euphrates. In Hasakah, there was widespread relief among locals who had initially feared that the storming of the prison had freed hundreds of extremists “Now they are saying that it’s over, we hope this is the end so we can start our normal life again,” said Fawaz al Aswad, 35, from the Azizia area. “During this past week we were not afraid of gunfire but we were afraid of Isis sleeper cells. No one got hurt from my family, but one of my neighbours died. He was an SDF fighter.”
“We could hear gunfire all the time,” said Hala Muhammed, 31. “We were very afraid. If all countries have taken their Isis fighter(s) back now this would not happen. But it seems they want Isis to remain here for the time being.” Meanwhile, in north-western Syria a disturbance of a different kind – a savage winter storm – continues to cause disruption, with heavy snow and strong winds damaging thousands of tents used by the more than 1.5 million refugees in the province. NGOs have stepped up campaigns for funding for blankets and heating as the storm that brought deep snow to Istanbul and plunging temperatures from northern Iraq to Gaza continued to rage. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said that at least 545 tents have been reported destroyed and 9,125 tents damaged by snowfall, floods and winds. “The snow, freezing rain, and sub-zero temperatures are especially harmful to children, the elderly, and people with disabilities living in flimsy tents without insulation, adequate winter clothing, and heat,” it said in a statement. One group of aid workers, the Molham Team, recently raised more than $1m in less than two days to rehouse 250 families in Syria’s north-west from tents into houses. The appeal, with the Twitter hashtag #untilthelasttent, initially aimed to raise $500,000 and help 100 families, but double that amount was donated, and the group was able to rehouse the entire camp.

834;834;834;834;845;845;West plans to tie Afghan teacher aid to girls’ education pledge;2022-01-27;['Patrick Wintour'];['Afghanistan', 'Aid', 'Taliban', 'Global development', 'Society', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Gender', 'Human rights', 'Education'];"The west is planning to incentivise the Taliban to abide by their promise to allow girls to be educated by providing funding for teachers’ salaries only in provinces in which the pledge is met. The Taliban claimed this week the group would allow girls of secondary school age to be educated from March, the start of the next school term. Sceptical diplomats said they would need more than verbal assurances, with physical and budgetary evidence of preparations being required. If no credible nationwide pledge was made or implemented, western diplomats said a plan to fund teachers’ salaries would go ahead only in those provinces where girls were allowed to attend school. Some provinces have been less repressive about the rights of women.
The salary funds would come from the World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), the single largest source of aid to Afghanistan before the Taliban took over in August. Worth £1.5bn, the fund has been frozen since then. Next month, the World Bank executive board is likely to discuss how more cash can be released from the fund, not just to help with humanitarian work but, for the first time since August, with the payment of key workers in health and education. As reports of dire humanitarian need mounted in December, £280m was released but it was mainly sent to the World Food Program and Unicef, and was not spent on salaries. Accused of letting Afghanistan fall apart, diplomats say there is a growing consensus that the west needs to go beyond conventional humanitarian aid and to fund teachers’ salaries, but only if girls are not being excluded from education. London and other capitals have been pushing for a larger tranche of ARTF funding to be released, but are waiting on a World Bank board paper, which will map out how cash could be released for salaries in education, health and agricultural production without reaching the Taliban. The west refuses to recognise the group, and the US has imposed sanctions on many of their leaders. The key proposal is for UN agencies, such as Unicef, or the International Red Cross to produce lists of frontline health and education workers so payments can be sent to their bank accounts directly. One source stressed the plan was for the medium term, adding that the Taliban were “slowly realising that this is the only way this will work”. The cash for key workers is only one aspect of how the humanitarian crisis is worsened by sanctions. On Thursday, the Norwegian Refugee Council became the latest aid agency to say it is nearly impossible to channel money into Afghanistan due to the state of the banks and fears among western financial institutions that transactions will fall foul of US Treasury sanctions. Before Christmas the UN security council passed a resolution aiming to protect bank transactions for humanitarian purposes from the sanctions regime. Since then the US Treasury has issued six general licences to allow such payments to go ahead, and is in discussion with Citibank, the main bank that handled Afghan transactions, to reassure its officials it will not be sanctioned if it returns to the market. The UK is also bringing the UN’s humanitarian exemption into UK sanctions law, and is providing £280m to Afghanistan this year. US officials are talking to the Afghan Central Bank to discuss how it can be made more independent and credible. Western officials say it is a misunderstanding to regard theACB’S £8bn in frozen reserves as a potential source of humanitarian funding since it is seed capital for the bank, and if handed back to the Taliban would amount to diplomatic recognition of the group. On Tuesday, the Asia Development Bank board released £405m, mainly for the Afghan agricultural sector.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/west-plans-to-tie-afghan-teacher-aid-to-girls-education-pledge;environment;politics
85;85;85;85;87;87;Belgian civil servants given legal right to disconnect from work;2022-01-31;['Daniel Boffey'];['Belgium', 'Work-life balance', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Money', 'Work & careers'];Belgian civil servants will no longer need to answer emails or phone calls out of hours after the country became the latest in Europe to offer workers the right to disconnect. The law, which comes into effect on Tuesday, means 65,000 federal officials are able to make themselves unavailable at the end of the normal working day unless there are “exceptional” reasons for not doing so. There are also government plans to extend the right to private-sector employees despite the opposition of some business groups. Petra De Sutter, the Belgian minister for public administration, said the law was necessary to combat a culture of people feeling they should always be available. That perception is said to have been exacerbated by the necessity to work from home during the Covid pandemic, a situation that is likely to lead to permanent changes in people’s habits. In a recent survey on remote working more than four out of five (84%) Belgians, of which 40% held managerial positions, said they would like to continue to work from home for two or more days a week post-pandemic. Without the right to disconnect, said De Sutter, “the result will be stress and burnout and this is the real disease of today”. The federal government is also examining a proposal to move to a four-day week of 38 to 40 hours for full-time staff, meaning longer working days but a three-day weekend. Belgium has followed a trend set in Europe by Volkswagen in Germany, which decided in 2012 to ban certain employees from accessing emails after hours in order to avoid burnout. In France, the sense that a different work-life balance needed to be struck was turned into action in 2017, when organisations with more than 50 workers were required to start negotiations to define the rights of employees to ignore their company smartphones and laptops. Portugal went further last year by approving legislation under which employers with more than 10 staff can be liable to fines if they text message, phone or email workers who are off the clock. Companies must help pay for expenses incurred by remote working. However, the Portuguese parliament rejected a proposal to include a legal right to switch off work-related messages and devices outside office hours. Last November, the European parliament backed a resolution calling on the European Commission to draft an EU-wide law that would protect workers who wished to “disconnect”. Alex Agius Saliba, a Maltese MEP, who drove the vote, said: “We cannot abandon millions of European workers who are exhausted by the pressure to be always ‘on’ and overly long working hours. “Now is the moment to stand by their side and give them what they deserve: the right to disconnect. This is vital for our mental and physical health. It is time to update worker’s rights so that they correspond to the new realities of the digital age.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/belgian-civil-servants-given-legal-right-to-disconnect-from-work;business and economy;politics
