The World Health Organization (WHO) chief says he is optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will be defeated in 2022, provided countries work together to contain its spread.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against ""narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding"" in a new year statement.
His comments come two years since the WHO was first notified of cases of an unknown pneumonia strain in China.
Global Covid cases now stand at 287m, while nearly 5.5m people have died. 
Across the world people are marking the new year but celebrations are muted, with many countries wanting to discourage crowds gathering.
Coronavirus remains part of daily life: a disease that has shut borders, split families and in some places made it unthinkable to leave the house without carrying a mask.
Despite all this, Dr Tedros sounded a positive note in his speech, noting that there are now many more tools to treat Covid-19.
But he warned that continuing inequity in vaccine distribution was increasing the risk of the virus evolving.
""Narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding by some countries have undermined equity and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of the virus evolving in ways we can't prevent or predict,"" he said. 
""If we end inequity, we end the pandemic,"" he added. 
In other developments:
In his comments, Dr Tedros also alluded to low vaccination rates.
While most of the population in Europe and the Americas have received at least one dose, a WHO target of full vaccination rates in 40% of every country by the end of 2021 has been missed across most of Africa. 
Dr Tedros has previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply, fully vaccinating much of their populations while others wait for their first doses. 
The WHO has set a new goal for 2022: vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic.

3;Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew accuser seeks evidence he could not sweat;2021-12-31T23:54:13.000Z;[];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'ghislaine maxwell', 'jeffrey epstein'];['reasonably', 'private', 'andrew', 'lead', 'giuffre', 'accuser', 'sweat', 'evidence', 'prince', 'seeks', 'information', 'irrelevant', 'request', 'lawyers', 'virginia', 'objected'];"
Lawyers for a US woman who has accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault are seeking proof of the British royal's alleged inability to sweat. 
Virginia Giuffre's legal team made the request as part of a civil case against the prince in a New York court.
Ms Giuffre, 38, alleges that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager at the homes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.
In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, he said a ""problem"" with her account was that a medical condition at the time meant he could not have been sweating, as she claims he was.

A civil case filed in the US alleges that the prince sexually abused Ms Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - at Maxwell's London home, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the Virgin Islands.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. British socialite Maxwell was found guilty this week of grooming underage girls to be abused by him.
The motion filed by Ms Giuffre's lawyers calls on Prince Andrew to supply ""all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat"".
Prince Andrew's lawyers said he objected to the request ""on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence"". 
They added that Prince Andrew had no such documents in his possession to hand over. 
The motion also includes requests for details of Prince Andrew's trips on Epstein's planes, and communication he had with Epstein and Maxwell.
In a separate development, a request by Prince Andrew's lawyers to pause the proceedings against him has been turned down by a US judge. 
His lawyers had wanted Ms Giuffre to take part in a two-hour deposition to discuss her country of residence. 
Ms Giuffre has been living in Western Australia and Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that this may disqualify her from filing a lawsuit in a US court. The judge rejected the demand.
Meanwhile Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty on Wednesday of recruiting and trafficking young girls for Epstein, awaits sentencing, a date for which has not yet been set. The verdict could see her spend the rest of her life behind bars.
The jury's decision was welcomed by the survivors, with Annie Farmer - the only witness to use her real name during testimony - saying she was ""so relieved and grateful"". 
Ms Giuffre, who was not one of the four women who testified in the case but was referenced on many occasions in court, said she would ""remember this day always"".
Maxwell's brother Ian told the BBC that she would appeal against the verdict ""on legal grounds - both in terms of the pre-trial process and the trial process as well"", but did not give further details.
He described the victims' testimony as ""heart-rending"" but said he still believed his sister's innocence. 
Another of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, Sarah Ransome, criticised Mr Maxwell's remarks.
""This sex trafficking pyramid wouldn't exist without Ghislaine,"" she told the BBC.
""I really think Ghislaine's brother should sit in a room full of Ghislaine's survivors because then he might have a different opinion of what his sister actually has done. She has destroyed hundreds of lives.""

4;Covid: Cathay Pacific flights cut after Hong Kong clampdown;2021-12-31T03:13:55.000Z;[];['global supply chain management', 'hong kong', 'air travel', 'cathay pacific', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'world', 'cathay', 'hong', 'major', 'kong', 'pacific', 'flights', 'rules', 'remaining', 'result', 'clampdown', 'numbers', 'strictest', 'cut', 'quarantine', 'raising', 'open'];"
Cathay Pacific has announced immediate major cuts to its flight schedule, including cancelling passenger and cargo services to and from Hong Kong.
The airline did not provide details on how many flights would be grounded but it said it would operate a skeleton passenger schedule in January.
It comes after Hong Kong announced tighter Covid-19 quarantine rules for air cargo crew earlier this week.
The move was aimed at tackling the threat of the Omicron Covid variant.
Cathay pilots have previously told the BBC the restrictions have affected their mental health and personal lives.
Late on Thursday Cathay Pacific said it was tentatively planning to cancel some passenger flights in and out of the Asian financial hub in the first three months of the new year.
It also said that long haul freight and cargo-only passenger flights including from Europe, Riyadh and Dubai would be suspended until 6 January.
Cathay Pacific had already announced last week that it would cancel some flights in January.
The latest decision is likely to put further strain on the already struggling global supply chain.
Like much of the rest of the global aviation industry, Cathay has been hit hard by the pandemic. It posted a net loss of $2.8bn (£2bn) in 2020 and lost $972m in the first half of 2021.
Airlines around the world have cancelled thousands of flights in the Christmas period alone due to the coronavirus.
In line with mainland China, Hong Kong has a zero-Covid policy as it aims to persuade Beijing to allow cross-border travel.
As a result the city has some of strictest quarantine rules in the world, raising concerns that it may be left behind as other major financial centres open up as they adopt approaches that see them live with the coronavirus rather than remaining closed off to keep case numbers low.
Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest aviation hubs but also has some of the strictest coronavirus regulations in the world. Two pilots with Cathay Pacific recently told the BBC that the rules have seriously affected their mental health and putting a strain on their personal lives.  
""You're just in a perpetual state of quarantine,"" one pilot, who has spent almost 150 days in isolation this year alone, said.
Though Hong Kong has recorded barely any local coronavirus cases in recent months, the city has imposed an extensive testing and quarantine regime, in line with mainland China's zero Covid policy.

5;Tesla to recall 475,000 cars in the US;2021-12-30T16:29:12.000Z;[];['tesla', 'electric cars', 'united states'];['475000', 'submitted', 'repeated', 'recall', 'wear', 'rearview', 'traffic', 'cars', 'trunk', 'safety', 'report', 'tesla'];"
Tesla is to recall more than 475,000 cars in the US, according to documents filed with the US safety regulator.
The electric vehicle firm announced it was recalling 356,309 vehicles because of potential rear-view camera issues affecting 2017-2020 Model 3 Teslas. 
A further 119,009 Model S vehicles will also be recalled because of potential problems with the front trunk, or boot.
The total recall figure is almost equivalent to the 500,000 cars Tesla delivered last year, Reuters reports.
The BBC has approached Tesla for comment.
A safety report, submitted this month, estimates that around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera.
Over time ""repeated opening and closing of the trunk lid"" may cause excessive wear to a cable that provides the rear-view camera feed, says a Safety Recall report submitted by Tesla to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the US on the 21 December.
If the wear causes the core of the cable to separate ""the rear-view camera feed is not visible on the centre display"", the report notes.
The loss of the rear-view camera display may ""increase the risk of collision"", it adds.
The Model S recall involves vehicles manufactured between 2014-2021, some of which may have a problem with a ""secondary latch"" on the front trunk, or boot.
In another Safety Recall report, also filed on 21 December, Tesla notes the fault could mean, if the primary latch is inadvertently released, the front trunk ""may open without warning and obstruct the driver's visibility, increasing the risk of a crash"".
Around 14% of recalled Model S's may have the defect, the report notes.
In both cases, the reports state that ""Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths"" relating to the potential faults.
The latest recall is not the first safety issue to have prompted action from the electric vehicle firm.
Last week Tesla agreed to make changes to its Passenger Play feature, which allows games to be played on its touchscreen while the car is in motion.
It took action after an investigation was launched by the NHTSA.
The feature will now be locked and unusable while the car is moving.

6;Santander: Bank hands out £130m in Christmas blunder;2021-12-30T13:18:51.000Z;[];['uk banking', 'santander group', 'banking'];['hands', 'transactions', 'blunder', 'recover', 'hard', 'point', 'working', 'left', 'christmas', 'result', 'duplicated', 'pocket', '130m', 'santander', 'uk', 'bank'];"
Tens of thousands of people awoke on Christmas morning to a surprise from an unexpected benefactor - Santander.
The bank mistakenly deposited £130m into 75,000 accounts on 25 December.
Santander's staff are now rushing to claw back the money, although the job is being made more difficult because much of it was deposited in accounts at rival banks, according to The Times.
The error occurred when payments from 2,000 business accounts were made twice.
""We're sorry that due to a technical issue, some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients' accounts,"" the bank said in a statement.
""None of our clients were at any point left out of pocket as a result and we will be working hard with many banks across the UK to recover the duplicated transactions over the coming days.""
It said the mistake may have meant that some people were, in effect, paid twice from their employer's account, although the second payment was funded by Santander.
One payroll manager, who asked not to be named, told the BBC the blunder had cast a shadow over Christmas and Boxing Day.
""It ruined my holiday period because I thought I'd paid out hundreds of thousands in error - I thought I had done something wrong,"" they told the BBC.
""I thought it was just me and that I was going to get in trouble at work.""
They said that Santander had not given any information about how firms should explain the second payment to staff or about how it should be repaid.
""It's just a complete shambles,"" the payroll manager said. ""How they are going to recover it, I just don't know.""
The bank stressed that it had already begun speaking to the rival banks - which The Times said included Barclays, HSBC, NatWest, Co-operative Bank and Virgin Money. 
Santander said those banks would ""look to recover the money from their customers' accounts."" 
However, it was not clear how the banks would respond if their customers had already spent the money, meaning returning it would push them into overdraft.
Santander indicated that it may contact people directly to get the money back.

7;Elon Musk rejects claims that his satellites are hogging space;2021-12-30T02:38:54.000Z;[];['communications satellites', 'elon musk', 'spacex', 'china', 'space'];['way', 'rejects', 'situation', 'blocking', 'hogging', 'musk', 'elon', 'expect', 'space', 'satellites', 'weve', 'blocked', 'doing', 'effectively', 'claims'];"
Elon Musk has rejected claims that his Starlink satellite internet project is taking up too much room in space.
""Tens of billions"" of satellites can be accommodated in orbits close to Earth, he told the Financial Times.
His comments come after a claim by the head of the European Space Agency (ESA) that Mr Musk was ""making the rules"" for the emerging commercial space industry.
This week, China complained that its space station was forced to avoid collisions with Starlink satellites.
""Space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny,"" Mr Musk said in the interview.
Mr Musk pushed back at suggestions that his Starlink Internet Services project was effectively obstructing the entry of competitors to the satellite industry, saying that there is ample room in the Earth's orbit for satellites.
""This is not some situation where we're effectively blocking others in any way. We've not blocked anyone from doing anything, nor do we expect to,"" he said.
""A couple of thousand satellites is nothing. It's like, hey, here's a couple of thousand of cars on Earth, it's nothing,"" he added.
This month, Josef Aschbacher, the director general of ESA, warned that the thousands of communications satellites launched by Starlink would result in there being far less space for competitors.
Other experts have said that much larger distances are needed between spacecraft to avoid collisions than Mr Musk has suggested.
Scientists have also previously voiced concerns about the risks of collisions in space and called on world governments to share information about the estimated 30,000 satellites and other space debris that are orbiting Earth.
Mr Musk made headlines this week as he faced a social media backlash after China complained that its space station was forced to avoid collisions with satellites launched by his Starlink project.
The country's space station had two ""close encounters"" with Starlink satellites this year, Beijing claimed.
The incidents occurred on 1 July and 21 October, according to a document submitted by China this month to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.
""For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control,"" Beijing said in the document published on the agency's website.
The incidents behind the complaints, lodged with the UN's space agency, have not yet been independently verified.
China also accused the US of putting astronauts in danger by ignoring obligations under outer space treaties.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was urging the US to act responsibly.
SpaceX has already launched almost 1,900 satellites as part of the Starlink network, and plans to deploy thousands more.

8;China ride-hailing giant Didi sees losses deepen after crackdown;2021-12-30T04:54:46.000Z;[];['china', 'stock markets', 'united states'];['securities', 'uslisted', 'crackdown', 'requests', 'ridehailing', 'market', 'losses', 'stock', 'rules', 'china', 'regulators', 'mean', 'sees', 'didi', 'planned', 'giant', 'leave', 'deepen'];"
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global has seen its losses deepen after Beijing ordered online stores not to offer the company's app.
The firm reported an operating loss of $6.3bn (£4.7bn) for the first nine months of year as revenues in China fell by 5% in the third quarter.
The Chinese crackdown came just days after Didi made its New York stock market debut at the end of June.
This month, it said it will move its share listing to Hong Kong from the US.
In recent months, Didi has become one of the most high profile targets of Beijing's clampdown on the country's technology industry.
The restrictions placed on it by authorities in China have hit its share price in the US hard.
The company's value on the New York Stock Exchange has fallen by 65% since its debut less than six months ago.
In its latest report to investors the firm also said that its board had authorised it to pursue a listing of its shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
""The company is executing above plans and will update investors in due course,"" Didi said.
Didi's announcement early in December that it planned to leave the US stock market came on the same day that the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it had finalised rules that would mean US-listed foreign companies can be delisted if their auditors do not comply with requests for information from regulators.
""Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York stock exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,"" the company said at the time.
Didi also said in Thursday's announcement that Daniel Zhang, the chief executive of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who had served as a director on its board since 2018, has resigned from the role.
As well as coming under intense scrutiny from Chinese regulators, Didi now faces tough competition in its home market from ride-hailing services launched by car makers Geely and SAIC Motor.

Actresses Joanna Lumley and Vanessa Redgrave have been made dames in the Queen's New Year Honours list.
Absolutely Fabulous star and activist Lumley has been honoured for services to drama, entertainment and charity.
Celebrated stage and screen veteran Redgrave has been recognised for services to drama.
Other celebrities on the list include newsreader Moira Stuart, dancer Ashley Banjo, 007 actor Daniel Craig and soap stars June Brown and William Roache.
Joanna Lumley said her damehood was ""extraordinary"" and ""completely unexpected"".
She initially thought the formal letter was bad news, but ""burst into tears"" when she realised it was offering her an honour. ""It was an extraordinary shock,"" she told BBC News. ""I put my head in my hands and sobbed like a baby.
""Then I thought, how has this happened? Is it a mistake? I truly was completely thrown by it, and thrilled to bits, and so touched.""
The 75-year-old star, who is a friend of the Royal Family, won two Bafta Awards for her role as fashionista Patsy Stone in the 1990s BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.
She also appeared in TV shows The New Avengers and Sapphire & Steel, and was nominated for a Tony Award on Broadway in 2011. Beyond acting, she has been praised for her human rights and animal rights campaigning.
Vanessa Redgrave said she was ""surprised and grateful to join this wondrous group of British artists whose work has inspired me and audiences the world over"".
She added: ""My generation fought for freedom of expression. Long may this remain.""
The 84-year-old is regarded as one of the greatest actresses of her generation, with six Oscar nominations to her name including a win for the 1977 film Julia. Her other films include Mary, Queen of Scots, Howards End, Mrs Dalloway, Wilde, Mission: Impossible and Atonement.
The English actress is one of a coterie of stars to wear the triple crown of acting - winning an Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony - while she has also received an Olivier Award, the London West End's highest accolade.
Deliverance and Hope and Glory director John Boorman has been knighted, as has pioneering film-maker Horace Ové, the first black Briton to direct a feature film.
""Chronicling the lives, battles, art and culture of the African and Caribbean diaspora in Britain and around the world has been a lifelong journey and passion,"" he said. ""This award is testament to how far we have come and in many respects how far we still have to go.""
Also knighted are fantasy author, Games Workshop co-founder and video game entrepreneur Ian Livingstone for services to the online gaming industry; and writer, broadcaster and former Labour politician Trevor Phillips, for services to equality and human rights.
Daniel Craig, who bowed out as James Bond with this year's movie No Time to Die, has been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.
It is the same honour that the fictional spy himself received, and which author Ian Fleming wrote in the 1957 novel From Russia With Love, was usually given ""on retirement from the Secret Service"".
Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who are tasked with choosing Craig's successor, have both become CBEs for services to film, drama, philanthropy and skills.
Elsewhere on the list, broadcaster Moira Stuart said she was ""so moved and lifted by this recognition of my work"" after becoming a CBE.
""Because over the years, since my first Radio 4 news bulletin in 1978 through to my last BBC News summary in 2018, I've been committed to public service broadcasting, which gave me the chance to shift barriers, open doors and change so many stagnant stereotypes,"" she said.
""No it hasn't been easy, but this magnificent honour means so much to me, and I shall cherish it always.""
Financial guru Martin Lewis said it was ""a great surprise and thrill"" to be appointed CBE for services to broadcasting and consumer rights, adding that it had been ""overwhelming"" to hear how his advice had helped people during the pandemic.
Bourne and Bloody Sunday film director Paul Greengrass said he was ""very honoured"" to become a CBE, with the same accolade going to Elton John's lyricist Bernie Taupin.
Novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz - whose work includes the Alex Rider spy novel series and Foyle's War - and cookery author Claudia Roden have both received the same honour for services to literature.
Two long-serving soap stars - EastEnders' June Brown, aka Dot Cotton, and William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in Coronation Street - have been appointed OBEs, both for services to drama and charity.
Roache said he was ""delighted"" to receive ""such a wonderful honour"". He added: ""I can't tell you how proud I am!Coronation Street has given me so much in life and I absolutely love the programme and everyone who works on the show.""
Brown, who left the BBC drama in 2020, said: ""It is a great honour and I would like to thank Her Majesty, and all those involved in my recommendation.""
Another EastEnder, Nitin Ganatra, has been appointed OBE for services to drama, while Corrie star Cherylee Houston said she was ""honoured and humbled"" to become an MBE for services to drama and people with disabilities.
The actress, who plays Izzy Armstrong in the ITV soap, said: ""Equality and inclusion of disabled people is something that's been very dear to me throughout my career so far.""
Model, presenter and activist Katie Piper has been appointed OBE for services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.
OBEs have also gone to Scottish pianist Steven Osborne, crime writer Ann Cleeves and Pauline Black from ska band The Selecter, who paid tribute to her home town.
""Coventry made me who I am today, giving me the opportunity to study, work and ultimately find my creative voice within the 2-tone movement, which has spearheaded the musical conversation about racism and sexism for the past 42 years,"" she said.
Spice Girl Melanie Brown - aka Mel B - has become an MBE for her role as patron of domestic abuse charity Women's Aid.
Diversity star Ashley Banjo said he was ""so humbled and extremely proud"" to become an MBE for services to dance: ""It really is the ultimate accolade. It's something I never saw coming and for my mum and dad to see this moment means the world.""
The Last Leg presenter Adam Hills said he was ""absolutely chuffed to bits"" to be appointed MBE for services to Paralympic sport and disability awareness.

Kate Garraway, the Good Morning Britain presenter who has chronicled her husband Derek Draper's long battle with Covid-19, has been appointed MBE for services to broadcasting, journalism and charity.
Other new MBEs include best-selling author Adele Parks for services to literature, and Smooth Radio/Classic FM presenter Margherita Taylor for services to broadcasting and diversity.

12;Miners experiment with hydrogen to power giant trucks;2021-12-21T01:36:11.000Z;[];['hydrogen vehicles', 'business in africa', 'climate change', 'africa economy', 'south africa'];['serve', 'trucks', 'support', 'operational', 'numerous', 'initially', 'miners', 'hydrogen', 'truck', 'power', 'local', 'operation', 'regional', 'giant', 'experiment'];"
Mining trucks are monstrous machines that guzzle fuel at a scarcely believable rate.
Weighing 220 tonnes, they can get through 134 litres of diesel every hour. 
Little wonder then that mining companies are focusing their attention on these vehicles as the first step to reducing their carbon footprint.
Anglo American, in collaboration with several partners, is retrofitting a mining haul truck with hydrogen power technology.
A first of its kind, the monster mining vehicle is being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa, at the firm's Mogalakwena platinum mine. 
Due to be launched in early 2022, the truck will be hybrid, with a hydrogen fuel cell providing roughly half of the power and a battery pack the other half. 
Instead of having a tank of diesel that powers the motor, hydrogen enters the fuel cell and mixes with oxygen to create water in a chemical reaction catalysed by platinum, which generates the electricity needed to power the motors that drive the wheels.
It only emits water vapour and the company says it has the potential to reduce on-site diesel emissions by up to 80%.
By rolling out this technology across its global truck fleet, Anglo American says it will be ""taking the equivalent of half a million diesel cars off the road"". 
The trucks also harvest regenerative energy created when driving downhill and braking, which is stored in the battery and extends the range of the vehicle.
Anglo is developing the truck along with partners Engie, NPROXX, First Mode, Williams Advanced Engineering, Ballard, ABB, Nel and Plug Power.
However, reducing the carbon footprint of the mining industry is a formidable task.
The construction sector, which includes mining, accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2017, according to Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer for climate and circular economy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
He says the sector will need to reduce its energy consumption by a third if it hopes to be compatible with the Paris Agreement.
Hydrogen-powered trucks are a good start but need closer inspection, says Diego Marin, associate policy officer for environmental justice at the EEB. 
""While electric-powered vehicles, generally speaking, are less damaging to the environment than internal combustion engines on a life cycle analysis, this does not mean that they are green,"" he says.
Mr Marin points out it all hinges on how the hydrogen is produced. Some hydrogen is created using fossil fuels, which of course means there are substantial emissions as a result.
Anglo American says it is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to attain carbon neutrality by 2040.
Its hydrogen-powered hauler uses green hydrogen, which is made by splitting water atoms into oxygen and hydrogen, through electrolysis.
Even that is treated with caution by the EEB. 
""We should refrain from presenting hydrogen as a technological solution to all problems… all forms of hydrogen come at an environmental cost - water use, impacts on nature,"" says Mr Sabbadin. 
The EEB also points out that hydrogen power has a shorter storage life than other renewables and is substantially more expensive to produce.  
More technology of business:
Whether it be investment for the mining industry's green goals or hydrogen power as a broader power solution, the issue of cost is definitely a pertinent one in South Africa. 
Jarrad Wright, an energy consultant and principal engineer for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) explains. 
""Hydrogen for power production is still quite expensive and unlikely to compete for some time."" 
This is largely due to a lack of supporting infrastructure for the new forms of energy to be created, distributed or stored. 
But, Mr Wright adds that it is possible to migrate to hydrogen in specific applications. 
At the moment South Africa's hydrogen power infrastructure is still sparse.
But the government and private partners are exploring ways to transform the country's platinum belt into a ""hydrogen valley"", with a focus on producing green hydrogen.
Anglo American is one of the private partners in this hydrogen infrastructure plan, which aims to create a regional renewable energy ecosystem. 
The starting point for this ecosystem is due to be built at the Mogalakwena mine itself, through the construction of a hydrogen production and storage complex. It incorporates the largest electrolyser in Africa, a solar power field, and will generate approximately 140MW of green power. 
Initially, it will be to support the 24-hour operation of the new truck, but once operational, the aim is for numerous complexes such as this one, to serve as local and regional hubs for the emerging hydrogen economy.
""The ecosystem would not only help us reduce our... emissions, but would also provide the foundation for green hydrogen production, facilitating the roll-out of hydrogen-powered haul trucks across South Africa,"" Anglo says.

Pioneering photographer Sabine Weiss, who was the last surviving member of France's celebrated humanist school, has died aged 97 at her home in Paris.
Although she had stopped taking pictures, Weiss was actively involved in her archive until her death. Born in Switzerland, she learned her art in Geneva, moving to Paris after World War Two. She became renowned particularly for her images on the streets of Paris, and for 70 years remained at the heart of French photography.

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

21;Rogel Aguilera-Mederos: Colorado truck driver's sentence cut by 100 years;2021-12-31T14:17:29.000Z;[];['colorado', 'united states', 'kim kardashian'];['loved', 'struggle', '100', 'loss', 'event', 'life', 'countless', 'colorado', 'sentence', 'drivers', 'truck', 'aguileramederos', 'rest', 'injuries', 'rogel', 'cut', 'forget', 'ones'];"
A truck driver who was facing a 110-year jail term for a deadly crash has had his sentence reduced to 10 years, following widespread outcry.
Rogel Aguilera-Mederos' lorry crashed into traffic in 2019, killing four people in the US state of Colorado.
At trial he was convicted on 27 counts, and the judge said state law forced him to impose the lengthy sentence.
But on Thursday, Colorado Governor Jared Polis commuted what he called an ""unjust"" sentence.
Aguilera-Mederos was transporting timber in the Rocky Mountains foothills when the deadly crash happened in April 2019.
The lorry careered downhill into stationary traffic, bursting into flames and causing a major pile up in the city of Lakewood.
Four people - Stanley Politano, 69, William Bailey, 67, Doyle Harrison, 61, and Miguel Angel Lamas Arellano, 24 - were killed.
Aguilera-Mederos, a Cuban immigrant, told officials that his brakes had failed, and that he had tried his best to avoid other vehicles as he lost control of the truck.
But prosecutors argued that the 26-year-old knew his brakes were failing. 
They said he dangerously weaved between vehicles, and that he drove past at least one runaway truck ramp - long lanes at the side of roads designed for vehicles with brake problems to drive into and stop safely.
Judge Bruce Jones told the court that - under Colorado law - he had to impose the mandatory minimum sentence for all of convictions, and that they must be served consecutively.
""If I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence,"" the judge said after Aguilera-Mederos was convicted.
More than five million people, including reality TV star and law student Kim Kardashian West, signed a petition that called for a reduction in his lengthy prison sentence.
Truck drivers also announced on social media that they would boycott Colorado over the sentencing.
As governor, Mr Polis has constitutional power to grant pardons, clemency and commutations.
In a letter to Aguilera-Mederos, he called the crash ""a tragic but unintentional act"" and said there was ""an urgency to remedy this unjust sentence and restore confidence in the uniformity and fairness of our criminal justice system"".
""You will struggle with this burden of this event for the rest of your life, but never forget that... countless others will struggle with the loss of their loved ones or injuries as well,"" he added.
Aguilera-Mederos will be eligible to apply for parole in five years.
The timing of the governor's move has not been welcomed by everyone. 
In a statement, District Attorney Alexis King said she was ""disappointed in the Governor's decision to act prematurely"".
A hearing to reconsider the verdict had already been planned, and Ms King had previously said she would ask for Aguilera-Mederos to be resentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
""I joined the surviving victims and families of those who lost their loved ones in their wish to have the trial judge determine an appropriate sentence in this case,"" said Ms King.

24;Obituary: Betty White, the Golden Girl with a heart of gold;2021-12-31T19:43:03.000Z;[];['television'];['heart', 'girl', 'world', 'womens', 'services', 'war', 'went', 'golden', 'white', 'gold', 'working', 'moved', 'second', 'obituary', 'voluntary', 'work', 'betty'];"
Betty White was US television's Golden Girl with the heart of gold, celebrated for her comic acting abilities from TV's early days up to the 21st Century, while remaining committed to her animal activism.
""I have to keep acting so that I can afford to keep doing my charity work!"" she joked to The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.
Born in Illinois in 1922, White became one of America's original screen stars, enjoying a career that encompassed eight decades and earned her many accolades.
As an only child, she moved with her family to Los Angeles during the height of The Great Depression, and in the late 1930s began working as an actress and model. Her fledgling career had to be put on hold, though, during the Second World War, when she went to work with the American Women's Voluntary Services.
After the war, White continued with her showbiz ambitions with mixed success, before landing her own radio show and then appearing on Al Jarvis's Hollywood on Television variety talk show.
She died on Friday, weeks before her 100th birthday.
Clearly a burgeoning talent, she took over the reins of the TV show in the early 1950s, and was subsequently nominated for her first Emmy Award for best TV actress in 1951. It was the new awards' first ever category to recognise the achievements of women on the box.
Next came the TV sitcom Life with Elizabeth - a show she launched herself, alongside George Tibbles. ""He wrote and I produced,"" she explained. ""I was one of the first women producers in Hollywood.""
White kept her profile high with many chat show appearances, and met her third husband (and ""love of my life"") Allen Ludden on the game show Password in 1961. The couple were married from 1963 until Ludden's death in 1981.
The actress's biggest role so far came as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the 1970s. Her sharp-witted character, who had an eye for the men, worked alongside the sitcom's titular star in a fictional Minneapolis television newsroom.
The job won White two more Emmy Awards and set her up for what would become her most famous role, as the naive-but-loveable Rose Nylund in The Golden Girls, which carried her through the 1980s and 90s.
Nylund was a Norwegian-American who moved to Miami after the death of her husband and formed a later life bond with three other women, played by Beatrice Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.
In 1986, it won the Emmy for outstanding comedy and White scooped the individual award for best comedy actress.
""I am the lucky one who gets to come up and pick up this beautiful golden girl,"" she said in her acceptance speech. ""But Estelle and Rue and Bea and I all thank you - we're a match-set, you can't split us up.""
After The Golden Girls went off air in 1992, White - who was by then also a published author - appeared in the short-lived spin-off Golden Palace.
She also had a recurring role on soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful from 2006 to 2009, and hosted several other entertainment shows, including the prank show Betty White's Off Their Rockers.
But her career caught fire again in 2010, when she starred in another sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, opposite Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick.
""It's just a terrific show. The chemistry between the girls is so great,"" White told Newsweek.
The same year, the veteran also became the oldest ever host of Saturday Night Live, following a Facebook campaign to get her on the prime-time show.
Her 90th birthday in 2012 was marked with an all-star television special featuring her old co-star Tyler Moore, Ellen DeGeneres and Carl Reiner, as well as Tina Fey and Ed Asner.
Still making movies into her 90s, White joined an all-star cast in 2019's Toy Story 4, voicing a tiger teething toy named Bitey White.
Animals (real ones, not toys) were always a passion, and she worked closely with the Los Angeles Zoo and the Morris Animal Foundation for more than four decades.
""I'm actually the luckiest old broad alive,"" she said. ""Half my life is working in a profession I love and the other half is working with animals.""
In 2015, she was honoured with a lifetime achievement Emmy Award - her eighth Emmy in total.
""She is one of the most beloved female performers in the history of television,"" said Bob Mauro of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, who described White as an ""American institution"".
""Betty's career as a female pioneer has followed television from literally the beginning of the medium, winning her first Emmy Award in 1952, to the digital-streaming future, winning again in 2010.""
Emmy vice-president David Michaels went on to say that White was ""also one of the nicest women in showbusiness"".

25;Year in tech: The stories making headlines in 2021;2021-12-31T01:01:04.000Z;[];['meta', 'nfts', 'semiconductors'];['focus', 'rapidly', 'hyped', '2021', 'facebook', 'making', 'month', 'enthusiasm', 'zuckerberg', 'mark', 'tech', 'headlines', 'words', 'metaverse'];"
2021 introduced us to tech terms including Metaverse and NFT (non-fungible token).
Facebook took a dramatic new direction, heading off into virtual reality.
The internet, which had held up remarkably well over a series of lockdowns, experienced a few wobbles. 
And we learned that those chips in all our devices, which we take for granted, weren't infinite.
Here's our rundown of some of the biggest stories on the BBC Technology site over the past year.
Even though he lost the presidential election at the end of 2020, Donald Trump continued to make headlines into 2021.
On the 7 January, he was briefly locked out of his Twitter account after posting false claims of voter fraud. Just 12 hours later, he was allowed to tweet again. but a few days later was permanently suspended.
The tweet that led to the ban was seen as particularly inflammatory given the storming of the Capitol building just the day before.
The events acted as a wake-up call to social media networks which had previously allowed politicians to have, more or less, free rein posting online.
Facebook also chose to ban the former US president; six months on, in June, it was decided that Trump would remain barred from Facebook for two years.
During the course of the year both Facebook and Twitter adopted new rules on how to deal with the high-profile accounts of world leaders and politicians.
Of course it was not the last we heard from Mr Trump - but more on that later.
WhatsApp's plans to change its privacy policies to make it easier for people to message businesses, faced a backlash as millions downloaded apps from its competitors, worried that the plan meant large amounts of information on the messaging platform would be shared with Facebook.
Facebook insisted the changes did not mark a dramatic shift, but admitted that communication had been poor.
Privacy advocates said it merely highlighted that WhatsApp was already harvesting huge amounts of data for its parent firm.
A few days after the backlash was reported in the media, WhatsApp revealed that those who did not accept its updated terms and conditions would be unable to receive or send messages after the 15 May deadline.
Later in the year, WhatsApp was forced to rewrite its privacy policy following a £190m fine imposed by the Irish data protection authority. It subsequently had to provide much more information about what exactly it does with user information.
In Spring, anti-virus creator John McAfee, who has always been a controversial figure, was charged with fraud - accused of promoting crypto-currencies on Twitter in order to inflate the price.
At the time, he was already being detained in Spain on separate charges relating to tax evasion.
A few months later, a Spanish court agreed to extradite him to the US. But just a few hours later he was found dead in his cell - believed to have taken his own life.
It has been a year dominated by chip shortages - the result of a combination of factors, including the pandemic and the sharp increase in demand for certain goods as everyone adapted to working, learning and socialising at home.
In April, Cisco became one of the first to warn that the computer chip shortage was a problem, although its suggestion that it might last for six months proved to be rather optimistic.
Later in the year, the boss of chip firm Arm suggested that the problem could run until next Christmas.
Trump was back in the headlines in May with news that he had launched his own communications platform which would publish content ""straight from the desk"" of the former US president.
Some pointed out that it seemed to be little more than a glorified 1990-style blog - and just a month later it was shut down.
Later in the year, he unveiled a slightly more sophisticated effort to exert his influence on social media, with plans to launch an app called Truth Social in 2022.
It has raised $1bn to date, but has also courted controversy and is facing an investigation from the SEC.
In June, a major internet outage affected a number of high-profile websites including Amazon, Reddit, Twitch, the Guardian and the New York Times.
Cloud computing provider Fastly admitted responsibility. It runs what is known as an edge cloud, which is designed to speed up loading times from websites. Later it emerged that one customer changing their settings had triggered the bug.
Similar problems plagued Amazon Web Services, Akamai and Cloudflare during the year, prompting some to question the reliance on a handful of companies to keep the internet working.
One of Silicon Valley's original innovators, Jeff Bezos, stepped down from Amazon, exactly 27 years after he founded the online retail giant. For many he was a business visionary, and the company he started bears this out - worth $1.8trn at the time of his departure.
But like all tech giants, Amazon is facing increased scrutiny, over how it treats its warehouse workers, for example, as well as questions over whether it monopolises online retail. 
Mr Bezos isn't planning to walk out of the limelight however. His latest obsession is Space - in October he and Star Trek's original Captain Kirk, aka William Shatner, blasted into sub-orbit in his rocket, Blue Origin.
This year we learned that NFT stood for Non-Fungible Token. Less understood was what it meant - essentially a digital token that can be used as a way of paying for digital collectibles.
But for those who got it, it was a great way to make a quick buck - like 12-year-old Benyamin Ahmed, who made £290,000 from some pixelated artworks called Weird Whales that he had made during his school holidays.
Elsewhere, an NFT of an animated cat GIF sold for more than £365,000, while Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet hit £2.5m and Tim Berners-Lee web source code NFT went for a cool $5.4m.
But the NFT craze was not without its critics: author David Gerard describes NFTS as the ""new form of worthless magic bean"".
Either way, it was hard to ignore, and NFT made it into Collins dictionary of new words for 2021 - along with Metaverse.
Every so often a strange tale hits tech - and none was stranger than the warning that iPhone owners should be wary that powerful motorbikes could damage their camera systems.
The document, published by Apple and spotted by MacRumours, suggested that engine vibrations could harm the phones' optical-image stabilisation or closed-loop autofocus systems.
The BBC's retelling of the story got millions of hits.
In October, there were two major Facebook stories - one of which broke all records for tech index readership. But strangely that accolade went not to the radical company rebrand to Meta, but to a story about Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram being inaccessible for a few hours.
It was also the month that Facebook announced its new focus on the metaverse - a concept that has rapidly become one of the most hyped words of 2021, and one which Mark Zuckerberg seems to have endless enthusiasm for.
Essentially, it is a virtual reality version of the internet in which Meta, along with some other big names in tech, believes we will live, play and work at some point in the future.
Of course, the more cynical wondered if the newfound enthusiasm for the metaverse - which came with not just a company rebrand, but a plan to hire 10,000 people in the EU to build it - was a distraction from Facebook's ongoing issues with real-world content.
Its been quite a year for cyber crime, with record numbers of ransomware attacks and some serious bugs uncovered. In November our cyber reporter, Joe Tidy, set off to find some of the most wanted hackers from the notorious network Evil Corp - many of whom are based in Russia.
It took him to a golf course and a shiny skyscraper in Moscow. He didn't find the hackers, but he did learn that they were making a huge amount of money - alongside driving the requisite Lamborghinis, hosting plush weddings and keeping exotic pets.
Any direct links to the Russian state are denied by the Kremlin, but experts believe that hackers are allowed to flourish in the country provided they don't target Russian nationals. While US law enforcement claims they are also enlisted for state hacking.
This year there has been a renewed surge of disinformation around vaccinations, Covid and politics.
Technology has not been immune to conspiracy theories either, with attacks on 5G transmitters from those who believe they omit dangerous radio waves.
Despite no evidence the transmitters cause any harm, the theory has spawned a range of products which claim to protect people against them. 
The BBC has previously reported on the issue, from anti-radiation stickers for sale on Amazon, to a USB stick which UK Trading Standards described as a ""scam"".
Then, as the year ended - in an ironic twist - an anti-5G necklace was found to be radioactive by the Dutch authority for nuclear safety and radiation protections.

A $10bn glittering space jewel recedes into the distance. 
This is the moment the James Webb telescope came off the top of its rocket to begin its mission to image the first stars to shine in the cosmos.
The video was transmitted in near real-time last Saturday, but the feed to Earth was very glitchy and broken up.
The European Space Agency (Esa) has since had the sequence cleaned up and set to music by the UK artist Charlotte Hatherley. 
It's the last view we'll ever get of the telescope scientists believe will go on to make transformative discoveries about the early Universe, and about planets circling far-off stars.
Webb is currently heading to an observing position some 1.5 million km from Earth on its nightside. It should arrive at this location in late January. 
Already the astronomical facility is beyond the orbit of the Moon.
Saturday's launch on an Ariane rocket from French Guiana was a spectacular affair - and a very precise one.
The European booster performed flawlessly, putting Webb at just the right altitude and inclination to the equator, and with the required velocity.
Indeed, the flight performance was so good, mission controllers now believe the telescope's lifetime has been significantly extended because it didn't have to use so much of its own fuel when making a later course refinement. 
Another indicator of the Ariane dividend is the speed at which Webb's solar array is seen to deploy in the video. It comes out just 70 seconds after the telescope's ejection from the rocket's upper-stage.
The event was not expected for several minutes but Webb's onboard computers determined that all conditions for a safe deployment had been met and commanded the array's immediate release.
The telescope was launched in a folded configuration - a tightly packed cuboid a little under 10.7m by 4.5m by 4.5m. It's now being directed to unfold itself, with the tricky unfurling of a giant sunshield scheduled to take place over the next few days.
The camera system used to obtain the separation video was manufactured by Irish start-up Réaltra Space Systems Engineering. 
Arianespace, which manages the launches from French Guiana's Kourou spaceport, will be putting the Réaltra technology on Europe's next-generation Ariane vehicle - the Ariane-6 - when it enters service next year.
Charlotte Hatherley has previously worked with Esa on outreach projects. The title of the track used to accompany the Webb video is called Lonely Waltz, which featured on her 2017 album, True Love.

28;Apple puts Indian iPhone factory 'on probation';2021-12-29T18:50:57.000Z;[];['india', 'apple', 'iphones'];['apple', 'rapidly', 'rooms', 'requirements', 'probation', 'working', 'iphone', 'factory', 'meet', 'implemented', 'used', 'puts', 'set', 'supplier', 'remote', 'indian'];"
Apple has placed an iPhone factory in southern India ""on probation"" following protests over food poisoning and living conditions.
An audit by Apple found that remote dining rooms and dormitories used by workers did not meet requirements.
Around 250 women who worked at the Foxconn plant were affected by food poisoning, with more than 150 ending up in hospital, local media reported.
Foxconn apologised and said it was investigating the situation.
""We are very sorry for the issue our employees experienced and are taking immediate steps to enhance the facilities and services we provide,"" the Taiwanese firm said in a statement.
The factory has been closed since 18 December, when the protests began.
Apple has not specified what being on probation means but in the past it has declined to award new business to facilities on probation until problems are resolved.
An Apple spokesman said: ""Following recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn Sriperumbudur, we dispatched independent auditors. 
""We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements, and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented.""
The iPhone factory, which is about 25 miles (40km) from Chennai, employs 17,000 people.
The food-poisoning cases and subsequent protests also led the Tamil Nadu state government to ask Foxconn to review its worker facilities. 
Last year, Apple had to place another iPhone manufacturing partner on probation after worker riots broke out over unpaid wages at the partner's factory near Bangalore.

29;Covid: Omicron and Delta driving tsunami of cases - WHO;2021-12-29T22:43:13.000Z;[];['world health organization (who)', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'delta', 'tsunami', 'days', 'seven', 'week', 'period', 'test', 'staffing', 'isolation', 'cases', 'omicron', 'driving', 'uk', 'spain', 'strains'];"
The combination of Delta and Omicron variants is driving a dangerous tsunami of Covid-19 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) chief has said.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus' words came as the US and countries across Europe reported record new cases.
France reported Europe's highest ever daily figure for the second day in a row, at 208,000 cases.
And the US has reported a record average of 265,427 cases a day over the last week, according to Johns Hopkins.
Denmark, Portugal, the UK and Australia have all also reported record-breaking figures.
Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in its fourth wave of the pandemic. More than three-quarters of these were unvaccinated people.
Studies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. It is believed to be driving the surge in cases, with French health minister Olivier Véran telling reporters he would ""no longer speak of a wave when it comes to Omicron"" but a ""tidal wave"".
However, Dr Tedros warned it was the ""twin threat"" of the two variants that was behind the overall case load.
""This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers, and health systems on the brink of collapse,"" the WHO chief added.
At the moment, some 900,000 new cases are being reported around the world every day, Reuters news agency reports.
Dr Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, has told CNN Omicron infections are likely to peak at the end of January in the US, given its population size and vaccination rate. 
Several wealthy nations have launched booster drives to give third doses of Covid vaccines, including the UK where 57% of people over 12 have now received three jabs.

However, Dr Tedros told reporters richer countries' large-scale booster campaigns were ""likely to prolong the pandemic"", as they diverted supplies away from poorer, less vaccinated countries, thereby ""giving the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate"".
He went on to ask ""everyone to make a New Year's resolution to get behind the campaign to vaccinate 70%"" of the world by mid-2022. Almost 100 countries are yet to meet the original target of vaccinating 40% of their populations, the WHO says.
According to a WHO report published on Tuesday, the number of new Covid infections of all variants grew by 57% in Europe in the week before 26 December, and by 30% in the Americas.
Those numbers still seem to be climbing, with yet more records set on Wednesday:
Officials have warned that some of the high figures may be partly due to delays in reporting because of Christmas.
One effect of the record infections has been staff shortages in some essential services, due to people isolating so as not to spread the virus.
In Britain, the Fire Brigades Union says about a third of fire engines in London were unavailable for use earlier this week because of staff testing positive for coronavirus or having to isolate.  
And in the US state of Texas, members of the National Guard are being used in support roles at several juvenile detention centres. 
On Wednesday, Spain - which has seen a record 1,360 cases per 100,000 over the past fortnight - cut its isolation period from 10 days to seven, to alleviate staffing strains. The US has already reduced the period, while the UK has said those who test negative for two days will be allowed to leave isolation after a week.

30;Covid: US halves isolation time for asymptomatic infection;2021-12-28T11:05:30.000Z;[];['omicron variant', 'united states', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'joe biden'];['covid', 'volume', 'asymptomatic', 'things', 'sheer', 'medical', 'halves', 'fauci', 'having', 'president', 'isolation', 'omicron', 'joe', 'infection', 'serves'];"
US health officials have halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid-19 from 10 to five days, amid a surge in cases.
The measure is expected to alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages in many areas because of infections.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says most transmissions happen in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.
But experts have criticised the lack of testing requirements to end isolation.
The sharp rise in cases has been fuelled by the Omicron variant of the virus, which is now dominant in the US. Early studies suggest Omicron is more contagious than other variants, although milder. 
The growing number of people having to isolate has put pressure on several industries, including air travel, with thousands of flights cancelled during the Christmas holiday.
Leaders of major US airlines were among those calling for the change, as cancellations continued for a fourth day on Tuesday. 
The CDC said the new guidance was ""motivated by science"", and that the isolation must be followed by five days of wearing a mask around others. The announcement came as more than 200,000 daily infections were confirmed in the past two days nationwide. 
CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said the recommendation ""balances what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses"".
""These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives,"" Dr Walensky said in a statement.
This video can not be played
But there was no recommendation for people to take rapid at-home tests before the end of their isolation periods. Many experts say such tests help to show whether people continue to spread the virus.
Dr Michael Mina, an assistant professor at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, called the lack of such requirement ""reckless"".
""I absolutely don't want to sit next to someone who turned Positive 5 days ago and hasn't tested [negative],"" he said on Twitter.
In England, people are now required to isolate for seven days, instead of 10, with two negative lateral flow tests needed to end their self-isolation - the first no earlier than day six of isolation and a second 24 hours later.
Speaking on CNN, the top US infectious disease expert said the CDC decision would allow people to return to work more quickly, calling it ""very prudent"" and a ""good choice"".
""With the sheer volume of new cases that we're having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don't have so many people out,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, who also serves as President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said.
Infectiousness is not like a switch. It does not just go on to off. Instead, people with Covid gradually go from a period of peak infectiousness to lower infectiousness.
The most infectious period starts a few days before symptoms develop. This is one of the reasons why the virus is so hard to contain. After about five days, the risk of passing on the virus will start to decline for most people.
But it is still possible to pass on the virus. That is why when countries started introducing isolation periods many went for 14 days. It was a belt-and-braces approach. But over time these isolation periods have been reduced, reflecting the reduced threat the virus presents as vaccines have been rolled out.
In England it has now been set at seven days if you are negative using a rapid test. That should give people a good idea if they have passed peak infectiousness and reflects the fact the UK has made these rapid tests easily accessible to everyone.
The US approach for people without symptoms is grounded in research that suggests these cases are likely to be less infectious to start with. At the end of the day, it is all about balancing the risks - from both the virus and our responses to it.
The CDC also shortened the quarantine period for people exposed to someone infected. Unvaccinated people will be required to quarantine for five days after exposure, down from 14.
The same applies to people who were more than six months on from their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two months after a Johnson & Johnson dose, and had not yet received a booster shot.
Last week, the CDC reduced the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic health workers from 10 to seven days. But they were required to take a test to end their isolation period.
While the new recommendations are not mandatory, they are closely followed by many businesses and policymakers across the US.
On Monday, President Biden pledged to deal with a shortage of tests as Omicron threatens to overwhelm hospitals.
""Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do,"" he said as he joined a call with the administration's Covid response team and state governors. ""It's clearly not enough.""
New steps will include improving at-home test manufacturing and making it easier to use Google to locate nearby test centres, he said.
Different states and local authorities in the US are introducing new measures in a bid to combat rising cases. New vaccine requirements have come into force in New York City, including a vaccine mandate for private-sector workers in the city. 
Classic comedies and characters that have kept us laughing

31;Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means;2021-12-24T00:47:27.000Z;[];['coronavirus vaccines', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['likely', 'protection', 'hospital', 'bad', 'means', 'nhs', 'good', 'omicron', 'seriously', 'virus', 'uk', 'variant'];"
The world is being hit by a tsunami of Omicron. Scientists, politicians and indeed all of us are grappling with what it means for our lives. 
Restrictions are tightening in parts of the UK and other European countries in order to tackle the new variant. 
There's a constant stream of new information - some worrying, some positive. So where do we stand?
It is easy to forget, but we are in a much brighter place than this time last year when many of us could not meet family on Christmas Day.
The ""Christmas bubble"" rules meant in parts of the country you could spend the day only with those you lived with. But there were limits on the size of gatherings across the UK. 
The rise of the Alpha variant in late 2020 led to lockdowns in November and a long one in the New Year as the vaccination programme was only just getting going. 
The rules currently in place or coming into force on Boxing Day in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are much gentler by comparison.
If you catch Omicron then you are less likely to become seriously ill than with previous variants. 
Studies from around the world are painting a consistent picture that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, with a 30% to 70% lower chance of people infected ending up in hospital. 
Omicron can cause cold-level symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose and a headache, but that does not mean it will be mild for everyone and some will still be seriously ill. 
Changes to the virus seem to have made it less dangerous, but most of the reduced severity is down to immunity as a result of vaccination and previous bouts of Covid. 
The worry is severity is only one half of the equation if you care about whether hospitals can cope. 
If Omicron is half as likely to land you in hospital, but twice as many people are infected then the two cancel out and you're back to square one. 
And Omicron's real talent is infecting people. It spreads faster than other variants and can bypass some of the immune protection from vaccines and prior infections. 
The UK has record levels of Covid with confirmed cases on Thursday reaching nearly 120,000 - and this is an underestimate of what is really going on as not everyone gets a test and people who catch it more than once aren't included in the figures.
Old age has always been the biggest risk-factor for becoming seriously ill with Covid. 
In the UK, most of the Omicron cases and people ending up in hospital are under the age of 40 so we do not know for sure what will happen when it reaches old and vulnerable populations. 
The ability of Omicron to partially evade immunity means there is the potential for more older people to be infected than during the Delta wave.
Two doses of a vaccine offer little protection against catching Omicron, which led to a massive expansion of the booster campaign.
Now more than 31 million people in the UK have enhanced their immune defences. 
However, protection against catching Omicron seems to wane after about 10 weeks. Protection against severe disease is likely to hold up much longer. 
New medicines should keep even more patients out of hospital.
They are being given to people who are at high risk from Covid, including cancer patients and people who have had an organ transplant.
Molnupiravir is an anti-viral drug that disrupts Omicron's ability to replicate inside our bodies and cuts hospital admission by 30%. Sotrovimab is an antibody therapy that sticks to the virus and cuts hospital visits by 79%.
Both suppress the virus which buys time for the immune system to react. 
A surge in Omicron could put more people in hospital at the same time as taking away the people needed to care for them. 
The sheer volume of people catching Omicron is also affecting doctors, nurses and the rest of the NHS workforce as they have to isolate too. 
Nearly 19,000 NHS staff were off with Covid on 19 December, which is 54% higher than the week before. 
Meanwhile, NHS Providers, which represents hospital and ambulance services in England, says the health service is facing its busiest Christmas period ever. And that overall, 94.5% of adult beds were occupied compared with 89% last year.
The question is whether everything in our favour - milder, antivirals, boosters - is enough to deal with a variant that spreads faster than anything we've seen before. 
Or will it take more restrictions to manage the Omicron wave?
The speed this is happening means we will know very quickly how this is going to shake down.

32;Blair becomes 'Sir Tony' and joins top royal order;2021-12-31T22:29:15.000Z;[];['uk royal family', 'tony blair', 'camilla, duchess of cornwall'];['order', 'tony', 'sir', 'immense', 'blair', 'served', 'public', 'thank', 'service', 'politics', 'honour', 'royal', 'joins', 'parts', 'dedication', 'society'];"
Tony Blair, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Baroness Amos are to be appointed as members of the Order of the Garter, England's oldest and most senior order of chivalry.
The former prime minister now becomes known as Sir Tony.
The appointments are the personal choice of the Queen, with up to 24 ""knight and lady companions"".
Baroness Amos, a former Labour cabinet minister, becomes the first black member of the order.
The ceremonial order, founded in 1348, is a recognition of significant public service, made as the personal gift of the monarch.
Mr Blair becomes Sir Tony from 1 January, as he joins the order as a ""knight companion"".
""It's an immense honour,"" he said. ""I would like to thank all those who served alongside me, in politics, public service and all parts of our society, for their dedication and commitment to our country.""
He says he will be ""Sir Tony"" rather than Sir Anthony,
There have been several fictional on-screen depictions of the relationship between the head of state and her former prime minister - but this might be seen as an act of personal recognition from the Queen. 
Baroness Amos becomes a ""lady companion"", honouring her career as international development secretary, a United Nations under-secretary for humanitarian affairs. and her current role - master of University College, Oxford.
She is the first black member appointed to the order in more than 700 years.
Baroness Amos, 67 and Tony Blair, 68, become two of the order's younger members, with most in their seventies, eighties and above, in a post held until death.
Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, is appointed as a ""royal companion"" - a move likely to be seen as showing the Queen's endorsement for Camilla's role as a senior member of the royal family and spouse of the future monarch.
The duchess has had an increasingly high profile with her own campaigns, such as warning against domestic violence.
With the new appointments there will now be 21 companions out of the maximum of 24. 
Another former prime minister, Sir John Major, is among the current members of the Order of the Garter, along with businessman and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury and former MI5 chief, Baroness Manningham-Buller.
Appointments are usually made in April, but they have been brought forward this year.
The order, instituted by Edward III in the 14th Century, was rooted in the idea of medieval chivalry and monarchs surrounded by their most senior aristocratic companions.
The modern criteria, according to Buckingham Palace, is to ""honour those who have undertaken public service, who have contributed in a particular way to national life or who have served the sovereign personally"".
The Queen takes part in an annual procession with members of the order at Windsor Castle, wearing velvet robes and plumed hats.
A banner of the heraldic arms of the knights are on display at St George's Chapel at the castle.
In Scotland there is the Order of the Thistle, instituted in 1687, with the most recent appointment made in 2018.

37;Why it matters No 10's press chief was at the Downing Street party;2021-12-09T23:16:19.000Z;[];['conservative party', 'boris johnson'];['matters', 'quit', 'heart', 'party', 'course', 'chief', 'run', 'forced', 'downing', 'happened', 'street', 'investigation', 'press', '10s', 'desire', 'staff', 'official'];"
There have already been many twists and turns in the saga of the Downing Street party, or ""gathering"" as government ministers have now taken to calling it.  
There's been a resignation already, leaked footage, questions in Parliament and now a formal investigation. 
Why therefore does it matter that we know the identity of one of those who was there? 
Well it's understood that Jack Doyle, the current Downing Street director of communications was, and he made a speech to as many as 30 people in the press team and handed out a series of awards. 
We've been told that it was a weekly occurrence for him to thank staff each Friday night. 
But on that evening of 18 December last year he gave out multiple, light-hearted awards and we've been told there was food, drink, and party games. We've also been told the event went on past midnight.
There is now an official investigation into what happened. And at the heart of government there is no desire for other staff to quit or be forced out before it has run its course. 
There is still a determination to challenge the assertion that the gathering of several dozen people was really a party, rather than a permitted get-together of work colleagues.
There is no question that the press team in No 10 work hard and put in extremely long hours. At that point in time they were dealing with the pandemic and the final crescendo of the Brexit talks too. 
But other sources in Westminster are now questioning whether it is possible for Mr Doyle to stay in his job. 
In part that's because one of the problems this week for No 10 has been their efforts to deny and explain what did or didn't happen. 
Ministers, and the prime minister himself have been stuck in the Kafka-esque position of saying that they are sure no rules were broken, but they also don't know what went on. 
If they don't know what happened, how can they be sure that nothing went wrong? 
And if multiple sources have said there was a gathering of several dozen people, and people who were not on the Downing Street payroll were invited, how can that have been just a few work drinks at the desk in a Covid-secure office? 
Mr Doyle, well liked by his colleagues, is - as director of communications - in charge of the government's messaging. 
This week that message has misfired, which makes his confirmed attendance a very big problem. 
And as government spinners over the years have often found, there is one fundamental error which they cannot make. That's to become part of the story themselves, an uncomfortable position that Boris Johnson's press chief now finds himself in. 
For governments to function, the public has to be able to put their faith in the message they are hearing day to day. 
When that falters, as it has this last few torrid days, that can be costly for a government. 
Right now that's a price that the prime minister can ill afford.

40;South Africa says Omicron wave may have peaked;2021-12-31T02:04:55.000Z;[];['south africa', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['wave', 'licensing', 'sell', 'africa', 'peaked', 'south', 'restrictions', 'movement', 'rules', 'midnight', 'instead', 'normal', 'omicron', 'include', 'lifting'];"
South Africa has lifted overnight curfew rules, with officials saying the country may have passed the peak of its fourth wave of Covid-19 infections.
A government statement said the Omicron variant, while highly transmissible, had seen lower hospitalisation rates than previous waves.
There had been a marginal increase in the number of deaths, it added. 
The variant - first reported by South Africa last month - is spreading fast elsewhere leading to widespread curbs. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of a ""tsunami"" of infections from Delta and Omicron variants that could overwhelm health systems.
But in South Africa, a statement released after a special cabinet meeting said cases and hospital admission rates had dropped in almost all provinces across the country. 
For the week ending 25 December 2021, the number of confirmed infections stood at 89,781 - down from 127,753 the week before.
The changes announced include lifting restrictions on movement between midnight and 04:00. Businesses will also be allowed to sell alcohol under normal licensing rules, instead of closing at 23:00.
Overnight curfew rules of varying severities have been in place since a national state of disaster was declared in late March 2020. 
The country still has ""spare capacity for admission of patients even for routine health services"" despite the Omicron wave, officials said.
The public are still being urged to get vaccinated and follow public health protocols, including mandatory mask-wearing.
Gatherings remain capped at 1,000 people indoors and 2,000 outdoors or 50% at venue capacity to allow for social distancing.
The National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) will monitor the situation and make adjustments if necessary or if hospital pressure increases, officials said.
South Africa has recorded almost 3.5 million Covid-19 cases and more than 90,000 deaths during the pandemic - more than any other country in Africa. 
Many countries around the world are battling the Omicron wave while weighing up restrictions:

42;California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests;2022-01-01T00:02:08.000Z;[];['our planet now', 'trees', 'wildfires', 'california wildfires', 'climate change', 'forest', 'california'];['way', 'remains', 'points', 'looked', 'californias', 'trees', 'ravage', 'crying', 'saw', 'threaten', 'tree', 'christy', 'fires', 'sequoia', 'mighty', 'forests'];"
California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

""So now finally, we're on the map,"" says Philip Balhoa about Lüderitz, a town in southern Namibia, where harsh desert meets pale ocean. 
The port town has previously benefited from diamonds and fishing booms, but now struggles with high rates of unemployment and aging infrastructure. 
A proposed green hydrogen project is set to be ""the third revolution of Lüderitz,"" says Mr Balhoa, a member of the town council. 
He hopes that the project will train and employ local people, or ""Buchters"" as they affectionately call themselves - bringing down the town's 55% unemployment rate. 
""For a town that's really been struggling economically over the past 10 or 15, maybe longer, years, this is something that people are really very excited about,"" he says.
The project will be based near the town in the Tsau //Khaeb National Park, and ultimately produce around 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year.
In simple terms, the renewable energy from the sun and wind will be used to separate hydrogen molecules from desalinated water.
Those hydrogen molecules in their pure form or in derivative green ammonia can make up a variety of products, including sustainable fuels. 
The preferred bidder, Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, is set to start production in 2026 and will have the rights to the project for 40 years, once the necessary feasibility processes are concluded. 
The firm says the four years of construction are likely to create 15,000 direct jobs and 3,000 more during full operations - and that 90% of them will be filled by locals. 
Mr James Mnyupe is the Namibian government's presidential economic advisor and hydrogen commissioner. He explains that Lüderitz's location is ideal, because of the extensive solar and wind resources and the proximity to the ocean, both as a water source and a port. 
Mr Mnyupe says this is all part of a plan for change in Namibia by President Hage Geingob. ""The president was very keen to craft an economic recovery plan that is responsive, globally relevant, and systemic in nature."" 
This forms part of a much bigger development fuelled by green hydrogen that the government hopes to find funding for, expanding into agriculture, logistics and energy. Mr Mnyupe speaks of green hydrogen trains and pipelines to trade with neighbouring countries. 
There are hopes of creating renewable electricity, both for export and as an alternative to imported coal power from South Africa. 
""The idea is to turn Namibia into not just a green hydrogen hub, but into a synthetic fuels industry powerhouse,"" he says. 
The impact is set to be international, with agreements already signed with Germany, Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 
This comes with some funding agreements, but Namibia is looking at more options, such as green or sustainable bonds, towards the roughly $9.4bn (£7.1bn) needed for the initial project.
To put the size of the investment into perspective - Namibia's entire GDP in 2020 was just $10.7bn.
""People could start taking us seriously as a trading partner, and not a net recipient of development assistance,"" says Mr Mnyupe. ""For the ordinary Namibian, this means hope.""
More technology of business:
Mr Balhoa expects that the planned influx of people and business will strengthen infrastructure in Lüderitz, like roads and hospitals, and that the project will attract more investment from the central government into the area. 
But the optimism comes with matching concerns. Mr Balhoa says previous large projects have not invested back into the community as hoped. The are worries that the small town will not be able to meet the increased infrastructure demands - with accessible housing already being a big challenge. 
""I do believe it's going to be a game changer, not just for Namibia, but for the African continent,"" says Kennedy Chege, a researcher and PhD candidate at the Mineral Law in Africa research chair, University of Cape Town.
But he warns that the main challenges is financing: ""Trying to develop renewable energy plans normally requires so much funding, and the government itself is not able to actually provide that funding through its budget. So it requires mobilizing funding from both the public sector and the private sectors.""
Mr Chege says Namibia's international partnerships are a positive sign. 
Another challenge is the amount of water that is required to produce hydrogen. Doing this through desalination, as Namibia plans to, can be expensive - as are the electrolysis processes used later in the hydrogen-making process. 
Mr Chege says concerns about the viability of the project and creating the kind of infrastructure needed are valid, but he is hopeful given Namibia's comparative advantages.
While several countries in Africa, like South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria are developing green hydrogen plans, Namibia is the more advanced. ""But in terms of implementation, there hasn't been much progress in that regard, throughout Africa.""
While there is much to be done, Namibia is pushing ahead - so much so, that the government might announce a call for proposals for a second green hydrogen project as early as January 2022.

46;What is behind Scottish home price inflation?;2021-12-16T06:21:14.000Z;[];['housing market', 'inflation', 'scotland business'];['surge', 'scottish', 'supply', 'price', 'savings', 'rung', 'rest', 'spend', 'inflation', 'remains', 'squirrelled', 'rush', 'travel'];"
The cost of buying a home in Scotland has risen by an average of £18,000 in the year to October, or 11.3%. 
That's according to the monthly figures issued by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
That draws on property transaction details filed with Registers of Scotland, which buyers are obliged to do within weeks, and it represents an easing of the inflation rate that was seen in the preceding months. Although it's usually a quiet month for transactions, August saw a 16% increase on the previous year.
If you go back to that previous year, the market was distorted by pent-up demand from the months when viewing homes was banned, and it was near impossible to buy or sell them. In October last year, 13,000 homes were sold.  October 2021 was down to 9,600.
Property is just one of the prices on the rise. The basket of consumer goods that are combined to give us the UK consumer price index was 5.1% more expensive in November this year than the year before. 
The reasons are various, but most come down to the word ""disruption"" - of markets, of supply chains, labour shortages and power play in the global energy markets.
The latest rumblings between Russia and its European customers for gas have this week seen a further spike in wholesale prices, to reach new record levels, which will feed through to the capped price when it is next allowed to rise in April.
The ONS does not publish a breakdown of different inflation rates for the nations and regions of the UK. But the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does give that a try, with its monthly tracker. Stripping out the biggest and smallest changes, to remove distortions, it reckons that Scotland has the same inflation rate as the UK as a whole, with London significantly higher.
There are expectations that the inflation rate will continue to rise until a peak in April, when the energy price cap is raised. That's the same month National Insurance Contributions go up, hitting payroll deductions. And council tax is likely to rise, with the brakes removed by the Scottish government.
But property has continued to surge ahead of other costs. Average UK prices are 41% higher than they were only six years ago. The problem, agrees everyone in the industry, is the strong level of demand but weak level of supply.  
Simple economics tells you what's going to happen next, or you can try buying a home yourself, and you'll probably find out quite quickly.
Having started with lots of statistics, let's assume you don't mind reading some more, indicating how the property market has been functioning, or failing to:
One other piece of economic research, just published by the Bank of England, tries to isolate the impact of the lockdown effect - people wanting to move home to get more space, or to get out of the city.  Viewed from the City of London, getting out of the city means getting out of London.
They compare price inflation for flats with houses of similar size, and compare the price inflation in London with outside the metropolis. What they conclude is that this effect accounts for nearly half the surge in prices that we've seen.
The rest? That lack of supply remains part of the story. Plus, perhaps, a rush to get onto the first rung of the property ladder before it is lifted out of reach. And making use of the surge in savings squirrelled away while we haven't had so much to spend on travel or hospitality over the past 20 months.
Those savings, earning next to nothing in savings accounts, are now losing spending power at a rate of 5.1% - so that's another incentive to find something to invest them in, and in Britain, property remains a popular choice.

47;Omicron: Why do boosters work if two doses struggle?;2021-12-14T01:18:05.000Z;[];['coronavirus vaccines', 'james gallagher', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['struggle', 'parts', 'mutated', 'heavily', 'boosters', 'wriggle', 'doses', 'mutations', 'tightly', 'omicrons', 'omicron', 'virus', 'work', 'variant', 'help'];"
The heavily mutated Omicron variant has led to a serious dent in the ability of vaccines to protect us from catching the Covid virus. 
Two doses of some vaccines offer almost no protection from an Omicron infection, although they should still greatly reduce the risk of becoming so ill you need hospital care. 
The vaccines were all developed to fight the first form of the virus that emerged two years ago. 
So can a third or ""booster"" dose of those original vaccines make the difference or has Omicron already outwitted the protection they can give?
Fortunately for us - while the contents of the syringe may be identical, a booster is not just more of the same for the immune system. 
The protection you're left with after the third dose is bigger, broader and more memorable than you had before. 
Fighting coronavirus is something your immune system has to learn. 
One option is to figure it out on the job when you encounter the virus for real. However, there is a risk of getting it wrong and ending up seriously ill. 
Vaccines are more like a school - a safer environment to further your immune system's Covid education.
The first dose is the primary school education that nails the fundamentals. 
Your second and third doses are comparable to sending your immune system to secondary school and then university to dramatically deepen its understanding. It's not just repeating primary school over and over. 
""The immune system is left with a richer knowledge and understanding of the virus,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham. 
He said for all the talk of the dastardly tricks of Omicron, a highly-trained immune system is ""an incredibly difficult and hostile environment"" for the virus and its variants. 
Antibodies are a major beneficiary of this education. 
These are the sticky proteins that attach themselves to the outside of the coronavirus. Neutralising antibodies can gum up the virus so it can't invade your cells. Others sit there as the biological equivalent of a flashing neon sign spelling out ""kill this virus"". 
A flurry of laboratory studies and real world data showed the neutralising antibodies you have after two doses of a Covid vaccine were far less effective against Omicron. 
Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist from Imperial College London, said you were left with ""absolutely zilch"" and were a ""sitting duck for infection"". 
So back to school. 
Every dose of the vaccine triggers another round of antibody evolution within the immune system. It seeks out better antibodies that attach themselves more firmly to the virus. It's a process called affinity maturation.
""Your antibodies are a better fit as time goes on, they are getting fancier and more sophisticated,"" said Prof Altmann. 
If the antibodies are able to bind more tightly to the coronavirus then it will be harder for Omicron's mutations to help it wriggle free. And while the new variant is heavily mutated, it is still the same fundamental virus and has parts that have not changed at all.
Further rounds of vaccination also lead to the immune system broadening its antibody repertoire as it finds new ways of attacking the virus. 
It's not just about the quality of antibodies, the quantity goes up with boosting too.
Prof Charles Bangham, from Imperial, said: ""You get more of them, the concentration in the blood increases and we don't know how long this is going to last, but the more times you're vaccinated the longer-lasting the immune memory is.""
The impact of all this is clear in the same studies that showed two doses were weaker against Omicron. The protection against getting any Covid symptoms shot up to around 75% after the booster. 
Elsewhere in the immune system, boosting is giving our bodies the upper hand against future variants too.
B-cells are the part of the body that mass produce antibodies. Some mature to produce those super-sticky, highly refined antibodies after boosting. Others can spot coronavirus, but remain half-baked and flexible. 
""These can go off in different directions and when they proliferate they start to go after the new variant,"" said Prof Ball.
And then there's T-cells, which again become more plentiful and better at attacking Covid viruses in response to boosting. 
T-cells use a different trick to spot the virus and patrol our body looking for any sign of cells being infected with Covid. T-cells recognise parts of the coronavirus that the virus finds harder to mutate. 
So while Omicron is squirming away from our immune system, each vaccine dose and indeed each infection is giving our body's defences more tools to hunt it down. 
All this bodes well for vaccines protecting us from becoming seriously ill. 
""Immunity against a virus is almost never absolute - you can almost always get re-infected and what you want to do is get re-infection so trivial you don't know you've got it or it's very mild,"" said Prof Bangham.

48;Thwaites: Antarctic glacier heading for dramatic change;2021-12-13T20:44:47.000Z;[];['glaciers', 'climate change'];['shelf', 'uncoupled', 'persists', 'thwaites', 'heading', 'glacier', 'likely', 'dramatic', 'itgc', 'change', 'ridge', 'antarctic', 'team', 'ice', 'ongoing', 'pinning'];"
Scientists are warning of dramatic changes at one of the biggest glaciers in Antarctica, potentially within the next five to 10 years.
They say a floating section at the front of Thwaites Glacier that until now has been relatively stable could ""shatter like a car windscreen"". 
US and UK researchers are currently engaged in an intense study programme at Thwaites because of its melt rate. 
Already it is dumping 50 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean each year.
This is having limited impact on global sea-levels today, but there is sufficient ice held upstream in the glacier's drainage basin to raise the height of the oceans by 65cm - were it all to melt.
Such a ""doomsday"" scenario is unlikely to come about for many centuries, but the study team says Thwaites is now responding to a warming world in really quite rapid ways.
""There is going to be dramatic change in the front of the glacier, probably in less than a decade. Both published and unpublished studies point in that direction,"" said glaciologist Prof Ted Scambos, US lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC). 
""This will accelerate the pace (of Thwaites) and widen, effectively, the dangerous part of the glacier,"" he told BBC News.
Thwaites is a colossus. It's roughly the size of Great Britain, or Florida, and its outflow speed has doubled in the past 30 years.
The ITGC has established how this is happening. It is the result of warm ocean water getting under - and melting - Thwaites's floating front, or ice shelf as it's known.
The warm water is thinning and weakening this ice, making it run faster and pushing back the zone where the main glacier body becomes buoyant.
At the moment, the leading edge of the eastern ice shelf is pinned in place by an offshore underwater ridge, which means its flow speed is a third of that seen in the ice shelf's western sector which has no such constraint.
But the ITGC team says the eastern shelf is likely to become uncoupled from the ridge in the next few years which will destabilise it. And even if the pinning persists, the ongoing development of fractures in the shelf ice will almost certainly break up the area anyway.

""I visualise it somewhat similar to that car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction,"" explained Dr Erin Pettit from Oregon State University.
The affected area is very small when considered in the context of the glacier as a whole, but it is the shift to a new regime and what this means for further ice loss that is the real significance.
At present, the eastern shelf, which has a width of about 40km, moves forward at about 600m per year. The coming change in status will probably see the following ice jump in speed to about 2km per year - the same as the current velocity recorded in the 80km-wide western sector.
Jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, the five-year ITGC project is putting Thwaites under unprecedented scrutiny. 
Each Antarctic summer season, teams of scientists are investigating the glacier's behaviour in every way possible. From satellite, on the ice, and from ships in front of Thwaites.
Those teams are en route for the new season right now, some in Covid quarantine ahead of their deployment to the field.
One of the projects for the New Year will see the tubby yellow submarine known as ""Boaty McBoatface"" dive under Thwaites' floating ice to gather data on water temperature, current direction and turbulence - all factors that influence melting.
The autonomous vehicle will go on missions lasting one to four days, navigating its own path through the cavity beneath the shelf. This is high risk as the seafloor terrain is extremely rugged. 
""It's scary. We might not get Boaty back,"" conceded Dr Alex Phillips from the UK's National Oceanography Centre.  
""We've put a lot of effort this past year into developing collision avoidance for the vehicle, to make sure it doesn't crash into the seabed. We also have contingencies whereby if it does get into trouble, it can retrace its steps and retreat to safety.""
The latest science on Thwaites Glacier is being presented this week at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans.

Sony has said its £50m investment in the Welsh makers of His Dark Materials could propel it to become Europe's biggest drama producer.
Cardiff-based Bad Wolf sold a majority stake to Sony Pictures and said the deal would allow it to expand. 
Sony's Wayne Garvie said Bad Wolf had yet to reach its ""zenith"" and would continue to grow.
It is the largest UK production company outside London and will co-produce Doctor Who with the BBC from 2023.
The investment by Sony Pictures is understood to be between £50m and £60m.
Mr Garvie, Sony Pictures' president of international production, worked with Bad Wolf founders Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner at the BBC.
Tranter and Gardner were responsible for bringing the production of Doctor Who to Cardiff in 2005, and cited that positive experience as one of the reasons why they established Bad Wolf in Splott in 2015.
The name Bad Wolf is a reference to an entity in the first series of Doctor Who that was made in Wales.
Since 2015, it has produced the Philip Pullman trilogy His Dark Materials, the drama Industry for the BBC - which it has just finished the second series of - as well as A Discovery of Witches for Sky. 
Mr Garvie said: ""We have invested in a company that has not reached its zenith.
""We have [another] company called Left Bank Pictures who make The Crown, which you may have watched, and which is Britain's biggest drama company. And we built that together with the founders of the company over about eight years or so.
""And we want to do the same with Bad Wolf. There is no reason why Bad Wolf should not be or could not be the biggest drama producer in Britain and in Europe. And that is our ambition.""
Mr Garvie said Wales' recent history in producing high-end TV and film helped the decision to invest.
""One of the things we found really attractive about Bad Wolf was the passion they had for Wales, the people in Wales and their commitment to Wales,"" he added.
Tranter, Bad Wolf's chief executive, said: ""The kind of television dramas that Bad Wolf produces are huge. It is a very scary thing to do.
""We love it, and we want to go on and do bigger shows. But there comes a point when we have to acknowledge that in order to produce on an increasing scale and ambition, we need to take a partner and collaborator and investor with us on that journey.""
Ms Tranter said Sony's experience would help ""stabilise"" the company, but she wanted the investment to propel it into the ""next phase of its journey"".
Tom Ware, director of production and performance at the University of South Wales (USW), said Bad Wolf had boosted the creative industries.
""The kind of content they produce - big, high-end TV dramas that can be distributed globally - has put Welsh screen industries on the map.
""It has also contributed massively to the development of talent across a wide range of areas - obviously production, but also animation, visual effects and lots of other areas of the screen industries that were here before they came, but Bad Wolf's presence has kick-started their development.""
To address sometimes chronic shortages of crews, Bad Wolf has developed its own training and worked with education providers to recruit new staff.
Mr Ware said more than 100 USW graduates had gone on to work at the production company, adding: ""It has been great for all educational institutions in Wales, but more to the point it has been a huge boost for the Welsh economy.""

Two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant, UK scientists have warned. 
Early analysis of UK Omicron and Delta cases showed the vaccines were less effective at stopping the new variant. 
But a third booster prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. 
Meanwhile, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, who chaired a meeting with first ministers of the devolved nations this afternoon, warned the UK faces a ""deeply concerning situation"".
Speaking after the meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, he said measures taken so far were ""proportionate"", but ministers were ""absolutely"" keeping everything under review.
""Action is absolutely required, and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data,"" he added.
It comes as another 448 cases of Omicron were confirmed in the UK, taking the number reported so far to 1,265. The total number of Covid cases recorded on Friday was 58,194 - the highest figure since 9 January. 
The government has said it is updating its guidance for care homes in England - limiting the number of visitors allowed per resident, and increasing testing ""in order to balance the current Covid-19 risk"".
One of the main concerns since the heavily-mutated Omicron variant first emerged was that it would make vaccines less effective. 
The UK Health Security Agency report analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines were against the new variant.
The analysis is based on limited data, but showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop off for two doses of Pfizer. 
The 75% protection against Covid symptoms after a booster is not as high as against previous variants.
There was not enough data to analyse the Moderna or Janssen vaccines, but there is no reason to think they would have different results.
However, the UK Health Security Agency said vaccines were still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that needed hospital treatment. 
So far, around 22 million people have received a booster dose, but even if everyone was boosted the lower vaccine effectiveness would still leave millions of people susceptible. 
The real-world data backs up laboratory studies that showed a 40-fold reduction in the ability of antibodies from double-vaccinated people to take out the virus. 
There is optimism that vaccines will still keep many people out of hospital even if more do get Covid. Data on severity could be published next week.
However, an Omicron wave could be problematic even if it was milder. A large and sudden wave could lead to everyone who is still vulnerable needing hospital care at the same time. 
The rapid surge in Omicron cases was already hinting that the variant was getting around some of the protection given by vaccines. 
It is estimated that the number of Omicron cases is doubling every two to three days. 
The UKHSA estimates that more than half of all cases in the country will be Omicron by mid-December and that if growth continues unabated there will be more than 100,000 cases a day by the end of the month. 
Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain.""
""We expect the vaccines to show higher protection against the serious complications of COVID-19, so if you haven't yet had your first two doses please book an appointment straight away.""
The research comes amid concern about the growing numbers of Omicron cases in the UK. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned of a ""tsunami"" of cases as she tightened Covid isolation rules and encouraged people to cancel Christmas party plans.
Under the new guidance for care homes in England, residents will only be permitted to receive visits from three people, plus one essential care giver.
The Department of Health and Social Care said testing would also increase for fully-vaccinated residents making visits outside and for staff, and there vaccination teams were being expanded to increase the take-up of the booster jab.

54;Kim Jong-un: North Korea to focus on economy in 2022;2022-01-01T07:40:25.000Z;[];['kim jong-un', 'north korea'];['focus', 'kim', 'relations', 'north', 'economy', 'speech', 'senior', 'sejong', 'jongun', 'korea', 'researcher', 'replacement', 'seongchang', '2022', 'report', 'told', 'shortest'];"
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said the faltering economy will be the national priority this year as the country faces a ""great life-and-death struggle"". 
He was speaking at the end of a key ruling party meeting, which coincides with him being in power for 10 years. 
A self-imposed coronavirus blockade has left North Korea struggling with food shortages. 
There was no direct mention of the US or South Korea in his speech. 
Mr Kim said increasing development and improving people's living standards was the main task. 
He acknowledged the ""harsh situation"" in 2021 and and set ""an important task for making radical progress in solving the food, clothing and housing problem for the people"", the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
He said battling the pandemic was one of the main goals for the coming year: ""Emergency epidemic prevention work should be made a top priority in the state work,"" he is quoted as saying by KCNA.
But he also said Pyongyang would continue to strengthen its defence capabilities because of an increasingly unstable military environment on the Korean peninsula.
He was speaking on Friday at the end of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which began on Monday.
There were reports earlier this year that people in the country were going hungry, giving rise to concerns as winter approached about a full-blown food crisis.
The border has been closed since January 2020 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China.
Following a year in which leader Kim Jong-un repeatedly stressed North Korea's dire economic condition and food shortages, these challenges were once again in the spotlight at the ruling Workers' Party's year-end plenum.
Kim's warning of a ""great life-or-death struggle"" in 2022 echoes last April's rhetoric urging officials to prepare for another ""Arduous March"", referencing North Korea's greatest economic crisis and famine in the 1990s.
While such comparisons overexaggerate the situation, North Korea's economic woes have indeed been exacerbated by Covid-19-related border closures, international sanctions and natural disasters.
These have all contributed to what Kim described in June as a ""tense"" food situation, and international agencies also warn of growing food insecurity and starvation.
Kim's emphasis on implementation of the national economic plan, rural development and advancing ""scientific farming"" now serves to remind citizens that their leader is prioritising their needs, while setting expectations for another year of economic struggles.       
Mr Kim's new year speeches have previously included messages to South Korea and the US, but there were no explicit mentions this time.
""If we consider this report on the plenum as a replacement of Kim Jong-un's annual New Year's speech, it can be said that it's by far the shortest mention of inter-Korean relations and foreign policy ever,"" Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at Sejong Institute, told NK News.
At the end of last year, North and South Korea, the US, and China agreed in principle to declare a formal end to the Korean War which ended in an armistice.
But talks have yet to begin because of North Korea's demands, South Korea has said.

56;French ban on plastic packaging for fruit and vegetables begins;2021-12-31T22:50:54.000Z;[];['france', 'plastic pollution', 'emmanuel macron', 'environment'];['plastics', 'ban', 'statement', 'french', 'single', 'substitution', 'reusable', 'packaging', 'throwaway', 'fruit', 'vegetables', 'uses', 'plastic', 'begins', 'recyclable'];"
A new law banning plastic packaging on most fruit and vegetables comes into effect in France from New Year's day.
Cucumbers, lemons and oranges are among the 30 varieties banned from being wrapped in plastic.
Larger packs as well as chopped or processed fruit will be exempt.
President Emmanuel Macron called the ban ""a real revolution"" and said it showed the country's commitment to phase out single use plastics by 2040. 
More than a third of fruit and vegetable products in France are thought to be sold in plastic wrapping, and government officials believe that the ban could prevent a billion items of single use plastics being used every year. 
In a statement announcing the new law, the Environment Ministry said that France uses an ""outrageous amount"" of single use plastics and that the new ban ""aims at cutting back the use of throwaway plastic and boost its substitution by other materials or reusable and recyclable packaging"". 
The ban forms part of a multi-year programme introduced by Mr Macron's government that will see plastics slowly eased out in many industries. 
From 2021, the country banned plastic straws, cups and cutlery, as well as polystyrene takeaway boxes. 
And later in 2022 public spaces will be forced to provide water fountains to reduce the use of plastic bottles, publications will have to be shipped without plastic wrapping, and fast-food restaurants will no longer be able offer free plastic toys.
However, industry figures have expressed concerns over the speed at which the new ban is being introduced. 
Philippe Binard, from the European Fresh Produce Association, said the ""removal of plastic packaging from most fruit and vegetables at such short notice does not allow alternatives to be tested and introduced in a timely manner and stocks of existing packaging to be cleared"". 
Several other European countries have announced similar bans in recent months as they pursue commitments made at the recent COP26 conference in Glasgow. 
Earlier this month Spain announced that it will introduce a ban on the sale of fruit and vegetables in plastic packaging from 2023 to allow business to find alternative solutions.
Mr Macron's government also announced several other new environmental regulations, including rules calling on car adverts to promote greener alternatives such as walking and cycling.

At least 12 people were killed and several others injured after a stampede at a religious shrine in India.
Pilgrims were visiting the shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi in Indian-administered Kashmir on Saturday when the tragedy unfolded. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ""saddened"" by the loss of life. 
Tens of thousands of people usually visit the shrine every day, and it is thought there was a peak in visitors because of the holiday season.
According to a senior police officer, 14 people were injured in the stampede, with all of them taken to hospital.
One senior government official told AFP news agency that the death toll could rise as the shrine was incredibly busy with people trying to visit for the New Year. 
The shrine, located near the town of Katra, is among India's most revered pilgrimage sites. Visitor numbers have been capped to around 25,000 because of the pandemic.
It is not yet clear caused the stampede in the early hours of the morning, but some eyewitnesses claimed crowds at the site were not being managed properly.
An investigation into the incident has been launched. 
In a tweet, Mr Modi said: ""Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede at Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan. May the injured recover soon.""

59;New Year's Day is warmest on record in the UK, Met Office says;2022-01-01T15:36:07.000Z;[];['met office'];['north', 'real', 'record', 'winds', 'especially', 'northerly', 'warmest', 'southerly', 'replaced', 'met', 'showers', 'office', 'uk', 'wintery', 'day'];"
The UK is having the warmest New Year's Day on record, with new high temperatures set for the second day in a row, the Met Office says. 
St James's Park in central London saw temperatures of 16.2C (61.2F) on Saturday as 2022 was ushered in. 
Warm air from the Azores has been reaching the UK in recent days, bringing unusually mild weather.
The previous New Year's Day record was set in 1916, when it reached 15.6C (60.1F) in Bude, Cornwall. 
Saturday's record is still provisional as temperatures could get even higher as the day progresses. 
Friday became the warmest New Year's Eve on record.
BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich said: ""We've had winds coming from the south and south west bringing very warm air from the Azores - nearly all the way from the tropics - wafting across the UK and it's that which has lifted the temperatures.
""It's been with us for a few days now and warming up day by day.""
Sunday will be a little colder but temperatures will be still well above normal for this time of year, he added. 
The mild weather currently being seen is widespread across the UK, he added. 
""Around Tuesday it will be much colder as the southerly winds are replaced by northerly winds,"" he said. ""There could be some wintery showers, especially in the north of the UK. It will be a real change."" 
It will drop to somewhere between 6C and 9C, he said - in line with the average temperatures of 7C or 8C for the start of January.
In Edinburgh, it could get to as low as 3C on Tuesday. 
The Met Office say the UK's record temperatures have all been elevated by manmade climate change which has raised temperatures globally by 1.1C.
Cold records are still being broken, as in the Beast from the East storm in 2018. 
But the Met Office say warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently - a clear sign of an over-heating planet.
The winter wildfires in Colorado are arguably even more alarming than unseasonal warmth in the UK.  
It's too soon to say what role human-driven climate change may have played in the disaster - but it's the latest episode of regular weather patterns being disrupted. 
Meanwhile, different regions of Alaska are experiencing record high and low temperatures at the same time.
Climate scientists warn that we can expect many more extremes as the planet continues to heat. And attempts to reduce emissions have been undermined by several factors, including President Biden's struggle with climate policies in the USA.
The Met Office said Scotland had also recorded its warmest New Year's Day temperature, which was 15.9C in Achnagart in the Highlands. 
The previous record was 14.5C in Inverurie in 1992.  
Overnight on Friday, it reached 16.5C in Bala, Gwynedd, north Wales, making it the hottest New Year's Eve on record. 
It has been so warm that the skating rink at London's Somerset House had to close on New Year's Day because the ice was being affected.

The funeral mass for South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has taken place at the Anglican cathedral in Cape Town.
Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the racist regime in South Africa, died last Sunday aged 90. 
In his eulogy, President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu as ""the spiritual father of our new nation"". 
Tutu had insisted there should be no ""lavish spending"" on the funeral. He wanted ""the cheapest available coffin"".
Family, friends, clergy and politicians were among those who gathered at St George's Cathedral for Saturday's service, which had limited numbers because of coronavirus restrictions. Tutu's widow Nomalizo Leah sat in a wheelchair at the front of the congregation wearing a purple shawl - the colour of her late husband's clerical robes. 
Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.  
In the main eulogy at the official state funeral on Saturday, Mr Ramaphosa described the archbishop as a ""crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace. Not only in South Africa… but around the world as well"". 
""If we are to understand a global icon to be someone of great moral stature, of exceptional qualities, and of service to humanity there can be no doubt that it refers to the man we're laying to rest today,"" he said. 
Saturday's funeral was given a special status, usually designated for presidents and very important people.
Tutu had requested that the only flowers in the cathedral should be a ""bouquet of carnations from his family"", according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.
His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George's Cathedral - the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years.
It was earlier revealed that Tutu is to be aquamated - a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. 
Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Cape Town
Even though only 100 invited guests physically attended Archbishop Desmond Tutu's funeral service at the St George's cathedral, many turned up to honour him by watching proceedings from public viewing areas. Most were visibly emotional. 
One man described his attendance of Tutu's funeral as a full-circle moment because he also witnessed the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and watched Tutu and Mandela hold hands with their fists in the air as South Africa became a democracy. 
It's the end of an era. 
The last of South Africa's well-known freedom fighters leaves behind a difficult task for the leaders of the nation: to rid the country of corruption and racial divisions and lead the way forward, in the spirit of the moral compass which was the guiding force of Tutu's leadership.
In a video message at the mass, the Archbishop of Canterbury described how Tutu ""lit up the world"". He said that his paying tribute to Tutu was ""like a mouse giving a tribute to an elephant"".
Tutu's daughter said the outpouring of love for her father had ""warmed the cockles of our hearts"".
""Because we shared him with the world, you share part of the love you held for him with us,"" she said. 
Many people in Cape Town turned up to file past the archbishop's coffin as it lay in state. 
One man, Wally Mdluli, hitchhiked more than 1,000km (620 miles) across the country from Bloemfontein to Cape Town - enlisting the help of family and friends to pay for some of the trip and even sleeping at a petrol station on the way.
""I feel fulfilled after I saw the coffin. It's like his spirit is in me,"" he told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town.
Tutu used his high profile to speak out against the oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. 
After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both white and black people during the apartheid era.
Tutu was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system.
He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

A total of 874 cars have been set alight during New Years Eve celebrations in France, police say.
However, the interior ministry said the number was much lower than in 2019. Authorities also reported a rise in the number of people stopped and detained.
A curfew to tackle Covid-19 meant no significant disruption took place this time last year. 
Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in several cities.
Some 95,000 police and gendarmes were mobilised during recent New Year's celebrations, French media report - including 32,000 firefighters and security personnel.
In Paris, where face masks have been made compulsory again, 779 people were fined for not wearing a mask.
While restrictions have been partially lifted in France, more rules will come into place this month due to concerns for the Omicron variant.
From 3 January, public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people for indoor events, and remote working will become compulsory for those who are able to.

62;Covid: UAE bans foreign travel for citizens without booster jab;2022-01-01T17:20:27.000Z;[];['coronavirus vaccines', 'united arab emirates', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'booster', 'world', 'data', 'bans', 'citizens', 'vaccinated', 'received', 'fully', 'jab', 'population', 'uae', 'foreign', 'covid19', 'travel'];"
The United Arab Emirates has announced that it will ban citizens who have not had three doses of a vaccine against Covid-19 from travelling abroad. 
Officials said the exit ban, which comes into force on 10 January, would not apply to those who are medically exempt from receiving the vaccine.
It is the latest country to announce new curbs amid a rise in infections. 
Many countries impose strict restrictions on unvaccinated people before they are allowed in. 
This varies from a requirement for a negative Covid test before travel to mandatory quarantine upon arrival. 
More than 90% of the population in the UAE has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. About 34% had received the booster jab as of 24 December, according to Our World in Data.
Studies have found that a booster shot offers better protection against the heavily-mutated Omicron variant. , which has been spreading rapidly in countries around the world.
The new travel rules in the UAE were announced by the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
They were devised to ""ensure that health and safety are prioritised"", the Emirates News Agency reported. 
They said the ban on unvaccinated passengers would also be lifted in ""humanitarian cases"" and in cases where people were travelling for medical treatment. 
Foreign workers make up the vast majority of the resident population in the Gulf state and will not be affected by the new restrictions, which only apply to citizens.
The UAE has reported over 750,000 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began, and more than 2,000 deaths.

Fireworks have killed three people and injured scores others in Europe despite bans being in place against their use.
In the Netherlands, a 12-year-old boy was killed and another seriously injured watching an adult set off a home-made device, local media reported.
Dutch police have arrested a man. 
In Germany, a 37-year-old man was killed in a fireworks explosion on New Year's Eve in the western town of Hennef. Police are investigating. 
There were several people injured in incidents around Germany, German news agency DPA reported,
At least 80 people were hurt by fireworks in the Netherlands, according to De Telegraaf, including people losing feet and hands in explosions. 
Both the Netherlands and Germany banned the sale of fireworks over the New Year period because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Dutch officials justified the move by saying firework-related injuries would put too much strain on hospitals fighting the virus.
Despite this, enthusiasts in both countries have not been deterred, with people crossing borders to buy up festive pyrotechnics or in some cases making them themselves.
In Austria there were also several incidents, including one in which a 23-year-old man was killed returning to a firework that did not detonate.

A Belgian scientific research station in Antarctica is dealing with an outbreak of Covid-19, despite workers being fully vaccinated and based in one of the world's remotest regions. 
Since 14 December, at least 16 of the 25 workers at the Princess Elisabeth Polar Station have caught the virus.
Officials say cases remain mild so far.
""The situation isn't dramatic,"" Joseph Cheek, a project manager for the International Polar Foundation, told the BBC.
""While it has been an inconvenience to have to quarantine certain members of the staff who caught the virus, it hasn't significantly affected our work at the station overall,"" Mr Cheek said.  
""All residents of the station were offered the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on 12 January. However, they all expressed their wish to stay and continue their work,"" he added.
News of the outbreak was first reported in Belgian title Le Soir. 
The first positive test was recorded on 14 December, among a team who had arrived seven days earlier.
They and others who tested positive were placed in quarantine but the virus continued to circulate.
Staff arriving at the station must be vaccinated and tested for the virus. 
There are two emergency doctors at the station and new arrivals to the outpost have been suspended until the virus dissipates. 
Princess Elisabeth station is operated by the International Polar Foundation and went into service in 2009.  
It isn't the first time research stations in Antarctica have been affected by a coronavirus outbreak. 
Last year, a number of Chilean military personnel based at Bernardo O'Higgins research station were infected after sailors on a supply ship tested positive for the virus.

Nearly 4,400 flights around the world were cancelled on Saturday, more than 2,500 of them in the US, air traffic site FlightAware reported. 
Airlines have been struggling with staffing problems with crew quarantining after contracting Covid.
Adding to travellers' woes, heavy snow has hit the central US.
From the US cancellations, more than 1,000 are from Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.
""Today's cancellations are driven by Omicron staffing and weather-related issues. We did pre-cancel flights in anticipation of inclement weather. We've been contacting passengers early if their flights are cancelled to give them time to rebook or make other plans,"" United Airlines said in a statement.
Sunday, when many people often return home from their Christmas holidays, is likely to bring further disruption, with more snow and heavy winds forecast.
""It's too long and there's no space to spend the time, get something to eat, it's a long time here,"" one traveller stuck at O'Hara airport told ABC news in Chicago.
More on Covid around the world:
Since 24 December, more than 12,000 flights have been cancelled in the US.
Airlines have being trying to woo crew with extra pay to tackle the staff shortages. But unions say workers fear contracting Covid or having to deal with angry passengers.
The US is facing a surge in Covid cases powered by the Omicron variant.
New York City has seen record cases despite high vaccination rates. The virus has hit everything from the police force to Broadway shows, although there has not yet been a significant hike in hospitalisations. 
The city's new mayor, Eric Adams, took office on Saturday after low key New Year celebrations.

In his first speech, he said the city would not be ""controlled by crises"".
""This pandemic has not only impacted us physically, but emotionally, and I'm going to really encourage people in this city to just find that inner peace, no matter what we're going through,"" he said. 
""We have been through tragedies before. This is a resilient city and a resilient country and I want to bring that energy,""

66;Map drawn from memory helps reunite kidnapped Chinese man with family;2022-01-01T20:01:44.000Z;[];['china'];['helps', 'chinese', 'yearning', 'reunion', 'perfect', 'family', 'release', 'thank', 'man', 'thirtythree', 'map', 'memory', 'profile', 'reunite', 'waiting', 'drawn', 'wrote', 'kidnapped'];"
A Chinese man who was abducted over 30 years ago has been reunited with his biological mother after drawing a map of his childhood village from memory.
Li Jingwei was just four-years-old when he was lured away from his home and sold into a child trafficking ring. 
On 24 December he shared a hand-drawn map to the video sharing app, Douyin, which police matched to a small village and a woman whose son had disappeared. 
After DNA tests, they were reunited in Yunnan province on Saturday.
Video footage of the reunion showed the pair meeting for the first time in over three decades  and shows Li Jingwei carefully removing his mother's coronavirus mask to examine her face before breaking down in tears and embracing her.
""Thirty-three years of waiting, countless nights of yearning, and finally a map hand-drawn from memory, this is the moment of perfect release after 13 days,"" Mr Li wrote on his Douyin profile ahead of the anticipated reunion. ""Thank you, everyone who has helped me reunite with my family.""
Mr Li was abducted near the south-western city of Zhaotong in Yunnan Province in 1989 and subsequently sold to a family living over 1,800km away. 
Now living in Guangdong Province in southern China, he had no success asking his adoptive parents or consulting DNA databases about his origins. So he turned to the internet. 
""I'm a child who's finding his home. I was taken to Henan by a bald neighbour around 1989, when I was about four years old,"" he said in the video, which was shared thousands of times. 
""This is a map of my home area that I have drawn from memory,"" he said holding up a rough guide of the village, which included features like a building he believed to be a school, a bamboo forest, and a small pond.
Child abductions are not uncommon in China, a society which places high value on having a son. 
Many children are abducted at a young age and sold to other families. In 2015, it was estimated that 20,000 children were being abducted each year. 
In 2021 there were numerous examples of young men being reunited with their biological parents after long absences. 
Last July, Guo Gangtang was reunited with his son 24 years after he was abducted in the province of Shandong.

74;Covid: Pupils to wear face masks in class to tackle Omicron;2022-01-02T00:04:28.000Z;[];['schools', 'department for education', 'national association of head teachers', 'state schools', 'association of school and college leaders (ascl)', 'nasuwt'];['covid', 'sent', 'schools', 'class', 'real', 'periods', 'learning', 'wear', 'short', 'pupils', 'face', 'omicron', 'masks', 'remote', 'tackle', 'possibility', 'minimise'];"
Face masks are to be worn in secondary classrooms in England's schools to reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has announced.
The temporary reintroduction of face coverings aims to address concerns about schools remaining open for face-to-face learning this coming term.
Meanwhile, six school staff unions have issued a demand for urgent action to limit the spread of the virus.
They warned national exams would be put at risk without further measures.
They also called for air-cleaning units, financial support for absence cover, help with on-site testing and a relaxation of the Ofsted inspection regime.
Schools across the UK are re-opening after the Christmas break over the next week, with pupils being asked to take part in onsite Covid testing.
Until now, England was the only one of the four UK nations where face masks were not recommended for pupils in classrooms. Teachers will not have to wear them under the new guidelines.
Announcing the change - just a few days before schools reopen - Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said face coverings would be required until 26 January.
This is when the current national Plan B Covid measures run out, although they will be reviewed on or close to 4 January.
He said: ""I'm looking forward to welcoming pupils back next week to continue their face-to-face learning, which is so important for their education and wellbeing.
""There is no doubt that the Omicron variant presents challenges but the entire education sector has responded with a Herculean effort, and for that I thank each and every one of you.
""The prime minister and I have been clear that education is our number one priority. These measures will bolster our support to schools as we do everything in our power to minimise disruption.""
The government also announced it would be making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years setting, schools and colleges.
Staff absences and rising Covid rates at the end of last term - caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant - have led to fears of further disruption to education.
The four main teaching unions covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland - ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT - plus the GMB and Unison, have issued a joint statement calling for urgent steps to help schools.
""We need the minimum amount of educational disruption this term in order to avoid a third successive year where GCSEs, A-levels and other exams have to be cancelled, and thereby removing the uncertainty and additional workload for students and teachers,"" it says.  
""It is essential, therefore, that the government takes immediate and urgent steps to mitigate the risk of Covid transmission and that it provides more support to minimise disruption in schools and colleges.""
Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said while there were obvious drawbacks to using face coverings in classrooms, it was clear that the Omicron variant poses a very significant additional risk.
""It is absolutely essential that everything possible is done to reduce transmission and ensure that children remain in school.""
He added that the government's decision on masks was recognition that the spring term will be extremely challenging.
""The biggest problem they face is the likelihood of high levels of staff absence caused by the prevalence of the Omicron variant."" 
He added that while schools and colleges will do their best to minimise the impact on pupils, there was a real possibility that some classes and year groups may have to be sent home for short periods of remote learning. 
General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers Paul Whiteman said reintroducing face masks in secondary classrooms was a sensible move, but that more should be done.
""Where schools need air filtration units to improve areas of poor ventilation, they should be provided with them, without delay.""
He welcomed the 7,000 new units but said ""adequate ventilation in classrooms should not be limited to first come, first served"".
The process by which schools can obtain these units is due to be set out by the DfE shortly.
Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said ""finally, the government has been forced to recognise, and react to, the scale of the Omicron variant and its potential impact on education"".  
""The recommendation on wearing facemasks in secondary school classrooms is overdue - but it should be a requirement.""

75;Colorado wildfire: Three people reported missing and presumed dead;2022-01-02T00:32:51.000Z;[];['colorado', 'wildfires', 'united states', 'severe weather'];['victims', 'unlikely', 'humanremains', 'colorado', 'presumed', 'search', 'sheriff', 'reported', 'wildfire', 'county', 'missing', 'set', 'joe', 'dead', 'help', 'pelle'];"
Three people are missing and presumed dead, after a devastating wildfire in the central US state of Colorado. 
The blaze swept through several towns, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee.
The local sheriff had initially said there were no fatalities, calling it a ""miracle"".
But a spokeswoman for Boulder County admitted a mistake had been made.
""I think the sheriff probably wasn't adequately briefed by us,"" Jennifer Churchill said, in comments carried by the Colorado Sun. ""That was an unfortunate error. We feel terrible.""
No details have been released about those missing, but local media reported that one of them was a 91-year-old woman whose family said got trapped by the incoming flames.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said it was unlikely any of the three will be found alive. He added that the county is set to bring in human-remains detection dogs to help search for victims. 
The wildfire burned 6,000 acres across Boulder County, destroying at least 1,000 homes and businesses. It started under unusually dry conditions and came under control in part because of snowfall. 
More than 10 inches (25cm) of snow has fallen on the Boulder area and is now hampering efforts to find those missing. 
Images showed eerie scenes, with charred buildings buried under thick snow.

Residents hit by the wildfire are coming to terms with what happened, in some cases returning home to find complete destruction. 
""I feel like I made it out with my life and that's I think the most important thing,"" Jessi Delaplain, who lost her home to the fire, told CBS. 
""I gathered myself and I gathered my cats which was no easy feat to stuff them into the car. And I pulled out of the driveway and there were flames surrounding us.""
The cause of the wildfire is being investigated.
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires, and experts say that fires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years.

76;BBC Sound of 2022: Colourful rapper Central Cee kicks off the countdown;2022-01-02T00:00:35.000Z;[];['sound of 2022', 'music'];['shepherds', 'times', 'taking', 'colourful', 'subconsciously', 'kicks', 'sell', 'sure', 'look', 'cee', 'venue', 'sold', 'countdown', 'sound', 'tickets', 'central', 'bbc', '2022', 'rapper'];"
One of the fastest-rising stars of UK rap, Central Cee has won fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022.
Hailing from west London, his melodic take on drill has already earned him two Mobo Awards, and he's nominated for three Brits - including best newcomer - in February.
He burst on to the scene in 2020 with the straight-talking Day In The Life, in which he taunted his peers: ""Turn off the auto-tune, let's hear how you really rap.""
Freestyled while driving his car, the track was the culmination of 15 years of hard work. Born Oakley Caesar-Su in London's Shepherd's Bush in 1998, he's been cultivating his lyrical style since writing his first verse at the age of eight.
""I recorded my first song when I was 13 - recorded and released it,"" he told the BBC. 
""I'm 22 now, so it's coming up to 10 years. But I wasn't really in the game. I was still in school, balancing things and just going through life. It was only literally last year, 2020, where I got to take this stuff serious.""
Day In The Life and its follow-ups, Molly and Loading, framed him as a playful, mischievous character, eschewing the austere beats of drill for a more colourful sound - full of jazz samples and witty wordplay.
Amassing tens of millions of streams, the music quickly attracted the attention of record companies - but the rapper knocked them all back.
""Take that risk and go independent,"" he explained on the 2021 single Pinging. ""I just turned down six figures.""
The risk paid off, though. February's Commitment Issues secured Cee a number nine spot on the UK chart, and his first mixtape, Wild West, debuted at number two in March.
He celebrated the release by riding on horseback through Shepherd's Bush Market, and installing a giant mural on the nearby Goldhawk Road.
When Cee turned up to have his photo taken in front of it, ""50 to 60 school kids turned up after, like, five minutes,"" he recalls. 
""There's a lot of love, man.""
He ended the year with a guest verse on Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits remix, and another top 10 single, Obsessed With You - a street love song that samples fellow Sound Of 2022 nominee PinkPantheress.
Central Cee is the first act to be announced for the BBC's Sound Of 2022, which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year.
The rest of the top five will be revealed daily on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News. Now in its 20th year, previous winners of the prize include Adele, Celeste, Haim, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding.
Hey there - how has your 2021 been?
It's been an eventful one, to say the least! 
You sold out the Shepherd's Bush Empire in October. Did you ever walk past it as a kid and think, ""I'll play there one day""?
Every time I passed Shepherd's Bush Empire - which was two to three times a day for 10 to 15 years, I would look at it and I would just look and see who was on the bill, taking it in subconsciously. We could have sold a lot more tickets than that -  but it was a conscious decision to make sure I did that one. It's important to me that I did that venue no matter how many tickets I could sell. 
At the Mobos, you said you weren't sure how you felt about winning awards. Has your opinion changed now it's had time to sink in?
I still feel the same way but if I could reiterate it, what I meant is that I don't think people should feel like they need award shows to make them feel validated. We're all winners if we're in that room or releasing music, regardless of who gets the actual award.  
When you started making music, you'd record with just a MacBook and a pair of iPhone headphones. How did you teach yourself those skills?
I'm just quite observant, I'd say. So when I've downloaded the software I kinda just messed around with it. I didn't even watch no tutorials or nothing. Because I've been in the studio so many times, when I'm in the sessions I'm just watching what they do. I'm a fast learner - it was pretty straightforward.  
Where did the names Cench and Central Cee come from?
Central Cee just came. There's no interesting story behind it. And then Cench is just short for Central.  
Loading became your first chart hit in the middle of the pandemic. What was it like to see your numbers soaring while you were stuck at home?
It was strange. I couldn't get out there and interact with the fans, or perform, so I felt quite detached - just looking and experiencing everything through my phone, being at home. 
Do you feel it had to happen that way?
Timing is everything. It's God's timing. It had to happen that way.
You recorded Six For Six the same day that Loading hit the charts. How significant is that line, ""this ain't no coincidence""?
It's just the truth. 
Was there ever a time when you thought it might not happen?
Yeah - a couple times but I've been doing it for many years. For around 10 years. Within those 10 years there's obviously been bumps in the road and whatever but I was determined for the most part. 
A lot of your songs feel rooted in real situations… What's your writing technique?
My writing technique has changed since Day in A Life.  Day In A Life, I wrote outside of the studio and them times, studio time wasn't as accessible.  I was selective with it. The money was obviously coming out of my pocket - and it still is - but studio wasn't on tap the same way. So them times I'd write outside the studio and just go and record and then cut. Since Day In A Life I haven't written a song outside of the studio. I just write in the studio basically. 
The Wild West mixtape doesn't have any collaborations or features. Was that important to you?
It wasn't really premeditated, as such. By the time I had all the songs laid out, they just happened to be all on my own.
I haven't linked up to much people yet. I'm only just coming into the industry. I'm not in a rush to jump in the studio and work with everyone and this and that.
Commitment Issues and Obsessed With You are more emotional than a lot of UK rap. You could almost call them love songs. How important is it not to be boxed in by convention?
I don't try to not be boxed in by convention. It's not something I think about, but I have different emotions. I'm just a human being. So sometimes I might feel a bit more emotional or a bit more ""whatever"". 
Obsessed With You samples another Sound Of 2022 nominee, PinkPantheress... What do you think makes her special?
There's a whole list of things, which would take ages to run through, but she's one of my favourite artists though - no cap. I love everything about her. 
That song is the first track from your 23 mixtape. What can we expect when that comes out next year?
Expect big things. If you thought 'Wild West' was hard... 
And finally, what's your grand plan for 2022?
Stay alive and get richer!

The European Commission has proposed plans to label some gas and nuclear power as green, prompting criticism from Germany. 
The proposal argues that gas and nuclear are key to helping transition to cleaner power. 
But Germany's environment minister called the plan ""absolutely wrong"".
It comes months after countries pledged to keep temperature rises within 1.5C at the COP26 climate summit. 
""It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy,"" the Commission's proposal says. 
Under the proposal, only gas and nuclear plants with the highest standards would be considered green. Nuclear plants would also have to have strict waste disposal plans, Deutsche Welle reports. While gas plants would have a limit of how much carbon dioxide is released per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. 
If a majority of EU members back the proposal then it will become law from 2023. 
France had reportedly pushed for nuclear power to be included. The country relies on nuclear energy for 70% of its electricity, although this will be cut to half over the next 15 years. 
France has also pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035. 
The move has been criticised by Germany, which is in the process of phasing out nuclear completely and only has a few plants remaining.
German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke described the proposal as ""wrong"", adding that nuclear energy could lead to environmental disasters and large amounts of nuclear waste. 
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck called the plan ""greenwashing"", saying it ""waters down the good label for sustainability.""

A large fire is raging at the Houses of Parliament in the South African city of Cape Town. 
Video footage shows a plume of black smoke filling the sky, with huge flames coming out from the roof of the building. 
Dozens of firefighters are at the site battling the blaze; it is not yet clear what caused the fire.
It comes hours after Archbishop Desmond Tutu's state funeral at St George's Cathedral, near Parliament.
The roof area had caught fire and the National Assembly building was on fire too, the city authorities said.
""The fire is not under control and cracks in the walls of the building have been reported,"" a spokesman for the city's emergency services told the AFP news agency.
The fire was currently on the third floor, with initial reports indicating it started in the office space of the building and was spreading towards a gym at the site, city officials said.
The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly.

A South Korean citizen has crossed the heavily fortified border into North Korea in an apparent defection, South Korea's military says.
The person was able to evade detection for several hours despite a search operation by South Korean troops.
Military chiefs in Seoul said they did not know if the person was still alive, but had sent a message to the North asking for them to be protected.
North Korea has implemented a shoot-on-sight policy during the pandemic.
The person was detected in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas, at a point on the east coast at about 21:20 local time (12:20 GMT) on Saturday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
Defence officials in Seoul had pledged to overhaul the border defence system after similar breaches in the past.
In September 2020 North Korean troops shot and burned a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea. The incident sparked uproar. Pyongyang blamed the anti-virus rule and apologised.
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un had earlier declared a national emergency and sealed off a town after a North Korean defector who Mr Kim said had Covid symptoms crossed into the North from the South.
North Korea's pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions on movement within the country have also reduced the number of defections from the North to the South.
The border between North and South Korea is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. It is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing and surveillance cameras and armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day.

86;Denmark to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030;2022-01-02T03:03:04.000Z;[];['denmark', 'cop26', 'paris climate agreement', 'climate change', 'air travel'];['world', 'raise', 'lead', 'slow', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'flights', 'domestic', 'free', '2030', 'bar', 'countries', 'denmark'];"
Denmark's government has announced a goal to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 
In her New Year's address, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wants to ""make flying green"". 
However she acknowledged that the solutions to reach her target were not yet in place.
Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall carbon emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Ms Frederiksen, announcing her plan.
""When other countries in the world are too slow. Then Denmark must take the lead and raise the bar even more,"" she said. 
She added that achieving green domestic flights will be difficult but researchers and companies are working on solutions. 
The European manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be operational by 2035. 
If the hydrogen used to fuel them is generated using renewable energy, this could be a way for Denmark to reach its goals. 
However it is unclear if the technology will be ready, and costs sufficiently low, for the 2030 target to be reached.
Sweden has also announced plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. It is also hoping to make international flights green by 2045. 
Earlier this year, the government there announced plans to introduce increased airport fees for high-polluting planes. 
Meanwhile France is moving to ban domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. 
The measures could affect travel between Paris and cities including Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

89;Covid: Workplaces told to plan for absences of up to 25%;2022-01-02T15:24:09.000Z;[];['schools', 'public sector', 'cabinet office', 'nhs', 'self-isolation', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'begins', 'uk', 'symptoms', 'receives', 'workplaces', 'positive', 'plan', '25', 'selfisolation', 'systems', 'reasoning', 'whichever', 'test', 'absences', 'told'];"
Ministers have been tasked with developing ""robust contingency plans"" for workplace absences, as the government warned rising cases could see up to a quarter of staff off work. 
Public sector leaders have been asked to prepare for ""worst case scenarios"" of 10%, 20% and 25% absence rates, the Cabinet Office said. 
The UK has seen record numbers of daily cases over the festive period. 
Transport, the NHS and schools have already seen the effect of absences.
Rising case numbers have led to large numbers self-isolating and being unable to go to work. This has particularly affected industries where staff are unable to work from home.
Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay is chairing regular meetings with ministers to assess how the spread of the Omicron variant is affecting workforces and supply chains, the Cabinet Office said.
The prime minister had asked ministers working with their respective sectors to test preparations and contingency plans to limit disruption, it explained. 
Mr Barclay said the highly transmissible Omicron variant meant businesses and public services ""will face disruption in the coming weeks, particularly from higher than normal staff absence"". 
However, his department said that so far disruption caused by Omicron has been controlled in ""most parts of the public sector"".
People who test positive for Covid must self-isolate for at least seven days in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Two negative lateral flow results, 24-hours apart, are required to end self-isolation - the first no earlier than day six. 
In Scotland, positive cases must isolate for the full 10 days. 
Unvaccinated contacts of positive cases must also isolate for 10 days in all parts of the UK.
Some have called for a US-style self-isolation system to be introduced, where people only have to quarantine for five days, but the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said doing so would be counterproductive and could actually worsen staff shortages if it led to more people being infected.
Explaining its reasoning in a blog post, it said the two systems were not like-for-like. In the UK, the self-isolation ""clock"" begins when the person experiences symptoms or receives a positive test - whichever is first. But in the US, self-isolation begins only after a positive test - which may be some days after symptoms first appear.
On day six, the UKHSA says its modelling suggests 10-30% of people will still be infectious, depending on how quickly they get their test result after developing symptoms.
It says ending self-isolation after seven days with two negative lateral flow tests gives a similar level of protection to self-isolating for 10 days, when 5% of people will still be infectious. 
Ian Wilson, owner and director of Bellcare, a Cumbria-based firm that provides in-home help for the elderly and disabled, is concerned that those who need care aren't going to get it - simply because there aren't enough people to provide it.
""The amount of people requiring care in the first place means that you're generally run off your feet,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""As soon as you start losing staff [because of Omicron], it gets really, really awkward.""
While Bellcare has been able to bring forward an increase in the National Living Wage from April to now, thanks to a government grant, ""if the people don't come forward it is really difficult,"" said Mr Wilson.
Mr Wilson's firm employs around 120 people and could easily find hours for an additional 40 or 50 carers. 
""We've got the Brexit thing as well where we had overseas workers,"" said Mr Wilson. ""We can apply for licences to recruit overseas workers but that is a lengthy and quite costly process to be honest so it is not going to solve anything next week.""
Mr Wilson said: ""I don't know what the government plans are for contingencies. We can only work with what we've got and those people that we've got can only work so many hours a day, so yes, it is going to be difficult.""
The situation will be kept under review, the the UKHSA says, but it believes current rules are the ""optimal approach at present"".
In December, the education secretary urged retired teachers to return to classrooms to help with Covid-related staff shortages in the new year. 
Some schools had to close early or move to online learning before the end of last term because of staff absences. 
And several train operators have had to reduce services because of staff absences. 
Rising cases are also affecting the NHS, with 24,632 staff at hospital trusts ill with coronavirus or self-isolating on 26 December, up 31% on the previous week and nearly double the figure at the start of the month, according to NHS England. 
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Boris Johnson should have told ministers to start planning for workplace absences weeks ago. 
""Boris Johnson's lack of leadership means his government has dithered and delayed, leaving contingency planning to the very last moment,"" she said. 
""With record Covid infection numbers, the prime minister must immediately get a grip on workforce pressures, keep essential services moving, keep schools open and keep people safe.""
Businesses say this proposal from government is welcome, but they would like to see more detail of what contingency planning for mass staff absences might mean in practice.
Bosses also question where they will draw more staff from if their teams become ill.
Russell Norman had to close his popular restaurant Brutto in London prior to the New Year after his workforce plummeted from 24 people to just five in the week before Christmas, as staff fell ill with Omicron. 
He says that since Brexit, ""there just are not pools of enthusiastic people waiting in the wings who are available for restaurant work"". 
There's another worry too.  
Others in the hospitality sector say that many of their staff are on zero hours contracts and, as a result of falling consumer confidence and venues deciding to close in the last three weeks, have seen their hours cut dramatically. 
With symptoms mild, industry leaders say they believe some will continue to work, even if positive.
England reported 162,572 new cases on Saturday - a record number for the fifth day in a row - and Covid hospital admissions are at their highest level since January 2021.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not report figures on Saturday. 
England is currently under Plan B restrictions, which includes mandatory masks in most indoor public places, Covid passes for nightclubs and other large venues and guidance to work from home if possible. 
The measures are set to expire six weeks after implementation - 26 January, with a review after three weeks, which is expected on or close to 4 January. 
Other parts of the UK have already introduced tougher restrictions for hospitality venues. 
Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said any additional restrictions in England ""must be an absolute last resort"".

A giant European Union flag displayed at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark France taking on the bloc's presidency has been removed after it was criticised by right-wing politicians.
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said ""replacing"" the French flag at the monument was an attack on the country's identity. 
A government minister said the move was only ever meant to be temporary.
France has taken over the EU's rotating presidency for the next six months.
Ms Le Pen, who is a candidate in the presidential election in April, had vowed to file a complaint with the State Council, France's highest court for administrative matters. She described the EU flag's removal as a victory resulting from pressure on the government.
Far-right independent candidate Eric Zemmour, who is also running against President Emmanuel Macron, called it ""an outrage"".
Conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse also objected to the position of the EU flag: ""Preside over Europe yes, erase French identity no!"", she tweeted:
But European Affairs Minister Clément Beaune denied the government had bowed to pressure from the far right and said the flag had been taken down as planned.
""It was scheduled that the flag was to be taken down this Sunday, we hadn't established an exact time,"" he told France Inter radio.
Mr Beaune also pointed out that the French flag which is sometimes displayed at the Arc de Triomphe is not a permanent fixture there.
On Saturday, Mr Macron, who has not yet said whether he will run for re-election in April, outlined the priorities of France's EU presidency based on three principles: strengthening European sovereignty, developing a new model of growth, and creating a Europe closer to its citizens. 
Specific goals included better border protection and management of migration, improved security, technological innovation, and defending the rule of law, he added.
Other landmarks in the capital and other French cities will be lit up in blue for the rest of the week to highlight France's EU presidency, including:

91;Covid: Israel Omicron spike could bring herd immunity but with risks - health boss;2022-01-02T18:24:31.000Z;[];['israel', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['health', 'israel', 'website', 'reinfected', 'immunity', 'spike', 'zarka', 'boss', 'omicron', 'told', 'particularly', 'mr', 'risks', 'ynet', 'covid', 'recovered', 'herd', 'saw', 'bring', 'past'];"
Israel's top health adviser says the surge of Omicron cases could see the country reach Covid herd immunity.
Nachmann Ash said the country would pay a price for this and he wanted to see herd immunity achieved via vaccinations instead.
Modellers have warned that up to four million people could be infected by the end of January.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has admitted his current policy will not prevent a big rise in infections.
On Sunday, he said a fourth Covid-19 vaccine would be offered to people over 60 as well as medical staff.
The prime minister has previously insisted the aim is to prevent a spike in serious illness while keeping the economy open, even though he has not ruled out another lockdown.
Confirmed daily infections in Israel have quadrupled to more than 3,500 in 10 days, but the number of deaths has not seen a similar rise.
Herd immunity is a scientific term describing the point at which a population is protected from a disease, either by enough people being vaccinated or by people having developed antibodies by having the disease.
Prof Ash said a surge in Omicron cases was inevitable.
""The price of herd immunity is very many infections, and that may end up happening. The numbers need to be high to reach herd immunity, it's something that is possible,"" he said.
""But we don't want to reach it by means of infections, we want it to happen as a result of many people vaccinating.""
Salman Zarka, head of the health ministry's coronavirus taskforce, said herd immunity was not guaranteed.
""We have to be very cautious with this particularly in light of our experience over the past two years in which we saw people who have recovered be re-infected,"" Mr Zarka told the Ynet news website.
Meanwhile another government adviser, Eran Segal from the Weizmann Institute, warned that cases would soon outstrip Israel's testing capacity, leaving the country unable to identify new infections.
He predicted that between two and four million people would be infected over the coming three weeks - but that a lower number of people would suffer severe illness than in the previous wave.
He urged people to get vaccinated.
""Everyone who walks around, no matter where, will be exposed and should be protected,"" he tweeted.
About two-thirds of Israel's population of more than nine million have been fully vaccinated, which the health ministry defines as having either had a third dose or recently had a second dose.
However many of those eligible for a third dose have not yet had one.
Israel has already approved a fourth vaccine dose for immuno-compromised people and the elderly in care homes.
Meanwhile just over a quarter of Palestinians have been fully vaccinated, according to Our World In Data.
The Palestinians have received vaccine doses from Israel, Russia, China, the United Arab Emirates and the global Covax vaccine-sharing initiative.
UN experts had been critical of Israel's failure to fully extend its vaccination programme to Palestinians under its control.
The Israelis said the Palestinians were responsible for managing health matters in the Palestinian Territories.

Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has announced his resignation amid mass protests over the military's rule. 
The military launched a coup in October and put Mr Hamdok under house arrest, but he was reinstated the next month after signing a new power-sharing deal.
Demonstrators have since continued to take to the streets to demand an entirely civilian political leadership.
In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said a new agreement was needed for Sudan's transition to democracy. 
""I decided to give back the responsibility and announce my resignation as prime minister, and give a chance to another man or woman of this noble country to... help it pass through what's left of the transitional period to a civilian democratic country,"" he said. 
Security forces killed two people on Sunday during protests against the military's rule, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee. 
Security forces have not commented on the deaths. 
At least 56 people have been killed in protests since the coup on 25 October 2021, the committee says.

Twitter has suspended the personal account of the US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for repeated violations of its rules around coronavirus misinformation.  
The action against the Republican lawmaker came under Twitter's strike system, which identifies posts about the virus that could cause harm.
The company had previously suspended the Georgia congresswoman four times. 
Rep Greene said the ban proved that the company is ""an enemy to America"".
In a lengthy statement posted to the social media outlet, Telegram, the 47-year-old said ""social media platforms can't stop the truth from being spread far and wide"" and accused Twitter of aiding unidentified enemies in ""a Communist revolution"". 
Her official congressional account, which staffers appear to post on infrequently, remains active. 
The congresswoman's ban comes after she had tweeted on Saturday, falsely, about ""extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths"" in the US. 
In a statement issued to the BBC, a Twitter spokesperson said that Rep Greene has been banned for ""repeated"" violations of its coronavirus misinformation policy, which allows four ""strikes"" with varying suspensions from the platform, before issuing a permanent ban. 
The social media giant had issued her with a fourth strike in August after she falsely posted that coronavirus vaccines were ""failing"" and called on regulators not to approve new shots.  
""We've been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,"" the spokesperson said.
Since her election in 2020, Rep Greene has become one of Washington's most controversial politicians. 
She has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged and has in the past been associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. 
Despite the US struggling to contain the coronavirus, from which more than 825,000 people now died, she has been a determined opponent of measures designed to tackle the virus. 
She has frequently called into question the efficacy of vaccines and has regularly been fined for refusing to follow Covid guidelines in Congress, including those regarding mask-wearing on the House floor.

Ukraine's culture minister says he has complained to Netflix over the portrayal of a character from Kiev in Emily in Paris.  
The Netflix show follows a young American, played by Lily Collins, who travels to the French capital for work. 
In the latest series, Petra, a Ukrainian, shoplifts during a trip with main character Emily. 
Oleksandr Tkachenko described the caricature image of Petra as ""insulting"". 
Petra, who is played by Ukrainian actress Daria Panchenko, is also portrayed to have a poor fashion sense and is afraid of being deported. 
""In Emily in Paris, we have a caricature image of a Ukrainian woman that is unacceptable. It is also insulting,"" Mr Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. 
""Is that how Ukrainians are seen abroad?"" he added. 
According to Ukrainian media, Mr Tkachenko has sent a letter to the streaming service complaining about the portrayal of Petra. 
One Ukrainian resident in Paris agreed with his criticism.
""The way you treated the image of Ukrainians in your second season, 4th episode is such a low cost trick, absolute scandal and a shame,"" Yevheniya Havrylko wrote in an Instagram post, which has had more than 75,000 likes. 
Others have chosen to defend the show, like Ukrainian film producer Natalka Yakymovych who said: ""So in a TV series, negative characters can be anything but Ukrainian? Obviously, we all would like her to be from Moscow, but you don't always get what you want.""
It is not the first time Emily in Paris has been criticised for its portrayal of different nationalities. 
When the first season was released, it was criticised, particularly in France, for promoting stereotypical images of the city and its residents. 
It portrays the French as rude people who wear berets and frequently cheat on their partners. 
The new series of the show features Alfie, a stereotypical Brit who spends his time drinking in pubs and watching football. 
Darren Star, creator of the show, was defended the series at the time, saying he was ""not sorry for looking at Paris through a glamorous lens"". 
Mr Star said he had drawn on his own experiences of visiting the city. 
""I wanted to showcase Paris in a really wonderful way that would encourage people to fall in love with the city in a way that I have,"" he told the New York Times.

101;Can fitness apps be as effective as a personal trainer?;2022-01-03T00:20:27.000Z;[];"['gyms', 'fitness trackers', 'fitness', 'life', 'lifestyle', ""new year's resolutions""]";['trainer', 'personal', 'effective', 'trainers', 'fitness', 'onetoone', 'injuries', 'exercises', 'apps', 'doing', 'theyre', 'sessions', 'really', 'individuals'];"
As we start 2022, lots of us will be resuming the battle to lose weight and get fit. A wealth of high-tech fitness apps are now available to help, but are they anywhere near as good as hiring a human personal trainer?
Four years ago, Jenny Wiener was in a fitness slump.
She wanted to improve her physical and mental health, but her workouts lacked intensity without a proper training programme to follow.
When she went to the gym she says she often chose ""easy"" options, like jogging on a treadmill, to avoid more daunting exercises.
A personal trainer who might push her was out of the question because of the high cost - typically prices start from £30 an hour.
Ms Wiener, 32, who works as an events manager in St Albans, then discovered fitness app Freeletics.
To use the app you first input information about your previous training experiences and preferences, and goals. A virtual coach then used that information to suggest a personalised training regime.
At the end of each workout, the Freeletics app then asks Ms Wiener to provide feedback about its suitability and difficulty. The app's artificial intelligence (AI) software system then uses her answers - plus those from its other 53 million users around the world - to adjust future training sessions.
""The AI aspect is one of the main things that got me interested,"" says Ms Wiener. ""I was going to the gym every day before, but seeing zero results.
""When I found Freeletics, I was like 'OMG it's a PT [personal trainer] in my pocket, my gym buddy'.""
She adds that she finds the workouts exciting, because no two are ever the same. And that, as a result, the app has helped her to lose four-stone.
Freeletics' digital personal trainer app, called 'The Coach', costs from £1.78 a week. The firm's chief product and technology officer, Kornelius Brunner, says it ""gets smarter and better"" as users give it more and more feedback. 
However, sports and fitness psychologist, Anthony Papathomas, says that such apps are no substitute for human personal trainers.
""With an interpersonal relationship you are going to get that increased sensitivity to personal needs,"" says the senior lecturer at Loughborough University's National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine.
""If you don't fancy the session, or if you're not in a mood, which is often the case, particularly in exercise behaviour change,"" he says. ""Then I'm not sure the kind of alert [you get] on your phone, necessarily takes into consideration that we are human beings with competing interests outside of our health and fitness.""
Whereas, Mr Papathomas points out a ""human being"" trainer is probably more likely to empathise ""and exercise is only sustainable if we enjoy it.""
Brighton-based marketing consultant, Tom Bourlet, says he used to love exercising, but lost motivation after entering into a relationship.
Then in January of this year, he and his partner received a wedding invitation, and both were determined to lose a set amount of weight to get in shape for the big day.
He discovered app FitnessAI, which uses a similar approach to Freeletics - mining its users' data to improve and personalise all their workouts.
""I often utilise data in my work, and find it incredibly useful to ensure you're making continuous progress, therefore the entire concept appealed to me,"" says Mr Bourlet.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
""One guilty factor of training can be to keep doing the same reps [repetitions of a specific exercise], or weights, each week, failing to push yourself each time. However, the app helped to set out what I should be trying to achieve each week.""
While Mr Bourlet used to take long rests, from two to three minutes between each set of gym work, the app's AI kept him on-target. It gave him an exact rest-time, according to the specific exercise or weight lift session, and his performance.
He says that, overall, it helped him reach his weight-loss target of dropping three stone (19kg) almost a month ahead of plan.
FitnessAI founder, Jake Mor believes the AI's mathematical approach makes it better than a personal trainer.
""FitnessAI does tons of math behind the scenes to figure out what your workout plan should look like,"" he says. ""While trainers are great motivators, they are not math professionals.""
Perhaps unsurprisingly, London-based personal trainer Aimee Victoria Long disagrees with this analysis.
""Personal trainers come with a higher cost, but when you do one-to-one sessions, you can check an individual's form, to see they're doing the exercises correctly,"" she says. ""It really ensures that they're not going to have any injuries from the exercises that they're doing, which you can't really get from an app.
""Also, I can get to know not only their physical health, but also their mental health, because sometimes people are training all the time, and it might not be good for their mental health. And that's not going to be shown or picked up on an app.""
Yet sometimes fitness apps can help by asking the user questions that a human person trainer might not feel comfortable posing.
Take Jennis, the fitness app by British Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill. It requests data from female users about their menstrual cycles, in order to better programme their workouts.
Ms Ennis-Hill explains: ""The daily conversations [via the app] that we have with each woman mean that we regularly update recommendations, so that you're always getting sessions most suited to your hormonal profile.
""This, in turn, means you're doing what's right for your body, making bigger training gains, and capitalising on what your hormones are doing each day.""
Former British soldier Rachel Carey, 37, is a fan. After ovulation she receives more strength-based workouts, whereas in the first 14 days of her menstrual cycle, she receives more high-intensity workouts.
""The cycle mapping recommendations for the workouts are so much more appropriate for physiologically what's going on for me,"" says Ms Carey.

102;Sound Of 2022: Lola Young's slow-burning anthems are bubbling over;2022-01-03T00:02:56.000Z;[];['sound of 2022', 'music'];['suddenly', 'world', 'understand', 'im', 'health', 'things', 'mental', 'certain', 'slowburning', 'feeling', 'bubbling', 'lola', '2022', 'sound', 'youngs', 'really', 'anthems'];"
""Are you joking? No way! Oh my God. That's amazing. Such good news.""
Singer-songwriter Lola Young has just learned she's placed fourth in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022 - which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year.
She's in good company. In previous years, fourth place has gone to artists like Jorja Smith, Khalid, Sampha and Joy Crookes, who've all shaped the sounds of pop and soul in their own mould.
Young's deep, expressive vocals will be familiar to millions after she covered Together In Electric Dreams for this year's John Lewis Christmas Advert.
But the 21-year-old has been on the path to stardom since she wrote her first song, an ode to Santa Claus, when she was 11. 
Before long, she'd won the Open Mic UK contest and booked a place at the Brit School, while playing as many gigs as she could around her native south London.
""I've done so many [awful] open mic pub gigs where I've rocked up and played to three old men drinking beer and talking through my performance,"" she says. ""But I had to do that.""
It was at one such showcase that she caught the attention of Amy Winehouse's ex-manager Nick Shymansky - who loved her husky, soulful sound, but was reluctant to take her on. 
""He said he was too busy and too hurt from his past experiences,"" Young explains. So he introduced her to Nick Huggett, who discovered and signed Adele... before having second thoughts.
""Nick S decided that he couldn't miss out - so they ended up managing me together. They're like my uncles now!""
Signed to Island Records, Young released an assured debut album, Intro, at the age of 18. More recently, the attention-grabbing singles Fake and Bad Tattoo have seen her played on BBC Radio 1, and Elton John's Rocket Hour show. 
She ended 2021 with a nomination for the Brits Critics' Choice award; and starts 2022 with the endorsement of the 130 pundits who voted for the BBC Sound Of list (the top three will be announced over the next three days).
""It feels like things are getting better and better,"" she beams. ""The bubbling under the surface is starting to really, really bubble over!""
We caught up with her over Zoom to find out more about her backstory - and what she's got in store for the year ahead.
Have you always wanted to be a musician?
Yeah, I think for some people it comes a little bit later on, but I had it in my head that I wanted to be in music since I was maybe 10 or 11.
I've seen interviews where you said you weren't a natural singer. How much work did you have to do?
I think in other interviews, I've maybe been a little bit misunderstood in the sense that people thought I couldn't sing at all. It wasn't that. I had a voice, I was able to hold a note, but I didn't have the technical things like vibrato at all.
So, it was more the case that I had to work hard to get power and strength. Like with Beyoncé, I can imagine she just popped out singing to the heavens. I didn't have that.
I think she actually cried in perfect pitch when she was born. 
Yeah, literally.
What did you enjoy singing when you were a kid?
The first album I remember putting on and really enjoying was Paolo Nutini's These Streets. Then, growing up, I listened to a lot of Eminem and Biggie and old school rap; and then eventually a lot of David Bowie, Prince. So my inspirations are quite different.
Do you remember the first time you recorded yourself singing? 
Yeah, I was probably about 13, 14 and I went into a studio. Hearing my voice back was pretty mad - but it confirmed that's what I wanted to do.
You entered the Open Mic UK competition around the same time. What was that experience like?
Back when I was a kid, I thought X Factor or Britain's Got Talent was the way that people blew up. I didn't really understand the business side of things. So Open Mic UK was something I thought was going to change my life and, obviously, it helped a little bit - but it wasn't a game changer.
You won with an original song, right?
Yeah, it was called Never Enough and it's a song that's never gonna get released!
Has your writing changed since then?
A hell of a lot! I'm very careful about each lyric now. It can't just be a throwaway. And if it is, then we scrap it. 
I guess when you start out, you're almost impersonating your favourite artists. Then as you grow and get more experience, you put more of yourself into the songs?
That's true - but I think people sometimes underestimate the real power that a young person has. I have one song that I wrote when I was 13, that I still really believe [in] and that's going to be on the album.
Is that I Learned From You?
Yeah, you know my music!
Why did that song survive when other ones got cast away?
It had quite an interesting concept. It was about a close relative and how I was trying to understand our relationship. It's kind of complex and, although I didn't really realise at the time, it's quite a mature song. 
You went to the Brit school after that. Was it what you expected?
Um, no, it wasn't. There's a tendency for people to assume the Brit school is the way to the top, but it's still a school. You still do lessons, you still meet bitchy people and there's still bullying. Even the headmaster would say, ""We're not trying to create famous people. That's not why we're here."" 
I'm not saying I expected more than that because it was a really great experience. It helped me understand my style and where I wanted to go with my music. 
You released your first album, Intro, when you were 18.
I was 18, yeah.
One of the tracks, Blind Love, is still your most played song on Spotify. Why do you think people love that song, in particular?
Just because it's a classic, sad love song. It's about the journey of a relationship and how it ends, but also trying to come to peace with that. I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling.
On Six Feet Under, you sing about being depressed and thinking about death. What's it like to share dark feelings like those in your music?
It's very complex suffering from mental health, I think. Especially as a person who has gone through life without really thinking about mental health - and then suddenly it hits you. You suddenly understand the stigma around it, because you start feeling ashamed about saying certain things, or feeling certain things. So I feel really strongly that I have to be super-honest in my lyrics. I'm sharing [those feelings] with the world but also, I'm trying to share it with myself, as well.
What do your friends and family think of those songs?
Sometimes it can be hard but my family and my friends are super-understanding. They know already what I've gone through. So as scary as it is to talk about the dark side of your mind, the importance of sharing, of honesty, overrides the fear.
The Intro album was just starting to make waves when you developed cysts on your vocal cords. Were you ever worried you'd lose your voice?
It was very frightening, for sure, especially because I had a new type of vocal surgery. But I had the best surgeon and it was fine. I mean, I'm still in recovery.  My high register still cracks, so I might need to go for a check-up.
Just as you came out of hospital, the world went into lockdown. How did you find that?
For me. being indoors and being in my own space is quite hard. I hate it. I can't be alone. And I got Covid as well - not badly, but I did have Covid.
But it was a very tough year for a lot of people. People were very low and lost their jobs, you know? So my year was hard, but it wasn't the worst.
The other thing you did in 2020 was release Woman, which is one of your best songs. And it's quite political as well...
Woman was a process of me trying to understand how much one could be a feminist without being radical. 
I think that people really don't understand what that word [feminist] means. I remember getting cat-called as a teenager going to school by an old man in a van and, as you grow up, you start to question why the world lets you believe this is normal.  So in that song, I'm explaining what happens when you feel like you're less [important] than a man. It was something that I felt really strongly about. 
The songs you've released subsequently, like Ruin My Make Up and Fake, have a similar sense of strength and defiance. I'm interested in why that's a theme that you've focused on lyrically in the last two years.
I don't really know why.... I think it's more that I wanted to change my sound up. I was listening a lot to The Cure, and using a lot of vintage sounds and baritone guitars. And I think when the sonic changed, the lyrics changed with it. Like Fake, for example, I think the drama goes well with the sound of the record.
It sounds like something off a Tarantino soundtrack.
Yeah, that was the intention!
You ended 2021 by singing the John Lewis Christmas advert. I've always wondered how much input you get in that process? Like, do you get to choose the song?
The advertising company suggested the song. The only change I made was to sing it in a joyous way, with a tone of hope. That was a bit of a challenge, because the movement of the track is quite melancholic - but obviously it's supposed to be a Christmas song so it's not supposed to be too depressing!
Since then, I've started hearing your music more and more on the radio and in places like H&M. What's that like?
It's weird - but it's all I've ever wanted, so obviously that's really good.
And so, on to 2022. Are you working on a new album?
It's in the works! I've got a good few songs that I'm happy with but I don't know when exactly it will be released. Hopefully end of next year.

Richard Leakey, a world-renowned Kenyan conservationist and fossil hunter has died aged 77. 
His groundbreaking work contributed to the recognition of Africa as the birthplace of humankind.
He also spearheaded campaigns to stop poaching in Kenya, famously burning the country's stockpile of poached ivory. 
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said Leakey had ""served our country with distinction"". 
Leakey served in various positions in the Kenyan government including the National Museums of Kenya, the Kenya Wildlife Service and as head of the civil service.
""Besides his distinguished career in public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions,"" Mr Kenyatta said. 
Leakey followed in his parents' footsteps in paleoanthropology - the practice of seeking to understand human evolution by studying fossils and ancient tools. 
In his 20s, Leakey made his own important finds, and in two ground-breaking books (Origins and People of the Lake), he explained the emergence of Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans.
His work contributed to the growing body of evidence that the earliest humans had lived on the African continent. 
In 1981, he fronted a seven-part BBC television series called ""The Making of Mankind"", which made him a household name.
In the late 1980s, he switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service at a time when poachers were wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations. 
He told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the spectacular public burning of a huge haul of ivory. 
In 1993, the small plane he was flying in lost power and crashed. He survived but both of his legs were amputated below the knee. 
That did not stop him from entering Kenyan politics, setting up a new political party. But his political career did not last and in 1998 he took up a role as head of Kenya's civil service, with a mission to fight official corruption. 
He lasted three years in the role before returning to the Kenya Wildlife Service. 
At the time of his death, he was serving as chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University in the US. The institute works to facilitate research and education in palaeontology and archaeology in northern Kenya.
Kenya's Deputy president said Leakey ""inspired many Kenyans with his loyalty to his country. He loved Kenya"".

105;China: Evergrande suspends shares in Hong Kong as firm tries to raise cash;2022-01-03T02:13:52.000Z;[];['china'];['situation', 'statement', 'website', 'shares', 'evergrande', 'plan', 'cash', 'posted', 'repayment', 'hong', 'china', 'wealth', 'tries', 'raise', 'firm', 'kong', 'suspends', 'units', 'update'];"
Crisis-hit Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has suspended trade in its shares on the Hong Kong as investors await news on its restructuring plan.
The statement to the stock exchange did not give a reason for the trading halt.
Evergrande has more than $300bn (£222bn) of debts and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
Last week, the company dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products.
Evergrande said on Friday that each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive $1,257 each month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures.
The company had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures.
Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website that the situation was not ""ideal"" and that it would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late March, without giving further details.
The announcement was seen as highlighting the deepening cash squeeze at the struggling property developer.
Last week, Evergrande did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds. 
The company's $19bn in international bonds were deemed to be in default by rating agencies after it missed a payment deadline last month.

106;Gas prices: MPs and peers urge PM to act on energy bills;2022-01-02T13:58:05.000Z;[];['energy customer switching', 'uk economy', 'energy service companies', 'natural gas'];['prior', 'gas', 'number', 'poverty', 'million', 'uk', 'price', 'prices', 'rose', 'mps', 'peers', 'urge', 'energy', 'rise', 'bills', 'recent', 'act'];"
Twenty Conservative MPs and peers have called on the prime minister to tackle the spiralling cost of living.
Five ex-ministers are among those who have written to the Sunday Telegraph arguing for a cut in environmental levies and the removal of energy taxes.
Their call follows big increases in wholesale gas prices. Experts say average bills could hit £2,000 in 2022.
The government says it is meeting suppliers and the regulator regularly to work out how to help consumers.
Health minister Edward Argar told Times Radio there were a range of measures to help those who ""feel the squeeze with particular house bills"", adding that the economy was ""bouncing back"".
The letter to the Telegraph has been organised by the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservatives, which keeps an eye on the potential consequences of the government's environmental commitments. 
The group's chairman Craig Mackinlay is one of the letter's signatories, along with former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and senior MPs Robert Halfon and Steve Baker.
""We hardly need to point out that high energy prices, whether for domestic heating or for domestic transport, are felt most painfully by the lowest paid,"" the letter states.
It argues that by scrapping the 5% VAT rate on energy bills and suspending environmental levies which fund renewable energy schemes, the average household could save £200 on their energy bill.
Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said: ""It is a matter for the Chancellor in terms of tax policy but the key issue for us all is to get the economy re-opened, to get businesses firing up again."" 
But Mr Halfon said he had ""huge worries"" about the rising energy costs for people across the country.
With the energy price cap going up in the spring, he said the government should look at other measures, including suspending green levies which he said were ""actually 25% of everybody's energy bill"".
He added that he was not suggesting to ""get rid of them forever"" but to pause them at a time when people could really struggle.
Labour has also called for the lifting of VAT on fuel bills for the winter to help households, while Ovo Energy firm boss Stephen Fitzpatrick last week suggested that some ""environmental social policy costs"" should be removed by the government.
Other suppliers including Good Energy, EDF and trade body Energy UK have called for government intervention, after the cost of gas in wholesale markets rose by more than 500% in less than a year.
The charity National Energy Action (NEA) has warned that a record six million UK households will be in fuel poverty when the next increase in the energy price cap comes into force in April.
Prior to the most recent rise in the price cap in October, around four million homes in the UK were classed as being in fuel poverty. That number increased by 500,000 after prices rose and NEA estimates it will increase again by 1.5 million this year.
More than 20 energy suppliers have gone out of business since the start of September, with their customers shifted to new providers.
But many will find themselves on a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal.
Last week the Resolution Foundation think tank warned that millions of UK families face a ""year of squeeze"" in 2022 thanks to rising energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to reach 6% by the spring.
The Resolution Foundation says that an increase in National Insurance contributions from April, along with an expected rise in energy bills in the same month could amount to a £1,200 hit to household finances.
And the foundation warned that poorer families will bear the brunt of these rises as they spend a greater proportion of their income on electricity and gas.
The government says it has taken steps to help, including reducing the Universal Credit taper, providing cold weather payments and freezing alcohol and fuel duty.

107;"China: Why some think ""small eyes"" are not beautiful";2022-01-03T00:28:55.000Z;[];['social media', 'china', 'beauty standards'];['weibo', 'eyes', 'post', 'hopes', 'ms', 'small', 'look', 'latest', 'beautiful', 'china', 'particular', 'think', 'kinder', 'model', 'need'];"
""Do I not deserve to be Chinese just because I have small eyes?""
That is what Chinese model Cai Niangniang wrote in a recent impassioned social media post, after old pictures of her went viral for all the wrong reasons.
For several days she had been attacked online for being ""deliberately offensive"" and ""unpatriotic"", over a series of advertisements she had appeared in for Chinese snack brand Three Squirrels.
Her apparent crime? Having narrow eyes. 
Some social media users were so outraged that the company eventually removed the ads online, and apologised for making people ""feel uncomfortable"" over them. 
But Ms Cai said that she did not know what she had done to get cyber-bullied, noting that she was ""just doing my job"" as a model. 
""My looks were given to me by my parents,"" the 28-year-old wrote on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.
""Have I insulted China the day I was born just because of how I look?"" 
The ads, originally shot in 2019, were dug up by nationalist netizens amid a period of heightened sensitivity online in China over advertisements depicting Chinese people.
In November, a top Chinese fashion photographer apologised for her ""ignorance"" after a picture she shot for French luxury brand Dior sparked a backlash. It had featured a Chinese model with narrow eyes.
In recent days, there have been other incidents of social media outrage over adverts by Mercedes-Benz and Gucci that featured Chinese women with narrow eyes. 
Amid a growing sense of online nationalism and anti-West sentiment in China, some have seized upon these advertisements as examples of racism towards Chinese people. By featuring models with narrow eyes, critics say these companies are perpetuating Western stereotypes of Chinese faces. 
Many asked why these adverts did not feature the kind of models more commonly seen in Chinese advertisements who have fair skin and large round eyes, which are typically considered ideal beauty features in China.
A recent editorial by state news outlet China Daily highlighted how ""for too long, Western criteria of beauty, and Western tastes and likes and dislikes dominated aesthetics"". That included depicting Asian women in adverts as having narrow eyes, it said.
""The West no longer has an absolute say over everything,"" the opinion piece read. 
""The Chinese people do not need to follow their standards on what constitutes beauty and what kinds of women are considered beautiful.""
As a Chinese brand, Three Squirrels ""should have known about the sensitivity of Chinese consumers to how they are portrayed in advertisements,"", it added. 
At the heart of the controversy is the perception that such depictions invoke the ""slanted eyes"" stereotype of Asian people which emerged in Western culture in the 19th century, and which is considered hugely offensive by many Asians today.
In Hollywood, the quintessential Asian villain Fu Manchu was pictured with thin and narrow eyes. The character embodied and perpetuated ""yellow peril"", the racist idea that Asian cultures threatened Western society.
""There is indeed a long history in the use of 'slanted eyes' to discriminate against Asians,"" Dr Liu Wen from Taiwan's Academia Sinica told BBC Chinese. 
But the insistence among some Chinese on one particular beauty ideal also stands in marked contrast to the current global debate over diversity and the push for wider representation of Asian faces in the media. 
Observers say that while it is understandable that some consumers would be offended over the adverts, the outcry is also too simplistic as it rejects the idea that there can be in fact many different ways to look Chinese. 
""Rejecting 'slanted eyes' is a very dangerous phenomenon, because it is the rejection of aesthetic pluralism,"" Dr Luwei Rose Luqiu from Hong Kong Baptist University said. 
""It's stifling beauty that does not meet a certain standard."" 
Experts have also pointed out that traditional standards of beauty in China had in fact favoured narrow eyes. For example, paintings from what is widely considered as China's golden age for art and culture, the Tang Dynasty period from 618 to 907 AD, prominently featured women with long, narrow eyes. 
""Despite some variations across different dynasties, more narrow eyes were preferred in ancient China,"" said Dr Jaehee Jung, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Delaware. 
The current preference for large round eyes, ironically, may be a recent phenomenon influenced by the West. Some experts believe the latest shift in beauty standards began around the late 1970s, thanks to exposure to foreign advertising and entertainment when China opened its doors to the world.
""Women in contemporary China seem to endorse much of the Western standards for female beauty ideals pervasive in media images,"" said Dr Jung.
These days, large round eyes are so prized that it is not uncommon for young Chinese women to wear makeup or even undergo cosmetic surgery procedures to make their eyes appear bigger, such as creating a ""double eyelid"" crease.
But for Ms Cai, the model at the centre of the latest controversy, she hopes that people can be ""kinder"" to those who look different. She said in her Weibo post that there was no need to attack her even if they did not appreciate her particular look. 
""My eyes are just like this, in fact they're even smaller in real life [than in the ads]... Everyone has their own charm!""

108;Top US phone firms reject call to delay 5G rollout;2022-01-03T05:40:24.000Z;[];['at&t', 'aviation safety', 'telecommunication', '5g', 'air travel'];['joint', 'start', 'worldclass', 'firms', '5g', 'required', 'phone', 'networks', 'verizon', 'letter', 'proposal', 'delay', 'reject', 'services', 'operating', 'rollout'];"
Two of the biggest US phone firms have rejected a government request to delay the rollout of 5G services this week.
The US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) made the request over concerns about aviation safety.
However, AT&T and Verizon did say they will implement temporary safeguards.
Plane makers have warned that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless signals may interfere with sensitive aircraft electronics and could disrupt flights.
In a joint letter, the chief executives of AT&T and Verizon said the proposal to delay for a fortnight the introduction of 5G services, which are due to start on 5 January, would be ""an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks.""  
However, they also said that they will not deploy 5G around airports for six months, similar to an approach adopted in France.
""The laws of physics are the same in the United States and France,"" the letter said. 
""If US airlines are permitted to operate flights every day in France, then the same operating conditions should allow them to do so in the United States,"" it added.
But the FAA said circumstances in France are different, including that telecom firms operating in that country use lower power levels for 5G than are allowed in the US.
The aviation industry and the FAA had previously raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with aircraft equipment like radio altitude meters.
Last month, the bosses of the world's two biggest plane makers, Airbus and Boeing, made an appeal to Mr Buttigieg in which they said ""5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate"". 
The letter cited research by trade group Airlines for America which found that if the FAA's 5G rules had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations.
The airline group urged the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the telecom industry to work with the FAA and aviation companies and said it may go to court on Monday if the FCC does not act.
On Sunday, an FCC spokesperson said the agency is ""optimistic that by working together we can both advance the wireless economy and ensure aviation safety.""

109;CSI creator Anthony E Zuiker: US TV can be too conservative;2022-01-03T08:42:40.000Z;[];['television'];['propelled', 'showing', 'write', 'kind', 'conservative', 'violence', 'uptight', 'stone', 'late', 'creator', 'csi', 'philosophy', 'zuiker', 'sex', 'anthony', 'tv'];"
The creator and executive producer of the CSI franchise has said US TV can be too conservative.
Anthony E Zuiker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Sometimes America is a bit too uptight for its own good.""
The hugely successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series regularly features scenes of violence, often gory injuries and some sex and nudity.
""It's hard to keep up with what people will like and not like hour-upon-hour,"" Zuiker told guest editor Jacky Wright.
He suggested attempts by writers and producers to keep up with changing audience expectations can stifle creativity. ""I just don't think it is good for the evolution of storytelling,"" he said.
Zuiker was speaking to Wright, Microsoft's chief digital officer, who is one of the programme's traditional guest editors over the festive period - and a big fan of the crime series. 
Asked to comment on the debate about showing violence on TV and changing audience expectations, Zuiker told her: ""I tend to be one of those writers and producers that don't necessarily love the restriction of the month, or the flavour of the month. 
""It's like, some years it's OK, some years it's not OK, some years sex is OK, some years it's not OK. And sometimes America is a bit too uptight for its own good. And it's hard to keep up with what people will like and not like, or accept hour-upon-hour. 
""So my philosophy is we kind of write it like we see it. We get less flack for violence, but we are very uptight in the sex department. So any kind of gyration, showing the curvature of a buttock, any enlarged breasts or too much cleavage, we have propelled ourselves from 2020 to the Stone Age as of late, just because America got too uptight for its own good.""
Audience research and ratings guidance have previously indicated US audiences are particularly sensitive to scenes of a sexual nature.
Zuiker added: ""If you look at the show from 2000 to this year's finale, we've definitely gone in a more conservative, nervous fashion, which I just don't think is good for the evolution of storytelling.""
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation first aired in 2000, and the franchise spawned spin-off strands including Miami, New York, Vegas and Cyber.
The show has been credited with improving the public's understanding of forensics and how evidence gathered from a crime scene can be used to build a case against a criminal. 
Zuiker particularly defended the portrayal of violence in the show, the storylines of which often centre around often gory crimes. 
""If we show gratuitous violence, it's really for the sake of underscoring the crime and the evidence, it's not gore for gore or shock value,"" he explained. 
""What I don't want to do is have the writers to be restricted. If you're going to have someone hanging from a chandelier in a casino with no head, that's because it's a mystery, not because you want to shock people.""
He added: ""I just think when we begin to defensively hamper our creativity or defensively write or overly edit before it gets to the next stage of the network reading the draft, because we're too scared about the backlash, I think we start to lose creatively, and the shows go from A+ to C+ very fast.""

110;Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew accuser's deal with Jeffrey Epstein to be released;2022-01-03T09:23:57.000Z;[];['prince andrew, duke of york'];['overdose', 'newsnight', 'deal', 'impossible', 'giuffre', 'prince', 'accusers', 'shot', 'released', 'falklands', 'war', 'told', 'suffered', 'epstein', 'andrew', 'didnt', 'jeffrey', 'sweat', 'virginia'];"
An agreement between Virginia Giuffre and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which could be key to a civil case involving the Duke of York, is to be made public for the first time later.
The 2009 settlement between Epstein and Ms Giuffre is to be released on Monday after an order by judges in the US.
Prince Andrew's lawyers believe it could release him from liability in the case brought by Ms Giuffre, who accuses him of sexual assault when she was 17.
He has consistently denied the claims.
Andrew B Brettler, who represents the duke, had argued at a previous hearing that the ""settlement agreement"" would end Ms Giuffre's lawsuit against Andrew.
The settlement was reached between Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, and the prince's former friend and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.
Mr Brettler had previously told a New York hearing the agreement ""releases Prince Andrew and others from any purported liability arising from the claims Ms Giuffre asserted against Prince Andrew here"".
US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan, who is presiding over the civil case, is due to hold a video teleconference on Tuesday when a request by the duke's legal team to dismiss the case will be heard.
Ms Giuffre is suing the Queen's son for allegedly sexually assaulting her in London, New York and the Virgin Islands when she was a teenager.
She is seeking unspecified damages, but there is speculation the sum could be in the millions of dollars.
She claims she was trafficked by disgraced financier Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 and a minor under US law.
Andrew, 61, has denied all the allegations, telling BBC Newsnight in 2019: ""It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.""
Judge Kaplan last week denied a motion from Andrew's lawyers to halt the civil proceedings while the issue of where Ms Giuffre, now 38 and thought to be residing in Australia, lives is dealt with.
Last week, Ms Giuffre's lawyers said they were seeking proof of Andrew's claim he had an inability to sweat, which he said showed a ""problem"" with her account of an evening with the duke.
""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and it was almost impossible for me to sweat,"" he told Newsnight.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and Andrew's friend, faces the rest of her life in jail after she was convicted last week of helping to procure teenage girls for the disgraced financier to sexually abuse.

A shirt worn by Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is among 100 objects featured in online collections marking the corporation's 2022 centenary.
They include Roy Plomley's 1941 Desert Island Discs proposal letter and a 1935 clipping about the corporation's move to appoint its first female announcer.
The collections on the BBC 100 website highlight its most iconic objects, people and contributors.
It also has a year-by-year timeline.
The three collections are:
Robert Seatter, the BBC's head of history, said the BBC ""has an amazing history which belongs to us all"" and that the digital resources and partner exhibitions ""provide something to intrigue audiences of all ages"".
BBC History has worked with cultural and academic partners for the BBC's centenary, including the British Film Institute. Its list of 100 BBC Gamechangers, announced in the spring, will chronologically list the 100 BBC TV programmes said to have changed the landscape of British TV. 
The Science Museum Group will digitise 1,000 BBC objects for the first time and launch an exhibition and events programme across the UK. 
The centenary will also be marked by other regional museum partners with collections and displays, including the Museum of London; Leicester City Museum; Manchester Museum; Discovery Museum, Newcastle; Sheffield Museum; Liverpool Museum and Showtown Museum, Blackpool. 
There will also be a collaboration with the British Library.
The Science Museum Group's head, Sir Ian Blatchford, said they are ""delighted"" to be part of the celebrations and ""to be telling the story of a century of broadcasting"", adding the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford will be exploring broadcast technologies in the future in an exhibition called Switched On. 
Last year the corporation announced special content including the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, the Women's Euros, the World Cup and Commonwealth Games, new dramas and comedies plus Frozen Planet II, while BBC Three is set to return as a broadcast channel in February.

113;Richard Leakey - fossil expert, conservationist and politician;2022-01-03T15:13:06.000Z;[];['conservation', 'kenya'];['conservationist', 'expert', 'leakey', 'long', 'fossil', 'tough', 'real', 'questioned', 'president', 'recognised', 'man', 'supporters', 'richard', 'pull', 'troubles', 'politician'];"
Richard Leakey, who has died days after celebrating his 77th birthday, was a pugnacious man whose achievements were as remarkable as they were diverse.
Born on 19 December 1944 in Kenya's capital Nairobi, he was a world-famous fossil expert, author and conservationist, as well as being an opposition MP, anti-corruption campaigner, economic reformer, and head of the country's civil service.
He was beaten up, threatened and badly injured in a plane crash which saw him lose both his legs. 
""I think pressure probably suits me,"" Leakey once said with urbane understatement.
His first job was studying fossils. His parents, Louis and Mary, were famous archaeologists and palaeontologists who spent decades exploring Kenya's Rift Valley, searching for the origins of mankind.
In his 20s, Leakey almost eclipsed his parents' work, making his own important finds and writing books.
In the late 1980s, Leakey switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service (KWS) at a time when the organisation was close to collapse and poachers were busy wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations.
Energetic, ruthless and seemingly incorruptible, Leakey told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the public burning of a huge cache of ivory as a publicity stunt to draw global attention to the threat faced by elephants.
""People were genuinely shocked that ivory was causing elephants to become extinct,"" he told the BBC's Vivienne Nunis in an interview in September 2021.
Leakey's methods were successful but his combative style earned him plenty of enemies. It was a pattern that would be repeated again and again.
When, in 1993, the single-engine plane he was flying lost power and crashed, many speculated that it was sabotage. Both of his legs were amputated below the knee.
In 1994 Leakey changed careers once again, quitting the KWS to enter the equally ruthless world of Kenyan politics and helping to form an opposition party called Safina to campaign for multi-party democracy.
""Looking back at my careers, the political side of my life was most rewarding in terms of the country,"" he told the BBC.
But it was far from being an easy ride.
On one occasion he was whipped by hired thugs. President Moi described him as a racist, an atheist and a foreigner.
But in 1999 President Moi shocked the country by appointing Leakey as head of Kenya's civil service, and of a so-called dream team of reformers hired to rescue a country branded one of the world's most corrupt, from a deepening economic crisis.
Supporters said Leakey had been recognised by the president as the only man tough enough and honest enough to pull Kenya out of its troubles, but questioned whether he would last long enough in the job to do any real good.
Critics said the appointment of a white man with no university education was an insult to Kenyans and one which had clearly been orchestrated by colonial mentalities still lurking in the IMF and World Bank.
In his new job Leakey certainly helped to improve relations between Kenya and international lending institutions. His appointment may well have been crucial in persuading the IMF to resume lending the government money.
For a while Leakey enjoyed unprecedented popularity as his dream team started a radical overhaul of the country's bloated, corrupt, nepotistic bureaucracy.
But as usual, Leakey ran into trouble. Some complained again about his uncanny ability to make unnecessary enemies. Others said his anti-corruption drive was threatening the interests of too many powerful figures. Leakey stepped down in 2001 - without giving any public explanation.
Leakey said he planned to retire from active political life. He wanted instead to grow grapes on his farm in the Rift Valley. 
But in 2015, he returned to public life with current President Uhuru Kenyatta appointing him as chairman of the board of the KWS. He brokered a controversial deal that allowed a Chinese-funded railway line to be built through the Nairobi National Park.
""We cannot say to the people of Kenya: 'Oh the railway can't come through Nairobi Park so you won't have a railway for five years',"" he was quoted as saying at the time.
More recently, his focus had moved to what he saw as the biggest environmental threat - climate change.
""We've created a terrible mess,"" he said.
He feared that Kenya's national parks would one day cease to exist because they ""would have dried out or washed out"".
""Poaching, I think we can deal with. But habitat loss and human expansion to encroach on water systems and forests and pollute the air - no, I don't see anything being done in Africa,"" Leakey said. 
He died with his dream of building a museum on the edges of Kenya's Rift Valley, to celebrate evolution and the common history from Africa that all humans share, unfulfilled. 
""I want to build a cathedral of life, with no God,"" he said. 
""We are one species, we came out of Lake Turkana three million years ago and we have to recognise we're all in the same house,"" he said.
Having lived in Kenya all his life, Leakey also called for greater investment in Africa to help create jobs, which he said would allow the continent to ""leap ahead"".
""I'm full of confidence that we have the human resources, Africa has just got to be given a little bit of a lift.""

114;S Korea says man who crossed back to North is gymnast defector;2022-01-03T13:10:35.000Z;[];['asia', 'north korean defectors', 'south korea', 'north korea'];['s', 'gymnast', 'yonhap', 'worked', 'north', 'south', 'korean', 'defector', 'known', 'immediately', 'korea', 'man', 'reported', 'crossed'];"
South Korea's military suspects a man who crossed the heavily fortified border into the North on New Year's Day previously defected to the South.
Officials believe he is a gymnast who jumped the barbed wire fence into South Korea in 2020.
It is not clear why he made the perilous return crossing, or if he is alive or dead. 
North Korea has implemented a shoot-on-sight policy at the border to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Thousands of North Koreans have resettled in South Korea, but crossings through the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which separates the two countries, are rare. Most make their way via China.
Instances of defections from South to North are rarer still, with only a handful of cases recorded in recent years.

South Korean troops were sent to investigate on New Year's Day after surveillance cameras issued an alert that someone was roaming within the military border zone at a point on the east coast.
They could not find the man but discovered he had crossed into North Korea several hours later. 
Citing surveillance footage, a high-level military official confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed the same man who had earlier crossed from North to South Korea in November 2020, using a similar route. 
The man, believed to be in his 30s, worked as a cleaner in South Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. At the time he was detained, he said he was a North Korean gymnast. Other details about him were not immediately known.
""Footage showed he had a identical look and dress as the person who defected from the North in 2020,"" a defence ministry official told reporters.
Military chiefs in Seoul said at the weekend they did not know if the person observed crossing was still alive but had sent a message to the North asking for them to be protected. 
North Korea acknowledged receiving the message, but there are no details about the man's fate or his possible motives for returning. An investigation is under way into how he could have made his crossing undetected. 
The border between North and South Korea is filled with landmines and surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing. Surveillance cameras and armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day. 
Defence officials in Seoul had pledged to overhaul the border defence system after similar breaches in the past.

An Israeli wildlife photographer has captured a remarkable momentary image of a flock of birds forming the shape of a spoon with a heap of sugar.
The illusion happened during what is known as a murmuration, where thousands of starlings fly and swoop in clusters.
Albert Keshet also snapped what appeared to be the spoon bending, posting it on social media.
The images caught the attention of famed Israeli spoon bender Uri Geller, who has framed them in his museum.
Mr Keshet took the images when he went on an early morning excursion to a spot in the northern Jordan Valley to photograph wild plants and birds.
""When I was in the valley looking for birds, I met the flocks of starlings. I stayed there for about five or six hours, watching and following them in order to capture some beautiful pictures,"" he told the BBC.
""At one point they began to ascend to the sky and began the dance of starlings. To my huge surprise, in the space of only about five seconds the starlings formed the shape of the spoon. They held it for a few seconds then the shape changed to a bent spoon - just like the one Uri Geller is famous for!
""In the 10 years that I have been travelling and taking photos, this is one of the most amazing pictures of starlings I have ever taken!""
After posting the images on social media, Mr Keshet was flooded with messages from people expressing amazement. 
Among them was Uri Geller, who is renowned for bending spoons apparently with the power of his mind. He called it a ""phenomenal unique never again moment"", and a ""natural gift"" for his 75th birthday just days earlier.
The self-described ""mystifier"" and psychic has placed the blown-up images in his recently opened museum in Jaffa, in southern Tel Aviv.

116;Prince Andrew accuser’s 2009 deal with Jeffrey Epstein made public;2022-01-03T18:00:13.000Z;[];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'jeffrey epstein'];['case', 'tracks', 'andrew', '2009', 'stop', 'potential', 'went', 'jeffrey', 'prince', 'public', 'accusers', 'epstein', 'pay', 'trial', 'deal'];"
Virginia Giuffre agreed not to sue anyone connected to Jeffrey Epstein who could be described as a ""potential defendant"", a 2009 damages settlement against the sex offender shows.
The document, disclosed by a New York court, reveals the financier paid her $500,000 (£371,000) to end her claim. 
Ms Giuffre is suing the Duke of York in a civil case for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.
He has consistently denied the claims.
Ms Giuffre alleges that 20 years ago she was trafficked to the prince by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 
The document was released ahead of a critical hearing on Tuesday in the civil case involving Prince Andrew.
The prince's lawyers say this previously-secret 2009 deal means she cannot sue him - because she agreed to end all legal action against anyone connected to the offender who could be described as a ""potential defendant"". 
Epstein died in prison in 2019, while Maxwell was last week convicted of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be abused by the late financier.
But Ms Giuffre's legal team say the terms of the Florida settlement are irrelevant to her case against the Prince - which alleges sexual abuse by the royal in New York, London and the US Virgin Islands. 
In her 2009 claim against Epstein, lawyers for Ms Giuffre said she was lured into a world of sexual abuse at his Florida home when she was a teenager. 
They added: ""In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy defendant's [Epstein] every sexual whim, [Ms Giuffre] was also required to be sexually exploited by defendant's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen and or other professional and personal acquaintances."" 
That case never went to trial because on 17 November 2009 Jeffrey Epstein agreed to pay her $500,000 to stop it in its tracks. That deal was confidential until now - but has been made public because of its potential importance to the Prince Andrew case. 
In the document, Ms Giuffre, also referred to by her unmarried name Roberts, agreed to ""release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge"" Epstein and ""any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant"".
The settlement's wording says she discharges ""potential defendants"" from any US legal action, including damages claims dating ""from the beginning of the world"".
""It is further agreed that this Settlement Agreement represents a final resolution of a disputed claim and is intended to avoid litigation. This Settlement Agreement shall not be construed to be an admission of liability or fault by any party.
""The Parties further confirm and acknowledge that this Settlement Agreement is being entered into without any duress or undue influence, and that they have had a full and complete opportunity to discuss the terms of the Settlement Agreement with their own attorneys.""
The precise meaning of that wording is expected to be the subject of intense legal arguments in New York on Tuesday.
During a scheduled hearing, the duke's lawyers are expected to say it means Ms Giuffre's damages claim - which they say is baseless - must be halted. 
In filings to the New York court last month, Andrew B. Brettler, the duke's lead lawyer, said the Epstein settlement's plain language would be clear once it was released to the public. 
""Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit— or lack thereof —to any such claims,"" he said. 
""Giuffre's baseless claims against Prince Andrew ... must be dismissed at this stage.""
Ms Giuffre's lawyers say the Florida settlement is irrelevant. 
In their own court filings they have told the court that the Epstein deal is ""outside the four corners"" of her action against Prince Andrew because it does not cover her claims against him.

117;South Africa parliament fire flares up again;2022-01-03T17:04:13.000Z;[];['south africa', 'cape town'];['flares', 'inside', 'africa', 'south', 'building', 'ms', 'extent', 'hot', 'used', 'temperatures', 'lille', 'parliament', 'structure', 'drone'];"
A devastating fire that swept through South Africa's Houses of Parliament in Cape Town has reignited - hours after it was said to be under control. 
Flames have been billowing from the building's roof. Firefighters are at the scene, trying to douse the blaze.
The fire first broke out on Sunday, totally destroying the National Assembly, or lower chamber. 
Police have arrested a suspect who will appear in court on Tuesday on charges of arson, housebreaking and theft.
Authorities had warned that flare-ups would be possible because of carpets and wooden floors in the building. 
""The void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly is on fire,"" city officials said.
On Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa called the fire a ""terrible and devastating event"". 
He said the building's sprinkler system had not functioned properly, and praised firefighters for responding to the fire in minutes.
The parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured.
Government minister Patricia de Lille said Sunday's fire had led to the ""complete burning down"" of the National Assembly chamber. 
CCTV cameras were not being monitored at the time the fire started on Sunday, she said. 
Other areas of the parliamentary complex - parts of which date back to 1884 - were also badly damaged.
Ms De Lille said it was still too hot for people to go inside the building to check the extent of the damage, but a drone was being used to ""assess the structure of the building until the temperatures can cool down"".
The building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art. 
There is particular concern that the valuable Keiskamma Tapestry, which is 120m (394ft) long and documents South Africa's history, may have been damaged or destroyed.

The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly. The government is based in Pretoria.
Mr Ramaphosa on Sunday spoke of his sadness at ""this destruction of the home of our democracy"". 
Parliament said ""all efforts"" would be made to limit any disruption to its work.
Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the city's Council Chamber would be made available as an alternative place for parliament to meet. 
It was the second fire at the parliament in under a year. In March there was a fire caused by an electrical fault.
Last year, a fire ravaged part of the University of Cape Town's library, which was home to a unique collection of African archives.

118;Turkey's inflation hits 36% amid financial turmoil;2022-01-03T14:42:06.000Z;[];['turkish lira crisis', 'recep tayyip erdogan'];['remained', 'turmoil', 'target', '36', 'past', 'prices', 'official', 'rate', 'financial', 'turkeys', 'forecast', 'inflation', 'amid', 'factors', 'temporary', 'hits'];"
Turkey's annual inflation rate has soared to a 19-year high, underlining the country's financial turmoil and alarm over its president's policies. 
Prices hit more than 36% December as the cost of transport, food and other staples ate into household budgets.
Most central banks raise interest rates to help cool inflation but Turkey has gone the other way.
It has meant a collapse in the value of the lira, as Tayyip Erdogan prioritises exports over currency stability.
The lira shed 44% of its value against the dollar last year, and fell another 5% on Monday before recovering to trade flat. 
The drop in the lira has made the price of inflation-fuelling imports more expensive, ranging from energy to many of the raw materials Turkey's manufacturers turn into exports.
Mr Erdogan has described interest rates as ""the mother and father of all evil,"" and has used more unorthodox policy to try to dampen prices including intervening in foreign exchange markets. 
In a speech on Monday he said Turkey was ""going through a transformation in economy and rising to the next league"".
He said the nation is ""reaping the fruits especially in exports of our country's efforts and hard work in the past 20 years to bolster our foreign trade"". 
One economist forecast that inflation could reach as high as 50% by the spring unless the direction of monetary policy was reversed.
""Rates should be immediately and aggressively hiked because this is urgent,"" said Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting, in Istanbul. But she accepted the central bank was unlikely to act.
Mr Erdogan overhauled the central bank's leadership last year. The bank has slashed rates to 14% from 19% since September.
The subsequent accelerating surge in prices and drop in the lira have upended household and company budgets. 
There were pictures last month of people queuing for subsidised bread in Istanbul, where local officials have said the cost of living was up 50% in a year.
The cost of living is expected to rise further, especially after recent hikes in the price of electricity and gas bills of around 50% and 25% respectively.
The central bank has argued that temporary factors have been driving prices, and had forecast in October it would end the year at 18.4%. The bank's official inflation target is 5%, but the rate has remained in the double digits for the past two years.
To curb the lira's weakness, Mr Erdogan unveiled a scheme three weeks ago in which the state protects converted local deposits from losses versus hard currencies. That sparked a sharp 50% rally in the lira with support from the central bank.
But the lira then sank again last week, prompting a call on Friday from the president for people to keep all their savings in lira and shift gold into banks.
The economic turmoil has hit President Erdogan's opinion poll ratings ahead of planned elections scheduled for no later than mid-2023.

A Canadian court has awarded C$107m (£62m; $84m), plus interest, to the families of six people who died when a plane was downed near Tehran in 2020.
The family members awarded compensation by Ontario's Superior Court of Justice lost spouses, siblings, children, nieces and nephews.
Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by two missiles after taking off. Iran has said it mistook the aircraft for a US missile.
All 176 people on board died. 
They included 55 Canadians and 35 permanent residents of Canada. The relatives had filed a civil lawsuit against Iran and other officials who they say were to blame for the incident.
It was not immediately clear how the money would be collected from Iran. The relatives' lawyer, Mark Arnold, said his team would look to seize Iranian assets in Canada and abroad, which could include oil tankers.
This is the first time that compensation has been awarded to the families of the victims, CBC reports, adding that Iran did not defend itself in court.
Last year a report by the Canadian government said Iran was ""fully responsible"" for the downing of the plane, and that it had been a result of ""incompetence"" and ""recklessness"". 
Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility for the incident, which happened on 8 January 2020. But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force said an air defence unit had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US missile.
Iran's air defences had been on high alert because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces. That was in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad five days earlier.

121;Covid-19: French MPs get death threats over support for vaccine pass;2022-01-03T16:13:44.000Z;[];['france', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['support', 'french', 'pass', 'deterred', 'bfm', 'threats', 'death', 'vaccine', 'supporting', 'mps', 'reported', 'interview', 'covid19', 'tv'];"
Several French MPs say they have received death threats as they debate a Covid-19 pass that would bar the unvaccinated from much of public life.
The government is seeking to pass a law that would require people to show proof of vaccination to access public venues and transport with some exceptions.
The legislation is expected to be approved in a vote this week but has angered vaccine opponents.
France has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the EU.
At least 91% of the adult population have been fully jabbed, according to the French government.
On Sunday Agnès Firmin Le Bodo of the centre-right Agir party tweeted an email she received containing graphic threats to kill her over her support for the vaccination pass.
""Our democracy is in danger,"" wrote Ms Firmin Le Bodo, who is also a pharmacist and vaccinates people against Covid.
In an interview with BFM TV, she said she had reported the threats to the police and would not be deterred from supporting the vaccine pass.
Another MP, Naïma Moutchou of the Horizons party, shared a similar tweet which included a screenshot of an emailed threat.
In parliament on Monday, Health Minister Olivier Véran condemned the death threats and the ""selfishness"" of vaccine opponents.
Last week Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said police would strengthen protections for elected officials ahead of the vote on vaccine passes.
Barbara Bessot Ballot of the ruling En Marche! party said MPs had received messages threatening to kill them for ""attacking our freedom"".
""Those death threats are unacceptable,"" she wrote on Twitter.
Throughout the pandemic, critics have accused French President Emmanuel Macron's government of violating freedoms by imposing Covid rules. Protests against these rules have been held regularly.
For months France has asked people to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public venues.
But the French government has decided to remove the option to show a negative test in response to record increases in infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron and Delta variants of Covid.
The government is aiming to bring the vaccine pass into force in mid-January, once it has been approved by parliament.
Most parties back the vaccine pass, which is expected to be passed by the lower house early this week, before being debated in the Senate on Wednesday.

122;David Bowie: Singer's estate sells rights to his entire body of work to WCM;2022-01-03T19:55:28.000Z;[];['david bowie', 'music'];['bowie', 'singers', 'body', 'recessionproof', 'rights', 'think', 'replaced', 'stream', 'estate', 'david', 'regular', 'number', 'sells', 'record', 'streaming', 'work', 'entire', 'quite', 'wcm', 'proving'];"
David Bowie's estate has sold the publishing rights to his ""entire body of work"" to Warner Chappell Music, including hundreds of songs such as Space Oddity, Changes and Let's Dance.
WCM now has global music publishing rights to his song catalogue, the singer's estate told the BBC. 
Variety suggested the deal was worth ""upwards of $250m (£185m)"", but the terms of the agreement were not given.
WCM head Guy Moot said they were ""proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"".
Bowie died of cancer in 2016. He was hailed as an extraordinary artist and genius in a huge global outpouring of tributes from fellow music stars, including Sir Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Brian Eno and Madonna among others.
The agreement with WCM includes the 26 studio albums released during Bowie's lifetime and the posthumous studio album release, Toy, plus the two studio albums from Tin Machine - the rock supergroup fronted by Bowie. 
Tracks released as singles from soundtracks and other projects are also included.
Given the ups and downs of the music industry over the last 20 years, the appeal of a big cheque is, perhaps, unsurprising - especially for 'heritage' acts.   
Streaming may not quite have replaced the billions lost by the decline of the CD, but it is, for many established artists, proving to be a regular, and largely recession-proof, income stream; and for record labels and a number of new firms who have entered the market, this is, they think, a lucrative asset.  
With the music industry becoming ever more complicated, with licensing deals over streaming, adverts, films, video games and online video to negotiate, the artists - or their estates and families - have a large and hassle-free deposit in the bank, and the complicated job of turning music into money is left to the experts.  
With Spotify adding 60,000 songs to its catalogue every day, the chance of a new act making a splash seems tougher than ever - legacy artists with 50 years of fame and proven sales look like a relatively safe bet.
Bowie released a total of 111 singles, averaging two per year during his career, and 51 music videos.
This deal follows huge names, including Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, recently selling the rights to their music catalogues. 
Moot, who is WCM's co-chairman and chief executive, said Bowie's was ""one of the most ground-breaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history"", adding he had ""inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media"".
""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,"" he said.

He described Bowie's ""vision and creative genius"" driving him to ""push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture"". 
The executive added they were looking forward to ""tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care"".
WCM said the agreement followed last year's announcement of a deal between Bowie's estate and Warner Music Group [WMG], for it to oversee his full back catalogue of albums between 1968 and 1999.
""Warner Music has licensed worldwide rights to Bowie's recorded music catalogue from 1968. With this new deal with Warner Chappell, WMG is now home to Bowie's body of work as both a songwriter and recording artist,"" WCM added.
Warner Chappell Music is the global music publishing company of Warner Music Group. WCM co-chair and COO Carianne Marshall said they were ""pleased"" the estate felt they had the "" knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature"".
She called Bowie's music a ""living, breathing collection of timeless songs that are as powerful and resonant today as they were when they were first written"".
Allen Grubman , speaking on behalf of Bowie's estate, said: ""We are truly gratified that David Bowie's body of music will now be in the capable hands of Warner Chappell Music Publishing. We are sure they will cherish it and take care of it with the greatest level of dignity.""
Bowie's innovation was not just in the recording studio and in front of the camera - he was also involved in the world of finance. In the mid-90s, Bowie, his financial manager Bill Zysblat, and banker David Pullman came up with a new scheme to generate cash from the singer's extensive back catalogue.
In 1997, Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years. The securities, which were bought by US insurance giant Prudential Financial for $55m, committed him to repay his new creditors out of future income, and gave a fixed annual return of 7.9%.
He struck a deal with record label EMI which allowed him to package up and sell bonds on royalties for 25 albums released between 1969 and 1990 - which included classics such as The Man Who Sold The World, Ziggy Stardust, and Heroes, according to the Financial Times.
But in 2004, rating agency Moody's Investors Services downgraded Bowie bonds to only one level above ""junk"", the lowest rating, after a downturn in the music industry.
Bowie had already predicted the decline in traditional music sales, telling the New York Times in 2002 that music would become ""like running water or electricity"".

124;UK steel future uncertain without US tariffs deal;2022-01-04T00:07:07.000Z;[];['steel industry', 'trump tariffs', 'global trade', 'brexit', 'trade'];['way', 'steel', 'trade', 'product', 'pattern', 'future', 'uncertain', 'tariffs', 'used', 'set', 'originates', 'uk', 'spain', 'deal'];"
UK steel companies have been operating at a significant disadvantage compared to their European rivals since the beginning of 2022. 
The EU has done a deal with the US, which took effect on 1 January, to allow companies to export steel to the US again without any tariffs.
The UK is yet to reach a similar agreement though it is hoping for more talks with America this month.
It means British companies still face a 25% tariff on exports to the US.
And the effect of the change is already being felt.  
At a foundry in Chesterfield, raw materials are being melted in a furnace to make cast iron bars.
Steel and cast iron are no longer a huge chunk of the British economy but they are about to get a little bit smaller.
Because of the US tariffs on products from the UK, United Cast Bar Limited (UCB), the company that runs this foundry, is moving some of its production to a factory in Spain. 
""60% of the products we can make here we can also make in Spain,"" says James Brand, managing director of foundries at UCB. ""And our customers don't want that extra 25% cost.""
But if the UK manages to do a deal of its own with the US, will that production come back?
""Probably not,' he says. ""It really depends on how early the deal is done."" 
Once US importers get used to consignments arriving from Spain, a new trade pattern will have been established and the way the tariffs have been set up means they can't be avoided if any part of a product originates in the UK.
""It is highly likely we will just leave it over there (in Spain),"" Mr Brand says. ""Lost to the UK completely, then.""  
It was President Donald Trump who signed an order in 2018 to introduce the steel tariffs on national security grounds, which he claimed was to help protect US jobs. 
If the UK government had hoped that Joe Biden's administration would change course quickly, it has been disappointed. 
Neither public diplomacy nor private negotiation has yet led to any breakthrough. 
Following Mr Trump's move, both the UK and the EU retaliated with tariffs of their own against US products. But it is the EU that has got a deal done first, to resolve the dispute.   
That's partly because in trade, size matters. 
""They (the EU) are just bigger so they account for more steel exports to the US, and that means there is more interest from US importers in getting it resolved,"" says Soumaya Keynes, Britain economics editor at The Economist.
""And because there is more trade involved with the EU, the retaliation hurts more.""
The EU was also more explicit about how it intended to accelerate retaliation against the American tariffs. 
The UK was, says Ms Keynes, ""a bit friendlier, a bit chummier, and that could mean the EU had more leverage."" 
For the UK government, there is an added complication. 
There is political concern in Washington about British threats to suspend parts of the post-Brexit deal with the EU on Northern Ireland. 
The two issues are quite separate, but it is possible that one could delay the other. 
The government argues that the steel dispute could in fact lead to further complications in Northern Ireland, because of its special status as part of the EU single market for goods. 
But it is an awkward mix.
There is also the question of stepping up UK retaliation against the US tariffs. 
The government's formal response to a public consultation on further counter-measures has already been delayed, and it cannot be put off forever, 
Trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan issued a careful warning when she spoke to the BBC last month, after returning from a visit to Washington, 
""We had a very frank conversation, and I was very clear that the pressures that we are under to use countervailing measures if we can't solve the problem are becoming more and more acute.""  
The government certainly hopes the dispute can be resolved soon, before it gets worse. 
A solution later this month would be a great relief, and the message from industry is pretty clear. 
""Crack on, please,"" says UCB's James Brand. ""Let's get a deal brokered as soon as possible and put us on a level playing field with the rest of Europe."" 
It wasn't supposed to be like this. After Brexit, the UK was relying on a closer relationship with the US than it had when it was part of the EU.  
But in matters of trade, many things are easier said than done.

125;Elizabeth Holmes: Theranos founder convicted of fraud;2022-01-04T01:19:40.000Z;[];['theranos trial', 'medical technology'];['separate', 'elizabeth', 'convicted', 'senior', 'mr', 'founder', 'holmes', 'sexual', 'month', 'theranos', 'faces', 'stepped', 'trial', 'fraud', 'relationship'];"
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been convicted of defrauding investors after a months-long landmark trial in California. 
Prosecutors said Holmes knowingly lied about technology she said could detect diseases with a few drops of blood.
Jurors found Holmes guilty of four charges, including conspiracy to commit fraud against investors and three counts of wire fraud.
The 37-year-old could face up to 20 years in prison.
Holmes faced 11 charges in total and was found not guilty of four charges relating to defrauding the public. 
The split verdict came after the judge said the jury, having deliberated for seven days, could deliver a partial verdict after being unable to reach consensus on another three counts.
Theranos, at one point valued at $9bn (£6.5bn), was once the darling of Silicon Valley.
The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry, but its claims began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. 
For nearly four months at trial, the jury of eight men and four women were presented with two starkly different accounts of the former self-made billionaire, whose downfall shook Silicon Valley.
Calling some 30 witnesses, the prosecution sought to prove that Ms Holmes knew the product she was selling to investors was a sham, but remained hell-bent on the firm's success. 
At trial, multiple lab directors testified they told Holmes about the flaws in Theranos' technology but were instructed to downplay their concerns. At the same time, they said, Holmes told investors the technology was operating as planned. 
Holmes ""chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients"", said prosecutor Jeff Schenk in closing arguments. ""That choice was not only callous, it was criminal."" 
The defence countered with descriptions of a dedicated and driven businesswoman, making waves in a male-dominated industry.

Testifying in her own defence, Holmes acknowledged mistakes in Theranos' operation, but maintained she never knowingly defrauded patients or investors. 
The defence also laid blame on Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Holmes' former business partner and long-term boyfriend. 
Holmes has accused Mr Balwani, 19 years her senior, of emotional and sexual abuse - allegations he denies. Their decade-long relationship came to an end around the same time he stepped down as CEO in May 2016. He faces a separate trial next month. 
Holmes founded Theranos as a teenager, shortly after dropping out of chemical engineering at Stanford University. 
She was able to raise more than $900m from billionaires such as media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison.
The firm officially ceased operations in 2018 following the scandal.

Gunmen tried to kill Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry during an event on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the country's independence, officials say.
The incident happened as Mr Henry took part in the ceremony at a church in the northern city of Gonaïves.
Video posted online showed the prime minister and his entourage scrambling toward their cars amid intense gunfire.
The security situation has deteriorated significantly since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse last July.
Mr Henry has pledged to crack down on powerful gangs that are blamed for a wave of kidnappings and for seizing control of much of the gas distribution around the country,  causing severe fuel shortages.
The prime minister's office said ""bandits and terrorists"" were behind the assassination attempt, and that arrest warrants had been issued for the suspects.
The office accused the group of hiding behind walls to attack the convoy and of threatening the bishop by surrounding the church, according to the Associated Press.
One person was killed and two others were injured in the gunfight between the armed men and security forces, local media reported.
The attack is another blow to the fragile administration led by Mr Henry, who became Haiti's acting head of state two weeks after Moïse was killed. The circumstances of the assassination, believed to have been carried out by a group of mercenaries, are still unclear.
No date has been announced for a vote to elect a new president.
The rise in violence and a dire economic situation, made worse by several natural disasters in recent years, have led to a growing number of Haitians seeking opportunities in other countries.

127;Sound Of 2022: Mimi Webb makes music to break up to... as her ex-boyfriend found out;2022-01-04T00:00:10.000Z;[];['tiktok', 'sound of 2022', 'music', 'adele'];['piano', 'mimi', 'break', 'teacher', 'secondary', 'lesson', 'music', 'sang', 'exboyfriend', 'school', 'makes', 'play', '2022', 'sound', 'webb', 'thinking', 'sing', 'told'];"
When Mimi Webb started recording her EP, Seven Shades Of Heartbreak, last year, she had no idea it would prove prophetic.
Writing songs about the loves she'd lost focused her attention on her current relationship - and she wasn't keen on what she discovered, as her boyfriend quickly learned
""The EP helped me realise that that relationship wasn't right for me,"" she confesses. ""It really helped me figure out what I felt was missing... And he probably struggles with it, you know? When he listens to the EP, he's going to think 'Oh, God'"".
Still, she wouldn't change a thing. 
""It's just so crazy how I look back on that EP now,"" she says during our conversation in mid-December. ""It came out two months ago and I was in such a different place. It's really showed how much can change within a short period.""
That applies equally to her personal and her professional life. Seven Shades Of Heartbreak became the 21-year-old's first top 10 album, and she ended the year performing her single, Good Without, on the Top of the Pops Christmas special.
Now, she's earned third place on BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022 list - which means she's been identified by a panel of more than 130 record industry experts and fellow musicians as one of next year's breakthrough stars.
""I think Mimi is a real talent, and definitely one of the most exciting breakthrough artists,"" says pop star Tom Grennan, who voted in the poll. ""Her voice and song craft combined are incredibly potent.""
""Oh my god, that's insane,"" says Webb on hearing she's made the top three. 
""The Sound Of list is something I'd look out for every year. I always thought I'd love to be on there one day, so this is incredible!""
A precocious talent with a powerful, octave-destroying vocal range, Webb has been performing ever since she was a child in Canterbury.
A talent show regular, she had a brief role on EastEnders, before Adele's 19 gave her ""goosebumps"" and made her fall in love with the idea of becoming a songwriter.
She honed her skills at the British Institute of Modern Music (BIMM), discovering a talent for what she calls ""powerhouse sing-your-heart out songs"" and nabbing a record deal at the tender age of 18.
Her very first release, Before I Go, blew up on TikTok after she sang it a capella in a New York restaurant for social media star Charli D'Amelio. 
85 million views later, she began to unleash a barrage of emotionally-charged pop songs - Good Without, Dumb Love, 24/5 - which have made her a constant presence on Radio 1 over the last 12 months.
But while her songs dig deep, she's unabashedly positive in real life. Everything is ""incredible"" and ""exciting"" and ""crazy"", suggesting that, relationship troubles aside, Webb is savouring her success with unabashed glee.
Here's what she had to say about her career so far - from the piano teacher who spotted her talent, to her surprisingly modest tour rider.
When did you discover you could sing?
I think I was probably eight years old. I always sang, since I was a toddler - but I think the moment when I first thought, ""Oh, there's something going on here"" was when I was eight and doing choir and musical theatre at school.
Who was the first person who encouraged you?
It was my piano teacher at secondary school. In my first lesson, he asked me what could I play and I said, ""Oh, I can play Someone Like You by Adele and I can sing it, too."" He was probably thinking, ""Hang on, this is a piano lesson"" but when I sang, he just was blown away. He then called up the guitar teacher, who came and listened too, and they basically got my mum on the school phone and told her, ""This is something you need to pursue"".  I was so excited!
What was the first song you wrote for yourself?
Actually, I've been writing since I was 10 years old. I'd sing these random songs I made up in my head in the back of the car. My mum used to assume they were real songs, but they weren't! And the more I did it, the more she would be like, ""Oh my gosh, this is quite cool."" 
You ended up leaving home at 16 to attend BIMM in Brighton. What was that like?
BIMM was two hours away from Canterbury - so it was very intense and scary. I had to move in with a host family and make a whole new friendship group.  But I kept saying to myself, ""I want to be an artist and this is the way I need to go about it. If I go two stairs up, I won't be going back down.""
One of the first songs you uploaded was a drum and bass track that attracted the attention of your manager, is that right?
Yeah. It was indeed.
Is it still available anywhere?
No, it actually got taken down in the end. It's an interesting one because I basically sang a melody over this DJ's track and then I dropped it online. I wanted to just get someone to hear my voice - and that's how I found my manager Rob and we've been smashing it ever since.
If you had to rate that song out of 10 from today's perspective, what would it get?
Erm, a six? It wasn't bad - but obviously my music is very different now.
How soon after that did you write Before I Go?
I wrote Before I Go when I was 18, in the summer and it was probably sitting there for a good year before we released it in February of 2020. It's my first baby!
And how did you end up singing it on Charli D'Amelio's TikTok?
So basically, I didn't even know what TikTok was - but I met Charli in New York around Christmas 2019,  and I told her about my music and she just started supporting it, like, amazingly. The amount of people that heard that song just from a few videos that she did was just unbelievable. Just to see that reaction, especially in the pandemic, was crazy.
You've got your own TikTok account now, and I love how much your family get involved in the videos. How do they feel about it?
Oh my God, they just love seeing how happy I am. They're just so proud and I'm just so grateful that they're so supportive. 
There's a video where you put your dad in the front seat of your car and play him Halfway for the first time. What's it like sharing something so emotional and raw with him?
He definitely asked, ""What's going on here? Did he break your heart?""  But that's one of the things - from this experience of playing my music, I've built a very honest relationship between me my parents where they can get to know me through my lyrics. And it's been so nice to be able to go to my dad and get advice.
In Halfway, you sing about a five-year relationship - so is the whole EP about the same person? 
Half of the EP's about my first ever boyfriend, and then the second is probably about my ex-boyfriend. It's crazy because I was in a relationship when I was writing this EP, and the EP kind of helped me realise that that relationship wasn't right for me. 
The song Good Without feels like it might be about that realisation... The lyric ""I'm good without you"" is all about moving on and building back your confidence, right?
It really is. It's not about that break-up from two months ago - but it's got that empowerment to it. And I went back to it when I was going through all that stuff, and it really helped me out. I was just so grateful that it was there. 
If you didn't have the music, what would be your top tip for getting over heartbreak?
Get into a routine, take your time, going out with good friends and having a little laugh really helps. And put yourself first. ""You can't love anyone else until you love yourself,"" that's always what my mum used to say to me. 
Are your family helping to keep you grounded now that your career's taking off?
One hundred per cent. I just moved to my own place in London about a month ago, but I'm always, on the phone to them, FaceTiming, catching up. They keep my feet on the floor. 
You haven't started asking for puppies on your rider, then?
Oh gosh, no. Just sausage rolls.
Amazing! Are sausage rolls good for the voice?
Do you know what? I think they're alright. A bit of pastry doesn't do you any harm!
Until a flake gets stuck in your throat...
Oh my gosh, you're right. No more sausage rolls then.
There's a vocal run in the chorus of Dumb Love that covers an octave and a half in two bars. Is that tricky to sing live?
Oh, it's great live. The song has a nice pace, so getting to the high note isn't too hard because I have time to breathe. 
Do you know what your vocal range is like? How many octaves you can cover?
Quite a few. I can go very high and I can go pretty low. You'd think with my husky voice that upper register would be tough for me, but I can get a high, sweet-sounding note.
The video for Halfway was filmed in an empty theme park. What was the best ride?
Oh, we had so much fun on the teapots. I have three of my best friends in the video and we all had such a laugh. We were so dizzy. 
Is that the best pop star perk you've had so far?
Actually, it's more about when people come up to you at the end of a show. Those are the moments that really take your breath away and make you think, ""Wow, I can't believe I'm here"". 
But the whole thing is exciting. You're in the studio one minute being a songwriter, and then the next minute you're on stage, then you're doing an interview or you're filming a new music video. I just love every part of it.
That's cool, because I think a lot of people feel frazzled by all of that - but you're clearly throwing yourself into it, full force.
Straight in and thrashing it out!
And what does 2022 hold for you?
The start of 2022 is in the studio. I'll be in LA writing for a little bit, then I'll be off on my Europe and UK tour. It's going to be so good.

128;Is there a better way to make new resolutions stick?;2022-01-04T00:03:53.000Z;[];['apps', 'fitness', 'life', 'lifestyle'];['way', 'tell', 'form', 'junior', 'better', 'karmakar', 'look', 'journal', 'thing', 'resolutions', 'shubhangi', 'stick', 'isnt', 'psychiatry'];"
""Run. Work on doctorate."" So begin all my to-do lists but progress is elusive. With New Year's resolution season here - perhaps technology can make me into a more productive machine.
""An extraordinary amount of what we do is habit,"" says Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.
It is estimated that between 45% and 95% of what we do is habitual, ""but I'd reckon towards the higher end of that range,"" says Prof Kelly.
We act according to our habits, ""from the time we rise and go through our morning routines, until we fall asleep after evening routines,"" says Ann Graybiel, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
We develop those habits by encoding them in a part of our brain called the striatum, which deals with reward and releases the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter dopamine, her research shows.
Now a new cohort of apps - with names like SnapHabit, Habitica and Strides - reckon we can reprogram our habits to improve our lives and be happier.
SnapHabit, for instance, arrives with two default habits: to take a daily walk, and ring a friend.
At the bottom appear ""guided journeys"", or sample practices you can select to exercise in the habit app gym. For example, becoming a more committed opponent of racism is one, doing 100 press-ups a day is another.
Or, you can choose your own. I add ""Run for an hour"", and ""Colour two boxes"" on the days I selected. It is strangely satisfying.
Short-term rewards like this are important for changing our habits, says Prof Kelly. Doing physical exercise just to be healthier ""is not enough to sustain a daily habit"", he warns. 
And to get a new habit or change an old one, the change ""needs to be small, should ideally be tied to an existing habit, and must be rewarding in the short term,"" Prof Kelly adds.
So, apps can help contribute toward short-term rewards. And also tie our new habits to existing ones. Like checking our mobiles, or sharing things we've done with our friends.
Telling people in our lives about our attempts to change a habit can also make us work harder - because we then have friends to hold us accountable.
""We did a correlation analysis. How many friends you had on the app was correlated with how successful you were in changing your habits,"" says Jake Bernstein, SnapHabit's co-founder.
Similarly, Habitica, another app, includes ""a quest function that incorporates social accountability,"" says Vicky Hsu, who was an early user of the app and then became chief executive of the company behind it.
More technology of business:
""If you don't do any of the things that you've committed to for the day, then the app takes away points from you and from everyone else who's opted in to participating in the quest with you,"" explains Ms Hsu.
And collecting ""random pets"" as part of the game helped her stay on top of meditating, exercising, and going to bed on time, she says.
""I found the visual representation of the work I was doing extremely helpful, especially since I do a lot of intangible work that doesn't necessarily feel productive,"" says Ms Hsu, who also practises as a lawyer.
On SnapHabit, the largest group, 32.7% of users, is trying to exercise more. In second place, 15.9% are trying to build habits to learn or study.
Mr Bernstein says he was surprised by some of the habits people set up -  for example, ""not masturbating"".
If an app successfully helps us change our habits, it's likely because it mirrors behavioural principles for how we can best train the basal ganglia in the striatum in our brain.
One aspect is cognitive load: this is the mental effort involved in completing a task or learning new information.
We're more likely to learn a new habit when this is low, so by marking tasks we've completed, an app can reduce it, and make forming the habit easier for us.
Another is called the ""Zeigarnik effect"": we remember incomplete tasks more than ones we've completed.
So, by showing progress bars or percentages, an app can help remind us of our tasks in progress.
Talking about the origin of his own app, ""I originally built it to solve my own problem,"" says Mr Bernstein.
""I know the things that I enjoy doing and that give me fulfilment, so how can I map the way I spend my time to those things.""
He had begun quantifying his time with a Fitbit, but when Covid started he wanted to make it ""more social, make us more connected and help us meet our goals together"".
It's a similar story to Kyle Richey's, founder of the Strides habit app. ""In 2011, I was using to-do list and calendar apps to manage my day,"" he says.
These were ""awesome replacements for their analogue counterparts, but I felt like something was missing,"" he observes.
""I wanted to do more than put an ""!"" on a task. I needed a way to prioritise the right things and use behavioural science techniques to stay motivated and focused.""
Apps that show you the number of consecutive days you've followed a new habit represent ""a super powerful tactic but can also be incredibly frustrating if you drop them"", says Mr Bernstein. 
It's important ""to be compassionate to yourself when you fail,"" he says. And take away something positive, like insight about what motivates you.
An app ""will never tell you to take a break and look after yourself,"" says Shubhangi Karmakar, a junior doctor in Dublin and an editor of the British Journal of Psychiatry. ""The important thing isn't just to form a habit, but to form a healthy one,"" she says.
Changing our behaviour is ""the hardest thing"", adds Mr Bernstein. And ultimately, apps like these on their own can only go so far.
After all, for me, the consecutive number of days spent working on my doctorate still remains stubbornly stuck at zero.

129;Elon Musk: Tesla criticised after opening Xinjiang showroom;2022-01-04T02:26:24.000Z;[];['xinjiang', 'elon musk', 'tesla', 'china', 'uighurs'];['criticised', 'teslas', 'paul', 'musk', 'elon', 'scott', 'showroom', 'xinjiang', 'president', 'manufacturing', 'opening', 'ill', 'place', 'taking', 'industry', 'tesla'];"
Electric car maker Tesla has been criticised in the US after opening a showroom in China's controversial Xinjiang region.
The company, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, opened the showroom in the city of Urumqi on New Year's Eve.
However, the move has been welcomed by some in China.
China has been accused of slavery and genocide against the Uyghur minority group in the resource-rich western region of the country.
Republican senator Marco Rubio, who sponsored a bill signed into law by President Joe Biden in December that requires firms to prove that goods imported from Xinjiang were not produced with forced labour, spoke out about Tesla's decision.
Mr Rubio tweeted: ""Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labour in the region.""
Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance of American Manufacturing industry body, said: ""I'll be blunt: Any company doing business in Xinjiang is complicit in the cultural genocide taking place there. But Tesla's actions are especially despicable.""
Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the BBC.
However, the opening of the new Tesla showroom was widely welcomed by users of China's Twitter-like Weibo social media platform.
One user posted: ""Thank you for expanding in Xinjiang, happy new year!"". Another said: ""You see, Tesla supports the development and construction of Xinjiang, unlike some companies.""
Late last year, US microchip giant Intel apologised after a backlash over a letter it sent urging suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang.
The company's letter sparked criticism in China, with calls for a boycott.
Intel was not the first company to come under pressure over aims to comply with sanctions related to Xinjiang while continuing to operate in China.
Retail giants Nike and H&M also faced a backlash last year after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uyghur forced labour in cotton production.
The Xinjiang region of China is home to many of country's Muslim Uyghur population and there have been allegations of forced labour and possibly genocide.
In December 2020, the BBC published an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities, including Uyghurs, into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. 
Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.

130;Elizabeth Holmes: Has the Theranos scandal changed Silicon Valley?;2022-01-04T00:56:41.000Z;[];['companies', 'theranos trial', 'silicon valley', 'fraud'];['technology', 'scandal', 'elizabeth', 'looking', 'particularly', 'stage', 'substantive', 'holmes', 'silicon', 'theranos', 'valley', 'wisdom', 'startup', 'investors', 'right', 'work', 'changed'];"
For years Elizabeth Holmes was the darling of Silicon Valley, a woman that could do no wrong.
The start-up she founded, Theranos, attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investments.
Yet the company she had built was based on fantasy science.
The technology Theranos was producing - supposedly testing for hundreds of diseases with a pin prick of blood - seemed incredible. And it was. 
Millions of dollars were squandered and some who used the company's tests, including a cancer patient, say they were misdiagnosed.
Now, years after Theranos collapsed, Holmes has been found guilty in California on four counts of conspiring to defraud investors.
For an outsider to Silicon Valley the story sounds nonsensical. How were so many people taken in?
Yet in Silicon Valley, many believe that Theranos - far from being an aberration - speaks of systemic problems with start-up culture.
In Silicon Valley, hyping up your product - over-promising - isn't unusual, and Holmes was clearly very good at it.
A Stanford University drop-out, she was, by all accounts articulate, confident and good at presenting a vision - a mission as she described it - to revolutionise diagnostics. 
Sceptical experts told her that her idea was just that - an idea - and wouldn't work.
But she projected an unfaltering confidence that the technology would change the world.
""It's baked in to the culture"" said Margaret O'Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.
 ""If you are a young start-up in development - with a barely existent product - a certain amount of swagger and hustle is expected and encouraged"" she said.  
Particularly at an early stage, when a start-up is in its infancy, investors are often looking at people and ideas rather than substantive technology anyway. General wisdom holds that the technology will come with the right concept - and the right people to make it work. 
Ms Holmes was brilliant at selling that dream, exercising a very Silicon Valley practice: 'fake it until you make it'. 
Her problem was she couldn't make it work. Her lawyers argued that Holmes was merely a businesswoman who failed, but was not a fraudster.
The problem in Silicon Valley is that the line between fraud and merely playing into the faking it culture is very thin.
""Theranos was an early warning of a cultural shift in Silicon Valley that has allowed promoters and scoundrels to prosper,"" said tech venture capitalist Roger McNamee, who is critical of big tech and did not invest in Theranos. 
He believes that a culture of secrets and lies in Silicon Valley, a culture that allowed Theranos' tech to go un-analysed, is ""absolutely endemic"". 
Ambition can be good. Promising a brighter future, and then trying to realise that vision, brought about computers and smartphones.
But for investors, trying to separate the charlatans from the revolutionaries is a constantly evolving challenge.
Last month, Silicon Valley phone app start-up HeadSpin's CEO and founder, Manish Lachwani, was arrested for allegedly defrauding investors. For people putting money on the line, there are great fortunes to be made and lost.
In Silicon Valley intellectual property is closely guarded. The 'coke' recipe, the secret sauce, is often the thing that gives a company value, and new technology firms are particularly sensitive to having their ideas copied or stolen. 
Secrecy is important for these companies to succeed - but that culture of secrecy can also be used as a smoke screen, particularly when even employees and investors don't understand or aren't given access to the technology itself.
This is what happened at Theranos. Journalists, investors, politicians, you name it, were all told the science was there. Yet when questions were asked they were told the technology was so secret that it could not be fully explained, analysed or tested. 
Walgreens, a major client of Theranos, became exasperated with the lack of information given by the company about how the system worked. 
There are many Silicon Valley companies I've reported on that will not fully explain how their tech actually works. They claim to have ""proprietary"" systems that cannot yet be revealed or peer-reviewed. 
The system is based on trust, yet it is fundamentally at odds with a culture of ""faking it"" and creates the perfect environment for Thernanos-type scandals, where claims that aren't true are left unchallenged. 
A system that places so much emphasis on secrecy needs lawyers, and lots of them. Companies don't want their employees running off with ideas. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are endemic in the start-up world - and by no means confined to tech. 
But Silicon Valley's culture of secrecy makes it notably difficult for whistle-blowers. 
After the company's collapse, former Theranos employees spoke of intense pressure to withdraw negative public remarks or stay quiet altogether. The company hired aggressive, expensive and very active lawyers to protect Theranos's reputation.
This is not uncommon in Silicon Valley, says Cori Crider from Foxglove, a group that helps whistle-blowers come forward. 
""I spent more than a decade working in national security and I very often feel like Silicon Valley types play from the playbook of the CIA on this stuff"", she said.
""They have managed to scare people and make them think they don't have the right to raise legitimate issues.""
If founders and chief executives aren't being honest, employees need to feel comfortable raising the alarm. All too often they don't.
Amid the hype, it can be easy to forget that many investors looked at Theranos and passed - especially those with a knowledge of healthcare. 
Among those who were notable investors were people and groups without expertise in health, such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
For these investors with capital, often their decision to put in a stake assumes that smaller early stage funders have done their homework on the tech. 
""They're kind of taking third party validation at its word,"" said Ms O'Mara. 
Once again, it's a system based on trust - later investors trusting that earlier ones know what they're doing. The problem here is, with so much money sloshing around, that is not a given.
In the end, Theranos got caught. As a health technology company doing real life diagnostics, results and regulators would eventually prove it real or fake. 
But with many Silicon Valley companies selling the supposedly new and the cutting edge in fields far less tightly regulated, scrutiny is more lax.
Today, the 'fake it until you make it' culture is still alive and well - as is the repressive culture of secrecy and the aggressive use of NDAs for employees.  It's a model that has its advantages - and helps churn out extremely valuable and sometimes innovative companies. 
But it also means the ingredients are still in place for another Theranos scandal.

131;Omicron stats are huge, but look beyond them;2022-01-04T03:28:53.000Z;[];['nhs', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['data', 'trusts', 'hospital', 'look', 'england', 'bed', 'wales', 'nhs', 'shown', 'patients', 'omicron', 'stats', 'huge', 'ae'];"
Covid infections have risen to unprecedented levels in recent weeks because of the Omicron variant.
But, as early evidence suggested it would, this variant is causing milder illness, for now at least.
A fall in the proportion of detected cases ending in hospital, shows this. It is now five times lower than it was a year ago.
This is largely thanks to a huge amount of immunity that has built up across the population either through vaccination or infection.
And with better treatments for those who do become ill, one way or another everyone is less at risk to some degree than they were previously.
But the sheer weight of infections means while Omicron is milder, patient numbers in hospital have been going up.
The total has doubled in just under a fortnight in England to more than 14,000. That, however, is still well under the 34,000 peak last winter when more than a third of beds were occupied by Covid patients. Rises are being seen elsewhere in the UK, although gaps in publishing data over the festive period make it hard to judge how quickly.
But to fully understand what's happening you need to look beyond the headline figures.
A hospital case this winter is not the same as one from earlier in the pandemic.
For one thing, a growing proportion of hospital patients with Covid are being treated for something else. They just happen to have the virus.
Latest data, from last week, suggested a third of those admitted to hospital in England were in this position. That's up from a quarter in the autumn. This data is not published in the UK's other nations but there is no reason to think it is any different.
Yet, as the chart above shows, the absolute number in hospital with Covid, and therefore severely ill, is still climbing. And even those who are not in primarily for Covid add pressure to the NHS because of the need for extra infection control measures.
Another sign of how Covid has changed is that the patients who are being treated for it are not getting as sick. 
There have been early reports that patients are not spending as long in hospital and the numbers needing critical care has hardly changed. All this puts the NHS in a stronger position to cope.
But make no mistake, the pressures on the front line are severe.
The number of people coming to hospital ill with Covid is well above what the NHS would normally get for all types of respiratory infections combined - and the numbers are rising.
How high they will go is still uncertain. Much depends on whether there will be a big wave of older, frail patients being admitted if Omicron infections move from younger people into older age groups.
There is growing confidence this may not happen though as hospital bosses are reporting even the outbreaks in care homes are not translating into the hospital admissions you would expect. What's more, London as a whole may have already peaked. The boosters, it seems, are holding up.
If you can't see the lookup, click here
But the situation is further complicated by the high number of staff absences driven by large numbers having to isolate. 
Again England has the most comprehensive data. Pre-pandemic NHS staff absence in winter was around 5%. The latest data shows it was 8% in the week up to Christmas. 
The combined pressures have led at least half a dozen NHS trusts to declare major incidents - when demand exceeds capacity - in the past week. 
All this begs the question why something more is not being done to suppress the wave in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have tougher restrictions in place.
The problem now - illustrated by modelling produced for the government by Warwick University - is the window may already have passed. The research suggests even a return to lockdown with only schools open would have virtually no effect on hospitalisations if introduced today.
To have had a significant impact measures would need to have been introduced by Boxing Day or earlier, before Omicron had spread so much. 
Even then the argument in favour of tougher action was unclear as infections and hospitalisations would rebound once restrictions were lifted. Largely all it would have achieved is delaying and spreading out illness.
That may have helped the NHS, but would have had to be balanced against wider costs of restrictions to society, the economy and mental health from another lockdown.
What does seem likely is the wave will come and go pretty quickly - even in other parts of the UK the restrictions in place are expected to only have a limited impact.
And once it does, experts believe the extra immunity acquired will mean the population will be even better protected for the future.

133;Apple becomes first firm to hit $3tn market value;2022-01-04T03:56:12.000Z;[];['stock markets', 'apple'];['apple', 'technology', 'worlds', 'firm', '3tn', 'valuation', 'market', 'took', 'tablets', 'stock', 'saw', 'hit', 'smartphones', 'value', 'rise', 'soar'];"
US technology giant Apple has become the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $3tn (£2.2tn).
The firm's share price has risen by around 5,800% since co-founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007.
However, its value slipped a little from that milestone, to end Monday's trading session in New York at $2.99tn.
Apple has been one of the big winners of the pandemic, as coronavirus lockdowns saw spending on gadgets jump.
""Hitting $3 trillion is another historical moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong,"" Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush said.
It took just over 16 months for Apple's stock market valuation to rise from $2tn to $3tn, as the world's biggest technology companies saw demand soar as people became more reliant on smartphones, tablets and laptops during lockdowns.
The company became the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $1tn in August 2018.
The iPhone typically accounts for around half of the company's sales, while it is also well-known for its iPad tablets and Mac computers.
Increasingly important parts of the business are software, sold through the Apple store, storage space via the iCloud and services such as its music, television and fitness subscription platforms.
""The linchpin to Apple's valuation re-rating remains its Services business which we believe is worth $1.5 trillion,"" Mr Ives said.
In August, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook received more than five million shares in the firm, as he marked ten years in the job.
A company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that he sold most of the shares for more than $750m.
It was part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs.
The award was dependent upon on how well Apple's shares had performed compared to other firms on the S&P 500 stock index.
Cupertino, California-based Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and his business partners Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.
The company made its stock market debut in 1980 with a market valuation of $1.8bn.
In November, the original Apple computer built by Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs fetched $400,000 at auction in the US.

134;China: Xi'an residents in lockdown trade goods for food amid shortage;2022-01-04T11:53:39.000Z;[];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'china'];['scale', 'undermine', 'took', 'unacceptable', 'food', 'xian', 'lockdown', 'spread', 'trade', 'shortage', 'residents', 'amid', 'virus', 'wedded', 'china', 'socially', 'goods', 'xi', 'ruling'];"
People quarantined in the Chinese city of Xi'an are bartering supplies amid continuing worries over food shortages.
Social posts show locals swapping cigarettes and tech gadgets for food. About 13 million have been confined to their homes since 23 December.
The strict measures come ahead of the Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics due to be held in Beijing next month.
Overnight, the city of Yuzhou was shut down after the discovery of just three cases, all of them asymptomatic.
Yuzhou, with a population of 1.1 million, has closed its transport system and entertainment venues and banned almost all vehicles from the roads. All but essential food shops are shut, with only workers involved in epidemic prevention allowed out. 
The outbreak in the much larger city to the west is the worst China has seen in months as it continues a ""zero Covid"" strategy, seeking to stamp out the virus rather than try to live with it.
Authorities in Xi'an have been providing free food to households, but there have been numerous complaints on social media. Some residents said their supplies were running low or that they had yet to receive aid.
Videos and photos on social media site Weibo showed people exchanging cigarettes for cabbage, dishwashing liquid for apples, and sanitary pads for a small pile of vegetables.
One video showed a resident appearing to trade his Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns. 
""People are swapping stuff with others in the same building, because they no longer have enough food to eat,"" a resident surnamed Wang told Radio Free Asia. The news outlet also reported that another man had wanted to trade a smartphone and tablet for rice.
""Helpless citizens have arrived at the era of bartering - potatoes are exchanged for cotton swabs,"" one Weibo user said, while another described it as a ""return to primitive society"". 
Some were more optimistic though, and commented on how ""touched"" they were by their neighbours' kindness in sharing their supplies with them. 
Xi'an is at the epicentre of China's current Covid outbreak, and local authorities have enacted drastic measures which have attracted significant criticism online.
In a recent incident, residents in the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound in the south of the city were reportedly told just after midnight on 1 January that they had to leave their homes and go to quarantine facilities. 
Netizens were also shocked by an unverified post that went viral on Monday. A Xi'an resident said their father had died after he suffered a heart attack and was turned away from a hospital due to the city's Covid situation. The hospital has yet to respond.
Covid first appeared in China and up until a few weeks ago the government had managed to contain it to such a level that new cases were negligible and mainly coming from people arriving from abroad. 
What Beijing calls its ""dynamic zero Covid"" strategy combines mass vaccination with a regime of constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps to prove you don't pose a threat. All of that amounts to hyper vigilance about any new outbreak - if and when one is spotted the reaction is severe. 
China has been wedded to this approach since the beginning because it's likely the leaders from Xi Jinping down consider anything less would cause illness and death on a scale that would be politically, economically and socially unacceptable. The ruling Communist Party took much of the credit for containing the virus early on - after it had spread beyond China's borders - and diverting from that would undermine its credibility. 
There is a broad acceptance of this approach, and the stringent restrictions it can bring, among many Chinese who for decades have not felt they can rely much on the public health system. So illness and the prospect of losing your job, let alone your life, are existentially daunting. 
Add to that the prestige attached to - safely - hosting another Olympic Games in a few weeks' time and the fast approaching Chinese New Year mass migration of millions across this country and there is clearly little doubt the government will remain committed to ""zero Covid"" for the foreseeable future.

135;Why BlackBerry held the tiny keys to my heart;2022-01-04T01:41:01.000Z;[];['blackberry', 'mobile phones'];['heart', 'pressing', 'qwerty', 'hard', 'held', 'short', 'wood', 'love', 'keyboard', 'keys', 'stream', 'tiny', 'plank', 'blackberry'];"
Many vintage BlackBerry phones will stop working on Tuesday as the company turns off support for its operating system. For journalist Bill Wilson, it means the retirement of a faithful workhorse. 
""Is that a Blackberry, I didn't know they were still going?"" has been many a conversation opener over the past decade, and particularly over the past five or six years.
From airport security to pubs and restaurants, even in hospital intensive care, strangers have looked on curiously and even asked to hold and look at my Q10 phone with its distinctive qwerty keyboard.
But my stock answer of ""yes they are still going"" would now have to add ""but not their classic phones"".
Launched in 2013, that particular model, and BlackBerry's phones since then, have faced an increasingly impossible battle as Apple and Samsung set about their battle for global smartphone domination.
Hard to believe that in the late 2000s and early 2010s, BlackBerrys were a ubiquitous sight on commuter trains, trams and planes across the UK - as business professionals scrolled through their emails and tap-tapped away their replies.
But now, after reports of the demise of BlackBerry's operating system on many previous occasions, it really is the final curtain.
For on 4 January, the Canadian firm - which is now a specialist in cyber-security software - is to turn off its BlackBerry OS support.
Announcing the termination, BlackBerry thanked ""our many loyal customers and partners over the years"".
It means remaining die-hard owners of their devices won't be able to make or receive calls, send texts, use wi-fi or access mobile data. 
That includes all smartphones running on BlackBerry 7.1 OS and earlier, the BlackBerry 10 operating system and the tablet-based BlackBerry PlayBook OS.
Phones such as my antique Q10 ‎will completely cease to function, though it may remain handy as a back-up for contact numbers.
The only glimmer of sustained life is that post-2016 Blackberry-branded phones, which were made under licence by Chinese firm TCL, will still work as they use the Android operating system.
Over the years it's not just Blackberry phone user numbers that have dwindled, but support and functions have dropped away one by one.
Support for many apps, including BBC iPlayer and WhatsApp, was withdrawn from BlackBerry OS devices, and not long ago YouTube stopped working too.
Somehow or other I was able to circuitously get the latter two to work again by downloading links from far corners of the planet.
Apps have become a non-existent element for users of BlackBerry devices.
For example, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 I found myself unable to download the various NHS apps, and had to sign in to places manually.
So, why go to all this trouble?
In short, it is still great for emails, with five or six different addresses all in one stream. I also love the qwerty keyboard with keys that depress and are not like pressing a hard plank of wood.
As phones have become progressively bigger, the BlackBerry still fits beautifully, and fairly lightly, in the hand.
It's a feeling with which Ben Wood, an industry analyst for CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum, agrees.
""The dedicated qwerty keyboard was an iconic design,"" he says. ""The devices became so comfortable in people's hands that they developed muscle memory delivering fast and accurate text input.""
Mr Wood says: ""It always makes me smile when I show kids some of the mobile phones of yesterday.
""They are enthralled by the design diversity. I even had a 14 year-old ask me the other day 'why don't they bring keyboards back?' which made me smile."" 
It is almost exactly 23 years since BlackBerry launched its 850 phone, and the company soon became the leader in providing emails when out and about on the move.
There was also the attraction of BBM - BlackBerry's Instant Messenger service - although this facility attracted unwanted publicity during the riots that swept through many UK cities in 2011.
There were outraged cries of protest that the police could not monitor the encrypted nature of BBM messages to find out where looters would strike next.
But the models that followed the iconic BlackBerry Bold would face increasing competition from Apple and Android phones.
So what happens next?
In 2020, TCL's licence ended and was picked up by a firm called Onward Mobility. It promised a 5G BlackBerry running Android for 2021, but nothing emerged. 
For now I shall try my luck with a second-hand Android Blackberry KeyOne - itself five years old now - (from Canadian eBay this time), and bought long ago in preparation for just this such day.
And I shall also hold on to my useless Q10 - you never know when in the future someone may ask...""is that an antique BlackBerry?""

136;China: Evergrande shares rise as Hong Kong trade resumes;2022-01-04T06:15:05.000Z;[];['china', 'stock markets'];['close', 'hong', 'lost', 'kong', 'weight', 'trade', 'shares', 'debts', 'evergrande', 'china', 'value', 'fret', 'collapsing', 'investors', 'rise', 'resumes', 'evergandes'];"
Shares in crisis-hit Chinese property developer Evergrande rose on Tuesday afternoon as they resumed trading in Hong Kong.
The heavily-indebted firm suspended its shares on Monday pending the release of ""inside information"".
It comes after Evergrande said its sales for 2021 plunged 39% from the year before to $69.5bn (£51.6bn).
The company also confirmed it had been ordered to demolish 39 buildings on the island of Hainan.
The firm said the buildings affected by the demolition order are at its Ocean Flower Island project, and added the decision does not involve other plots of land in the project.
""The company will actively communicate with the authority in accordance with the guidance of the decision letter and resolve the issue properly,"" Evergrande said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The announcement also addressed concerns about the firm's financial position: ""With regard to the company's current liquidity situation, the company will continue to actively maintain communication with creditors, strive to resolve risks and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all parties.""
Evergrande has more than $300bn of debt and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
Last week, the company did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds.
Its $19bn in international bonds were deemed to be in default by rating agencies after it missed a payment deadline last month.
The company has also dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products.
Evergande's shares have lost almost 90% of their value in the last year as investors fret that it may be close to collapsing under the weight of of its debts.

137;Train services hit by Covid staff absences;2022-01-04T11:17:13.000Z;[];['scotrail', 'rail travel', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'learnt', 'end', 'train', 'foolish', 'predict', 'hit', 'lessons', 'offer', 'future', 'month', 'timetable', 'services', 'absences', 'staff'];"
Rail passengers are facing cancellations or fewer services as train companies face high levels of staff absences due to Covid.
The Rail Delivery Group said almost one in 10 rail workers were off.
Train companies including ScotRail, CrossCountry and LNER have announced reduced timetables and passengers have been warned of cancellations.
Alex Hynes, boss of ScotRail, said the company had ""hundreds"" of staff off work due to having Covid or isolating.
He told the BBC's Today programme the company usually operates 2,000 services a day, but it would be reducing this by 160 (8%) from Tuesday.
""Over the last few weeks because of record numbers of Covid cases we have been cancelling too many trains so we have decided to proactively put this revised timetable in to give our customers greater certainty on the service we can offer,"" he said.
Mr Hynes said the operator was ""pretty confident"" the reduced timetable would ""prove to be a robust service for customers in the coming weeks"".
""We have said we will offer this timetable until the end of the month but of course one of the lessons we have learnt from Covid is that we would be foolish to predict the future,"" he added.
""There will be a few twists and turn in this Covid tale until it's over.""
Rising Covid case numbers have led to large numbers of people self-isolating and being unable to go to work, which has acutely affected industries where staff are unable to work from home.
Rail operator CrossCountry said its staff absences were ""worsening each day"", with more than one in 10 staff now absent.
Meanwhile, South Western Railway said its services would be ""subject to short notice cancellations"" ahead of the company introducing a ""consolidated timetable"" from 17 January.
LNER has announced it has cancelled 16 trains for this week, but warned passengers there could be ""other non-planned changes"" to the timetable. 
On Monday, there were widespread cancellations across Britain's train services with the Rail Delivery Group estimating that more than 6,000 staff, including crews and drivers, were currently absent.
The industry body said there would be ""some short-notice cancellations so our advice to anyone travelling is to check online before they set out or to sign up for automatic alerts from National Rail Alert Me"".
""We are working hard to provide the most reliable service possible and so that passengers can travel with confidence when fewer rail staff can work, a number of operators are introducing amended timetables,"" it added.
The website of Transport for Wales showed 49 train journeys were cancelled on Monday, while TransPennine Express cancelled 37 and Avanti West Coast cancelled 25.
Southern has said it is not putting on any direct services to London Victoria - a major commuter station - until next Monday.
Rail Minister Wendy Morton said she would ""continue to monitor the situation closely"".
The government has warned rising cases could see up to a quarter of staff off work and ministers have been tasked with developing ""robust contingency plans"" to deal with workplace absences.
Public sector leaders have been asked to prepare for ""worst case scenarios"" of 10%, 20% and 25% absence rates, the Cabinet Office said.
The transport sector is not the only area affected by staff absences, with worker shortages also hitting retailers and hospitality firms.

138;Covid: US reports record 1m cases with peak still to come;2022-01-04T16:27:30.000Z;[];['united states', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'peak', 'reports', 'im', 'number', 'vaccinated', 'come', '1m', 'millions', 'mildly', 'record', 'symptomatic', 'severe', 'cases', 'going', 'tens', 'told'];"
The US has recorded more than one million new Covid cases, as officials warn the peak of a fast-spreading Omicron surge is still to come.
A record 1,080,211 cases were reported on Monday - the highest one-day tally of new cases anywhere in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The Omicron variant accounts for the majority of cases in the US.
The top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci has said the country is facing ""almost a vertical increase"" in cases.
He said the peak may be weeks away.
While rates of death and hospital admissions in the US have been far lower in recent weeks than in previous infection spikes, the number of hospital admissions has been steadily rising. 
But Dr Fauci said the example of South Africa - where Omicron first spread rapidly before subsiding - offered some hope.
Omicron has also led to school districts across the country postponing the return of students to classrooms following the winter break due to the rapid spread of the variant and subsequent staffing shortages. There are also concerns over challenges in securing rapid tests for students and teachers.
In Detroit, Michigan, for example - which is experiencing an all-time high infection rate of 36% - city school officials announced that schools will remain closed through Wednesday. 
A number of other major school systems, including Atlanta, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Newark, have announced postponements or a return to virtual classes. 
In New York City, the largest school district in the US, schools remained open. On Monday, Mayor Eric Adams said that school is ""the safest place or our children"". 
The New York Times reported, however, that approximately one third of parents kept their children at home over Covid-19 fears. 
In terms of hospital admissions, data from the US Department of Health and Human Services shows that more than 103,000 people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 - the first time the tally has crossed the six-figure mark since September. 
State health officials have reported that the vast majority of Covid hospital admissions are among the unvaccinated. In Illinois, for example, officials over the weekend said that nearly 85% of patients with Covid-19 or related diseases are unvaccinated. 
""I'm still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,"" Dr Fauci told ABC on Monday.
Officials have also said that the number of children in hospital is rising. 
Some 8,652 people are reported to have died from the disease in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins.
The previous US record of cases was 590,000, reported four days ago.
The highest number outside the US came during India's Delta surge, when more than 414,188 people were confirmed as having the disease in May 2021.
Studies suggest that Omicron is milder than the previously dominant Delta variant, but fears remain that the sheer number of cases stemming from the highly infectious Omicron could overwhelm hospitals.

140;Brexit: Did the EU ban crown marks on pint glasses?;2022-01-05T11:40:25.000Z;[];['boris johnson', 'reality check', 'brexit', 'beer'];['world', 'gone', 'eu', 'ban', 'brexit', 'state', 'crown', 'trade', 'overall', 'pint', 'rest', 'power', 'marks', 'glasses', 'member', 'uk'];"
To mark the first anniversary of the trade deal between the UK and the EU, Downing Street issued a press release about how prime minister Boris Johnson plans to ""maximise the benefits of Brexit"".
It gave examples of ""key successes"" so far: 
The crown stamp had been used on pint glasses for more than 300 years to show they are large enough to hold a full pint. 
An EU directive, which took effect in 2006, required the use of an EU-wide ""CE"" mark which stands for Conformité Européenne -  French for ""European Conformity"". 
CE appears on many other products, from toys to medical devices, and it shows that they meet the EU's safety, health and environmental rules and can move freely across its countries with no additional checks.
But the European Commission has rejected the idea that EU rules stopped the UK from having the crown stamp on glasses as well.
A spokesperson told us: ""EU law does not prevent markings from being placed on products, so long as it does not overlap or be confused with the CE mark.""
Following Brexit, goods will now have to use the UKCA marking - ""UK Conformity Assessed"". However, to allow businesses time to adjust, products with the CE mark can still be sold and used in Great Britain until 1 January 2023. 
Former Brexit minister Lord Frost said in September 2021 that the government ""will permit the voluntary printing of the crown stamp on pint glasses"". 
A 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - the so-called ""Tampon Tax"" - was scrapped by the government from 1 January 2021. 
EU laws require member states to tax tampons and sanitary towels at a minimum rate of 5%.
But the EU is in the process of abolishing the tax. 
The Republic of Ireland - an EU member - already had 0% VAT on sanitary products, because this rate was in place before the EU legislation imposed the 5% minimum rate.
As we've pointed out before, the majority of these involve taking the deal that the EU has with those countries and replicating the terms for the UK.  The government has been successful at doing these ""rollover deals"" in a relatively short space of time.
With a few of the countries the terms have been slightly different to the EU's, such as Japan, Norway and Iceland.
And a deal has been signed with Australia and agreed in principle with New Zealand, which are not the same as the EU deals with them.
How do you get to a total value of £760bn? 
Add up the value of imports and exports with countries that also have deals with the EU, which you'll find on this table. Add Australia and New Zealand and you get to just over £200bn. 
The rest comes from trade with EU countries, which are covered by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
But there is less trade with the EU now than there was when the UK was a member state. So, overall UK trade with the rest of the world has actually gone down since the government came to power. 
While Covid will clearly have been a factor, the UK did about £220bn less global trade in 2020 - about 18% down on its 2019 figure.
And to say that the deals are ""worth over £760bn"" assumes that without them there would be no trade done at all, which is not the case. 
This was delivered by ""avoiding cumbersome EU bureaucracy"", according to the press release. 
The UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators.
But - as the head of the UK medicines regulator pointed out at the time - the UK's approval was permitted under EU law.
The vaccine rollout started in the UK on 8 December 2020 - weeks before the EU.  
And initially, the pace of vaccination in the UK was faster than in the EU - which ran into problems with its rollout early on.  
However, EU countries have since caught up. 
Currently, 13 EU countries, as well as Norway and Iceland, have a higher proportion of their populations fully vaccinated - according to figures from Our World in Data, which looked at those who have received all doses prescribed by the initial vaccination protocol.
However, according to the latest data, the UK has given more booster doses of the vaccine to its population than any other country in Europe, with 50%. 
In Germany and France, the booster jab has been given to 39% and 33% of the population respectively.

Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, whose work included Dallas Buyers Club and Wild has died aged 58.
The Oscar-nominated director also won an Emmy award for his work on the HBO series Big Little Lies.
He died over the weekend in Quebec City, his long-time producing partner Nathan Ross confirmed in a statement provided to The Hollywood Reporter, though no cause of death was given.
Ross said Vallée ""stood for creativity"" and ""authenticity"".
""He was a true artist and a generous, loving guy,"" he wrote. ""Everyone who worked with him couldn't help but see the talent and vision he possessed.
""He was a friend, creative partner and an older brother to me. The maestro will sorely be missed but it comforts knowing his beautiful style and impactful work he shared with the world will live on.""
US actress Reece Witherspoon, who starred in both Wild and Big Little Lies, tweeted on Monday: ""My heart is broken. My friend, I love you.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote that Vallée's ""passion for filmmaking and storytelling was unmatched - so too was his talent.
""Through his work and with his art, he left a mark in Quebec, across Canada, and around the world.""
Montreal-born Vallée began his career making music videos before moving into film in 1995, with his debut thriller Black List, and then the critically-lauded 2005 coming-of-age movie C.R.A.Z.Y.
His 2009 feature, The Young Victoria, starring British actress Emily Blunt as Britain's Queen Victoria, picked up three Oscar nominations.
But perhaps his best-known work arrived in 2013, with Dallas Buyers Club - the emotional story of Ron Woodroof, who sold experimental drugs to fellow Aids patients in Texas.
Stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto both put in Oscar-winning performances in the movie, which was nominated for six Academy Awards, including best picture and best original screenplay.
The next year, Vallée directed Reese Witherspoon in Wild, a film based on the bestselling memoir about of a former heroin addict who tries to re-discover herself by backpacking and hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.
He worked with her again on HBO's Big Little Lies, which saw him win the Emmy for best directing on a limited series, movie or special.
The Emmy and Golden Globe-winning show, a screen adaptation of Liane Moriarty's top novel, featured Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Nicole Kidman, Zoë Kravitz and Shailene Woodley as five California-based women who become embroiled in a murder investigation.
Paying her respects on Monday, Dern posted: ""The world has lost one of our great and purest artists and dreamers. And we lost our beloved friend.""
Vallée went on to direct Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson in another HBO series, Sharp Objects, which he was also an executive producer on.
HBO commented that he was ""a brilliant, fiercely dedicated filmmaker, a truly phenomenal talent who infused every scene with a deeply visceral, emotional truth"".
""He was also a hugely caring man who invested his whole self alongside every actor he directed,"" the network added in a statement.
""We are shocked at the news of his sudden death, and we extend our heartfelt sympathies to his sons, Alex and Émile, his extended family, and his long-time producing partner, Nathan Ross.""
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in 2016, Vallée revealed what he enjoyed most about making movies and TV shows. ""The dream,"" he said. ""Dreams can come true. I'm living the dream right now.""
Cameron Bailey, CEO of the Toronto International Film Festival, paid tribute by describing the director as ""a prodigious talent"".
He is survived by two children.

At least 13 people have been killed and several more have been injured after a fire broke out in an apartment building in the US city of Philadelphia.
At least seven children are among the dead, an official from the Philadelphia Fire Department told reporters. 
The blaze began at around 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) in a public housing block in the north of the city. 
Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy told reporters it was one of the worst fires he had ever seen. 
""We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain,"" he said on Wednesday.
He added that eight other residents had managed to escape the building.
It is believed there were 26 people in the three-storey block at the time of the fire.
The building is owned by the government funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, and it has been legally divided into two apartments since the 1950s. 
Officials said that at the last inspection of the building in 2020 there had been four working smoke detectors, but none of them went off during the fire.
Mr Murphy told reporters that while authorities do not currently consider the cause of the fire to be suspicious, there will still be a thorough investigation due to the loss of life.
Speaking during the press conference, the city's Mayor Jim Kenney said: ""This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way.""
""Losing so many kids is just devastating,"" he added.

145;Labour calls again for 5% VAT cut on energy bills;2022-01-05T16:22:41.000Z;[];"['angela rayner', 'boris johnson', 'energy service companies', ""prime minister's questions"", 'oil & gas industry']";['absolutely', 'eu', 'calls', 'single', 'market', 'impossible', 'remain', 'everybody', 'knows', 'vat', 'energy', 'cut', 'labour', 'bills', 'aligned'];"
Labour has again called for the 5% VAT rate on energy bills to be scrapped, demanding ""serious solutions"" for the rising cost of living.
Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said working families were ""picking up the tab"" for Boris Johnson's ""incompetence"" over the issue. 
But the PM insisted the government was providing a number of schemes to help.
A spike in wholesale gas prices has led to soaring energy bills in the UK.
A total of 27 energy companies have also gone bust as the energy price cap - limiting how much consumers can be charged - saw some businesses forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for.
But there are fears an expected rise in the cap, due in April, could see households hit with even higher bills. 
Labour has been calling for the government to slash the 5% VAT rate on energy bills to zero since October, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves calling it a ""simple"" and ""immediate"" measure to help people deal with costs over the winter. 
A group of 20 Conservative MPs and peers - including five ex-ministers - joined the call last week, writing to Mr Johnson to urge him to cut VAT, as well as going further by suspending environmental levies which fund renewable energy schemes.
Backers of the plan said VAT receipts had come in more than £3bn higher than forecast because of rising prices, giving the government extra funds to cover the cost.
But a Treasury source has told the BBC that rising bills overall mean consumers are spending less elsewhere on products with higher VAT, so the overall income to the government has remained flat.
Standing in for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who has tested positive for Covid - Ms Rayner said ""working people across the country are facing rising bills and ballooning prices"", due to a mixture of inflation, rising energy costs and an incoming tax rise to pay for the NHS and social care. 
She added: ""The prime minister pretends it is not his fault. He blames the global forces, he blames the market. 
""But the prime minister has made political choices that have led us into this place.""
The deputy leader claimed the government had ""failed to invest in long term energy security"" and ""let the energy market run out of control"", adding: ""Can't the prime minister see what is happening?
""Yet again working families are picking up tab for his incompetence.""
But Mr Johnson said a number of government initiatives - including the warm homes discount, winter fuel payments and cold weather payments - were supporting people, especially those on low incomes. 
He also accused Labour of ""bare-faced cheek"" for calling for the VAT cut, as the party campaigned to stay in the EU - when it would not have been an option. 
""Everybody knows full well it would be absolutely impossible if they were to do what Labour would do and go back into the EU [and] remain aligned with the EU single market,"" said the PM.
""That is the objective of the Labour Party. They can't be trusted on Brexit and they can't be trusted with the economy.""

150;James Webb Space Telescope: Sun shield is fully deployed;2022-01-05T07:59:38.000Z;[];['astronomy', 'nasa', 'european space agency', 'the universe', 'james webb space telescope', 'hubble telescope', 'space exploration'];['deployed', 'james', 'swamp', 'trying', 'targets', 'space', 'fully', 'wavelength', 'webbs', 'telescope', 'webb', 'temperatures', 'universe', 'shield', 'infrared'];"
The new James Webb telescope has passed a major milestone in its quest to image the first stars to shine in the cosmos. 
Controllers on Tuesday completed the deployment of the space observatory's giant kite-shaped sun shield.
Only with this tennis court-sized barrier will Webb have the sensitivity to detect the signals coming from the most distant objects in the Universe.
Commissioning work will now concentrate on unpacking the telescope's mirrors, the largest of which is 6.5m wide.
This video can not be played
The deployment of the five-membrane sun shield is a triumph for the engineering teams at the US space agency (Nasa) and the American aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman.
There were many who doubted the wisdom of a design that included so many motors, gears, pulleys and cables. 
But years of testing on full-scale and sub-scale models paid dividends as controllers first separated the shield's different layers and then tensioned them.
The fifth and final membrane - which like the other four had the thickness of a human hair - was locked into place at 16:58 GMT.
""Unfolding Webb's sun shield in space is an incredible milestone, crucial to the success of the mission,"" said Greg Robinson, Webb's program director at Nasa Headquarters. 
""Thousands of parts had to work with precision for this marvel of engineering to fully unfurl. The team has accomplished an audacious feat with the complexity of this deployment - one of the boldest undertakings yet for Webb.""
It's worth noting that all the previous testing was done on Earth, under gravity conditions. This was the first time the shield had been unfurled in the unique ""Zero-G"" environment of space. ""The first time, and we nailed it,"" enthused Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.
""There was a lot of joy, a lot of relief,"" added Hillary Stock, the sunshield deployments lead at Northrop.
James Webb was launched on 25 December on an Ariane rocket from French Guiana.
The telescope is regarded as the successor to the Hubble space observatory which is now 31 years old and nearing the end of its operational life.
Webb will do similar science to Hubble but with the next-generation technologies that allow it to see deeper into the cosmos and, therefore, further back in time.
The expectation is that it will even catch the light from the pioneer stars that were first to ignite shortly after the Big Bang more than 13.5 billion years ago.
Critical to the whole endeavour, however, will be Webb's sensitivity in the infrared. The light coming to the telescope from its targets at the edge of the observable Universe will arrive in this longer wavelength domain. And that means Webb must be cooled to fantastically cold temperatures or its own infrared glow will swamp the signals it's trying to detect. 
Hence the shield. The shade it casts will lower the environment around Webb's mirrors and instruments to below minus 230C.
The controllers, who are based at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, now have Webb's golden mirrors in their sights.
Like the sun shield, the telescope's two principal reflectors had to be folded to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane.
Wednesday should see the 74cm-wide secondary mirror extended on 8m-long booms in front of the primary mirror. 
The main mirror has ""wings"" that were tucked back for launch but which must now be rotated through 90 degrees to make a full, 6.5m-wide surface. Assuming things continue to run like clockwork, this should happen at the end of the week.
Webb is currently moving out to a position 1.5 million km from Earth on the planet's ""midnight"" side. It's from this location that it will study the Universe. 
James Webb is a joint venture between the American, European and Canadian space agencies.

153;China: Is it burdening poor countries with unsustainable debt?;2022-01-06T01:17:22.000Z;[];['china', 'reality check'];['world', 'sri', 'loan', 'chinas', 'debt', 'unsustainable', 'loans', 'china', 'burdening', 'poor', 'countries', 'chinese', 'lending'];"
China has faced criticism for its lending practices to poorer countries, accused of leaving them struggling to repay debts and therefore vulnerable to pressure from Beijing.
But that is rejected by China, which accuses some in the West of promoting this narrative to tarnish its image.
It says: ""There is not a single country that has fallen into [a] so-called 'debt trap' as a result of borrowing from China.""
China is one of the world's largest single creditor nations. 
Its loans to lower and middle-income countries have tripled over the past decade, reaching $170bn (£125bn) by the end of 2020. 
However, China's overall lending commitments are likely to be significantly greater than these figures suggest.
Research by AidData, an international development body at William & Mary University in the US, finds that half of China's lending to developing countries is not reported in official debt statistics.
It is often kept off government balance sheets, directed to state-owned companies and banks, joint ventures or private institutions, rather than directly from government to government.  
There are now more than 40 low and middle-income countries, according to AidData, whose debt exposure to Chinese lenders is more than 10% of the size of their annual economic output (GDP) as a result of this ""hidden debt"".
Djibouti, Laos, Zambia and Kyrgyzstan have debts to China equivalent to at least 20% of their annual GDP. 
Much of the debt owed to China relates to large infrastructure projects like roads, railways and ports, and also to the mining and energy industry, under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.  
In an interview with the BBC, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency MI6, said China uses what he called ""debt traps"" to gain leverage over other countries. 
The claim is that China lends money to other countries, which end up having to cede control of key assets if they can't meet their debt repayments - an accusation that's been long denied by Beijing.
One example often cited by critics of China is Sri Lanka, which years ago embarked on a massive port project in Hambantota with Chinese investment. 
But the billion dollar project using loans and contractors from China became mired in controversy, and struggled to prove viable,  leaving Sri Lanka saddled with growing debts.
Finally, in 2017, Sri Lanka agreed to give state-owned China Merchants a controlling 70% stake in the port on a 99-year lease in return for further Chinese investment. 
Analysis of the port project by UK-based think tank Chatham House has questioned whether the ""debt trap"" narrative strictly applies, given that the deal was driven by local political motivations, and that China never took formal ownership of the port.
It points out that a large proportion of Sri Lanka's overall debt was owed to non-Chinese lenders, and that there's no that evidence China has taken advantage of its position to gain strategic military advantage from the port.
Despite that, there's little doubt China's economic involvement in Sri Lanka has grown in the past decade, and concerns persist that this could be used to advance its political ambitions in the region.
There are other parts of the world where Chinese lending has also proved controversial, with contracts whose terms could give China leverage over important assets.
But there are no cases, among the hundreds of loan arrangements studied by AidData and some other researchers, of Chinese state-owned lenders actually seizing a major asset in the event of a loan default.
China does not publish records of its foreign loans, and the majority of its contracts contain non-disclosure clauses which prevent borrowers from revealing their contents. 
It argues that such confidentiality is common practice for international loan contracts.
""Confidentiality agreements are very common in international commercial loans"", says Professor Lee Jones at Queen Mary University of London. 
""And much of China's development financing is fundamentally a commercial operation.""
Most of the major industrialised nations share information about their lending activities through membership of what's known as the Paris Club.  
China has chosen not to join this grouping, but using available World Bank data, the rapid growth in China's reported lending compared to others can be clearly observed.
China tends to lend at higher rates of interest than western governments.
At around 4%, these loans are close to commercial market rates and about four times that of a typical loan from the World Bank or an individual country such as France or Germany.
The required repayment period for a Chinese loan is also generally shorter - less than 10 years, compared to around 28 years for other lenders' concessional loans to developing countries.
Chinese state-owned lenders also typically require borrowers to maintain a minimum cash balance in an offshore account to which the lender has access. 
""If a borrower fails to repay its debt,"" says Brad Parks, Executive Director of AidData, ""China can simply debit funds from [this] account without having to collect on bad debt through a judicial process.""
This approach is rarely seen in loans issued by western lenders.
There's currently an initiative by G20 nations - those countries which have the largest and fastest-growing economies - to offer debt relief for poorer countries to help them deal with the impact of the pandemic. 
China has joined this and says it has contributed ""the highest amount of debt repayment"" of any country taking part in the plan.
The World Bank says that since May 2020, a total of more than $10.3bn has been delivered in debt relief by G20 countries under this scheme.
But when we asked the World Bank for a breakdown by country, it said it could not share the information.

156;Census 1921 - 100-year-old secrets revealed;2022-01-06T06:00:53.000Z;[];['history'];['likely', 'given', 'season', 'revealed', 'social', 'lady', '1921', 'homes', 'large', 'probably', 'census', '100yearold', 'secrets', 'london', 'staff'];"
A unique snapshot of life one midsummer night - just over 100 years ago - reveals, among other things, life in the real Downton Abbey, how slum families pleaded for better homes, and why a man from Yorkshire wasn't able to divorce his wife.
Pages from the 1921 Census - made available for the first time - reveal glimpses of some of the lives of the 38 million people living in England and Wales on the evening of 19 June that year. At the time, the country was recovering from the shocks of World War One and the Spanish flu pandemic.
The future crime writer Dorothy L Sayers was living in central London and working from home in June 1921, when the census was carried out. She was a boarder in the Bloomsbury home of Elinor James, an Irishwoman of 57 who - like her five female tenants - was single. 
Almost all boarding-house keepers were women in 1921, the census shows. 
Elinor James's house, in Mecklenburgh Square, had eight rooms - generous compared with many other homes. Her lodgers were aged between 25 and 32 - among the 1.7 million so-called ""surplus women"" who supposedly found it hard to find a husband. So many men of their age had been killed in World War One. 
Many of those young women entered the workplace instead. The census shows more were working in professions. Most were teachers and nurses, but more were training to become lawyers, architects and doctors.
At Mecklenburgh Square, all five boarders worked. 
Dorothy L Sayers had studied modern languages at Oxford and described herself on the form as a translator. Her first detective novel ""Whose Body?"" would be published two years later, introducing the amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey.
The youngest tenant, Kitty Wood, worked as a solicitor's clerk in Lincoln's Inn. The eldest, Edith - whose surname is hard to make out - was a librarian at the Daily News. 
Ursula Murphy, from Dublin, worked as a temporary civil servant in the Foreign Office. Alice Saxty - from Queensland, Australia - described herself, apparently with some pride, as a ""craft worker"" who made dresses for ""Dora McLaren artist"". Dora McLaren had designed posters for the London Underground, and in the 1920s illustrated a comic strip for the Daily Herald newspaper.
For the first time, the 1921 Census allowed respondents to identify themselves as being divorced. Just 16,000 people did so. 
It would be another 50 years before a marriage could end with neither party at ""fault"" and so the shame of getting a divorce - plus the cost of legal proceedings - meant formal separation from a partner was not an option.
In 1921, there were many single mothers - but relatively few from divorce. Almost all were as a result of World War One. The number of widows rose sharply - from 642,311 in 1911 to more than 1.6m at the start of the 1920s.
Yorkshireman William Ambler, a Bradford factory worker, wrote on his form that he was married - but hadn't lived with his wife for 20 years. He explained how she had been unfaithful to him and had given birth to a daughter.  
Mr Ambler said he could not afford to divorce his wife, although she had successfully applied to the court for maintenance which he had to pay. 
""Is it not high time there was [sic] divorce laws to dissolve such unions,"" he wrote. 
""Have I to serve life-long misery, for her infidelity?"" he asked.
Edith White, a housekeeper from West Yorkshire, living with her grown-up son and daughter, scrawled ""We favour divorce law reform"" across her form. 
But for others, ending a marriage was just plain wrong. Henry Forrest of Stretford Road in Manchester stated his objection to even asking a divorce question on the census form. 
Divorce was a ""CURSE to the country"" wrote the school teacher - who was 42, unmarried, and living with his five younger sisters and brother.
On the evening of the census, the Earl of Carnarvon was at home in Highclere Castle - familiar today to millions as the fictional Downton Abbey. 
Joining him upstairs was his wife, their 19-year-old daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert, the archaeologist Howard Carter and a female visitor. 
Downstairs that evening were four members of staff. 
Cook Minnie Lynch, 42, was originally from Killarney in Ireland.  Ivy Cestell, 20, from County Cork, and Isabelle Fowler Reed, 18, from Aberdeen, were both kitchen maids. Thirty-year-old Louise Villepinte, from France, was a ladies' maid. Only Ivy was married - the others listed themselves as single.
Highclere is a grand stately home with 35 principal bedrooms and - just like in ITV's Downton Abbey - employed many servants. The 1911 census recorded 18 resident staff including 10 maids. So why were there so few in 1921? 
The most likely explanation - according to the current Lady Carnarvon - is that it was the London ""season"" and many aristocrats from large country homes would have been enjoying social events in and around the capital. Some of the staff were probably there too - while others might have been given time off.
Lady Carnarvon says the then Earl, his wife and daughter, could have made a special trip back to Highclere from London to meet Howard Carter. The Earl funded the archaeologist's journeys to Egypt in winter, and In late 1922, they would discover Tutankhamun's tomb.
There were 1,712 Jamaican-born people living in England and Wales in 1921 - according to the census.
Dr Harold Moody was one of the most prominent. He had finished at the top of his class studying medicine at King's College London.
His census return shows him living on King's Road (now King's Grove) in Peckham, south-east London, in a 10-room house. He was then 38 - and his wife, Olive, who'd been born in Henley, was 32. The couple had five young children.
Also living with them was a ""general domestic"" servant - a 17-year-old girl called Frances Hinds, who had been born in Hampstead.
Moody described himself as a ""medical practitioner"" working from home. He had set up his own practice in 1913 after struggling to find employment.
In 1931, he established the League of Coloured Peoples to campaign for black rights in the UK.  
James Bartley was 33 in the summer of 1921. He worked as a gas fitter and lived in Montgomery Street in Hove, Sussex, with his wife May and three children under five.
Two-bedroom houses in that road now sell for about half a million pounds - but 100 years ago, the Bartley family lived in one room.
""Stop talking about your homes for heroes,"" wrote Mr Bartley at the bottom of his form. ""Start building some houses and let them at a rent a working man can afford to pay.""
""Homes Fit for Heroes"" had been the promise made by Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, two years before at the end of the Great War. He had pledged to build half a million new homes for returning veterans.
Across the country, most tenants lived in privately-rented housing, often in squalid conditions.
Mr Bartley would most likely have fought in the war himself - but while the National Archives holds medal cards for several James Bartleys, none are from local Sussex Regiments and no dates of birth are listed.
At least Bartley was employed - he worked for the Brighton Gas Company. Two hundred miles away near Liverpool, ""master tailor"" Robert Stevens - a father of 13 - stated he was ""out of work"".
Mr Stevens, 44, and his wife Agnes - who according to their form was busy with ""Home Duties"" - lived with their children in five rooms on Park Street, Wallasey.
Ivy, 21, and Gerty, 19, were both milliners. The eldest boy, 18-year-old Robert, worked at St Paul's Mills in Birkenhead. Florrie,16, and Bella, 14, helped their mother at home. Five younger children were at school, and the youngest three were at home. 
Robert Stevens wrote simply: ""Can you help us times are hard.""
There was no category for disability on the census forms, but some householders chose to note their own conditions anyway - including former soldiers still struggling three years after their return from war.
Harold Samuel Orpen of St Mary's Mansions, in Paddington central London, was nearly 47 and a retired regular Army officer. He lived in six rooms with his wife Joan and a 20-year-old servant, Florence Wiles, originally from Norfolk. 
Orpen's form is noticeable for its lack of fountain-pen ink. Instead, he used a typewriter to fill it out and felt obliged to explain: ""I lost half my right hand in the late war and cannot write properly.""
Other former service personnel added handwritten notes. One simply wrote: ""Ruined by War doing odd work"" in the section for occupation. 
The forms were hand-delivered to eight and a half million households by 38,000 census staff. They then had to return to collect them. The enumerators - as they were called - told newspapers at the time it was a ""wearying job"". One complained that children had used the forms to play noughts and crosses.
""You walk from house to house trying to look pleasant and important, and doing your best to make believe you're loving the job, while all the time you feel you would welcome the Earth to open and swallow you up,"" said another.
Nevertheless, a century on, their determined efforts are being revealed in a unique and valuable resource. It's accessible online - either for free by visiting the National Archives in Kew, west London - or through the Findmypast website for a fee.

158;Caviar sales soar as more people get a taste for posh fish eggs;2022-01-06T00:04:16.000Z;[];['fish', 'fish farming'];['15', 'roll', 'company', 'fish', 'hot', 'eggs', 'public', 'sales', 'mr', 'taste', 'posh', 'caviar', 'fernandez', 'going', 'soar', 'sector', 'farms'];"
When high-end restaurants around the globe had to close their doors during the Covid lockdowns, things didn't look good for the world's caviar producers.
Add glitzy events being cancelled, and cruise liners not being able to leave port, and you might think that it spelled disaster for the sellers of wincingly expensive fish eggs.
But the reality has been very different. Online sales are booming as the well-heeled increasingly eat their caviar at home.
""I think people in lockdown wanted to enjoy themselves, and everybody decided to spend money on caviar, either at home, or in restaurants [when they were able to open again],"" says Carla Sora, general manager of Italy's Agroittica Lombarda, Europe's largest caviar farm.
But what exactly is caviar? It is the salt-cured eggs of numerous species of the sturgeon fish. Long considered a delicacy, the industry was historically centred on wild stocks in the Caspian Sea, which is today surrounded by Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan.
But by 2006, severe overfishing in the Caspian led to a ban on the global sale of almost all wild caviar from the sea. This is still enforced by the Switzerland-based Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
The ban led to a big growth in the farming of sturgeon around the world specifically for the production of caviar. As a result, almost all of the caviar sold legally worldwide is now from farmed stocks - sturgeon reared in man-made lakes and ponds.
This global farmed sturgeon industry was worth €750m ($848m; £640m) in 2019, according to the most recent figures from Norwegian firm Kontali, which monitors the worldwide fish farm sector. Meanwhile, the European Union estimated that global caviar volumes reached 380 tonnes in 2018, its most up to date figures.
Ms Sora says that sales at Agroittica Lombarda soared last year, especially in the US, where they doubled.
Meanwhile, US firm Sterling Caviar, owner of four farms in California, and the largest caviar producer in the country, said its sales were up 10% in 2021. In the UK, the sole sturgeon farmer, Exmoor Caviar, sold out of all of its then stock at the end of 2020.
Kontali analyst, Maren Boe, says that online sales have ""been the saving grace"" for producers since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.
""By selling smaller tins of caviar, both in shops and online, producers have been able to sell to consumers looking to increase everyday luxury by buying caviar to consume at home,"" she says.
Sterling owner, Eugene Fernandez, says that its online sales soared 60% last year, helped by launching a new website in August. He thinks that caviar fans now want to eat it on a more regular basis.
""I think going forward the caviar market will probably be less of an occasional product for holidays, and more something that's bought regularly,"" he says.
Ms Sora adds that producers in the US and Europe have also benefitted from less caviar exports coming from China, whose farms account for 70% of global production. China's domestic consumption of caviar has soared in recent years, at the same time as there might have been some staff shortages caused by the pandemic.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
But why is caviar so expensive? At Exmoor, its cheapest tin costs £14, but that only gets you 10 grams - less than a teaspoon's worth. By contrast, its most expensive costs £4,800 for one kilogram.
Much of the high cost is down to the fact that female sturgeon take a long time to reach egg-laying maturity. For the Siberian sturgeon, the main species farmed at Exmoor, this takes between four and five years. For the white sturgeon at Agroittica Lombarda the females don't start laying eggs until they are 14 years old.
Critics of sturgeon farms, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, argue that farming any fish is cruel, as it keeps them in an artificially confined space. The female sturgeons are also generally killed before their eggs are harvested.
""Caviar is something no-one needs,"" says Sascha Camilli, Peta's senior PR coordinator. ""On fish farms, sturgeons are smashed together to swim in crowded, barren tanks, or netted areas polluted with the waste from thousands of fish.""
The caviar industry counters that the sturgeon meat is also sold for eating, that farmed stocks can bolster critically endangered wild numbers, and that the welfare of the fish has to be their main priority.
Exmoor's chief executive Kenneth Benning says that, despite the recent boom, there is no certainty that caviar sales will continue to rise so strongly because demand for the expensive premium product is greatly affected by economic uncertainty.
""The reality is that disposable income is [likely] going to be less, particularly in the UK,"" he says. ""There's a lot of people out there in the world who basically cannot justify spending £20 on a 10 gram tin.
""We've been on an upward trajectory, but I think that that's from the marketing perspective, and from building customers who've come back to buy the product again.""
By contrast, Mr Fernandez expects growth to continue to grow rapidly, and Sterling intends to acquire a further 240 acres of land to expand its existing farms.
""We'll do a roll up of another five or 15 farms over the next three to four years and take the company public,"" says Mr Fernandez. ""This is going to be a hot sector for the next five to 10 years - at least.""
At Exmoor, the plans for the future are more high tech - it has filed a patent for the development of lab-grown caviar from sturgeon stem cells. This technology is already under development for other fish, such as tuna.
""With cellular aquaculture, we believe we can produce the egg we need within 40 days,"" says Mr Benning. ""If we had excess demand, we could meet it in a moment.
""In a room that is less than 300 square meters, we can produce more caviar than the entire annual global production. If you can provide the products, it's the same genetic material and it doesn't involve the captivity or killing of an animal - it's a no-brainer.""
If all goes to plan, Exmoor - which is working with partners in Switzerland, Germany and Eastern Europe - intends to launch its cell-cultivated caviar in 2023.
But would this mean the end of the farmed sturgeon industry? Mr Benning doesn't think so. He says that some people will always want to buy natural rather than lab-grown caviar.

President Joe Biden has said rioters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 ""held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy"". 
In a televised speech marking the first anniversary of the events, Mr Biden said they came ""in rage"", and ""in the service of one man"". 
He accused his predecessor Donald Trump of spreading ""a web of lies"" that led to the attack on the Congress building. 
Investigators have so far arrested 725 suspects in connection with the riot. 
""Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated this incidence, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy"", Mr Biden said in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.
""They came here in rage, not in the service of America, but rather, in the service of one man.
""The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election... His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution"", he added. 
On 6 January 2021, Trump supporters stormed the building as Congress was meeting to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory. Images of US lawmakers cowering from the mob in the gallery of the House of Representatives on that afternoon shocked the world. 
Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also encouraged them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost.
The former president released an angry statement hitting out at his successor shortly after Mr Biden's speech. In it, he accused Mr Biden of ""failure"" and repeated false claims about the election. 
This video can not be played
Several other events are planned by Democrats, who have control over the US Congress, to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will preside over a moment of silence at noon on the chamber floor. She will also lead a moment of reflection with congressional staff members. 
Meanwhile, some Republicans plan to skip the day's commemorative events. The party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, is leading a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - two provocative pro-Trump members of the House - will hold a news conference later in the afternoon. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has already accused Mr Biden of ""brazen politicisation"", of the 6 January riot.  
Last January, Joe Biden gave an inaugural address outside the US Capitol that focused on national healing and unity.
Now, standing in the centre of the building nearly a year later - after it has become clear that the nation is as divided as ever - Biden put unifying rhetoric aside and took dead aim at Donald Trump and his supporters.
In some of the sharpest words directed at his predecessor since the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden condemned Trump's continued efforts to question the legitimacy of that election.
Not only that, he blasted Republicans who continue to stand behind the former president and endorsed national efforts to enact election reform to counter what he said were Trump-backed attempts to undermine voting rights.
This is an election year in America, with control of the US Congress and several key states hanging in the balance.
Biden's rhetorical shift could represent a strategic shift, as well - a decision that the Democratic base can most effectively be rallied with anger, not hope.

164;The man who ran all of Glasgow's 6,000 streets;2022-01-06T07:51:09.000Z;[];['every single glasgow street – a journal of running 6,000 streets by michael shanks'];['match', 'speed', 'trying', 'intended', 'michael', 'glasgows', '6000', 'man', 'running', 'challenges', 'street', 'streets', 'written', 'inefficiency', 'ran'];"
""I get lost quite a lot,"" Michael Shanks admits. ""My map reading is atrocious.
""And inevitably you end up running the same street several times.""
Over the past two years Michael has run along every single street, road and lane on the map of Glasgow - but he says he is more of an explorer than an athlete.
In total he has run more than 2,300km (1,400 miles), double the actual length of the city's 6,100-plus streets.
Michael, a 33-year-old modern studies teacher, started his mammoth task as a way of making the most of his limited exercise hours during the first Covid lockdown in March 2020.
""I realised I tended to run broadly the same route round the west end of Glasgow where I live,"" he says.
""Even streets that were pretty close to me I had just never gone down."" 
He started adding new streets and venturing to different areas, then eventually started to consult maps and plan his routes.
His research led him to Rickey Gates, who had run every street in San Francisco in 2018. The ultra runner did it in just 45 days, clocking up an average of 29 miles a day.
Michael says he never intended to match the American's speed, but he had written about the challenges such as trying to avoid the inefficiency of running the same street again and again.
This creates a mathematical conundrum - how do you travel along every road in a city with the least possible distance?
""Cul-de-sacs are a nightmare,"" Michael says. 
""There is nothing you can do but run all the way to the end of it and then all the way back. 
""New housing schemes are the worst because they are just full of dead ends. That adds a lot of mileage.""
But Michael reserved the accolade of ""least favourite street"" for a bit of Moray Gardens in the south of the city. When he finally found it, the road turned out to be an extremely steep, muddy track surrounded by a forest.
Some parts of the city are well-suited to his task, such as Garthamlock and Craigend, which were built in the 1950s and 1960s with roads that are linked by pedestrian lanes.
The traditional gridiron layout of many of Glasgow's tenements is also good for methodically ticking off streets, but there are some areas where it is less clear.
Parts of Easterhouse and Possilpark are full of streets where the tenements were demolished 20 years ago and nature has reclaimed most of it.
However, these ""ghost streets"" are still mapped so Michael had to run them.
""I nearly got run over by a dirt bike in Possilpark,"" he says. 
""I turned a corner and there it was right in front of me.
""I think my mother would rather I did not run down some of these streets.""
Michael is quick to add that despite Glasgow's enduring ""no mean city"" reputation, he has never encountered any trouble on any of his runs through some of the most deprived communities in the UK.
""I can honestly say there is not a single run in any part of the city where I have thought: 'I need to get out of here quickly',"" he says.
""I think that is testament to the fact the city has changed a lot.
""I have found people unfailingly friendly when it is obvious I don't know where I'm going."" 
He adds: ""I'm not a very good runner so usually I pretend to check the map to get my breath back. 
""I see people looking and I say: 'I'm not lost, I'm just trying to run every street.' That's an obvious conversation starter.""
People are usually keen to tell him all about their area, which helps Michael collect information for a book he is planning on the social history of Glasgow.
He has been inspired by a book from 1860 called Rambles Around Glasgow by Hugh Macdonald.
""I am never really going to be an athlete so it is not really a fitness challenge, it is an adventure,"" he says.
""I have been exploring.""
His exploration has uncovered some strange recurring themes.
""I have actually become a bit obsessed with 'no ball games' signs because they absolutely infuriate me,"" he says.
""It's not a relic of a bygone era because they are absolutely everywhere.
""That mentality which says kids should be seen and not heard really annoys me as a teacher.""
While ball games are often banned in housing schemes, Michael is also intrigued by football goalposts that crop up in the most unlikely places.
He also thinks he must be the only person to take a picture of every single Welcome to Glasgow sign, which he comes across every time he reaches the city council boundary.
Michael finished his challenge on Wednesday when he ran down the city centre's George Square, which he had saved for last. There he was greeted by family and friends.
He says he has enjoyed the challenge but is glad to see the back of it.
""I'm relieved but it's quite sad in a way,"" he says.
""I've enjoyed going on the adventure and I guess there is nowhere left to visit in Glasgow. I've been literally everywhere.
""But the map will update soon. There is housing being built all over and I won't be at 100% for very long. So I'll be back at it in a few weeks.""

165;I understand anxiety over rising prices, says Chancellor Rishi Sunak;2022-01-06T14:23:17.000Z;[];['angela rayner', 'jacob rees-mogg', 'personal finance', 'rishi sunak', 'cost of living', 'peter bone'];['anxiety', 'understand', 'way', 'rising', 'sunak', 'track', 'support', 'making', 'rishi', 'sure', 'shows', 'record', 'prices', 'weve', 'policy', 'thats', 'chancellor'];"

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he ""understands people's anxiety... about rising prices"" and insisted he will ""always be listening"" to concerns. 
He pointed to a living wage rise and the winter fuel payment as ways the government is helping people.
But the chancellor is coming under pressure from Labour and some of his own MPs to cut the VAT on energy bills.
And minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is reported to have raised concern about a tax rise coming into force in April.
On Wednesday, the Financial Times said the leader of the House, Mr Rees-Mogg, had argued against a hike in National Insurance in a Cabinet meeting, calling instead for savings to be made in government spending.
The government says the rise will initially help tackle the backlog in the NHS, and later be invested in social care.
Asked if there were splits in the Cabinet over the tax, Mr Sunak said he had respect for his colleagues but added that it was ""not a responsible thing to do"" to ""duck difficult decisions"" and that people wanted the government to invest in the NHS and social care.
The tax rise is due to kick in during April, around the same time households could see a big rise in their energy bills.
Soaring global gas prices on the wholesale market have put pressure on suppliers, and 27 energy companies have gone bust. 
Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, Conservative MP Peter Bone urged the government to cut VAT on energy bills to help consumers.
""Energy costs are not a luxury, they are a necessity, something that you can't avoid. You need to heat your home,"" he said.
Labour are also urging the government to scrap VAT on energy bills with the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner accusing the prime minister of failing ""to invest in long term energy security"" and that ""yet again working families are picking up tab for his incompetence"" at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the warm homes discount should be increased from £140 per year to £300 and offered to more people. 
Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""We've got to pay for it. But one of the other effects of the big rising global gas prices, as well as hitting people with their heating bills, is it's resulted in record profits for the oil and gas sector.
""I think at this stage, when people are going to face an average increase in energy bill of nearly £700, and these oil and gas sectors are making super-profits, it's not unreasonable to ask them to make a contribution.""
Speaking from a vaccination centre in West Sussex, the chancellor said the government had put in place a series of measures to help people with energy costs. 
""We announced half a billion pounds towards the end of last year to help millions of families - £100-£150 to help them get through the winter,"" he said.
The chancellor also cited the warm homes discount which reduces energy bills by £140, cold weather payments and winter fuel discounts.
""There is support there for people,"" he said, but added that he was ""always listening making sure the policy we've got will support people in the way we want it to, and that's what our track record over the last year or two shows"".
Abolishing VAT of 5% on energy bills would be quick and easy, but is considered a blunt instrument, as it would provide support to well-off customers who don't need it. 
And for those that do need it, 5% of a possible £700 price rise is pretty small.
The government could temporarily suspend the additional levies on bills that fund green policies.
But that would be a tricky sell in some quarters, after the UK hosted a major global climate summit, and these levies are designed to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuels. 
One other option is to extend and expand the Warm Homes Discount. Currently, customers in receipt of certain benefits can apply for a one-off payment of £140.
And another option - suggested by the industry - would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves, by establishing a fund or facility which would allow them to draw down government cash when wholesale prices were very high and then pay it back when prices dipped again.

166;Kazakhstan unrest: Why have there been riots and deaths?;2022-01-06T15:54:20.000Z;[];['kazakhstan', 'russia', 'nursultan nazarbayev'];['nazarbayev', 'unrest', 'killed', 'kazakhstan', 'mr', 'security', 'president', 'russia', 'source', 'riots', 'protesters', 'say', 'deaths'];"
Security forces in Kazakhstan say they have killed dozens of protesters in the main city, Almaty, to quell massive riots.
Some 13 security officers have been killed, with hundreds more wounded in the unrest.
The protests followed a hike in the price of fuel.
Kazakhstan is a huge country, the size of western Europe, situated in Central Asia and bordering Russia and China. 
Made up mostly of mountains and arid steppe land, it has a population of only 19 million people. 
It gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world. It produces 1.6 million barrels of oil a day and has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment.
However, the wealth has not trickled down to the population, who have an average income of less than £2,500 a year. 
For 18 years, Kazakhstan was ruled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev - a former Communist Party politburo member with strong links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Statues of Mr Nazarbayev were erected and he built a new capital, Astana, which was later renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour.
He stood down in 2019, making way for current President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. 
Public protests in Kazakhstan are illegal without a government permit, and previous strikes and demonstrations have been dealt with very harshly. 
Demonstrations started on 2 January in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and the site of deadly clashes between protesters and police just over 10 years ago.
Protests then spread across the rest of the country.
The security forces say they killed rioters in Almaty while trying to restore order. Police say protesters tried to take control of police stations in the city.
At least 12 members of the security forces have been killed and 353 injured, according to police.
Nationwide, about 1,000 people have reportedly been injured in the unrest, with 400 being treated in hospital and dozens in intensive care.
The protests began when the government lifted its price cap on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
Many Kazakhs converted their cars to use LPG because it was cheaper than other fuel. 
However, the government said it could not afford to continue subsidising LPG and its decision to remove the cap virtually doubled its price. 
However, the rioters appear to have other grievances. Some chanted the name of Mr Nazarbayev and tried to tear down a bronze statue of him. 
After stepping down as president, Mr Nazarbayev continued to hold a strong position in government as head of Kazakhstan's Security Council. He also appeared to be grooming his daughter Dariga as a future leader, according to observers.
To placate the protesters, Mr Nazarbayev has been removed from his post.
Russian paratroopers have been sent to Kazakhstan at the request of the Kazakh president to help ""stabilise"" the country. 
They were sent under the authority of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). 
This is a group of countries comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, which was set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The CSTO, which is currently chaired by Armenia, has blamed the trouble in Almaty on ""an invasion of bandit formations trained from abroad"".
Russia is keen to increase the military presence it already has in Kazakhstan protecting assets such as gas pipelines, Russian military bases and the Russian space station at Baikonur. 
Kazakhstan's government is making concessions. 
It has put off removing its price cap on LPG - ordering the prices of all vehicle fuel to be regulated for six months. 
Ministers have also resigned. President President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the government had failed to carry out ""one of its main tasks -  keeping inflation in check"". The president has appointed Alikhan Smailov as acting prime minister.
The United States urged Kazakh authorities to show ""restraint"", saying protesters should be able to ""express themselves peacefully"".

Peter Bogdanovich, the US film director known for films such The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon has died aged 82, his agent confirmed on Thursday.
The New Yorker's work became synonymous with the New Hollywood of the 1970s.
His coming-of-age drama, 1971's The Last Picture Show, which he also co-wrote, earned him eight Oscar nominations including best director.
The film, set in a Texas town, had an ensemble cast of rising stars including Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd.
In 2014, he returned with his first movie in 13 years. She's Funny that Way, starring Owen Wilson and Imogen Poots, was ""a celebration of old Hollywood"", wrote BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber at the time.
Bogdanovich also starred on the small screen, appearing on HBO's The Sopranos where he played the role of a psychotherapist. 
Born in 1939, Bogdanovich became interested in cinema from an early age. 
Between the ages of 12 and 30, he kept a record of every film he watched along with a small review on an index card. 
As a teenager, he attended acting school and upon leaving took up small roles in theatre and on television, the New York Times reports. 
Bogdanovich is survived by his two children.
Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Godfather, released a statement to Deadline to say he was ""devastated"" by the news. 
""May he sleep in bliss for eternity, enjoying the thrill of our applause forever"", he said. 
Guillermo del Toro, the director of Pan's Labyrinth, tweeted: ""He was a dear friend and a champion of Cinema... He single-handedly interviewed and enshrined the lives and work of more classic filmmakers than almost anyone else in his generation.""

171;Farmers could be paid for post-Brexit 'rewilding' land changes;2022-01-06T02:40:08.000Z;[];['agriculture', 'nature', 'george eustice', 'brexit'];['rewilding', 'changes', 'way', 'step', 'support', 'change', 'run', 'farmers', 'production', 'land', 'postbrexit', 'field', 'going', 'paid', 'quite', 'need'];"
Farmers and landowners in England could be paid to turn large areas of land into nature reserves, or to restore floodplains, under new government agriculture subsidies.
When the UK was part of the EU, farmers were given grants based on how much land they farmed. 
Following Brexit, the government has pledged to pay based on how farmers care for the environment. 
But environmental groups say the new plans lack detail and may not deliver.
In what the government describes as ""radical plans"", landowners and farmers will be allowed to bid for funding to turn vast areas of land - between 500 and 5,000 hectares - over to wildlife restoration, carbon sequestration, or flood prevention projects. 
""What we're moving to is a more generous set of incentives for farmers doing the right thing,"" Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC.
""We can have both sustainable, profitable food production, and see a recovery for nature as well.""
Agriculture is a devolved issue meaning that each UK nation has its own plans. Wales, for example, has said its new funding scheme will promote environmental benefits and be in place from 2025.
Under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, farmers were given taxpayers' money largely based on the amount of land they farmed: the more land they held, the more cash support they got. In 2020 about £3.5bn was handed out.
Now the government says that instead of rewarding farmers for how much land they work, it wants to encourage farmers to introduce practices that improve the environment.  
Farming creates 10% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, and large-scale agriculture has long been accused of degrading the environment.
Applications will shortly open for the first wave of ""Landscape Recovery"" projects. Mr Eustice said the scheme would lead to ""fundamental land use change"" creating new woodlands, restoring peatlands, and other ""intensive interventions"". 
The aim of these pilot projects is to create 10,000 hectares of restored wildlife habitat, which could help sequester carbon and restore England's rivers and streams. Mr Eustice said he hoped it would lead to more large-scale rewilding projects like the Knepp estate in West Sussex. 
But Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said the ""golden opportunity"" of the agricultural transition was in danger of being ""wasted"" .
""While we're hearing the right noises from the government, the devil will be in the detail, and the detail is still not published nearly six years after the EU referendum,"" he said.
James Robinson, a farmer in Cumbria with 300 acres of land, said it was difficult to judge the proposals because they still lacked detail.
""It will make a difference but we need action now. The way farming has been run for the last 40-50 years has been for field production at the expense of environment. We can't keep going as we are, we need to make a change now, and as farmers we need to step up and make a change. But we also need government support to do that and it's still not quite there yet,"" he said.
There were also concerns among tenant farmers about how they could take part. George Dunn of the Tenant Farmers Association said: ""Payments are being removed from tenant farmers in real time while we have a vague commitment for further work to be undertaken on how tenants can access schemes"".
Dr Alexander Lees, from Manchester Metropolitan University, said the schemes fitted well with the challenges of reversing declines in Britain's most endangered species - those on the Red List. But the aspirations of the pilot seemed ""simultaneously low and over-ambitious"", he said.
""It would seem very hard to reverse biodiversity loss for the 'most threatened species' in just 10,000 hectares,"" he added.
""If we are serious, then we need to be racing towards the 300,000 hectare target as fast as possible."" 
An additional plan, called the Local Nature Recovery scheme, will pay farmers to deliver on small-scale environmental priorities, such as ""creating wildlife habitat, planting trees, or restoring peat and wetland areas"".
Mr Eustice said it was ""about individual farms or groups making space for nature on part of their holding, perhaps creating water features on some of the less productive land, or hedgerows for breeding sites for birds.""
The government says, by 2030, the policy aims to:
Details of the broader Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which aims to support sustainable farming practices, were revealed in December. 
The Wildlife Trusts, National Trust and RSPB were highly critical of the SFI plans, saying they were ""deeply concerned"" that they did not go far enough. 
According to the Wildlife Trusts, the SFI allows 30% of arable soils to be left bare over winter, which is damaging to soil health. The standards also do not address the damaging impact of pesticides and artificial fertilisers on soil, it said. 
It also claimed that farmers would be left to measure and assess their own management plans.
Mr Eustice said judging how successful the plan is would be a ""complex"" thing to do in the years ahead.
He said: ""We've been running agri-environment schemes in one form or another for well over 20 years, and each of those have been evaluated. It may not be perfect, but we think it's reasonably accurate. And you have to work on something.""

172;Kazakhstan unrest: Troops told to fire without warning;2022-01-07T09:10:04.000Z;[];['kazakhstan'];['western', 'unrest', 'warning', 'republics', 'north', 'kazakhstan', 'mass', 'shares', 'size', 'russia', 'land', 'troops', 'soviet', 'told'];"
Kazakhstan's authoritarian leader says he has authorised security forces to ""fire without warning"" amid a violent crackdown on anti-government protests.
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the main city of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike.
He has blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"", without giving evidence.
The interior ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the unrest. 
In a televised address, Mr Tokayev said the peacekeeping forces sent from Russia and neighbouring states had arrived on his request and were in the country on a temporary basis to ensure security.
The force from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) reportedly has about 2,500 soldiers. Mr Tokayev gave ""special thanks"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin for sending troops.
Earlier on Friday, fresh gunfire was heard near the main square of Almaty.            
Where is it? Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe, dwarfing in land mass the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
Why does it matter? It has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. A mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has largely escaped the civil strife seen in other parts of Central Asia.  
Why is it making the news? Fuel riots have rocked the government, resulting in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.
The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled, drawing protesters onto the streets. 
The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances.
Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition.

174;'Crisis actor' conspiracy theory: How anti-vax activists targeted a Covid patient;2022-01-07T03:31:59.000Z;[];['anti-vaccination movement', 'fake news'];['antivax', 'dyne', 'tells', 'value', 'patient', 'social', 'crisis', 'targeted', 'conspiracy', 'unfortunate', 'mr', 'theory', 'actor', 'wrote', 'covid', 'taken', 'taylor', 'sarcastically', 'activists'];"
A man was targeted with hundreds of abusive messages after being featured in a year-end BBC News report. The source? Anti-vaccine activists who falsely believed he was a so-called ""crisis actor"" pretending to be sick with Covid-19.
A few days after Christmas, Henry Dyne nonchalantly checked his phone while ordering a couple of drinks at a bar. As he unlocked it, he was greeted by more than 600 notifications. 
He began to despair - it was something he'd experienced before - but, says the 29-year-old from Surrey, this time was ""a hundred times worse"".
The messages were nasty, abusive, even threatening.
""Next time you're in a hospital bed,"" one read, ""it won't be with Corona.""  
Dyne's misfortune began when he contracted the virus in summer 2021. He hadn't been vaccinated, he said, thinking that his relative youth would make any infection pretty mild. 
But the IT consultant - who also enjoys posting jokes on his Instagram account - was unlucky.
""Every time I'd sleep, I'm not sleeping. I'm all over the place. And then one day, I just woke up at about six in the morning and said I'm calling an ambulance,"" he says. ""The scariest part was the fever and the hallucinations.""
In July, he ended up in hospital, hooked up to an oxygen tank, and spoke to BBC journalists who were visiting to report on a rise in Covid cases in young people for the News at Six.
""I just thought it probably would be quite good to go on record and say 'this is my experience, it is a lot worse than I thought, so get the vaccine',"" he says. 
He didn't think he'd soon find himself the focus of a group of anti-vaccine activists. It was the start of allegations that he was a so-called ""crisis actor"". 
The idea of ""crisis actors"" - people who pretend or are hired to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - is part of many contemporary conspiracy theories. 
The concept was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook shooting were somehow faking their personal tragedies. The idea allows motivated activists to explain away real suffering by pretending it was somehow staged.
Of course, BBC News does not use ""crisis actors"", and does not pay interviewees. Dyne was not paid for his contribution. 
But that did not stop committed anti-vaccine activists from making up false information and going on the attack. 
""How much did the BBC pay you to pretend you had Covid-19?"" one message read. Another said: ""You're a dirtbag, mate. Karma is real my friend.""
There were much worse comments as well - many too explicit to share here.
Wild theories spiralled further out of control as activists trawled through his online accounts. Some discovered his LinkedIn profile, which listed one of his former employers, a company that had secured government contracts providing laptops to schools during the pandemic.
The detail was true, but he was no longer employed by the company - the connection was both tenuous and coincidental. 
After the initial wave of abuse tailed off and Dyne was on the road to making a full recovery, he tried to joke about it on his Instagram bio, sarcastically describing himself as a ""1x Academy Award Winning Crisis Actor"".
""Humour is my way of coping, all you can do is laugh,"" he explains, ""Little did I know this joke would get me in so much trouble.""
Round two came after a BBC News Special broadcast on 27 December, called Review 2021: The Coronavirus Pandemic. It included the clip of Dyne's original interview. 
Someone posted a video of themselves watching the special, googling Henry Dyne's name, finding his Instagram bio and reading the phrase ""crisis actor"".
It's unclear who made the original video - but it was quickly reposted in anti-vaccine circles on YouTube and Facebook, before really taking off on Twitter. 
One of the main drivers of the Twitter storm was an aspiring Welsh politician, Richard Taylor. He posted the video on Facebook and racked up thousands of reactions with a tweet. 
Taylor received 20% of the vote in Blaenau Gwent standing for the Brexit Party in the 2019 General Election. He recently set up a crowdfunding campaign that raised £61,000 for a Swansea cinema closed after breaching Covid regulations.  
Taylor's posts read ""We see you"" along with the video, but when contacted said via email: ""In my original post, I was not implying anything... It us up to my social media followers to draw a conclusion from what they see or read.
""It is unfortunate that Mr Dyne decided to reference himself sarcastically in his social media accounts,"" Taylor wrote, ""I have lived believing that when someone tells you who or what they are, believe them, so I would have taken Mr Dyne at face value when he referenced himself as a crisis actor.""
He also condemned the abuse and threats. 
""I would never intentionally contribute to abusing or threatening another individual, having spent a large part of my vocation life helping and serving others,"" he wrote. 
But the viral video did result in Dyne receiving hundreds more abusive and threatening messages - he estimates three times as many as in the initial wave in July, including several death threats and fake accounts set up in his name.
Taylor's post on Facebook was labelled as false by fact-checkers. A video on YouTube remains live, as do several viral tweets showing the video on Twitter. 
Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - has since taken down the fake accounts. 
""We apologise to Henry for the distress that this must have caused,"" a Meta statement said. 
""Accounts that impersonate someone else are not allowed on Instagram and we have removed the accounts reported to us.""
Twitter said in a statement: ""We continue to take enforcement action on content and accounts that advance demonstrably false or misleading claims about Covid-19 and that may lead to significant risk of harm.""
YouTube is investigating the video in question. 
All three social media companies condemned online harassment and say they have rules and tools to protect against it. 
While lamenting the repeated rounds of abuse, Henry Dyne has continued to poke fun at his accusers, joking that he's available to ""fake"" other disasters.
""That's literally all you can do,"" he says. ""Something does need to happen with social media. It's just so obvious that it's blown so far out of control.""
While he would consider a career in stand-up comedy, he says his bout with Covid-19 wasn't very funny - and was all too real.

175;The companies offering delivery to the Moon;2022-01-07T00:01:20.000Z;[];['artemis', 'nasa', 'human spaceflight', 'the moon', 'space exploration'];['fear', 'companies', 'things', 'quickly', 'opportunity', 'kind', 'gives', 'missions', 'offering', 'moon', 'delivery', 'slate', 'risky', 'frees'];"
Not many people can say they have a doctorate in interplanetary navigation, but Tim Crain can.
While working on his PhD in Austin, Texas, in the 1990s he hoped one day to work on missions to Mars and in 2000 he landed his dream job with Nasa, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
""In 2000, the idea was, we would finish the space station in just a matter of years, and then the next big human spaceflight project would be to move on to Mars,"" he says.
But things didn't quite work out that way and shortly after he joined Nasa the agency's priorities changed.
""Things took a turn, we lost [the Space Shuttle] Columbia, had the global war on terrorism, so, Mars fell off the table,"" he explains.
He shifted to another Nasa programme called Constellation, an ambitious plan to return to the Moon and eventually Mars, but by 2010 it too had fallen by the wayside.
""I became a little bit disillusioned that the Moon was no longer an option with Nasa,"" says Mr Crain.
So, after a decade with Nasa he left to form Intuitive Machines with co-founders Steve Altemus and Kam Ghaffarian.
Their plan was to apply their expertise to complicated engineering projects, which they did for a few years.
But in 2018 an opportunity came along that the partners could not resist.
In April of that year Nasa launched Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), a programme to commission private companies to take cargo to the Moon.
That cargo would include instruments and devices designed to pave the way for Artemis, Nasa's latest plan to return to the Moon, this time by 2025.
""We said: 'Hey, wait a minute. That's something we could go after,'"" remembers Mr Crain.
So, they dropped everything and scrambled to get a proposal together.
""That was a new experience - to write a proposal for a lunar mission of 30 days. And we won, along with two of our competitors Astrobotic and Orbit Beyond and our lives changed,"" he says.
But winning the contract was only the first step, next came the design and development of a spacecraft that could get to the Moon.
""We quickly discovered we needed to assemble a whole programme - we needed operations, we needed launch system integration, we needed an entire payload integration group.
""When you take that whole thing, we actually have a mini space programme,"" says Mr Crain.
Starting with nothing more than a blueprint it took Intuitive Machines three years to build their spacecraft, Nova-C.
Their engineers used knowledge of existing space technology and blended that with their own development.
The company even developed its own propulsion system which uses methane and liquid oxygen, a well-tried combination. 
It is also a fuel that could, one day, be made in space to power future missions.
""Any place there's carbon and water, two of the most abundant chemicals in the universe, as far as we know. We'll be able to make methane.""
""I think that LOX (liquid oxygen) and methane is the propulsion [system] that will drive commerce through the solar system,"" says Mr Crain.
The spacecraft, Nova-C is capable of transporting a payload of 130kg, but for its first flight is only carrying 80kg.
Mr Crain says that once Nova-C has proven itself, they will build bigger spacecraft. The company has plans for one that can carry a payload of five tonnes.
But before those more ambitious missions, the first launch has to go to plan. 
A US spacecraft has not made a soft landing on the Moon since the last of the Apollo missions in 1972. (The LCROSS mission in 2009 deliberately crashed a vehicle into the Moon to examine the material kicked up by the impact.)
Nova-C could change that when it blasts into space atop a SpaceX rocket in the first quarter of 2022.
It will decouple from that rocket after about 18 minutes and head to the Moon on a journey that will take about four days.
More technology of business:
Once there Nova-C will enter a low lunar orbit for around 24 hours. Then it will use its main engine to brake for a soft touchdown between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Crisium, two of the dark lava seas on the Earth-facing side of the Moon. 
Once safely down, it will operate for around 13 and a half days during the lunar day, during which time the Nasa and commercial payloads will be deployed and start work.
The experiments and data gained will be sent back to Earth using Intuitive Machines' own lunar data relay service. 
Once it has run out of energy, everything shuts down and Nova-C will sit on the Moon's surface forever, or perhaps until some future astronaut comes along and recycles it.
One of the biggest engineering challenges has been managing the extreme temperatures that Nova-C will encounter on the Moon, where temperatures can be as high as 140C (284F) and fall to minus 170C (minus 275F).
""If it was just the spacecraft and its flight computers, that would be relatively easy. But now we have to take care of our payloads,"" says Mr Crain.
Heating and cooling systems have been designed to keep the cargo safe, even in the extreme environment of the Moon.
Simeon Barber is a senior research fellow at the Open University and has spent his career developing instruments that will work in space, on planets and other bodies including the moon.
His current project is a Exospheric Mass Spectrometer, which will head into space on the first mission of a rival to Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic. His device will analyse the composition of the lunar atmosphere around the lander.
""I think we are entering a new era, for sure,"" he says.
Previously, scientists like him might have worked on one or possibly two big space missions in their career, but now there are new possibilities with the prospect of more regular trips to the Moon.
""There are several missions on the slate now and this gives you the opportunity to do things quickly, to be a bit more risky, and not have all your eggs in one basket. So it kind of frees you from that fear of failure,"" he says.
Lunar transport systems from Intuitive and its rivals, as well as government-led programmes like Nasa's Artemis will be the start of a new era of human activity on the moon, says Mr Crain.
""Unlike the first time around, where we had to invent a lot of the technology from scratch, we have a lot of technology in terms of electronics, computers, manufacturing, and composite materials [that] has changed the game.""
""I think within the next 20-30 years, you will see civilians paying for for trips to the Moon, for holidays.
""Predicting the future is hard, so maybe not. But I think it's feasible.""
Dr Barber is cautiously optimistic. He highlights how hostile the Moon will be for humans, with the huge temperature range and lunar dust which, if not managed, will damage machinery and human lungs. He is also keen that further human exploration has a minimal environmental impact.
But would he go, if he could?
""I like my home comforts. But yeah. I think you'd have to say, yes wouldn't you?""

176;Kew scientists name new tree after Leonardo DiCaprio;2022-01-06T11:24:36.000Z;[];['madagascar', 'conservation', 'plants', 'kew gardens', 'biodiversity'];['species', 'mining', 'risk', 'dicaprio', 'oil', 'orchids', 'tree', 'kew', 'plants', 'used', 'thought', 'scientists', 'wild', 'leonardo', 'primrose'];"
A tree that is new to science has been named after Leonardo DiCaprio.
Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, say they wanted to honour the star for his help in saving a rainforest from logging.
The tree, which has been given the official name, Uvariopsis dicaprio, grows only in the Cameroon forest known for its incredible biodiversity.
""We think he was crucial in helping to stop the logging of the Ebo Forest,"" said Dr Martin Cheek of Kew.
Scientists and conservationists were horrified when they heard of plans to allow vast swathes of the Ebo Forest to be opened up for logging.
One of the largest relatively untouched rainforests in Central Africa, it is home to the Banen people and an array of unique flora and fauna, including threatened gorillas, chimps and forest elephants.
International experts wrote a letter to the government documenting the precious animal and plant species at risk of extinction. The issue was picked up by DiCaprio, whose social media posts to his millions of followers added momentum to the campaign.
The government later revoked plans to allow logging, although the forest has yet to be officially designated a national park.
""This could just be a stay of execution,"" Dr Cheek added.
The ""dicaprio"" tree is the first plant new to science to be officially named by Kew scientists in 2022, through publication in the scientific journal, PeerJ.
The small tropical evergreen tree has glossy yellow flowers that grow from its trunk. A member of the ylang ylang family, it has been found only in a small area of the forest and is critically endangered.
Last year, more than 200 plants and fungi from across the word were officially named by Kew scientists and their collaborators, including a pink lily from the same forest, an insect-trapping wild tobacco plant found in Australia and an orchid with star-like flowers from the island of Madagascar that can grow in darkness.
Several of these new species are already extinct and many are threatened due to deforestation, land clearance and droughts, floods and fires driven by climate change.
Of 16 new species of orchids found in Madagascar, three are thought to be extinct in the wild due to destruction of their habitat. One has disappeared due to forests being chopped down to grow plants for geranium oil used in the aromatherapy industry in Europe.  And a new Cape primrose from Katanga in Congo is at risk from copper mining.
Until a species has a scientific name, assessment of its extinction risk is near impossible, which makes protection from extinction very difficult. 
Dr Martin Cheek said the list of show-stopping discoveries from 2021 is another reminder that this is our last chance to find unknown species, name them and protect them before they become extinct.
""There are still thousands of plant species and maybe millions of fungal species out there that we don't know about,"" he said. ""This natural habitat that they're growing in - especially forests, but other habitats too, is increasingly and more rapidly being destroyed by us humans without knowing what's there.""

179;Obituary: Iconic black actor Sidney Poitier;2022-01-07T15:35:51.000Z;[];['obituaries'];['iconic', 'sidney', 'poitier', 'way', 'racist', 'played', 'patient', 'black', 'performance', 'obituary', 'newlyqualified', 'sound', 'actor', 'doctor', 'film', 'studios'];"
Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, once turned down the role of Othello because he did not want to be typecast as a black actor.
It underlined the dilemma faced by a man who broke down many of Hollywood's racial barriers.
As the first black winner of the Academy Awards' Best Actor statuette, he was always aware of being the standard-bearer for greater racial integration.
But often he felt he had become something of a racial token, and this denied him the opportunity of taking on more varied roles.
He died on Friday, aged 94, the Bahamian foreign minister announced.  
Sidney Poitier was born on 20 February 1927 in Miami, Florida.
His parents were Bahamian farmers who had travelled to the US to sell tomatoes. His premature birth meant he gained US citizenship as well as Bahamian.
Relatives believed his father's family originated in Haiti and that his ancestors were runaway slaves. 
He was brought up on Cat Island in the Bahamas before the family moved to the capital, Nassau.
Aged 15 he went to live with his brother in Miami before moving to New York, where he worked as a dishwasher.
It was in the US that he experienced racism for the first time.
""I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except those put aside for my colour or my caste.""
After a spell in the US Army he joined the American Negro Theatre, which had been set up as a community project in Harlem in 1940.
Unfortunately Poitier was tone-deaf and was unable to sing, something audiences felt was a prerequisite of black actors at that time.
Instead he decided his future lay as a serious stage actor and he was offered a leading role in a production of Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata in 1946. 
It was a sign of the times that the production featured only black actors. 
In 1949 he took the difficult decision to move away from stage productions and into films.
It was a sound decision. His performance in the 1950 film No Way Out, in which he played a newly-qualified doctor confronted by a racist patient, brought him to the attention of the studios.
His breakthrough came in The Blackboard Jungle in 1955, in the role of a disruptive pupil in an inner-city school. 
The film was immensely popular, not least because it was one of the first to have a soundtrack featuring rock 'n' roll, including Bill Haley's classic Rock Around the Clock.
The Defiant Ones, in 1958, saw Poitier nominated for best actor at the Academy Awards, and he won a Bafta for the same film.
Five years later he was awarded an Oscar for Lilies of the Field, the first black winner of the Best Actor trophy.
With the growing civil rights movement in the US, it was inevitable Poitier would find himself lauded as an example of black achievement. It was a role he gladly accepted.
""I was a pretty good actor and I believed in brotherhood. I hated racism and segregation. And I was a symbol against those things.""
However, he was concerned that his Oscar may have been indicative of Hollywood's need for a token black actor, rather than something he achieved on merit.
Then 1967 saw him at his commercial peak with three films, making him Hollywood's most bankable star that year.
He played a newly-qualified teacher in a tough London school in To Sir, With Love, based on the autobiographical novel by E R Braithwaite.
His character's experience of being an immigrant in London mirrored that of many West Indians who came to Britain during the 1950s and '60s.
""Acting isn't a game of 'pretend',"" he once said. ""It's an exercise in being real.""
Poitier was nominated for Bafta and Golden Globe awards for Norman Jewison's film In the Heat of the Night.
He played a Philadelphia detective who found himself stranded in a red-necked Mississippi town on the night a businessman is murdered.
His developing relationship with the bigoted local sheriff, played by Rod Steiger, gave Poitier his strongest role and the film won five Oscars, including best picture.
Poitier's response to Steiger's question ""What do they call you, boy?"" produced one of cinema's most famous lines: ""They call me Mr Tibbs.""
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner featured Poitier as the boyfriend of a white, middle-class girl who takes him to meet her parents.
Played by Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn, her parents were torn between their liberal values and their reaction to a prospective black son-in-law.
At the time filming began, interracial marriage was still illegal in 17 US states. These laws were only revoked by the Supreme Court months before the film was released.
But Poitier faced criticism from some black civil-rights activists who complained his characters were just too good to be true.
It helped to persuade him to move away from acting roles. He involved himself in the campaign for Bahamian independence, achieved in 1973, and began a new career as a director.
By the end of the 1970s, Poitier had formed his own production company with other stars, including Paul Newman and Barbra Streisand.
Successes behind the camera included Stir Crazy, with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, and the thrillers Shoot to Kill and Little Nikita.
Poitier became the first black actor to receive a life achievement award from the American Film Institute in 1992.
Five years later, he was appointed the Bahamas' ambassador to Japan and he received a knighthood in 1974. 
As a Bahamian citizen this was a substantive rather than an honorary award, although he did not use it in the US.
Poitier married  Juanita Hardy in 1950, but the union ended in 1965. In 1976 he married the Canadian actress, Joanna Shimkus, and had six daughters from his two marriages. His daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier is also an actress.
In 2016 He was awarded a Fellowship by Bafta, a recognition of his outstanding contribution to cinema. Poor health prevented him travelling to London to receive the award so he appeared via a video link.
Poitier's noted ability to play intelligent leading roles helped to break down racial taboos in American cinema and wider society, although he played down his importance as a role model.
""If I'm remembered for having done a few good things,"" he once said, ""and if my presence here has sparked some good energies, that's plenty.""

At least 21 people have died after heavy snow trapped them in their vehicles in northern Pakistan.
The military is attempting to clear roads and rescue those still trapped near the hilltop town of Murree. 
Around 1,000 vehicles were trapped on a highway during a blizzard, according to Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid. 
Murree is a mountain resort town north of the capital Islamabad. Local media reported on Friday that tourists were getting stranded due to snow. 
More than 100,000 cars had entered Murree in recent days to see the unusually heavy snowfall. This caused a huge traffic jam on roads leading in and out of the town, police said. 
The area has now been declared a disaster area and people have been urged to stay away.
""For the first time in 15 to 20 years such large number of tourists flocked to Murree, which created a big crisis,"" Mr Rashid said in a video message.
Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed shock over the ""tragic deaths"" of the tourists. 
""Have ordered inquiry and putting in place strong regulations to ensure prevention of such tragedies,"" Khan said in a tweet.

181;Turkmenistan plans to close its 'Gateway to Hell';2022-01-08T14:34:50.000Z;[];['turkmenistan'];['close', 'hell', 'wellbeing', 'profits', 'televised', 'turkmenistan', 'remarks', 'valuable', 'president', 'gateway', 'resources', 'losing', 'significant', 'plans', 'natural'];"
Turkmenistan's president has ordered the extinguishing of the country's ""Gateway to Hell"", a fire that has been burning for decades in a huge desert gas crater.
Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wants it put out for environmental and health reasons, as well as part of efforts to increase gas exports. 
Mystery surrounds the Darvaza crater's creation in the Karakum Desert.
Many believe it formed when a Soviet drilling operation went wrong in 1971.
But Canadian explorer George Kourounis examined the crater's depths in 2013 and discovered that no-one actually knows how it started. 
According to local Turkmen geologists, the huge crater formed in the 1960s but was only lit in the 1980s. 
The crater is one of Turkmenistan's most popular tourist attractions.  
""We are losing valuable natural resources for which we could get significant profits and use them for improving the well-being of our people,"" the president said in televised remarks. 
He instructed officials to ""find a solution to extinguish the fire"".
There have been numerous attempts to end the fire, including in 2010 when Mr Berdymukhamedov also ordered experts to find a way to put out the flames.
In 2018, the president officially renamed it the Shining of Karakum.

182;Tories call on Treasury to fund green energy plans;2022-01-08T01:07:22.000Z;[];['conservative party', 'energy service companies', 'environment'];['tories', 'support', 'treasury', 'green', 'scheme', 'workers', 'whilst', 'warm', 'energy', 'worse', 'plans', 'taxes', 'fund', 'targeted', 'squeeze', 'tackle'];"
A group of green-minded Tory MPs says the government should fund environmental and social energy policies from the Treasury, instead of from consumer bills.
The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which includes 116 MPs, says the temporary measure would ease the surge in household costs.
But the group opposes a separate proposal to abolish the 5% VAT on energy bills, saying it would effectively provide a subsidy for fossil fuels.
The CEN is urging ministers to reduce bills and emissions in the long term by ensuring the UK's homes are better insulated.
The plea is endorsed by the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group - an alliance of businesses and charities who will write to the prime minister on Monday, arguing better insulation for people in sub-standard housing could cut bills by £500 a year.
But the current crisis over energy bills has revealed divisions among Conservative backbenchers. 
The plan to scrap VAT on energy has been pushed by the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of Tory MPs and peers.
The caucus, with around 20 followers, has been linked to the anti-green pressure group formerly known as the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was founded by the former Chancellor Nigel Lawson. 
Although its numbers are small, it is well connected in Conservative media.
Its leader, the Tory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay has regularly voted against measures to tackle climate change.
He doesn't deny climate change science, but believes the costs of climate policies are falling unfairly on the UK.
In December, Mr Mackinlay tweeted that he blamed ""the rush to Net Zero"" for creating the ""madness in the energy market"".
But this view is disputed by the industry body Energy UK, which says the rise in gas prices has caused the crisis, not Net Zero policies.
Sam Hall, director of the environmental CEN, pointed out that his organisation had almost six times more members than the sceptic NZSG.
He told BBC News: ""A clear majority of Conservative backbenchers supports the government's Net Zero agenda - the PM should know that we've got his back.""
The director added: ""Last year, no Conservative MP voted against the government's sixth carbon budget, which aims to cut emissions by 78% by 2035. 
""Although a small minority of MPs are raising concerns about the cost of achieving the target, it is perfectly possible to deliver Net Zero in a way that is fair and keeps down energy costs for consumers and businesses.""
Mr Hall insisted the solution to the global gas crisis ""was not to deepen our dependence on gas by removing VAT"".
Instead, he said the Treasury must urgently devise policies to fund environmental and social energy projects for the long term. 
The government has accepted that its current system of loading levies onto the cleaner fuel - namely electricity - is perverse.
Mr Hall said when the price of gas settles, the levies should be shifted on to the dirtier home heating fuel, gas.
""Because of the government's Net Zero policy, the UK is set to reduce its gas demand significantly over coming decades,"" he said. 
""This will protect UK consumers from future gas price shocks by making us less dependent on volatile international gas prices."" 
But Mr Mackinlay told BBC News he did not see any ""conflict"" between his group and the CEN, ""nor anything to be gained by an 'ours are bigger than yours' approach"".
He added: ""We all want to leave the planet in a better place than we found it.
""The key difference is our perception of how best to achieve a lower carbon UK and to inject some realism when the UK is responsible for 1% of global CO2 whilst China, India, Indonesia go gangbusters for new coal.""
Mr Hall said: ""Every country will need to hit Net Zero - and the UK should lead on this to gain the benefit of going first to develop new technology and services.""
The government is urgently seeking solutions for the cost of living crisis, which is seeing bills and price tags rising in the UK.
The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills - along the lines of the current Warm Homes Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner to tackle a cost of living squeeze, which could see households £1,200 a year worse off as a higher energy cap comes in at whilst taxes rise for workers and employers.

183;Marilyn Bergman: Oscar-winning lyricist dies at 93;2022-01-08T19:25:19.000Z;[];['music'];['marilyn', 'dear', 'sidney', 'morning', 'lose', 'pictwittercom2y7v76w4jj', 'nadia', 'human', 'bergman', 'lyricist', 'oscarwinning', 'epitome', 'crushing', 'dies', '93'];"
Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar winning lyricist who collaborated with her husband Alan on The Way We Were and hundreds more songs, has died aged 93.
The song-writing duo worked together on numerous shows for stage and screen and were known as ballad specialists. 
They wrote hits for Hollywood stars including Barbra Streisand, Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra.
She died on Saturday at her Los Angeles home with Alan and her daughter by her side, her agent said.
Bergman's cause of death has been reported as respiratory failure, and is not Covid related. She is survived by her husband, 96.
The Bergmans were nominated for 16 Academy Award nominations, winning three times - for The Way We Were from the 1973 Barbra Streisand film of that name, Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair in 1968 and for their score for Streisand's Yentl in 1983.
They also won several Grammy and Emmy awards, and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980.
Bergman was a trailblazer for women in the industry and in 1985 was the first woman to be elected president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).
Among those paying tribute was US producer Quincy Jones, who called her death ""crushing"".
Born in Brooklyn, New York City on 10 November 1928 in the same hospital as her husband, Bergman studied music from a young age. 
While at New York's High School of Music & Art, she often played piano for lyricist Bob Russell, who encouraged her to consider becoming a professional songwriter.
But her entry into writing lyrics was also a painful one - while in college, Bergman fell down a flight of stairs and broke both of her shoulders. Unable to write or play piano, she started speaking song lyrics into a tape recorder.
Even though she and Alan grew up living close to each other, they did not meet until they both moved to Los Angeles. For Bergman, that was in the mid-1950s, and she started writing lyrics for composer Lew Spence, with whom Alan was also working with. 
Marilyn and Alan wed two years later in 1958. They had one daughter together, Julie Bergman Sender, who is a film producer.

At least five people have been killed after part of a cliff collapsed onto leisure boats on a Brazilian lake.
Another 20 are missing and 32 injured following the accident in the south-east of the country.
Video circulating online shows the moment the rock detaches from the cliff face as onlookers try to yell warnings to the boats beneath.
At least one of the boats appears to have sunk, while others managed to escape.
The collapse at 11:00 local time (14:00 GMT) followed days of rain in Minas Gerais state, which had made the cliffs more susceptible to collapse, local fire officials told reporters.
Three vessels were hit by falling rock, Lieutenant Pedro Aihara told reporters. Out of the 32 injured, one person was in hospital with serious head and facial injuries, while 23 escaped with only light injuries.
Divers and helicopters are searching the water for any more survivors.

A Saudi princess and her daughter have been released from a high-security jail after being held for nearly three years without charge, campaigners say. 
Princess Basma bint Saud was detained in March 2019 as she prepared to fly to Switzerland for medical treatment.
It is not known why she was detained, and neither she nor her daughter Suhoud were charged with any crime.
Some have speculated it may have been related to her advocacy on humanitarian issues and constitutional reform.
Her family told the United Nations in a written statement in 2020 that it was likely due in large part to her ""record as an outspoken critic of abuses"", news agency AFP reports.
Other supporters suggest it was her close links to former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is reported to have been placed under house arrest.
Princess Basma, 57, appealed to Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release her last April, saying she had done nothing wrong and that her health was suffering.
It is not known what treatment she was seeking abroad when she was detained in 2019.
Announcing her released on Twitter, the ALQST for Human Rights said she had been ""denied the medical care she needed for a potentially life threatening condition"" during her time in the Al-Ha'ir prison, on the outskirts of the capital.
The Saudi rights group added. ""At no point during her detention has any charge been levelled against her."" 
Princess Basma is the youngest daughter of King Saud, who ruled Saudi Arabia between 1953 and 1964.

186;Nigeria attacks: Hundreds reported killed as bandits target villages;2022-01-09T05:37:21.000Z;[];['africa today podcasts'];['rid', 'killed', 'bandits', 'reassure', 'target', 'determined', 'let', 'mr', 'reported', 'outlaws', 'fate', 'communities', 'buhari', 'attacks', 'nigeria', 'nigerians', 'villages', 'hundreds'];"
At least 200 people in Nigeria's north-western Zamfara state have been killed in a wave of vicious attacks by armed militants, residents say. 
The attacks are believed to be in response to military air strikes that killed more than 100 fighters on Monday and forced others from forest hideouts.
Gunmen burnt homes and mutilated the bodies of their victims in the assault. 
A resident of one of the villages told the Reuters news agency the militants were shooting ""anyone on sight"".
The attacks are the latest in a wave of violent attacks in north-west Nigeria, where the central government has long been at war with a number of local criminal groups it has described as bandits. 
These gangs are sophisticated networks of criminals who operate across large swathes of territory, often stealing animals, kidnapping for ransom and killing those who confront them.
On Friday it was initially reported that more than 100 people had been killed by suspected ""bandit"" militants in the region, after some 300 gunmen on motorbikes arrived in as many as nine communities between Tuesday and Thursday night. 
Idi Musa, a resident of another village, told the AFP news agency that the attackers also stole ""around 2,000 cattle"". 
Meanwhile, local media has reported that armed groups appear to be abandoning hideouts in forested areas in response to sustained government attacks, instead moving towards the western part of Zamfara state. 
In a statement issued on Saturday, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari pledged that the government would not relent in its battle with the militants. 
""Let me reassure these besieged communities and other Nigerians that this government will not abandon them to their fate because we are more than ever determined to get rid of these outlaws,"" Mr Buhari said. 
""The latest attacks on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces.""
On Wednesday, the Nigerian government officially labelled bandits as terrorists, allowing security forces to impose tougher sanctions on the groups and their supporters. 
Nigeria's armed forces said this week they had killed 537 ""armed bandits and other criminal elements"" in the region and arrested 374 others since May last year.
Thousands of Nigerian troops have been deployed to fight them.

The US actor and comedian Bob Saget, best known for starring in the sitcom Full House, has died suddenly aged 65, law enforcement officials have said. 
The actor was found unresponsive by staff in his room at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Orlando, Florida on Sunday. 
Officers from the Orange County Sheriff's Department arrived after a call from hotel staff and pronounced him dead at the scene. 
The exact details surrounding his death remain unclear. 
But in a short statement posted to Twitter, the Sheriff's Department said that detectives had found no signs of foul play or drug use during initial enquiries. 
Saget, a veteran stand-up comedian, had just started a new comedy tour across the US, performing as recently as Saturday in the city of Jacksonville, Florida. 
After the show he had tweeted expressing his joy at being back on stage, telling fans that he was ""happily addicted"" to his craft. 
Although Saget was idolised by many comedians for his profane and often cutting act, he was best known in the US for his role in the sitcom, Full House, where he starred alongside the actors John Stamos and fellow comic Dave Coulier. 
He won plaudits for his portrayal of Danny Tanner, a widowed father of three daughters, playing the role from 1987 to 1995. 
He reprised it in 2016 when Netflix revived the programme for a further five seasons. 
John Stamos, who worked with Saget on Full House and Fuller House, said he was ""broken"" at the news of his friend's death. 
""I am broken. I am gutted.  I am in complete and utter shock.  I will never ever have another friend like him.  I love you so much Bobby,"" Stamos posted on Twitter. 
Whoopi Goldberg also paid tribute to her friend, giving a special mention to his ""huge heart and abject lunacy"".
Accompanying a photo of himself and Saget, actor and writer Penn Jillette wrote on Twitter: ""Saget would have wanted something tweeted that was really funny and in very bad taste. I can't do that. I'm just so sad. Bob was just great on every level and we will all miss him.""

193;Huge fossilised ‘sea dragon’ found in Rutland reservoir;2022-01-10T06:01:17.000Z;[];['leicester'];['fossilised', 'rutland', 'dragon', 'coast', 'reservoir', 'usually', 'inland', 'marine', 'yorkshire', 'unusual', 'think', 'reptiles', 'jurassic', 'sea', 'huge', 'location'];"
""I rang up the county council and I said I think I've found a dinosaur,"" explained Joe Davis, who works at Rutland Nature Reserve near Leicester. 
During landscaping work at the reserve's reservoir in February 2021, he'd spotted something unusual poking out of the mud. 
It wasn't a dinosaur. But it was the fossilised remains of a ten-metre long sea predator called an ichthyosaur. 
And it was the largest of its type ever discovered in the UK.
""I looked down at what seemed like stones or ridges in the mud and I said this looks a bit organic, a bit different,"" Mr Davis told BBC News. ""Then we saw something that looked almost like a jawbone.""
The council said to Mr Davis: ""We don't have a dinosaur department at Rutland County Council so we're going to have to get someone to call you back."" A team of paleontologists were brought in for a closer look. 
They concluded it was an ichthyosaur - they were warm-blooded, air-breathing sea predators not unlike dolphins, and could grow up to 25 metres long. They lived between 250 million and 90 million years ago.
Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist from Manchester University, was brought in to lead the excavation effort. He called the discovery ""truly unprecedented"" and - due to its size and completeness - ""one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history"".
""Usually we think of ichthyosaurs and other marine reptiles being discovered along the Jurassic coast in Dorset or the Yorkshire coast, where many of them are exposed by the erosion of the cliffs. Here at an inland location is very unusual."" 
Rutland is more than thirty miles from the coast, but 200 million years ago higher sea levels meant it was covered by a shallow ocean. 
When water levels at the Rutland reservoir were lowered again in the late summer of 2021, a team of palaeontologists came in to excavate the remains. Special attention was paid to the removal of the huge skull. 
A large block of clay containing the ichthyosaur's head was carefully dug out before being covered in plaster and placed on wooden splints. 
The block, weighing almost a tonne, was raised out of the mud and will now be examined further. 
""It's not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much,"" said Nigel Larkin, palaeontological conservator and Visiting Research Fellow at Reading University. ""It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge.""
Anglia Water, which manages the Rutland reservoir, is now looking for funding to enable the ichthyosaur to stay in the area and be enjoyed by the general public. 
""A lot of people thought I was pulling their leg when I told them I'd found a large marine reptile at work,"" Mr Davis said. ""I think a lot of people won't believe it until the TV programme goes out.""
That TV programme is on Tuesday 11 January at 8pm on BBC Two. ""Digging for Britain"" will then be available on the BBC iPlayer.

A man has been arrested at a Doja Cat concert in the US, after attempting to jump the queue by making a bomb threat.
Fans had been lining for more than 12 hours for the free show in Indianapolis on Saturday when, at 5pm, the man told people around him he had an explosive device in his backpack.
Police cleared the area for 20 minutes and the concert went ahead after they ensured the backpack was safe.
The man had unrelated outstanding warrants and was arrested for those.
The investigation into the bomb threat is still ongoing, said the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) in a statement.
""A fan wanted to advance in line so he exercised very poor judgement and told those around him in line he had a bomb in his backpack,"" Deputy Chief Joshua Barker told the Indianapolis Star. 
""Someone did the right thing and alerted IMPD. The backpack was clean.""
Doja Cat's show was part of the build-up to Monday's College Football Playoff, which will see the Georgia Bulldogs face off against underdogs Alabama Crimson Tide.
Fans had queued overnight to be at the front of the show, battling ice and freezing rain as temperatures dropped to -9C.
Some expressed their frustration at the disruption on social media.
""My boyfriend and I waited at the front of the line since noon, just for us to get trampled and fearing for our lives,"" wrote Paige Osborne on Twitter.
""Bomb threat and someone in cuffs at the Doja Cat concert 10 minutes before we were supposed to go in. I am LIVID,"" added another fan.
After the short delay, Doja Cat took to the stage around 21:40, wearing an ensemble that paid homage to the football championship.
The star, who has eight nominations at this year's Grammy Awards, raced through hits including Woman, Say So, You Right and Juicy in her 16-song, 90-minute set.
But the show was not without incident itself. A fight broke out in the crowd after the rapper/singer threw a pair of drumsticks into the audience.
""Hey, hey, hey. Chill, chill,"" shouted the star as she halted her band. 
""Listen, no fighting. I don't want to see that, I don't want to see that at all. I care about you, and it's way too cold out here for that.""

195;Air pollution: Delhi's smog problem is rooted in India's water crisis;2022-01-10T00:03:39.000Z;[];['asia', 'delhi', 'india', 'air pollution'];['northwest', 'sources', 'indias', 'winter', 'shrinks', 'crisis', 'water', 'delhis', 'winds', 'rooted', 'rains', 'smog', 'popular', 'pollution', 'air', 'raising', 'problem', 'vertically'];"
Every winter, Indian capital Delhi's toxic air is fuelled by farmers burning crop stubble. But the fires don't stop. Why? The answer lies in water, writes climate expert Mridula Ramesh.
India loses an estimated $95bn (£70bn) to air pollution every year. 
From mid-March to mid-October, when Delhi's air quality varies from good to moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups, chatter on air pollution and its causes is muted. 
But then comes winter. Pollution in any city mixes vertically in the atmosphere, and the height at which this happens shrinks by more than half in the winter, raising the concentration of pollution. Two new sources also enter the mix. By the end of October, when the rains have ceased, the winds begin to blow in from the northwest, carrying fumes from burning fields. Then there is the Diwali, the popular festival lights, where millions burst fire crackers to celebrate. 
Both of these play a large role in the spike in pollution. In the first week of November 2021, when Delhi's air quality went beyond hazardous, stubble burning accounted for 42% of the city's PM2.5 levels - these are tiny particles that can enter the lungs. 
Governments have banned the practice, imposed fines and even suggested alternate uses for the straw and other crop residue. But farmers continue to burn stubble. Why? 
Think of the fields that are on fire. They get only between 500-700mm (19-27 in) of rainfall a year. Yet, many of these fields grow a dual crop of paddy and wheat. Paddy alone needs about 1,240mm (48.8 in) of rainfall each year, and so, farmers use groundwater to bridge the gap. 
The northern states of Punjab and Haryana, which grow large amounts of paddy, together take out roughly 48 billion cubic metres (bcm) of groundwater a year, which is not much less than India's overall annual municipal water requirement: 56bcm. As a result, groundwater levels in these states are dropping rapidly. Punjab is expected to run out of groundwater in 20-25 years from 2019, according to an official estimate. 
The burning fields is a symptom of the deteriorating relationship between India and its water. 
Long ago, farmers grew crops based on locally available water. Tanks, inundation canals and forests helped smoothen the inherent variability of India's tempestuous water. 
But in the late 19th Century, the land began to transform as the British wanted to secure India's north-western frontier against possible Russian incursion. They built canals connecting the rivers of Punjab, bringing water to a dry land. They cut down forests, feeding the wood to railways that could cart produce from the freshly watered fields. And they imposed a fixed tax payable in cash that made farmers eager to grow crops that could be sold easily. These changes made farmers believe that water could be shaped, irrespective of local sources - a crucial change in thinking that is biting us today.
After independence from the British in 1947, repeated droughts made the Indian government succumb to the lure of the ""green revolution"". 
Until then, rice, a water-hungry crop, was a marginal crop in Punjab. It was grown on less than 7% of the fields. But beginning in the early 1960s, paddy cultivation was encouraged by showing farmers how to cheaply and conveniently tap into a new, seemingly-endless source of water that lay underground. 
The flat power tariffs to run borewells were cheapened and finally not paid - removing any incentive to conserve water. Water did not need to be managed, farmers were taught, only extracted. In the heady first years of the revolution, fields began to churn out paddy and wheat, and India became food-secure. But after a couple of decades, the water began to sputter.
To conserve groundwater, a 2009 law forbade farmers from sowing and transplanting paddy before a pre-determined date based on the onset of the monsoon. The aim was to make the borewells run less in the peak summer months. 
But the delay in paddy planting shrunk the gap between the paddy harvest and sowing of wheat. And the quickest way to clear the fields was to burn them, giving rise to the smoky plumes that add to northern India's air pollution.
So, the toxic smog is but a visible symbol of India's trainwreck of a relationship with its water. 
To tackle this problem, Indians need to respect their water again - a tall ask after decades of neglect. 
Take people's choices in food and crops. A century ago, most Indians ate the hardy millet, which could withstand the vicissitudes of India's water. Today, there are far more Indians, and they eat rice and wheat rotis (flatbreads), making millets an unappealing crop for farmers to grow. 
And pricing water, directly or through electricity that powers the borewells, is seen as political suicide. Meanwhile, as air quality improves from hazardous to (very) unhealthy, people, courts and political leaders have moved on - at least until next November. 
But the time bomb - of depleting groundwater - ticks on. Once that runs out, the November air might be cleaner.
But what will India do about food?

196;The AI software that could turn you in to a music star;2022-01-10T00:03:28.000Z;[];['streaming', 'artificial intelligence', 'music'];['turn', 'technology', 'opera', 'software', 'problems', 'music', 'solve', 'silicon', 'valley', 'ai', 'star', 'tech', 'wider', 'natural', 'solutions'];"
If you have ever dreamed of earning money from a stellar music career but were concerned you had little talent, don't let that put you off  - a man called Alex Mitchell might be able to help.
Mr Mitchell is the founder and boss of a website and app called Boomy, which helps its users create their own songs using artificial intelligence (AI) software that does most of the heavy lifting.
You choose from a number of genres, click on ""create song"", and the AI will compose one for you in less than 30 seconds. It swiftly picks the track's key, chords and melody. And from there you can then finesse your song. 
You can do things such as add or strip-out instruments, change the tempo, adjust the volumes, add echoes, make everything sound brighter or softer, and lay down some vocals.
California-based, Boomy, was launched at the end of 2018, and claims its users around the world have now created almost five million songs.
The Boomy website and app even allows people to submit their tracks to be listed on Spotify and other music streaming sites, and to earn money every time they get played.
While Boomy owns the copyright to each recording, and receives the funds in the first instance, the company says it passes on 80% of the streaming royalties to the person who created the song.
Mr Mitchell adds that more than 10,000 of its users have published over 100,000 songs in total on various streaming services.
""Eighty-five per cent of our users have never made music before,"" Mr Mitchell tells the BBC. ""And now we've got people who were paying their rent, and augmenting their income, with $100 (£74) or $200 a month from Boomy during Covid.""
But, how good are these Boomy created songs? It has to be said that they do sound very computer generated. You wouldn't mistake them for a group of people making music using real instruments.
However, using AI to help compose music isn't exactly new: US classical composer, David Cope, developed such a software system back in the 1980s, following some episodes of writer's block.
One day he set it up to write compositions similar to those by Johann Sebastian Bach. Mr Cope then popped out for a sandwich, and returned to find that the computer had composed 5,000 Bach-inspired chorales. These were later released on an album called Bach by Design.
More recently, in 2019, Berlin-based US electronic music composer, Holly Herndon, made an album called Proto in collaboration with an AI system called Spawn that she had co-created. Ms Herndon is an expert in this field, and has a doctorate in music and computing from Stanford University in the US. 
Mr Mitchell says that what has changed in recent years is that technological advancements in AI have meant song-writing software has become much cheaper.
So much so that Boomy is able to offer its basic membership package for free. Other AI song creator apps, such as Audoir's SAM, and Melobytes, are also free to use.
While AI composition inevitably grabs the headlines because of its novelty, new tech is continuing to change many other aspects of the wider music industry.
When the City and County of San Francisco imposed strict lockdowns back in 2020, Matthew Shilvock says that keeping an opera company going proved ""extremely challenging"".
He is general director of the San Francisco Opera, and it could no longer have ""two singers, or even a singer and pianist, in the same room"".
But when he tried running rehearsals with his performers online, ""traditional video conference platforms didn't work"", because of the latency, or delays in the audio and video. They were out of sync.
So, Mr Shilvock turned to a platform called Aloha that has been developed by Swedish music tech start-up Elk. It uses algorithms to reduce latencies.
Elk spokesman, Björn Ehler, claims that while video platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet have a latency of ""probably 500 to 600 milliseconds"", the Swedish firm has got this down to just 20.
Mr Shilvock says that, when working remotely, Aloha has ""allowed me to hear a singer breathe again"".
He adds that looking to wider tech to help solve problems is only natural for an opera house with Silicon Valley on its doorstep. ""The energy and the drive to find solutions through technology is just so much part of the DNA of this city.""
Meanwhile in Paris, Aurélia Azoulay-Guetta says that, as an amateur classical musician, she ""realised how painful it is to just carry, store, and travel with a lot of physical sheet music for rehearsals, and how much time we waste"".
So she and her fellow co-founder ""decided to junk our jobs"" and launch a start-up called Newzik, which allows music publishers and composers to digitally distribute their sheet music to orchestras.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that her solution replaces the stress of musicians having to turn physical, paper pages with their hands during performance or rehearsal. Instead, they now turn a turn a digital page via a connected pedal.
And if the arrangement of a concerto or other composition is tweaked - which can be done by using an electronic pen on the app screen - this will update on every orchestra member's copy of the electronic music sheets.
Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that this feature particularly helped when concerts finally resumed after lockdowns, because orchestras and ensembles faced last minute programme changes - for instance, if musicians were absent, self-isolating.
Other tech firms are focusing on helping musicians more effectively deal with their paperwork. One such company is Portuguese start-up Faniak.
Founder and chief executive, Nuno Moura Santos, describes its app as ""like a Google Drive on steroids"", allowing musicians - who are often freelancers -to more easily do their admin all in one place, ""so they can spend more time writing and playing music"".
Back at Boomy, Mr Mitchell is himself a classically-trained violinist. He says that the firm's users are now popping-up everywhere.
""We have Uber drivers creating albums and playing them during their drives,"" he says. ""And [last year] I woke up to a frantic call from my head of engineers, asking if we were under attack.
""There was tons of traffic from Turkey, and we don't have a Turkish version. It was just a YouTuber in Turkey, who did a video about Boomy, and [from that] we have tens of thousands of users there.""

199;Past seven years hottest on record - EU satellite data;2022-01-10T12:00:33.000Z;[];['climate change'];['data', 'eu', 'hottest', 'satellite', 'unprecedented', 'methane', 'record', 'seven', 'reach', 'rates', 'rate', 'remarked', 'scientists', 'past', 'parts'];"
The past seven years have been the hottest on record, according to new data from the EU's satellite system.
The Copernicus Climate Change Service said 2021 was the fifth-warmest year, with record-breaking heat in some regions.
And the amount of warming gases in our atmosphere continued to increase. 
Governments are committed to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C to curb climate change. But scientists warn that time is fast running out.
The environmental, human and economic costs of hotter temperatures are already being seen globally. 
Europe lived through its warmest summer, and temperature records in western US and Canada were broken by several degrees. Extreme wildfires in July and August burnt almost entire towns to the ground and killed hundreds. 
""These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,"" Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, explains.
The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.
Copernicus data showed that 2021 was the fifth-hottest on record, marginally warmer than 2015 and 2018. Taken together, the past seven years were the hottest seven years on record by a clear margin, the agency explained.
The 2021 average temperature was 1.1-1.2C above the pre-industrial level around 150 years ago.
It would be easy to dismiss the latest global temperature figure as a non-event. Who celebrates fifth place in anything? 
If we were in a film, these annual temperature updates would be the ominous drum beat signalling the plot is darkening. 
They measure out the pace of change in our world. The increments may be tiny - a fraction of a degree - but the direction of travel is inescapable.  
And make no mistake, the rhythm they mark out increasingly sets the pace for all our lives.  Think of the fires and floods that affected so many people in 2021.
And now look again at what the data is telling us: the seven hottest years ever recorded have been the last seven years.
We can't say we weren't warned. 
The agency said that the start of the year saw relatively low temperatures compared to recent years, but that by June monthly temperatures were at least among the warmest four recorded.
Places with above average temperatures included the west coast of US and Canada, north-east Canada and Greenland, large parts of north and central Africa, and the Middle East. 
The weather phenomenon known as La Niña - when surface sea temperatures are cooler - contributed to below-average temperatures in western and eastern Siberia, Alaska, and the central and eastern Pacific during the start and end of 2021.
Overall Europe's annual temperature was outside the ten warmest years on record but the summer was the hottest.
A heatwave swept through Mediterranean in July and August, particularly affecting Greece, Spain and Italy.
In Sicily, 48.8C degrees was reported, breaking Europe's record for highest temperature by 0.8C. 
The hot temperatures in the eastern and central Mediterranean was followed by intense wildfires particular in Turkey but also in Greece, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria.
And Europe also saw extreme wet weather, with huge floods devastating parts of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
These events were part of the same picture of weather systems disrupted by climate change.
The concentration in the earth's atmosphere of two gases that significantly contribute to climate change rose in 2021, said Copernicus. 
Carbon dioxide concentrations reached 414.3 parts per million last year, growing at a similar rate to 2020. 
This video can not be played
But scientists remarked that methane levels in the atmosphere increased to reach an unprecedented approximately 1,876 parts per billion. The growth rate of methane was also higher than in 2020 - Copernicus said both rates were very high compared to the past two decades of satellite data.
Scientist say it is important to reduce methane levels because it is more potent than CO2, however it lasts much less time in the Earth's atmosphere.
The increasing concentrations of these gases showed no signs of slowing down, concluded Vincent-Henri Peuch, Director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.
More data about 2021's temperatures will be released in the coming days from other agencies including from Nasa and the UK's Met Office.

Amateur photographers have been cataloguing the wealth of wildlife on a farm after the land was opened up to them by a nature-loving farmer.
Tom Clarke, who farms at Prickwillow in Cambridgeshire, has dedicated part of his land as natural habitat.
Members of Ely Photographic Club have captured striking images of deer, hare, owls and insects.
""I wanted to show that nature can thrive alongside commercial farming,"" Mr Clarke said.
He is one of a group of farmers who worked with the RSPB to set up the Ely Nature-Friendly Farming Zone with the aim of ""enhancing the environment within our farmed landscape"".
Last spring, Mr Clarke invited members of the local photography club to use his land as their canvas.
""Lots of them were travelling to north Norfolk because that's where they thought nature was,"" he said.
""But it's right here on their doorstep - and I wanted to record that.""
He was not surprised at the variety of animals and insects the group captured on his land.
""I see this stuff all the time, but I usually see nature's backside, running away, and I'm too busy in my tractor to stop and capture it on film.
""People's perception is that Fenland farmland is flat and boring and full of fields of crops - but nature is all around us.""
Mr Clarke and like-minded farmers have ""dedicated part of our farms and given it over to nature"", he said.
""The food, the shelter and the habitat is all here to encourage wildlife to thrive.""
The photography group is still using the farm for their wildlife photo shoots.

206;'Is this for real?' No escape for No 10 from party claims;2022-01-10T22:59:01.000Z;[];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson'];['office', 'party', 'kind', 'real', 'parties', 'odd', 'escape', 'justified', 'think', 'planned', 'ministers', 'prime', 'claims', 'outdoors'];"
""Is this for real?""
That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown.
Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form.
A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. 
""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time.
Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?""
Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance, a long table set out in the garden for drinks, crisps and sausage rolls with, two eyewitnesses told me, the prime minister and his wife in attendance. 
Notwithstanding how many of you might feel reading the details of that event, and the planning that went into it, there are three main reasons why this latest bout of claims about what was happening in Number 10 are deeply troubling for Mr Johnson.
First off, the email, a scoop for our colleagues at ITV, is evidence in black and white of a social event that was planned in advance.
That flies in the face of the prime minister's insistence so far that there were ""no parties"". Evidence of a planned event is not the same as ad hoc chats or the odd drink after hours outdoors or in the office in a Covid-secure environment - the kind of events some in government think could be justified.
With an official investigation under way by a senior and experienced official with a stringent reputation, that is troublesome.
Second, the prime minister could lose a senior official over what happened, and there has long been speculation about which moderately senior head might roll in the aftermath of the inquiry.
But if, as eyewitnesses have told us, Mr Johnson was there himself, he is personally right at the centre of the mess.
Third, for most of Monday the chatter among MPs and ministers getting back into the parliamentary routine was that the mood had calmed, the Tory anger at No 10's chaos had eased off after a liberal application of mince pies and eggnog.
Disillusionment with Downing Street was still extremely common but the heat, and with it the political pressure, had cooled somewhat.
But now, with this new damaging fodder for the opposition, don't be so sure.

208;The controversy of wood pellets as a green energy source;2022-01-11T00:01:20.000Z;[];['pollution', 'cop26', 'green economy', 'north carolina', 'climate change', 'environment', 'drax group'];['pellets', 'researches', 'trees', 'replanted', 'green', 'prof', 'short', 'controversy', 'wageningen', 'university', 'energy', 'source', 'netherlands', 'panel', 'wood'];"
This is the first of two Business of Technology articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as an energy source.
The areas in and around North Carolina's forests feel spacious. Canopies of lanky pine trees eventually give way to enormous car parks and long-term storage units, underscoring the feeling of vastness.
Many of these US trees are destined to be turned into small pellets for the biomass industry. At wood pellet mills, wood is chipped, dried, ground and compressed into uniform, easily storable pellets. They're then shipped mainly to the UK, where they're burned for energy.
Most forest land in North Carolina is privately owned, in holdings that can be as small as one acre (0.4ha). This can mean they are too small to qualify for conservation easements - agreements encouraging landowners to keep trees intact, sometimes with tax benefits.
Small forest owners here include a number of third-generation African Americans whose ancestors moved north and west as part of the Great Migration (the movement of six million African Americans between 1916-70 out of the rural southern US to the urban Northeast, Midwest and West) leaving the cropland to turn back into forest. 
""A lot of minority landowners are really disconnected from their land,"" says Freddie Davis III, a forester who leads the Rural Training and Research Center, which is part of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. 
Mr Davis believes that biomass is the best option on such low-value holdings for these owners - who typically live away from their forest land and often not even in the same state. ""I'm super passionate about it because it offers opportunity,"" he says.
Yet the racial justice aspect is complex. Sherri White-Williamson, who leads environmental justice policy for the North Carolina Conservation Network, works out of a cramped office in Clinton. The area has a large black population and is about 20 minutes away from a pellet mill. ""We've pretty much become the dumping ground for a lot of things for the sake of economic development,"" she says. 
While the wood pellet industry is an important local employer, Ms White-Williamson argues that the effects on water, air and noise mean that these companies aren't the best of neighbours. 
Volatile organic compounds from wood pellet manufacture, especially softwood like pine, are a problem because of the way they're converted into formaldehyde and other noxious substances, says Derb S Carter Junior, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center. 
Enviva, the world's main producer of wood pellets, counters that its plants are in compliance with air quality regulations. 
Biomass is controversial, not just locally for the affects on communities near pellet plants, but also globally for the unusual way that its carbon emissions are counted. Many argue that the current carbon accounting rules on wood pellets are not fit for purpose. 
They are accounted at the harvest site, such as in North Carolina, rather than the place where they are actually burnt, notably at the UK's Drax power station in Yorkshire. 
The reason for this is that because the trees are replanted, this form of energy is renewable. Decades ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed under the Kyoto Protocol that it would be simpler to account for the carbon emissions of land use only when harvested.
But these decisions have been not just scientific but political, says Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network: The negotiators mainly ""come out of the forest agencies of the various countries, have close ties to industry and work to advantage the interests of the forest industry,"" she argues.
""They have made the accounting seem so forbiddingly complicated and technical that higher level negotiators in the party delegations just leave it to them."" 
More technology of business:
Lawyer Derb Carter says the US now has a ""proliferation"" of wood pellet mills ""where - they're all for export, mostly to Europe - and essentially no utilisation of this material here in the US for energy production"".
In 2018-19, all of the wood pellets fed into the UK's Drax power station were imported. Mr Carter says for the EU, UK, and increasingly Japan and South Korea, this system is ""almost a free ticket in some ways"". 
The emissions from burning wood don't actually show up in these countries' emissions records, because of what he says are the ""perverse accounting"" rules on wood pellets' carbon emissions.
A growing number of scientists and policymakers understand that biomass is not an instantaneously carbon-neutral source of renewable energy. Mr Carter says it is a ""simplistic notion"" that trees are a renewable resource. Trees cut for biomass can take 30-100 years to fully grow back. Even if they store some carbon as they grow - the maximum amount of carbon dioxide is only absorbed by fully mature trees.
Drax defends it use of wood chips to make electricity.
""Biomass is a reliable, flexible renewable power source which is available regardless of what the weather does. It therefore has a vital role to play in the energy system, displacing coal and supporting the grid to further decarbonise, by enabling more renewables like wind and solar to come online,"" a spokesperson said.  
Wood pellet producer Enviva points out it is not sourcing from pristine forests, but managed forests which need to be thinned periodically to maintain good health, yet whose wood quality isn't high enough for higher-value markets like paper. 
According to Enviva, its wood pellet mix is made up of 20% sawmill residues, 14% thinning, and the remainder from harvest.
Kim Cesafsky, Enviva's director of sustainability, is adamant that ""we directly displace coal"". She calls fossil fuels ""a one-way street"", in contrast to biomass.
Yet biomass is actually even more polluting than coal. ""Burning wood for energy produces at least as much carbon dioxide as burning coal per unit of energy produced and usually more,"" Ms Putt explains.
Wood is less energy dense than coal, so ""you have to put more into burning it to get the amount of energy that you want - therefore you release, generally, more carbon dioxide,"" she says. 
Prof Gert-Jan Nabuurs, who researches forestry at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, is one of the coordinating lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He acknowledges that wood does not burn as efficiently as natural gas or coal ""and that is why for the same amount of energy, you are emitting more"". But he argues that ""this biomass for bioenergy is a short cycle"" as the trees are replanted.
Yet this idea runs contrary to proforestation - the principle of keeping forests intact - because as diverse forests are replaced with plantations of a single tree species, this makes them not only more vulnerable to disease but also generally less efficient at sequestering carbon. 
According to Ms Putt: ""Plantations are less carbon dense than are natural forests, generally speaking, and they get logged more frequently. So they have less opportunities to sequester carbon.""
The second story on wood pellets in this series will cover how power stations are using biomass to generate electricity and will be published on Friday 14th January.

209;Covid: Fact-checking the doctor who challenged the health secretary;2022-01-10T18:47:29.000Z;[];['long covid', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'reality check', 'vaccine passports', 'sajid javid'];['covid', 'suggest', 'health', 'factchecking', 'weight', 'spare', 'vaccine', 'secretary', 'spends', 'dr', 'challenged', 'told', 'doctor', 'wanted', 'viz', 'strong'];"
A video clip of an unvaccinated doctor challenging the health secretary over the government's plan to make NHS staff have a Covid jab - or risk losing their job - has been viewed more than a million times on social media. 
Making vaccination a condition of employment already applies to care-home staff and, from 1 April, is being extended to NHS workers - about 90% of whom are already vaccinated. 
Dr Steve James - a critical care consultant who has chosen not to be vaccinated - told Sajid Javid, during the health secretary's visit to King's College Hospital, ""the science isn't strong enough"" to support the policy.
""The vaccines are reducing transmission only for about eight weeks with Delta,"" he said.
""For Omicron, it's probably less.""
But that's not exactly what the evidence shows. 
While vaccines remain very good at protecting against becoming severely ill with Covid, the protection they give against catching it and passing it on does wane more quickly. 
Dr James was referring to a study that found a vaccinated person with Covid was just 2% less likely than an unvaccinated person to pass it on, 12 weeks after a second Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - he acknowledges his reference to ""eight weeks"" was an error. 
But the same study found the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which NHS staff are likely to have had, endured better. Vaccinated people had a 25% lower risk of infecting others than unvaccinated people after 12 weeks.
And this research alone doesn't tell the whole story - the vaccines also reduce people's risk to others by stopping them catching the virus in the first place.
One paper found those vaccinated with Pfizer 85% less likely than the unvaccinated to be infected with Covid after two weeks and 75% less likely after 12 weeks.
Vaccinated people also seem to clear the virus faster and have less of it in their system - reducing their chances of passing it on.
These studies all looked at the Delta variant, first identified in India. 
Two vaccine doses appear to be less effective against catching and passing on Omicron infections - although, they are still good at preventing severe illness - but much of the benefit is restored with a third booster jab. 
The second part of Dr James's argument was that he had probably had Covid, providing him with some protection without a vaccine.
""I've got antibodies,"" he said.
""I've been working on the Covid [intensive-care unit] since the beginning.""
So-called natural immunity - having immune cells such as antibodies and T-cells in your system that recognise and fight off the virus from an infection rather than a vaccine - can offer effective protection, although it comes with the risk of becoming very ill or developing ""long Covid"".
But what the doctor didn't mention is that, as with his point about vaccines, this protection also wanes and may be ineffective against infection with a different variant.  
An Imperial College London study suggests the protection from having had Covid against infection by the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, ""may be as low as 19%"".
The best protection against Covid comes from having an infection and being vaccinated too, several pieces of research have found.

Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics, at the University of Oxford, says doctors have a clear ethical duty to be vaccinated but sacking someone who is not but can show they have had a recent infection that may provide similar protection may be unjustifiable.
If the vaccines completely blocked transmission, it would be a much simpler question, he says.
But since they are less effective against new variants, it is ""no longer as clear"". 
Dr James says he is not against all Covid vaccination but feels he was framed as such online, after opposing compulsory jabs.
He describes himself as ""pro-choice and pro-vaccine"", saying his point was specifically about the science behind the mandate not the vaccine itself. 
But another NHS hospital doctor, Dr Meenal Viz, who spends her spare time online correcting misinformation, told BBC News she feared the clip of Dr James would be seized on by those who wanted to suggest the science for the vaccine in general was not strong enough - despite the huge weight of evidence from hundreds of independent institutions and millions of people that it prevented disease and death.
This fits into a pattern she regularly sees online, where short clips, single statistics or lines from a scientific study taken out of context can ""completely blow up"" and cause more confusion than straightforward falsehoods. 
""On the internet, when things go viral, people tend to cherry-pick what they want,"" Dr Viz said, potentially leaving people with the impression an intensive care doctor was doubting the science of the vaccine, rather than the much narrower and more complicated point Dr James says he was making. 
And her fears were not misplaced.
Dr James's comments were eagerly seized on by those against vaccination, including some promoting false theories such as the virus is a hoax. 
BBC News also found it referenced in more extreme encrypted chat groups, including one used to organise removals of sick patients from hospital against doctors' advice and coordinate the serving of bogus legal writs accusing doctors and teachers of crimes against humanity.
But Dr James stands by his comments: ""If people wish to polarise, they will do that,"" he says.

Labour and some Tory MPs are demanding immediate answers on whether Boris Johnson attended a drinks event in the Downing Street garden during lockdown.
In heated scenes in the Commons, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the PM ""can run, but can't hide"" from scrutiny over the May 2020 gathering.
And Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson must quit if found to have broken Covid rules.
The PM has declined to say whether he went to the drinks.
He will face MPs for what is likely to be a volatile session of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
On Monday, ITV published a leaked email from Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020 - when lockdown rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings.
The invitation encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". 
Witnesses have told the BBC the prime minister and his wife Carrie were among about 30 people who attended the drinks.
An inquiry - led by senior civil servant Sue Gray - is under way into this event and other gatherings that took place on government premises during 2020.
""We should get rid of him…. We should own the situation. We are the Tory party. We are not delivering good governance.""
That stinging verdict from a Conservative MP does not, at least not yet, seem to represent the consensus among the party's ranks on what to do about the current situation in Downing Street.
But the goodwill-to-all-men moment the Christmas holidays promised is very much over.
The subject of conversation among Tories on Tuesday was not the government's planned menu of policy fare for the week, but whether or not the moment had arrived when Boris Johnson, election-winner, had become Boris Johnson, discredited liability.

Standing in for Mr Johnson in the Commons on Tuesday, minister Michael Ellis said he expected Ms Gray's work to be ""swift"".
But he warned it could be ""paused"" if the Metropolitan Police - which says it is in contact with the government over reports of alleged breaches of Covid rules - decided to carry out its own investigation.
Mr Ellis added that it was not for him to ""pass judgement or to pass sentence"" before Ms Gray's findings were known.
But Labour MPs lined up to recount stories of constituents who had suffered during the pandemic and to accuse the government of hypocrisy.
Ms Rayner said it was disappointing that Mr Johnson was not there in person to respond, adding: ""But his absence speaks volumes, as do his smirks on the media.
""The public has already drawn its own conclusions. He can run, but he can't hide.""

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asked: ""Will the minister set out what he thinks should happen if a Conservative MP is found to have flouted and broken a Covid law?""
And DUP MP Jim Shannon was brought to tears when speaking of the death of his mother-in-law during the pandemic.
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Conservative MPs to ""force [the PM] from office"" if he did not ""do the decent thing"" and resign.
Few Tory MPs turned up in the Commons to support Mr Johnson, but one who did, Suzanne Webb, said: ""The time of the House is better spent at this moment in time, as we recover from this pandemic... debating how we can build back better and level up.""
But Scottish leader Douglas Ross told the BBC he felt ""fury"" over what had happened, adding that Mr Johnson should resign if he ""broke the law"".
""People gave up so much and they're now seeing at the exact same time, potentially, those at the top in No 10 were enjoying the weather and having a drink in the garden,"" he said.
""I can't answer the question 'was the prime minister there?' He can, and the public deserve that answer.""
Tory MP Nigel Mills told the BBC: ""The idea that during the worst lockdown - when you could only see one other person - that the people organising the rules were having a party is just unacceptable. It's indefensible.""
""I think if [Mr Johnson] knowingly attended what he knew to be party, then he can't survive that.""
Conservative former minister Johnny Mercer tweeted about the drinks gathering: ""It's humiliating, and does not reflect the majority of my colleagues who 'at least try' and lead by example.""
Another ex-minister told the BBC that Mr Johnson ""tries to lie his way out of everything"", while another said: ""Boris is finished.""
The PM's official spokesman refused to comment on claims surrounding the drinks event while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to attend Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, having missed last week's session because of a positive Covid test.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised for attending a party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, but said he believed ""implicitly that this was a work event"".
It is the latest in a number of alleged parties to have taken place under Covid restrictions, which are currently being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
An email, sent to as many as 100 people in Downing Street, invited them to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"".
The email, revealed by ITV News, was sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.
It is understood that about 30 people attended the event on 20 May 2020. Two eyewitnesses had already told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie there.
In his apology, Mr Johnson told MPs he went into the garden just after 18:00 to thank groups of staff and returned to his office 25 minutes later. He said that the event ""could be said to fall technically within the guidance"". 
Throughout the pandemic there has been a mixture of guidance and legal restrictions relating to behaviour likely to spread the virus. 
Legal restrictions are underpinned by sanctions - where breaking the law could result in prosecution. Guidance - unless it's also backed up in law - is not enforced by fines or court action, explains Stuart Nolan from the Law Society.
In terms of guidance:
When it came to workplace gatherings, the guidelines said: ""Workers should try to minimise all meetings and other gatherings in the workplace.""
The ""working safely during coronavirus"" guidelines also said only absolutely necessary participants should attend meetings and should maintain 2m separation throughout."" Generally, workers were told to ""reduce the number of people you spend time with in a work setting"". 
There is nothing in the guidelines that would suggest that drinking, socialising or other types of work event would have been allowed.
There were also a number of legal restrictions in place in May 2020:
People could not leave their homes - or be outside the place they live - without a reasonable excuse, which included work (where you couldn't work from home), exercise and getting things like food and medicine.
For people who broke these rules, the police in England could fine them £100 for the first offence which could then double for each further offence up to a maximum of £3,200.
It would be difficult to see how the Downing Street event would have been in line with these rules, argues barrister Adam Wagner.
""If you were doing something which wasn't necessary for work then you weren't outside of your house [with] a reasonable excuse and you were potentially committing a criminal offence.""
However, Mr Wagner added that as the prime minister and his wife live in Downing Street they would not have technically left their home to attend the party.
Mr Wagner is involved in a case to bring a judicial review against the Met Police for not investigating the alleged parties.
The law also banned gatherings in a public place of more than two people, unless they were all members of the same household or the gathering was ""essential for work purposes"". However, lawyers have noted that Downing Street is not a public place. 
The official gov.uk Twitter account posted this tweet on the same day as the Downing Street garden party.
A number of other gatherings are alleged to have taken place in Downing Street during 2020.
One was alleged to have taken place on 27 November - a leaving party for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Dominic Cummings.
At this point a national lockdown was in force and indoor gatherings with other households were not allowed (unless for work).
This lockdown ended on 2 December and England returned to the tier system of restrictions where there was a specific prohibition on organising an indoor gathering of more than 30 people.
When a Downing Street Christmas quiz took place on 15 December, London was under tier 2 restrictions. These rules banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes.
The same rule would have applied when a party - which was joked about in a leaked Downing Street press conference video - was alleged to have taken place on 18 December. At this point London had been moved to tougher tier 3 restrictions.
Furthermore, the government's guidance for the Christmas period specifically said: ""Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.""
This same line was also tweeted out by the official gov.uk account on 17 December 2020 in response to a question from a member of the public about whether Christmas parties were allowed in the workplace.
Allegations of Downing Street parties first surfaced in the Daily Mirror, when it reported in early December that a party had been held in Number 10 during the 2020 Christmas period.
In response, Mr Johnson told MPs that that ""all guidance was followed completely in No 10"". 
However, after the Downing Street press conference video was leaked - which appeared to confirm a Christmas party took place - Mr Johnson said he understood the public anger.
""It goes without saying that if rules were broken then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved,"" Mr Johnson said. 
Later, when details of the Downing Street quiz emerged, Mr Johnson said he ""certainly broke no rules"". Number 10 said that the prime minister ""briefly took part virtually"" to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. 
Two people pictured with Mr Johnson - wearing tinsel and a Santa hat - were members of his closer staff who had come in to help him with the technology, according to Downing Street.
Number 10 also insisted that no rules were broken when a photo emerged of the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden from 15 May. Mr Johnson said that the photo showed ""people at work"", which was allowed under the rules.

South African police have uprooted several cannabis plants growing near President Cyril Ramaphosa's office in Pretoria.
They belonged to activists from the indigenous Khoisan community, some of whom have camped in the area for three years. 
Their leader, who calls himself King Khoisan, clung on to a large cannabis plant as police dragged him away.
""Police... you have declared war,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as shouting.
""We have been here peacefully. We are coming for you,"" he continued.
He has since been arrested.
He and some fellow activists were detained for ""dealing in dagga [cannabis], illegal plantation and cultivation of dagga as well as failure to wear a face mask in public when ordered to do so by a police officer,"" a statement to AFP said. 
In 2018, the group set up camp on the green space outside the president's office, near a giant statue of Nelson Mandela, to campaign for the official recognition of their language.
King Khoisan's wife expressed anger about the incident in an interview with South Africa's IOL news site.
""I am very, very cross,"" Queen Cynthia said. ""The president don't want to come,"" to talk to them, she said. She told IOL the Khoisan people just want acknowledgement. 
People had been using the plants for medical reasons, such as cancer and high blood pressure, she continued. The cannabis had been planted in a vegetable garden.
The personal personal use of cannabis in private places was decriminalised in South African in 2018.
The Khoisan are South Africa's oldest inhabitants but now form a small minority in the country.

222;In pictures: British tank soldiers' final year in Germany;2022-01-12T00:23:18.000Z;[];['photography'];['queens', 'hussars', 'tank', 'regiment', 'mergers', 'established', 'royal', 'late', 'irish', 'stemmed', 'final', 'formed', 'germany', 'soldiers', 'british', 'pictures'];"
Nearly 75 years after the end of World War Two, the UK's last tank regiment in Germany, the Queen's Royal Hussars, returned home. 
British photographer Tobias Wilkinson spent a year documenting the daily life of the soldiers in their barracks and on manoeuvres, before they came back to the UK in 2019.
Nicknamed ""Churchill's Own"", the Queen's Royal Hussars is the most senior armoured regiment in the British Army and is equipped with dozens of main battle tanks. 
The regiment was formed in 1993 from the Queen's Own Hussars and the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, which both stemmed from the 1958 mergers of the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th Hussars, which were established in the late 17th Century. 
Before relocating to Tidworth, Wiltshire, the regiment had largely been based at Athlone Barracks in Sennelager, North Rhine-Westphalia, since 1998. 
The barracks have been mainly occupied by a series of British tank regiments since the end of World War Two.
""I have a home in Germany and became interested in the subject of the British Army's departure because it coincided with Brexit and increased Russian military posturing in Eastern Europe,"" says Mr Wilkinson, who is also a former soldier.
""Of the soldiers I photographed, there was a poignancy and nostalgia about being in the British Army in its closing moments in Germany,"" he adds.
""Many had enjoyed their experience of living in Europe, and whilst many were glad to be nearer their families in the UK, many who were more established were sad to be leaving.""
The Last Hussar exhibition is on at the National Army Museum in London from 19 January to 6 February 2022.

Boris Johnson is facing calls from senior Tories to stand down as prime minister after he admitted attending a drinks party during lockdown.
The PM apologised for the way he had handled the event in the Downing Street garden in 2020 and said he understood the public's ""rage"" over it. 
Cabinet members including deputy PM Dominic Raab rallied round Mr Johnson.
But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and senior backbenchers William Wragg and Caroline Nokes called on him to go.
Mr Ross, an MP and an MSP, said he had a ""difficult conversation"" with Mr Johnson after the PM's apology to MPs earlier on Wednesday.
He said he would write to the 1922 Committee - which organises Tory leadership contests - to register his lack of confidence in the PM.
""He is the prime minister, it is his government that put these rules in place, and he has to be held to account for his actions,"" he said.
If 54 backbench Conservative MPs send letters to the 1922 committee it will trigger a leadership challenge.
Ministers have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation into alleged Covid-rule breaking at Downing Street parties by senior civil servant Sue Gray, which they say will be published shortly.
But another backbencher William Wragg, who chairs an influential select committee, said the prime minister's position was ""untenable"".
""I don't think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.
And fellow Tory Caroline Nokes, who chairs another Commons committee, said the prime minister should resign now as he was ""damaging the entire Conservative brand"".
The former minister, who has previously been critical of Mr Johnson's leadership, told ITV's Robert Peston: ""Regretfully, he looks like a liability. 
""And I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years' time at a general election.""
The prime minister's admission and apology in the Commons likely bought him a little time.
A pause until the official inquiry into what parties did or didn't take place in Downing Street is published, in perhaps a week or so.
But for many on his own side, Boris Johnson has already lost the benefit of the doubt.
Growing numbers of his own MPs want him out, discussing frantically how and when his exit could take place.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson sought to calm anger about reports he had attended a ""bring your own booze"" party at the height of the first lockdown.
He admitted he was at the 20 May 2020 gathering for about 25 minutes, so that he could ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work. 
He said: ""I believed implicitly that this was a work event.""
But he added: ""With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside.
""I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that - even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance - there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's defence was ""so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public"" and he called on Mr Johnson ""to do the decent thing and resign"".
The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Tory MPs to force the PM out - and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said he had to go.
Sir Ed has written to the Metropolitan Police to ask them to investigate Mr Johnson's attendance at the 20 May party.

The PM's statement was met with a mixed reaction from Tory MPs, with some saying he had sounded genuinely contrite.
Dan Poulter, who also works as a psychiatrist, said: ""I am pleased that the prime minister has apologised, but it's not much consolation to those of us who cared for patients on the frontline of the NHS and saw them die of Covid"".
Dominic Raab said the PM had ""given a very clear account"" of what had happened and had apologised for the ""perception"" of rule breaking.
He said detailed claims about the 20 May party were being investigated by Sue Gray and the prime minister would update the Commons once she had finished her work. 
Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove also backed the PM at a meeting of the 1922 committee.
Speaking to the BBC before the meeting of Tory backbenchers, Mr Gove said it was ""right for the PM to apologise"" but it was also ""important we all wait for Sue Gray's report to conclude"".
Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has been visiting a pharmaceutical firm in the West Country, has not been available for interview. 
But on Wednesday evening, he tweeted that Mr Johnson was ""right to apologise"", and he supported the PM's call for ""patience"" whilst Ms Gray completed her investigation.

224;RAF man set to unleash Virgin Orbit space rocket over Pacific;2022-01-13T00:43:51.000Z;[];['richard branson', 'newquay', 'aerospace', 'space exploration', 'california'];['unleash', 'way', 'simulator', 'sending', 'raf', 'rocket', 'pacific', 'space', 'satellites', 'man', 'seat', 'virgin', 'set', 'stannys', 'right', 'orbit', 'told', 'upcoming'];"
RAF pilot Matthew Stannard will be at the controls of a jumbo jet on Thursday when it launches a rocket to space from out over the Pacific Ocean.
The airman is currently seconded to Sir Richard Branson's satellite launch company, Virgin Orbit, which will be attempting to loft seven spacecraft.
""Stanny"", as he's known, is more accustomed to firing missiles from Tornado and Typhoon fighter jets.
Unleashing a 21m (70ft) space booster will be a new experience.
""Stanny has been a wonderful addition to our team. As you'd expect given his background with the RAF, he brings a bright intellect, incredible attention to detail, and an excellent experience base, in addition to his world-class piloting skills,"" said Virgin Orbit chief operating officer Tony Gingiss. 
""Stanny's been deeply involved in all of our planning, and after flying on our previous mission and logging many hours in the simulator, he will be in the right seat for our upcoming 'Above the Clouds' flight, releasing our LauncherOne rocket at the right time, sending our customers' satellites on their way to orbit,"" the executive told BBC News.
The UK Ministry of Defence anticipates using Virgin Orbit to launch military satellites in the future, and is building a pool of experience in advance of this happening.
Thursday's mission will be the third overall for British entrepreneur Sir Richard's Long Beach, California-based company.
His 747-and-LauncherOne system has previously put up 19 satellites. The seven on the latest manifest includes one manufactured in Glasgow by Spire Global, which tracks weather conditions from orbit, along with ship and plane movements.
Flt Lt Stannard is scheduled to get matters under way at roughly 12:30 US West Coast time (20:30 GMT).
He'll fly out over the Pacific with the rocket tucked neatly under the left wing of the former Virgin Atlantic jumbo.
About an hour after take-off, at an altitude of 35,000ft (10km), the liquid-fuelled booster will be unlatched and go into a freefall.
Roughly four seconds later, as Flt Lt Stannard banks his 747 hard to the right, LauncherOne will ignite its first-stage engine to begin the climb to orbit.
Virgin Orbit wants to run six space missions this year, with two of these planned to operate out of Newquay Airport in Cornwall.
The first of these UK events could happen as early as June or July, although much will depend on how quickly licensing paperwork goes through the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA's paramount concern is safety and it won't let any launch proceed until it's satisfied all contingencies are covered. 
The CAA has 35 staff to assess the technical details of applications. A licence to operate a spaceport is expected to take six to 12 months to process; a licence to operate a rocket system will take longer at nine to 18 months.
The CAA told the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday that so far it was dealing with four formally submitted licensing applications (others from a range of potential spaceport/rocket operators are at a pre-application stage).
However, when asked whether this meant a UK launch was likely this year, the authority's policy director Tim Johnson refused to be drawn.
""We absolutely share the government's enthusiasm, and industry's enthusiasm, and commitment to this task. We're open for business, we're processing applications; the key driver of the timetable will be the quality of the applications (and) the evidence presented,"" he told MPs.
""We will exercise our duties in the most timely way possible.""

226;Berney Arms: The hamlet that has all but disappeared;2022-01-13T01:33:51.000Z;[];['sheila hutchinson books', 'berney marshes & breydon water -rspb', 'berney arms windmill'];['track', 'arms', 'pandemic', 'hamlet', 'saw', 'station', 'passenger', 'numbers', 'disappeared', 'berney', 'rise', 'upgrades', 'quietest', 'line'];"
The Norfolk hamlet of Berney Arms was once home to a small but thriving community of 11 families. Today, it lies empty but for an unused pub, an RSPB centre, a closed marsh mill and a railway station. What was it like to live there and what does its future hold?
""I would go back and live there tomorrow if I could,"" says Sheila Hutchinson.
She was raised in Berney Arms, a remote settlement sitting on the north bank of the River Yare near Great Yarmouth.
""At one time there were 11 families there,"" she says.
Livelihoods were eked out largely from the land itself, whether directly at the marsh mill or indirectly from grazing cattle.
The last lifelong residents to leave Berney Arms were Mrs Hutchinson's uncle Stanley Hewitt and his family.
They left in 1988 when their farmhouse was sold to the RSPB. 
""When we were growing up we had no running water, no electricity and a fireplace in the kitchen,"" says Mrs Hutchinson.
""People have asked me what it was like growing up like that. The answer is simple - we didn't know anything different.""
Drinking water used to come from the roof, through a pipe with a sock on the end acting as a filter and then into a tank.
With no trees or other buildings around, winter winds were ferociously cold, Mrs Hutchinson says.
Water left in a jug overnight would freeze and would have to be heated over a flame in the morning before it could be used.
""In the winter months the cold would go right through you,"" she says.
""But I don't remember ever being poorly or having a day off school,"" the 75-year-old says. ""We were hardy.""
To get to school each day she walked across nearly a mile of marshland before arriving at the railway station, and if caked in mud would she had a flannel and a towel to clean up before getting on the train to go to school in Great Yarmouth.
Author Mrs Hutchinson, who wrote Berney Arms Past and Present with her husband Paul, remembers the breath-taking views from her and her brother's bedrooms, which stretched out to Burgh Castle on one side and the railway station on the other.
Her family's story begins with her grandfather Henry Hewitt, who owned cattle and the farmhouse in Berney Arms. Her father looked after the cows and a living was made selling milk.
The community's primary links with the outside world centred on the railway station.
From the trains that stopped at Berney Arms came the post, the newspapers and - twice a week - the groceries.
""If you missed something off your grocery list,"" she says, ""that was it until the next delivery.""
Today, the station remains open. 
Gone is the post, the newspapers and the groceries - to be replaced primarily by people interested in seeing birdlife.
Mrs Hutchinson fears the way of life she was raised in has gone forever in Berney Arms. And she doubts such a community will ever again be formed there.
Asked if that makes her a little bit sad, she says, simply: ""Yes.""
Though if the pub, which closed in 2015, can be successfully brought back to life, she says, there is probably a living to be made from the growing number of visitors coming to explore Berney Arms.
Last year, the railway station at Berney Arms, which has seating for six people, saw the largest rise in passenger numbers of any stop in the UK.
Once the quietest station in the country, Berney Arms saw its passenger numbers rise eightfold from just 42 in 2019-2020 to 348 last year - though the increase is almost entirely explained by the pandemic and the fact the line was closed for much of the year for upgrades and the laying of new track.
The station, which is only accessible on foot, is a request stop on the line between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. It is surrounded by the RSPB's Berney Marshes and Breydon Water reserve.
Jonathan Denby, of Greater Anglia which runs the line, says Berney Arms' continued place on its network is assured.
""From an operational point of view, the rail network is there and is part of the fabric of the nation.
""It gives people the opportunity to do things both for work and also for pleasure.""
During the week and on Saturdays there are two trains from Norwich stopping at Berney Arms on their way to Great Yarmouth, but just one train which heads the other way. On Sundays, there are four trains running each way between Norwich and Great Yarmouth.
The line on which Berney Arms sits is important to Greater Anglia because of Great Yarmouth. When the summer months come, the Berney Arms route gives the operator a second railway line to ferry tourists into the popular coastal town.
""Having another route gives us flexibility,"" says Mr Denby. 
""Berney Arms is also a pretty simple station and is low maintenance for us and when you consider we've already had 800 people using it since April 2021 there is potential for growth there too.""
Leisure travel is the area of Greater Anglia's business which has seen the strongest resurgence since the pandemic started.
Mr Denby added: ""I think there's a good chance we will see an increase in passenger numbers at places like Berney Arms because people are increasingly enjoying going outside and into the countryside.""
Most of those who use the service to and from Berney Arms are walkers and birdwatchers.
The RSPB runs a reserve in the hamlet and it has recently benefitted from a major drainage scheme.
""You've got to be a special kind of person to come out here,"" says Ian Robinson, of the RSPB.
""But I think once you're out here, it has its own atmosphere - big skies, features like Berney windmill and just the fact that you're on your own, with your own thoughts and with wildlife and the landscape you see around you.""

Classic comedies and characters that have kept us laughing

228;The people using YouTube to pay for their French chateau;2022-01-13T00:11:11.000Z;[];['housing', 'france', 'youtube', 'housing market', 'life', 'lifestyle'];['wave', 'video', 'french', 'social', 'started', 'using', 'talking', 'pay', 'youtube', 'tv', 'renovation', 'sporadically', 'chateau'];"
Stephanie Jarvis credits YouTube with saving her vast French chateau.
She had bought the 40-room, 16th Century home back in 2005 after pooling resources with a friend.
Such French castles were relatively cheap at the time, so between them they were able to buy one for £590,000, raising the money by selling both of their two-bedroom London flats.
The plan was to turn the property - Chateau de Lalande, in the Centre-Val de Loire region of northern France - into a bed and breakfast, and hire it out for events.
However, Ms Jarvis admits that she didn't factor in just how expensive it would be to pay for the upkeep of such a huge, old building. ""I didn't realise how much money it would take to run,"" says the 50-year-old.
So, by the start of 2020, the chateau business had yet to make a profit. And then the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, and France went into lockdown.
""It was going to be the first year that we were in profit for the bed and breakfast, but everything had been cancelled,"" she says. ""I had no money coming in, and nothing to do.""
Then Ms Jarvis had a brain wave. Since 2018 she had been sporadically posting video blogs about her life at the castle up on social media platform, YouTube, under the channel name, The Chateau Diaries. She had started to do this after appearing in a TV renovation show, called Escape to the Chateau DIY, and found that she liked the experience of talking to the camera about her home.
With the pandemic shutting down everything else, Ms Jarvis decided that she'd now make and publish such videos on a daily basic ""and see how it goes"".
To her surprise, her YouTube channel soared in popularity, going up from 10,000 subscribers in 2019 to 173,000 today.
This meant that the money she made from the advertisements on her videos jumped from a few hundred euros to many thousands.
""It escalated so fast, it was unbelievable,"" she says. ""I think a lot of people were finding themselves in quarantine, and wanting to see how other people were living through it.""
""The channel also gives people this hope that maybe they don't need to follow a traditional path, and then can still make something happen with their lives.""
Ms Jarvis is now able to use the revenue from YouTube, along with the renewed income from the bed and breakfast, to pay four staff to work at the castle.
She also now gets additional funds from a Patreon account that she set up last year. Patreon is an online subscription platform that allows Ms Jarvis' subscribers to pay to view exclusive, extra video content. This is now said to make about £24,000 per month.
Another couple now making YouTube videos about life owning a French chateau are British designer Anna Mayrhofer and her Italian filmmaker husband Philipp.
They purchased their 18th Century Chateau Le Fleur, in Normandy, in 2019, using money from the sale of their Parisian apartment. Like Ms Jarvis, they also underestimated the total cost of the renovations that the property would need.
The couple started to post videos at the end of 2020, hoping it would serve as a marketing tool for when the pandemic ended and they could open their bed and breakfast.
Their YouTube channel - How To Renovate A Chateau (Without Killing Your Partner) - now has 133,000 subscribers, and brings in regular advertising revenue.
""It never occurred to us that this could become an income stream as important as the guesthouse,"" says Mr Mayrhofer.  ""But we get more and more advertising money, and it started to become almost like a salary.""
The couple also launched a Patreon account, which has more than 750 subscribers paying from about £4.50-17.50 per month. Mr Mayrhofer says he and Anna are now so busy making video content it might make more financial sense to slow down the guesthouse side of their business. 
""For now, we enjoy [making videos]. It encourages us, and it's fun to do,"" he says. 
Paris-based estate agent, Patrice Besse, specialises in selling chateaux dotted across France. He says that one in relatively good condition now costs between €800,000 ($900,000; £670,000) and €1,500,000. Cheaper properties require more restoration work, and therefore might end up costing more in the long term.
He cautions that buying a French chateau should not generally be seen as a way to make money. ""Any buyer knows that owning a chateau will not make you rich.""
Instead, he says that owning a chateau is a ""way of life"", and that many buyers care less about the return on their investment, and more about the emotional journey of restoring an old property and the dream of living in one.
Yet he adds that per square metre ""chateaux are the cheapest real estate in France"", especially when compared to the cost of a Parisian apartment. And demand has risen as a result of the pandemic meaning that people want to leave France's big cities.
Fellow estate agent Christophe Chassin adds that the price of French chateaux has increased since the start of the pandemic, due to high demand.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
""We made a lot of sales over the past 12 months,"" says Mr Chassin, who sells mostly to overseas clients from the UK, US, Australia and South America. ""And we are struggling to renew our portfolio of properties.""
One person who bought a French chateau from Mr Chassin over the past year is American, Julia Leach.
The 30-year-old was inspired to purchase one after becoming an avid viewer of Ms Jarvis' The Chateau Diaries while she lived in New York.
""The contrast was stark between the hustle and work culture I was immersed in, and the slower pace of life of Stephanie's videos pulled at my heart,"" says Ms Leach, who shared Jarvis' videos with her family in California. 
So in April 2021, Ms Leach, her partner, sister and their parents pooled their financial resources to buy the 12-bedroom, 13th-Century Chateau du Puy Vidal in Charente, southwest France, for €2.2m (£1.8m).
Ms Leach, who previously worked in film and television production, plans to turn the castle into a studio facility for filmmakers. And she naturally has also set up a YouTube channel - Lady of the Chateau Productions - which already has 13,000 subscribers.
Back at Chateau de Lalande, Ms Jarvis says she can spend 40-60 hours a week filming and editing videos. ""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" she says. ""I feel more tied to the chateau, but in a really positive way.""

229;MI5 warning over 'Chinese agent' in Parliament;2022-01-13T17:17:13.000Z;[];['mi5', 'china', 'uk parliament'];['warning', 'office', 'number', 'known', 'past', 'fully', 'security', 'agent', 'mi5', 'liaising', 'services', 'parliament', 'fund', 'chinese', 'researchers'];"
MI5 has issued a rare warning that an alleged Chinese agent has infiltrated Parliament to interfere in UK politics.
An alert from the security service said Christine Ching Kui Lee ""established links"" for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with current and aspiring MPs.
She then gave donations to politicians, with funding coming from foreign nationals in China and Hong Kong. 
It comes after a ""significant, long-running"" investigation by MI5, Whitehall sources told the BBC. 
One of the MPs funded by Ms Lee was Labour's Barry Gardiner, who received over £420,000 from her in five years - but he said he had always made the security services aware of the donations.  
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also received a £5,000 donation when he was energy secretary - but he said the money was accepted by his local association and it was ""the first time he has been given cause to be concerned"". 
Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was ""deeply concerning"" that someone ""who has knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party has targeted parliamentarians"".
But she said the UK has measures in place ""to identify foreign interference"".
The security service said anyone contacted by Ms Lee should be ""mindful of her affiliation"" and its ""remit to advance the CCP's agenda"".
Issuing an alert about an individual is an unusual move for MI5. 
It signals that their long-running investigation had led them to become sufficiently concerned that they felt they had to act now. 
We have heard about concerns over Russian influence in the past but China, British intelligence officials say, has now become their top priority.
The allegation here is interference - covertly gaining influence - and not espionage (stealing secrets).
And one concern from security officials is that there are not the laws in place to be able to tackle interference.
As a result, they sometimes believe that going public - as they have done in this case - is the best way of disrupting any ongoing risk.
Conservative MP and former party leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, brought up the alert in the Commons, confirming it had been emailed out to MPs by the Speaker.
He said it was ""a matter of grave concern"", calling for Ms Lee to be deported and demanding the government make a statement to the House.
Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood also called for a statement in the Commons, adding: ""This is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China.
""But the fact that it's happened to this Parliament, there must be a sense of urgency from this government.""
According to the alert, Ms Lee claimed her involvement with Parliament had been to ""represent the UK Chinese and increase diversity"".
But MI5 said that activity ""had been undertaken in covert coordination with the United Front Work Department [of the CCP], with funding provided by foreign nationals located in China and Hong Kong"".
The UFWD is alleged to be seeking to ""cultivate relations"" with ""influential figures"" to ensure the UK political landscape is favourable to the CCP and to challenge those that raise concerns about the party, including over human rights.
The security service said Ms Lee had ""extensive engagement with individuals across the UK political spectrum"", including the now disbanded All Party Parliamentary Group, called Chinese in Britain.
But they warned Ms Lee ""may aspire to establish APPGs [parliamentary groups] to further the CCP's agenda"".
Mr Gardiner began getting donations from Ms Lee's law firm, Christine Lee & Co, at the end of 2014. 
According to the register of MPs' interests, between then and 2020, he received over £420,000 in donations, mostly covering the costs of employing parliamentary researchers. 
Ms Lee's son was also understood to have volunteered for the Labour MP and was later employed as his diary manager.
In a statement, Mr Gardiner, who was a member of the shadow cabinet when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader, confirmed he had received the donations and that Ms Lee's son had worked for him.
But he said he had been ""liaising with our security services for a number of years"" about her and they had ""always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past"".
The Brent North MP said she had ""no role"" in who was appointed as his researchers and all donations were ""properly reported"", adding: ""I have been assured by the security services that whilst they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office.""
He also confirmed her son resigned from his post on Thursday, and that MI5 had no intelligence that showed he was aware of, or complicit in, his mother's actions.
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed also received £5,000 from Ms Lee when he was a minister in the coalition government. 
A spokesman for the party said Sir Ed was ""shocked by these revelations"", adding: ""The email from the Speaker of the House of Commons today was the first time he has been given cause to be concerned about a donation to his local party association received in 2013.
""The government must make it a national security priority to protect the UK's democracy from threats and interference by foreign actors.
""This donation was reported properly and all rules and guidance was followed - as Ed expects is the case with donations made to colleagues across the House.""

230;'Havana syndrome': US baffled after new cases in Europe;2022-01-13T17:05:20.000Z;[];['havana', 'russia', 'geneva', 'united states', 'paris', 'canada'];['syndrome', 'baffled', 'microwave', 'europe', 'havana', 'military', 'researched', 'russia', 'missions', 'moscow', 'weapons', 'used', 'cases', 'purposes', 'microwaves'];"
Four more US diplomats working in Geneva and Paris have fallen ill with a suspected neurological illness known as ""Havana syndrome"", US media report. 
Three diplomats became sick in the Swiss city and one in the French capital last summer, with some 200 people affected over five years.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the American government was working to get to the bottom of the mystery.
There are fears an adversary may have targeted diplomats with microwaves. 
Mr Blinken said the issue had been raised with Russia but no determination had been made. 
Havana syndrome first emerged in Cuba in 2016 and has affected US diplomats, spies, officials and family members, as well as a number of Canadian diplomatic staff deployed in Cuba. 
Some of the people who experienced the syndrome were left with dizziness and fatigue for months. 
The latest cases include one person who was evacuated from Switzerland to the US for treatment, media reports say.
Mr Blinken told MSNBC in an interview that he had met state department employees around the world who had described their illnesses and how their lives had been disrupted.
People, he said, had been ""directly and powerfully affected"".
""To date, we don't know exactly what's happened and we don't know exactly who is responsible,"" he told the broadcaster.
""We are working overtime across the entire government to get to the bottom of what happened, who's responsible,"" he said.
Russia, China and the US itself are all said to have researched microwaves for military purposes but  Moscow has dismissed accusations it used ""microwave weapons"" against US missions as ""fanciful hypotheses"".
A more innocent, but also unproven, theory is that those who got sick suffered from a mass condition brought on by some stressful underlying situation.

234;Secret audio sheds light on toppled dictator’s frantic last hours;2022-01-14T00:10:44.000Z;[];['tunisia'];['toppled', 'political', 'party', 'sheds', 'speakers', 'playing', 'light', 'secret', 'security', 'president', 'officials', 'hours', 'dictators', 'voiceimitator', 'audio', 'relevant', 'sought', 'frantic'];"
The BBC has obtained extraordinary recordings which we believe to be of phone calls made by a former Middle East dictator, Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, as he flew out of the country in 2011. These final moments show how his authority crumbled, sealing the fate of his 23-year dictatorship and sparking the region's wave of pro-democracy ""Arab Spring"" uprisings.
The recordings have been forensically analysed by audio experts who found no evidence of tampering or manipulation. Ben Ali died in exile in 2019, but the BBC has also played these recordings to people who know the individuals concerned, and they believe the voices to be genuine, further supporting the authenticity of the recordings. However some of the people concerned strongly dispute their veracity.
If genuine, the recordings give an incredible insight into the change in Ben Ali's mood in the last 48 hours of his regime, as he slowly begins to grasp the true impact of protests rocking his feared police state. 
The recordings - extracts of which are included below - begin on the evening of 13 January 2011. The first is a call to a close confidant, believed to be Tarak Ben Ammar, a successful media tycoon who is known for encouraging director George Lucas to film the first Star Wars movie in Tunisia. Earlier that day Ben Ali had made a televised speech to the nation, in an attempt to quash the momentum of mass demonstrations.
Widespread discontent at economic hardship and decades of autocratic rule and corruption had erupted weeks earlier after a young street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, set fire to himself when officials stopped him selling produce in the town of Sidi Bouzid. By 13 January about 100 people had died in the protests, which were now overwhelming the streets of the capital. 
But Ben Ali sounds reassured when Ben Ammar appears to lavish him with praise. 
""You were wonderful, this is the Ben Ali that we've been waiting for!"" says Ben Ammar in the recording. 
Ben Ali is self-deprecating, saying his speech lacked fluency, but his confidant reassures him. 
""Not at all… It's a historic comeback. You're a man of the people. You speak their language,"" his friend says. 
This video can not be played
Ben Ali laughs with what sounds like relief. But the speech made to the Tunisian public clearly isn't enough. The next day, protests intensify and threaten to overrun the Ministry of Interior. Arrangements are made for Ben Ali's family to get on a flight out of the country for their own safety - headed to Saudi Arabia - and Ben Ali is then persuaded to escort them, he says. 
The content and the timing of the next recordings place Ben Ali on this flight. 
He can be heard making a series of increasingly frantic calls to three people - believed to be his defence minister, the chief of the army, and a close confidant - Kamel Eltaief.
He begins by asking someone we understand to be Minister of Defence Ridha Grira about the situation on the ground back in Tunisia. Grira breaks it to him that an interim president is now in place. Ben Ali asks Grira to repeat this information three times, before responding that he will be back in the country ""in a few hours"". 
He then calls a man the BBC believes to be close confidant Kamel Eltaief. Ben Ali tells Eltaief that the defence minister has reassured him events are under control. 
This video can not be played
Eltaief bluntly corrects this assumption.
""No, no, no. The situation is changing rapidly and the army isn't enough,"" his friend tells him. 
Ben Ali interrupts him to ask: ""Do you advise me to come back now or not?"" He has to repeat the question three more times before Eltaief properly responds. 
""Things aren't good,"" Eltaief finally replies. 
Ben Ali then makes a call to who we believe to be the chief of the army, General Rachid Ammar. Ammar doesn't appear to recognise the voice on the end of the line. ""I'm the president,"" Ben Ali has to tell him.
Ammar reassures him that ""everything is ok"". Again, Ben Ali poses the same question he asked Eltaief - should he return to Tunisia now? Rachid tells him it would be better for him to ""wait a while"".
""When we see that you can come back, we'll let you know, Mr President,"" Ammar tells Ben Ali. 
He calls his defence minister once more, again asking if he should return home, and this time Grira is more forthright, telling Ben Ali that he ""cannot guarantee his safety"" if he does so. 
Just after midnight, President Ben Ali's plane lands in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He orders the pilot to prepare for his return trip, and he and his family are escorted to the King Faisal Palace Guest House. 
But the pilot disobeys the order. He abandons Ben Ali and flies back to Tunisia.
Waking in Saudi Arabia the next morning, Ben Ali rings his defence minister again. Grira admits the administration is not in control of what is happening on the streets. He tells Ben Ali that there is even talk of a coup. Ben Ali dismisses this as the action of ""Islamists"", before once more talking about returning home. 
This video can not be played
Grira now seems to attempt to level with his boss. 
""There's anger on the streets in a way that I cannot describe,"" Grira says. He seems keen to be clear with the president, adding: ""So that you cannot say that I misled you, and the decision is yours.""
Ben Ali tries to defend his reputation. ""What have I done to the street? I served it.""                        
""I'm giving you the situation, not an explanation"" Grira replies. 
Within hours a new government is formed in Tunisia - one in which many of the same ministers, including Grira, maintained their positions. Ben Ali was never to return to his homeland, remaining in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, until his death in 2019. 
Defence Minister Ridha Grira and Army Chief Rachid Ammar declined to comment on the recordings when contacted by the BBC. Ben Ali's confidants, Kamel Eltaief and Tarak Ben Ammar, denied that the calls with them had taken place, with Ben Ammar adding that he had not attempted to reassure the president about his rule. 
The BBC has spent more than a year undertaking research into the authenticity of the recordings. They have been analysed by a number of leading audio-forensic experts in the UK and the US who looked for signs of tampering or editing, or 'deep fake' processing which artificially replicates voices. No suggestion of any kind of manipulation could be found. 
The BBC also sought to confirm the identity of those on the calls by playing the relevant extracts to individuals who know at least one of the speakers that appear to be heard. Those consulted included three of Ben Ali's top security officials, leaders of his political party, and even a voice-imitator of the president.  
All of those approached could identify the speakers and did not raise concerns about authenticity. Other evidence also corroborates the background of these calls, including previous statements by Minister of Defence Grira and Army Chief Ammar that they had spoken to the president while he was on the plane, with Ammar's recollection closely matching the content of his call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The recordings suggest how an autocrat who oversaw a repressive and feared surveillance state for 23 years had been reduced to confusion and was at the mercy of his ministers' instructions in his final moments in power. In 2011, during his exile in Saudi Arabia, Ben Ali received a life sentence in absentia over the death of protesters during the revolution.

237;Downing Street apologises to Queen over lockdown parties;2022-01-14T16:48:33.000Z;[];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson', 'queen elizabeth ii'];['johnson', 'image', 'party', 'restrictions', 'apologises', 'lockdown', 'parties', 'downing', 'queen', 'street', 'told', 'attended', 'prime', 'work', 'staff'];"
Downing Street has apologised to Buckingham Palace for two staff parties in No 10 on the night before Prince Philip's funeral.
The gatherings, first reported by The Telegraph, took place on 16 April 2021 and went on until the early hours.
The PM's spokesman said it was ""deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning"".
Boris Johnson was not at either party - but he faces questions over alleged Covid rule-breaking at No 10.
The latest party revelations led to a backlash from opposition parties, who contrasted the behaviour of No 10 staff with pictures of the Queen sitting alone at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, due to Covid restrictions. 
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all calling for Mr Johnson to resign after he admitted attending a drinks party in the Downing Street garden during lockdown on 20 May 2020.
And Andrew Bridgen has become the fifth Conservative MP to publicly declare they have written to the chairman of the 1922 Committee - which organises Tory leadership contests - to say they have no confidence in the prime minister.
Fifty-four Conservative MPs have to write a letter to trigger a vote.
Meanwhile, the former head of the government's Covid taskforce has apologised for having leaving drinks in the Cabinet Office when she left the civil service on 17 December 2020.
Kate Josephs, who is now the chief executive of Sheffield City Council, said she was ""truly sorry"" for ""the anger that people will feel"".
In a statement on Friday, she added that the drinks event will also now form part of the ongoing investigation into gatherings in government.
Sources have confirmed that this was a separate event to a quiz held for the private office of Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, on the same evening. 
The two staff get-togethers for Downing Street staff on 16 April last year happened at a time when Covid restrictions banned indoor socialising.
They have also been added to the list of gatherings in government buildings being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
After No 10 apologised for the events, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This shows just how seriously Boris Johnson has degraded the office of prime minister.
""The Conservatives have let Britain down. An apology isn't the only thing the prime minister should be offering the Palace today. 
""Boris Johnson should do the decent thing and resign.""
At this point all Downing Street can do is apologise. 
The plan was to buy time waiting for Sue Gray's report but even that became untenable as Boris Johnson was forced to say sorry to the Commons and now to the Queen. 
The problem for the prime minister and his team is that they are not in control of this situation, they don't know what's coming next and can only react.
The absurd detail about filling a suitcase with wine in the latest leak has prompted a raft of memes mocking Mr Johnson and his staff. No politician wants to be the object of ridicule. 
For now it's clear they're trying to insulate the prime minister, pointing out that he was away when these latest antics took place. 
There's no sign his cabinet is plotting against him, but the danger hasn't passed. 
Government officials apologised to the Palace in a phone call.
Asked why No 10 had apologised rather than Boris Johnson himself, his spokesman told reporters: ""Well, again, the prime minister said earlier misjudgements have been made and it's right people apologise, as the PM did earlier this week.""
The spokesman says he could not prejudge Ms Gray's inquiry, but added: ""We acknowledge the significant public anger, it was regrettable this took place a time of national mourning.""
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on Mr Johnson to apologise personally to the Queen ""for the offence he's caused her and millions around the country mourning for loved ones"".
The two parties last April involved around 30 people in total, and are reported to have converged at some point in the Downing Street garden, where they continued past midnight. 
Staff were reportedly sent to a nearby shop with a suitcase, that was brought back ""filled with bottles of wine"".
They were both leaving parties: one for the PM's then director of communications, James Slack, and the other for one of the PM's personal photographers.
Mr Slack, who is now deputy editor of The Sun newspaper, has apologised for the ""anger and hurt"" caused by the party, and acknowledged it ""should not have happened at the time that it did"".
At the time, England was under ""step two"" restrictions that stipulated people could not socialise indoors, except with those from their household or support bubble. 
People could socialise outdoors in groups of up to six people or two households.

238;Space travel destroys red blood cells faster than on Earth;2022-01-14T16:11:57.000Z;[];['the marrow study: keeping bones healthy in space'];['red', 'cells', 'planets', 'nature', 'study', 'destroys', 'space', 'missions', 'blood', 'published', 'medicine', 'mean', 'need', 'marrow', 'earth', 'faster', 'travel'];"
Scientists have discovered more about why space travel makes astronauts anaemic when they return to Earth.
Canadian researchers say 50% more red blood cells are destroyed in space and this continues for however long the mission lasts.
As a result, long voyages to the Moon, Mars and beyond may be a challenge, they say.
But their insights could benefit bedridden patients on Earth with the same condition.
""Space anaemia"" is something scientists have known about since the very first missions returned to Earth - but exactly why it happens has been a mystery.
Now a small University of Ottawa study of 14 astronauts - including Britain's Tim Peake - on six-month stays at the International Space Station, has found out more.
Using blood and breath samples taken during their missions, the researchers were able to measure red blood cell loss. These cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body - and are the key to life.
""Our study shows that upon arriving in space, more red blood cells are destroyed, and this continues for the entire duration of the astronaut's mission,"" said Dr Guy Trudel, lead researcher and hospital physician.
While in space, because of weightlessness, this isn't an issue - but back on Earth it means astronauts have reduced bone mass and muscle strength, and feel very tired.
Three million red blood cells are destroyed per second in space, compared to two million on terra firma. Fortunately, the body can compensate. If it didn't, astronauts would become very ill in space.
But the researchers are not sure how long the body can be in this constant state of repairing itself, especially if it's in space for a lengthy mission.
Even when astronauts in the study returned to living with gravity there was no quick fix, and a year later they were still found to be losing red blood cells at a higher rate.
Despite this, they were able to function normally. Male and female astronauts were equally affected.
""If we can find out exactly what's causing this anaemia, then there is a potential to treat it or prevent it, both for astronauts and for patients here on Earth,"" said Dr. Trudel.
He sees the anaemia caused by space travel as being ""similar"" to that experienced by patients who've spent months inactive in intensive care with illnesses like Covid.
Anaemia also prevents them exercising and recovering, and his team will research how this mechanism works in future studies.
The findings of the Marrow study, published in Nature Medicine, may mean people who take part in space missions to far-off planets would need to adapt their diets to make more iron, as well as eat more calories for energy.
Screening astronauts and space tourists for blood or health conditions affected by anaemia before spaceflight might also be necessary, the researchers say.

The former chairman and chief executive of supermarket chain Sainsbury's, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, has died aged 94, the company has announced.
During his 40-year career with the firm he covered several roles, becoming a director in 1958 before being promoted to lead the business in 1969. 
Lord Sainsbury retired from the company in 1992, becoming its life president.
Sainsbury's current CEO Simon Roberts described him as ""one of the great retailers of his time"". 
John Sainsbury started working in his family's business in 1950, initially taking on a role in the grocery department. 
In 1980 he was knighted by the Queen for services to the food retailing industry and retired from his role as chief executive and chairman in 1992. 
Martin Scicluna, chairman of Sainsbury's, said he would be ""greatly missed"" by all his friends and colleagues. 
Mr Roberts said Lord Sainsbury was ""a shopkeeper to his core"" and ""was ambitious for the company and led Sainsbury's through an unprecedented period of growth; he was a truly inspirational man"".

243;How a colossal block of ice became an obsession;2022-01-15T02:03:48.000Z;[];['earth science', 'antarctic', 'icebergs', 'climate change'];['produce', 'way', 'thats', 'things', 'obsession', 'slow', 'colossal', 'kevin', 'little', 'taking', 'work', 'ice', 'sort', 'block'];"
Did you develop an obsession during lockdown? Did those long weeks and months take you down surprising avenues? Where did your mind wander? 
The Swiss-based British artist Kevin Eason found himself thinking about Antarctica and one particularly large chunk of ice. He'd read an article, by me as it happens, about a 300-billion-tonne iceberg that had recently calved from the east of the continent. D28, it's called; although that's not its only name as I'll explain. 
Kevin's interest was piqued by the satellite images that scientists began publishing of this berg, along with the sometimes surprising colours they would choose to render scenes and emphasise contrast. 
""It started out quite small. Just little studies,"" the artist recalls. 
""I found myself taking images that I'd see of D28, dropping them into Photoshop, and making colour samples. I was basically making pantones from Antarctica based on images that were being circulated around the internet.
""I spent weeks mixing the paint to match these colours. I guess it was a form of meditation. And then I was bound to the studio, and so it just started developing into something.""
That something is a series of four oil paintings depicting the life of D28. The first picture captures the definitive and distinctive outline of the berg in the days immediately after it broke from the edge of Antarctica's Amery Ice Shelf. The ones that follow are from Kevin's imagination. 
The series marks the years 2019, 2021, 2023, and 2025. We don't know when that final, speculative view will occur, but it will happen eventually. Icebergs are born to wither and melt away.
Those people who've seen the series have had various reactions, but some of the themes are common. You won't be surprised to learn that when asked to describe an emotion or feeling, the words that viewers used included ""transformation"", ""scale"", ""time"", ""isolation"", ""drifting"", ""silence"", ""change"",  ""awareness"", and ""loss"".
And, quite naturally, Kevin's D28 journey has brought environmental issues - and the loss of ice - to the forefront of his mind. Being in Switzerland, this is a very topical concern. Alpine glaciers are retreating rapidly in our warming climate, prompting local people to blanket the ice streams in Summer to try to protect them. 
""If I can produce a work of art that might have some sort of impact, or assist in some way; that might help slow down consumption or make people consider things a little bit more by taking fewer flights, or driving their cars less - that's got to be a good way to go,"" says Kevin.
My own interest in D28 goes back to the mid-2000s, long before it calved. At that time I was reporting research on the Amery Ice Shelf that sought to predict which part of this vast, floating wedge of ice might break first, and when. 
Attention had focused on an area that became nicknamed ""Loose Tooth"" because it looked in satellite images like a child's wobbly front tooth. 
The team studying the cracks developing in the ice shelf thought a calving might be imminent. It wasn't. Loose Tooth is still there, still wobbling, still hanging on to the Amery. It was the adjacent, 1,636-sq-km section that came away - the big berg now formally designated D28 (the largest Antarctic bergs are given an official listing by the US National Ice Center).
I joked with the Amery research team, led by Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, that perhaps another dental analogy was needed. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Helen laughed. And the nickname stuck.
People regularly now post satellite pictures of ""Molar Berg"", aka D28, as it bumps and grinds its way around the Antarctic coast. Even astronauts on the space station can see it, albeit from an oblique angle.
A keen observer is Dr Catherine Walker from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As a graduate student in the 2000s, she was tasked with studying those cracks in the Amery Ice Shelf.
""It was actually sort of sad to see it go, because it was something that I'd had all this time, and then it was gone,"" Catherine tells me.
""I really appreciate Kevin's paintings. I feel like that's my entire career right there.""
There's a growing appreciation of these city-sized bergs (Molar Berg was bigger than Greater London when it broke away). 
They dump huge quantities of fresh water into the wider ocean, along with iron and other minerals scraped off the Antarctic landmass. This influences the behaviour of local currents and food webs. 
D28/Molar Berg's travels have taken it a full quarter turn around the White Continent. It's now entered the Weddell Sea which is directly south of the Atlantic Ocean.
And it just so happens that it's moving in the direction of what is currently the world's biggest iceberg - a near-4,000-sq-km monster known as A23, which has been pinned fast to the Weddell seafloor for three decades. 
""Yep, that's one of mine, too,"" says Catherine. ""I always watch A23 because we're the same age. It calved in 1986 and it's started to wiggle recently.
""What's the fascination with these giant icebergs? I guess it has something to do with their size; they're so much bigger than you can imagine - like Everest or K2. You look at them and wonder: how do they hold themselves together.""
I think that's right. Their great scale is truly awesome. But for me it's also the way such imposing objects, built from snows that originally fell on Antarctica thousands of years ago, and which seem as though they ought to be so permanent, can suddenly disintegrate and fade away in a very short time.

244;Tsunami warning in Tonga after giant eruption;2022-01-15T08:57:28.000Z;[];['volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga', 'new zealand'];['question', 'tsunami', 'warning', 'website', 'reading', 'mobile', 'visit', 'tonga', 'version', 'submission', 'eruption', 'giant', 'need', 'submit', 'page'];"
Tsunami warnings have been issued in several countries including Tonga, Fiji, and New Zealand, after a giant underwater volcano eruption.
Social media footage from Tonga showed waves washing through a church and several homes. Witnesses said ash is falling over the capital, Nuku'alofa.
Residents there have been urged to move to higher ground.
It is the latest in a series of eruptions of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano. 
The eight-minute eruption was so violent it could be heard as ""loud thunder sounds"" in Fiji, more than 800km (500 miles) away, officials in the capital Suva said. 
The plumes of gas, smoke and ash pouring from the volcano reached 20km (12 miles) into the sky, said Tonga Geological Services.
Tonga's capital lies just 65km north of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai. A 1.2m tsunami wave was observed there, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.
In New Zealand, which is more than 2,300km away, officials have warned of storm surges from the eruption.
The National Emergency Management Agency said parts of the country could see ""strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore"".
Local forecaster Weather Watch tweeted: ""The energy release is simply astonishing"", adding: ""Reports of people hearing the sonic booms across New Zealand.""

245;Endemic Covid: Is the pandemic entering its endgame?;2022-01-15T01:47:56.000Z;[];['medical research', 'coronavirus lockdown measures', 'vaccination', 'james gallagher', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['covid', 'world', 'pandemic', 'vaccines', 'prof', 'vulnerable', 'endgame', 'entering', 'endemic', 'virus', 'uk', 'die'];"
Who hasn't let out an exasperated ""Is the pandemic finished yet?"" or a ""When can I just get on with my life?"" over the past two years? I know I have. 
The answer to those questions could be... very soon. 
There is growing confidence that Omicron could be hurtling the UK into the pandemic endgame. 
But what comes next? There will be no snap of the fingers to make the virus disappear. Instead, the new buzzword we'll have to get used to is ""endemic"" - which means that Covid is, without doubt, here to stay. 
So, is a new Covid-era truly imminent and what will that actually mean for our lives?
""We're almost there, it is now the beginning of the end, at least in the UK,"" Prof Julian Hiscox, chairman in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, tells me. ""I think life in 2022 will be almost back to before the pandemic.""
What's changing is our immunity. The new coronavirus first emerged two years ago in Wuhan, China, and we were vulnerable. It was a completely new virus that our immune systems had not experienced before and we had no drugs or vaccines to help. 
The result was like taking a flamethrower into a fireworks factory. Covid spread explosively around the world - but that fire cannot burn at such high intensity forever.  
There were two options - either we would extinguish Covid, as we did with Ebola in West Africa, or it would die down but be with us for the long term. It would join the swarm of endemic diseases - such as common colds, HIV, measles, malaria and tuberculosis - that are always there. 
For many, this was the inevitable fate of a virus that spreads through the air before you even know you're sick. ""Endemicity was written into this virus,"" says Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a virologist at St George's, University of London. 
""I am very optimistic,"" she says. ""We'll soon be in a situation where the virus is circulating, we will take care of people at risk, but for anybody else we accept they will catch it - and your average person will be fine.""
Epidemiologists, who study the spread of diseases, would consider a disease endemic when levels are consistent and predictable - unlike the ""boom and bust"" waves so far in the pandemic. 
But Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, says other people are using it to mean Covid is still around, but that we no longer need to restrict our lives. 
She thinks we'll get there ""rapidly"", adding: ""It seems like it's taken a long time, but only a year ago we started vaccinating and we're already an awful lot freer because of that.""
The only major curve ball would be a new variant that can outcompete Omicron and cause significantly more severe disease.
It is important to remember that endemic does not automatically mean mild. ""We have some huge killer diseases that we consider endemic,"" says Prof Ghani. Smallpox was endemic for thousands of years and killed a third of people who were infected. Malaria is endemic and causes around 600,000 deaths a year.
But we are already seeing the signs that Covid is becoming less deadly as our bodies become more familiar with fighting it. 
In the UK there has been a vaccination campaign, a booster campaign and waves of Covid involving four different variants of the virus.
""When Omicron has finished and moved through, immunity in the UK will be high, at least for a while,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.
The high level of infections has come at a price, with more than 150,000 deaths in the UK. But it has left a protective legacy in our immune systems. That immunity will wane so we should expect to catch Covid in the future, but it should still reduce the chances of becoming seriously ill. 
Prof Hiscox - who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group - says that means most people won't be badly affected.
""Should a new variant or old variant come along, for most of us, like any other common cold coronavirus, we'll get the sniffles and a bit of a headache and then we're OK.""
There will be people - mostly the old and vulnerable - who will die from endemic Covid. So there is still a decision to be made about how we live alongside it.
""If you're willing to tolerate zero deaths from Covid, then we're facing a whole raft of restrictions and it's not game over,"" Prof Hiscox explains.
But, he says, ""In a bad flu season, 200-300 die a day over winter and nobody wears a mask or socially distances, that's perhaps a right line to draw in the sand.""
Lockdowns and restrictions on mass gatherings will not come back and mass testing for Covid will end this year, he expects. 
The near certainty is there will be booster vaccines for the vulnerable come the autumn in order to top up their protection through winter. 
""We need to accept the fact that our flu season is also going to be a coronavirus season, and that is going to be a challenge for us,"" says Dr Groppelli. 
However, it is still uncertain how bad winters will be as the people who die from flu and Covid tend to be the same. As one scientist put it, ""You can't die twice.""
Prof Riley thinks we won't be compelled to wear face masks after Omicron, but they will become ""a much more common sight"" as they are in parts of Asia as people choose to wear them in crowded places. 
She adds: ""The likely scenario is life won't look much different to the autumn of 2019, when we all turned up for our flu vaccines.""
While the UK is ahead of most of the world due to a combination of vaccines and a large number of infections, the planet is not remotely close to seeing the end of the pandemic. 
Poorer countries are still waiting for vaccines to give to their most vulnerable people. Meanwhile countries that kept Covid at arms' length have had very few deaths, but also have less immunity in their populations. 
The World Health Organization has been clear the world is a long way off describing Covid as endemic. 
""For the world it is still a pandemic and an acute emergency,"" Dr Groppelli concludes.

Police in the US state of Texas are negotiating with a man who appears to have taken at least four hostages at a synagogue in the town of Colleyville. 
It is not known if he is armed or if anyone has been hurt. 
The service was being streamed live when the incident started. The feed has since been taken down, but not before an angry man could be heard saying he did not want anyone to be hurt. 
Police deployed special weapons teams and local people were evacuated.
At least four hostages - including the rabbi - are believed to be inside the synagogue, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
President Joe Biden ""has been briefed about the developing hostage situation in the Dallas area"", White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.
The police department in Colleyville said in a tweet at 11:30 (16:30 GMT) that it was ""conducting SWAT operations"" at the address of the Congregation Beth Israel.
Two hours later the department said the situation remained ""ongoing"".
""We ask that you continue to avoid the area. We will continue to provide updates via social media,"" it said.
A live stream of the Shabbat morning service on Facebook captured audio of a man talking loudly.
He could be heard saying, ""You get my sister on the phone"" and ""I am gonna die"".
He was also heard saying: ""There's something wrong with America.""
Barry Klompus, a member of the congregation since it opened in 1999, said he had been told about the incident by another member and had quickly turned to the live feed until it was pulled.
""It was horrible listening and watching, and it's that much more horrible not knowing,"" Mr Klompus told Reuters news agency.

Nino Cerruti - one of the great Italian designers and fashion entrepreneurs - has died aged 91. 
Reports say he passed away in hospital in Piedmont where he had checked in for a hip operation. 
He always insisted on trying on his own creations first. Many of them were kept at the textile factory his grandfather founded in the town of Biella in 1881.
""I have always dressed the same person, myself,"" he once said, according to AFP news agency.
With his experience in producing excellent fabrics at his family's textile mill, Cerruti went into the clothing business in the late 1950s. 
He opened his first boutique in Paris in 1967. 
When he asked male and female models to walk down the catwalk in the same clothes, he revolutionised fashion, AFP notes.
In the '80s, he branched out into Hollywood, designing clothes for stars including Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks.

A hostage taker who detained four people at a synagogue in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, was a British citizen, reports say. 
The man interrupted a morning service in Colleyville on Saturday and has since died. 
Police deployed special weapons teams, while FBI negotiators spent hours talking to the assailant.
Explosions and gunfire could be heard before the ten-hour stand-off ended. The hostages have been freed unharmed.  
In a statement, the UK Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British man in Texas and was in contact with the local authorities. It is not yet clear how the hostage-taker died or who he was.
The four people taken hostage included the synagogue's rabbi, according to US media reports.
The service was being streamed online when the incident began. One of the hostages was released unharmed six hours later, with the other three being led to safety by police several hours after that.
President Joe Biden was briefed about the developing situation.
The incident began at around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) when police were called to the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue. People were evacuated from the area shortly after.
A live stream of the Shabbat morning service on Facebook captured audio of a man talking loudly. He could be heard saying: ""You get my sister on the phone"" and ""I am gonna die"".
He was also heard saying: ""There's something wrong with America."" The feed has since been taken down.
The hostage-taker was also heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who is currently serving an 86-year prison term in the US, law enforcement officials told local media. 
Siddiqui was convicted of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan. She has since become an icon among many Islamist terrorists. 
Thousands took to the streets in Pakistan to protest her conviction in 2010.
After the Islamic State (IS) group kidnapped American journalist James Foley in Syria in 2012, they emailed his family demanding the release of Siddiqui. 
Victoria Francis told the Associated Press that she heard the man rant against America and claim he had a bomb during the live stream. ""He was pretty irritated and the more irritated he got, he'd make more threats,"" she said.

258;Marmite-owner Unilever makes three bids for GSK consumer goods arm;2022-01-15T17:10:48.000Z;[];['companies', 'unilever', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'glaxosmithkline'];['goods', 'reductions', 'walmsley', 'unilever', 'uks', 'gsk', 'arm', 'valuable', 'bids', 'radical', 'makes', 'shareholders', 'marmiteowner', 'say', 'thats', 'shareholder', 'consumer', 'greater'];"
GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth £50bn.
GSK said the proposals ""fundamentally failed"" to reflect the value of the division.
With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands.
Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms.
GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares.
The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. 
The firm has come under pressure from investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine. 
Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm ""would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio"". 
The consumer goods giant, which became a fully British company in 2020 after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. 
Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.  
GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right. 
Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around £50bn. However, that does not include a few important things. 
First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about £10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business. 
Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable. 
Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business.
She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business. 
Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. 
The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever. 
But Unilever's intentions are very clear. 
The ""for sale"" sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout. 
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins. 
""Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope. He wants to be seen to do something,"" Mr Mould said.
""But this is a high risk deal. Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits.""
The move was first reported in the Sunday Times.
GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders.
Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached £9.6bn in 2021.
Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum.
The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi.

259;Pacific volcano: Body of British woman found in Tonga, says brother;2022-01-17T14:28:37.000Z;[];['volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga', 'brighton', 'brits abroad'];['volcano', 'brother', 'tongas', 'tongahunga', 'north', 'miles', 'body', 'lived', 'known', 'pacific', 'nukualofa', 'tonga', 'hunga', 'british', 'haʻapai', 'woman'];"
The body of a British woman swept away by the tsunami in Tonga has been found, her brother says.  
Nick Eleini told broadcasters the family was ""devastated"" after Angela Glover died trying to rescue her dogs.
He said he understands her body was found by her husband James, who managed to cling to a tree when the wave hit, following the eruption of a volcano.
""Angela and James loved their life in Tonga and adored the Tongan people,"" Mr Eleini said.
It is the first known death of the disaster, caused by the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano on Saturday, about 40 miles (65km) north of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa, where the Glovers lived.
Communications to Tonga have been badly damaged, making it hard to establish the scale of the destruction.
Speaking outside their mother's home in Hove, Mr Eleini said that Brighton-born Angela, 50, had been living in Tonga since getting married to James. 
He said they had become ""well-loved by locals and ex-pats alike"", as he ran a tattoo parlour called the Happy Sailor, employing and training Tongans, while she founded the Tongan Animal Welfare Society.
Angela had ""a deep love of dogs"" and her organisation sheltered and rehabilitated stray animals before trying to find homes for them, Mr Eleini said.
""Angela and James loved their life in Tonga and adored the Tongan people. In particular, they loved the Tongan love of family and Tongan culture,"" he said.
""From a little girl it was always Angela's dream to swim with whales and it was Tonga that allowed her to fulfil these dreams.""

260;How delivery apps created 'the Netflix of food ordering';2022-01-17T00:06:23.000Z;[];['female entrepreneurs', 'takeaway food', 'entrepreneurship', 'food', 'delivery services'];['uzundag', 'yonca', 'ms', 'days', 'netflix', 'wedding', 'week', 'apps', 'recently', 'delivery', 'food', 'fourth', 'created', 'ordering', 'recipes', 'work'];"
Husband and wife, Emre Uzundag and Yonca Cubuk, say they are now ""living their small dream"", all thanks to a food delivery app.
The Turkish couple moved to New York in 2020, and due to coronavirus they found themselves stuck in their small apartment in Brooklyn.
Homesick, they started to cook more and more Turkish food, to help them cope with the stresses of lockdown. ""Which was a mental necessity during the pandemic,"" says Ms Cubuk.
They then moved on to cooking meals for friends around the city, and Ms Cubuk says the feedback was incredibly positive. 
""They started to tell us that we should turn it into a career.""
Despite neither of the pair having worked as a professional chef before, last year they decided to take the plunge, and signed their business up to a new food delivery app called Woodspoon.
While the huge market-leading delivery apps, such as Just Eat, Deliveroo, Uber Eats and DoorDash (the biggest in the US) now list many large restaurant chains, Woodspoon's business model is entirely different.
It was launched at the start of 2020 to link home cooks - people literally cooking from the kitchen in their house or apartment - to customers who want a fresh, homemade takeaway, rather than something from a chain restaurant.
You order via the Woodspoon app, which sends the details to the relevant home chef. Then, when the food has been cooked, it is picked up and delivered by a Woodspoon driver.
Although still only available in the Brooklyn borough of New York, with more than 120 cooks currently on its books, the plan is to expand. 
Emre Uzundag and Yonca Cubuk's BanBan Anatolian Home Cooking is now available via the app four days a week, while on the other three days they work on new recipes. Ms Cubik says that they are so busy that they recently had to work on their fourth wedding anniversary.
Yet, thanks to Woodspoon, they don't have to go to the expense of renting a commercial premise.
""Woodspoon gives us a platform and a voice to tell our story,"" she adds. ""And we are more than just kebabs and pilaf [a rice dish]... our best-selling dishes are the lentil soup and the orange spinach stew, both are vegetarian, the latter one is vegan.""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Woodspoon's co-founder, Lee Reschef, says that launching at the same time as the start of the pandemic actually proved to be helpful. ""We were fortunate enough to help a lot of restaurant workers that needed to find a new line of income,"" she says.
Before home chefs are accepted by Woodspoon they have to show proof of food safety training, and the company sends someone out to carry out an inspection of their kitchen.
The chefs also have to register their business with the relevant local authority, and be subjected to official food hygiene tests.
While Woodspoon is currently focused on US expansion the concept could also work in the UK, where it is also legal to run a food business from a residential property.
With the pandemic closing restaurants for long periods of time, the past two years has been boom time for takeaway delivery apps. The UK's largest, Just Eat, saw its revenues hit £725m in 2020, up 42% from 2019, while those at DoorDash jumped more than threefold to $2.9bn (£2.1bn).
Yet, while many of us are increasingly using these types of apps, people often cite one frustration - that you cannot order from multiple restaurants at the same time, and get all the different dishes delivered together.
That is, however, now changing, with a small but growing number of apps starting to offer that service.
One of those at the forefront is US app, Go By Citizens, which is run by restaurant and takeaway group C3. It allows its customers to order from a number of its brands at the same time, such as Umami Burger, Krispy Rice, Cicci di Carne, and Sam's Crispy Chicken.
To ensure that the food is all cooked and ready for delivery at the same time, C3 says it operates 800 so-called ""dark"" or ""ghost"" kitchens across the US - warehouse cooking facilities that house a number of kitchens under the same roof, all making delivery-only meals.
""Our app allows consumers to pick, choose and group their favourite menu items [together] from an array of C3 brands in a single order,"" says C3 chief executive Sam Nazarian. He describes it as ""the Netflix of food ordering"".
In addition to C3 brands, the company is inviting other people's restaurants and food businesses into its ghost kitchens and tech platform, including California's Soom Soom Fresh Mediterranean and Florida's Cindy Lou's Cookies.
Meanwhile, US ghost kitchen business, Kitchen United, also now lets its customers order from a number of different restaurant brands at the same time, via its app Kitchen United Mix.
""Everything is delivered, or available for pick-up, at the same time and on the same bill,"" says Kitchen United, chief executive, Michael Montagano. ""So, if someone in the household wants sushi, but another wants pizza, that's entirely doable.""
Kitchen United Mix is available in 10 US locations, with another eight currently in development.
In the UK, Deliveroo also runs a number of dark kitchens, called Deliveroo Editions - where takeaway businesses are invited to set up shop rent free. However, a Deliveroo spokeswoman confirmed that, currently, the food from each offering still has to be ordered separately via its app.
Whether it's a focus on home cooks, or allowing customers to order from more than one restaurant at once, does the continuing growth of delivery apps put more pressure on physical restaurants and takeaways already struggling to stay afloat?
UK food and restaurant critic, Andy Hayler, says he thinks some people might find it off-putting that an app allows you to order food from two or more restaurants at once.
""If I saw a menu offering two to three different things, this would suggest to me this is just some generic catering company, which is banging out industrial foods,"" he says.
Mr Hayler adds that certain foods, such as curry are well suited for delivery. While others, such as French and Japanese cuisine, struggle in takeaway form because the dishes are supposed to be well presented on a restaurant plate, and not bashed about in transit in a plastic container.
""Half of the experience [of French and Japanese restaurants] is looking at the food there,"" he says.

261;Tonga eruption: How its impact spread so widely and violently;2022-01-17T16:52:05.000Z;[];['volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga', 'pacific ocean'];['wave', 'tsunami', 'pushing', 'spread', 'water', 'widely', 'ocean', 'impact', 'tonga', 'violently', 'surface', 'eruption', 'floor', 'say', 'pressure', 'experts'];"
A massive volcanic eruption in Tonga, on Saturday, triggered a tsunami that spread across the Pacific in a matter of hours.
Waves hit Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as the west coasts of North and South America.
An atmospheric shockwave was detected around the world and a huge ash cloud has covered Pacific islands for hundreds of miles.
Here's what we know about how and why it spread so widely and violently.
Tonga is made up of about 170 islands, many uninhabited, about 2,000 miles (3,300km) east of Australia.
The volcano, Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai, sits 40 miles north of the capital. 
On Saturday, the centre of the volcano sank, disappearing under the sea.  
About two hours later, it erupted, with devastating force. 
When the eruption had ended, almost all of the volcano and the land around it had disappeared.
The eruption set off a massive atmospheric shockwave travelling at about 300m (1,000ft) per second. 
Pressure changes were detected on the other side of the world, in Europe, 15 hours later.
The explosion was heard across the Pacific, from Fiji to Alaska.
Waves from the tsunami spread rapidly across the Pacific.
They took less than five hours to reach New Zealand, about 10 to reach Alaska.
Experts say the tsunami may have been caused by the collapse of debris on the ocean floor and boosted by the pressure wave pushing down on the surface of the water.
The waves continued through Sunday and were still being recorded in Australia on Monday.
Tsunami waves can be much more destructive than normal waves, even when they are not particularly high.
A normal wave might take 15 seconds to wash up the shore and flow back out.
Some of the tsunami waves in Australia were under 1m but lasted almost 30 minutes. 
They kept moving onshore for 15 minutes and took about 15 minutes to move back out. 
The exact reasons why this eruption was so violent are still being assessed by experts.
Some believe the speed with which the molten magma was blasted out of the volcano may have  played a big part.
When magma filled with volcanic gas is forced through sea water at high speed, there is no time for a layer of steam to cool it.
And this ""fuel-coolant interaction"" causes a massive chemical explosion, researchers say.
Deeper water could have suppressed this - but the volcano's surface was just 150-200m under the sea.
Communications with Tonga have been largely destroyed, making it difficult to assess the scale of the destruction. 
Internet and telephone communications are extremely limited and outlying coastal areas remain cut off.
The Red Cross said even satellite phones, used by many aid agencies, had poor service because of the ash cloud. 
The organisation estimates up to 80,000 people may have been affected by the tsunami.
The dust from the volcano could contaminate water supplies, with locals advised to drink bottled water and wear masks.
The government of New Zealand, which has been helping assess the destruction, says the western coast of Tongatapu, Tonga's main island, has seen ""significant damage"".

The remains of a four-year-old Belgian boy who disappeared last week have been found in the Netherlands, Dutch police have announced. 
Dean Verberckmoes was reported missing by his family after his babysitter failed to drop him off at his grandparents' house. 
On Monday police discovered his body on an artificial island in Holland's Zeeland province.
Dutch police announced they had detained a 34-year-old Belgian man.
Police said the man, who they have not formally identified, was arrested in the Dutch town of Meerkerk, around 120 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of where the boy's body was found. 
Dutch media reported that Dean Verberckmoes had been staying with family friends before he was reported missing. 
Police said the suspect and the boy were last seen on Wednesday in the Belgian city of Sint Niklaas, near Antwerp. 
Officials in the Netherlands launched a mammoth search operation after receiving information that Verberckmoes could be in the country. 
Following the man's arrest, police issued an ""amber alert"" - a notice sent out in child abduction cases - with a description of the child and a photograph.  
Verberckmoes' body was discovered on Neeltje Jans, an artificial island in Zeeland province, soon after.
A police statement issued on Monday night said a police helicopter took part in the search, and investigators found a ""possible crime scene"". Around 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) officers found ""the lifeless body of a child"", the statement said. 
In a short message posted to Twitter, police confirmed that the remains were those of the missing toddler and thanked those involved in the search, as well as sending their ""condolences"" to the family.

Boris Johnson has ""categorically"" denied he was warned a drinks party in the No 10 garden risked breaking lockdown rules.
""Nobody warned me that it was against the rules,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""I would have remembered that.""
Former aide Dominic Cummings says he warned Mr Johnson at the time, and has accused him of misleading MPs about it.
Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says.""
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is due to publish a report into alleged Covid rule breaking at lockdown get-togethers in Downing Street and government departments.
In his blog, Mr Cummings, who was still working in Downing Street at the time of the drinks party on 20 May 2020, said he would swear on oath that he warned the prime minister it would be a rule-breaking event.
He claimed the PM had waved aside his warnings at the time. 
Two other former Downing Street officials told the BBC they remembered Mr Cummings telling them on that day he had advised the prime minister not to allow the drinks to go ahead.
Asked about Mr Cummings' claims on a visit to a North London hospital, Mr Johnson said: ""I can tell you categorically that nobody said that this was something that was against the rules, that was in breach of the Covid rules.""
Responding to his latest statement, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson clearly knows it's the end of the road. 
""He's the prime minister, he set the rules, he didn't need anyone to tell him that the party he attended broke them.
""If he had any respect for the British public, he would do the decent thing and resign.""
In his interview, Mr Johnson repeated the apology he made to MPs last week for ""mistakes"" made over the May 2020 get-together.
""As I said in the House of Commons, when I went out into that garden I thought that I was attending a work event."" 
He said he had not seen the email sent by a senior aide - his Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds - inviting staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"".
""I only saw it the other day. I only saw it when it emerged,"" said the PM.
""What I remember is going out into that garden for a short time and for 25 minutes thanking staff who'd worked on Covid, who were continuing to work on Covid, and then going back to office.
""If I had my time again, I would not have allowed things to develop in that way.""
Asked if he had lied to Parliament over the parties, he said: ""No. I want to begin by repeating my apologies to everybody for the misjudgments that I've made, that we may have made in No 10 and beyond, whether in Downing Street or throughout the pandemic.""
He said he would make a further statement on alleged rule-breaking in Downing Street when Sue Gray publishes her report, which is expected shortly.
Six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the prime minister so far, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP are urging him to resign.
Fifty-four Tory MPs must write letters calling for Mr Johnson to go in order to trigger a party leadership contest.

The massive volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga has caused catastrophic damage, with homes destroyed and many communities covered in a thick layer of ash.
The Tongan government says the country has been hit by an ""unprecedented disaster"".
Communications with Tonga have been severely disrupted. 
Satellite images and aerial photographs show the scale of the destruction.
The single undersea cable connecting Tonga to the outside world was severed in the eruption.
The port in the capital, Nuku'alofa on the main island of Tongatapu, has been severely damaged, with many buildings near the waterfront completely flattened. 
It is thought they were destroyed by the tsunami wave when it hit the island, shortly after the eruption on nearby Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai.
Despite the damage on the waterfront at Nukuʻalofa, inland areas are reported to be largely undamaged.
The UN reported extensive damage to property on the western beaches of Tongatapu. 
Waves of up to 15 metres hit the area on Saturday.
Reports from the area say 56 houses were completely or seriously damaged, and that the residents have been moved to evacuation centres.
There is also growing concern for residents of smaller, low-lying islands to the north of Tongatapu.
The authorities in Tonga say all the homes on one island, where around 50 people live, have been destroyed, while on another only two houses remain. Other islands, they say, have sustained extensive damage.
The main airport for the islands, Fua'amotu International Airport, was not damaged, but piles of ash are hindering operations and international aid efforts. Volunteers have been sweeping the runway of the main airport to allow planes to land.
Australia has said the ash must be cleared before it can land a C-130 military plane carrying supplies.
New Zealand is sending two ships, HMNZS Wellington and HMNZS Aotearoa, to the area with water supplies, survey teams and a helicopter.

265;5G phones: How serious is the threat to US flights?;2022-01-18T14:27:50.000Z;[];['mobile phones', '5g', 'air travel'];['phones', 'zones', 'interference', 'warned', 'threat', '5g', 'flights', 'serious', 'used', 'aviation', 'source', 'aircraft', 'radio'];"
Ten leading US airlines are warning that the imminent rollout of 5G services could be disastrous.
They say the new technology could cause thousands of flights to be delayed, and risks leaving large parts of the US aircraft fleet grounded indefinitely. 
5G relies on radio signals. In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band. 
These frequencies are close to the ones used by radio altimeters on aeroplanes, which measure the height of the aircraft above the ground, but also provide data for safety and navigation systems. 
The concern is that interference from 5G transmissions could stop these instruments from working properly, and cause safety problems, particularly when aircraft are coming in to land.
It is potentially very serious. 
In late 2020, the RTCA - a US organisation which produces technical guidance on aviation issues - published a report on the subject. 
It said there was ""potential for broad impacts to aviation operations in the United States, including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities, in the absence of appropriate mitigations"".
More recently, the US aviation regulator, the FAA, warned that 5G interference could lead to problems with a number of different systems aboard Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. 
These could make it difficult to slow the plane down on landing, causing it to veer off the runway.
Planes won't be allowed to use radio altimeters in circumstances where there could be a risk of serious interference. 
But that will restrict the ability of some aircraft to land, for example, in poor visibility. 
Airlines for America, which represents 10 major carriers, has warned that this could lead to more than 1,000 flights being delayed or cancelled in bad weather and mean at times ""the vast majority of the travelling and shipping public will essentially be grounded"". 
It has also suggested a large part of the US aircraft fleet will be ""deemed unusable"" because of restrictions on their operation.
Not to the same degree. That's because the way in which 5G is being rolled out varies from country to country. 
In the EU, for example, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power. 
Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks. 
In France, there are so-called ""buffer zones"" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference.
Regulators in the US have already taken a number of steps. 
The FAA has established temporary buffer zones around 50 airports, where 5G providers will limit their activities. But these are much smaller than the zones already being used in France, and US transmitters will operate at significantly higher power levels. 
It has also begun identifying which altimeters can be used safely in areas where 5G has been deployed - and those which are not reliable enough and will need to be replaced. 
It has also identified airports where GPS systems can be used to guide approaching aircraft rather than radio altimeters. 
But the airlines insist this isn't enough: they claim the 5G network should not be activated at all within two miles of affected airports.
Verizon and AT&T have already delayed the 5G rollout twice, and have agreed to the temporary buffer zones mentioned above. 
They also pointed out that 5G has already been implemented in some 40 countries.
Last month the US wireless industry body CTIA accused the aviation industry of ""scaremongering"", and warned that delaying the introduction of 5G would cause real economic harm.
UK regulators and airlines do not seem unduly worried. 
In a safety notice published in December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that ""there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour"". 
It also stressed that ""different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others"". 
The UK regulator says it plans to work internationally to gather further data on the issue.

267;Winter Olympics: Athletes advised to use burner phones in Beijing;2022-01-18T14:05:18.000Z;[];['china', 'cyber-security'];['phones', 'burner', 'prodemocracy', 'winter', 'tiananmen', 'square', 'religious', 'leaders', 'references', 'list', 'names', 'protesters', 'advised', 'beijing', 'words', 'olympics', 'athletes'];"
The Beijing Winter Olympics app that all Games attendees must use contains security weaknesses that leave users exposed to data breaches, analysts say.
The My2022 app will be used by athletes, audience members and media for daily Covid monitoring.
The app will also offer voice chats, file transfers and Olympic news.
But cybersecurity group Citizen Lab says the app fails to provide encryption on many of its files. China has dismissed the concerns. 
Questions about the app come amid a rise in warnings about visitors' tech security ahead of the Games, which begin on 4 February. 
People attending the Beijing Olympics should bring burner phones and create email accounts for their time in China, cyber security firm Internet 2.0 said on Tuesday. 
Several countries have also reportedly told athletes to leave their main devices at home.
The Citizen Lab report said it had found a ""censorship keywords"" list built into the app, and a feature that allows people to flag other ""politically sensitive"" expressions. 
The list of words included the names of Chinese leaders and government agencies, as well as references to the 1989 killing of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, and the religious group Falun Gong, which is banned in China.
The analysts noted that these features and security flaws are not uncommon for apps in China but posed a risk to users nonetheless. 
Analysts said the ""illegal words"" file appeared currently to be inactive, but it was unclear.
All visitors to the Games are required to download the app 14 days prior to their departure for China, and use it to record daily their Covid status.
For foreign visitors they also need to upload sensitive information already submitted to the Chinese government - like passport details and travel and medical histories.
Citizen Lab said transmission weaknesses in the app's software could lead to easy exploitation of data by a hacker, if targeted.
In a report on Tuesday, Chinese state media outlet Global Times dismissed concerns about the app, saying ""all personal information will be encrypted to ensure privacy"". 
It compared the app to one that had been used at the Tokyo Games. 
Cyber security firm Internet 2.0 has also warned of potential security risks during the Olympics. 
In a report seen by the BBC, it stressed the need for burner phones and reminded people not to use these devices after leaving China 
The report looked at some of the technology sponsors of the Games and their products in order to show ""the sophisticated and broad surveillance culture that exists in China"". 
One product, a VPN by Qi-Anxin, was able to capture a significant amount of user data, the report said. Under China's national security laws, authorities can request to access this data. 
""China's national data security laws are not designed with the Western values of privacy and liberty and do not offer the same level of protection,"" the report said. 
Team USA has encouraged its athletes to use a new device, according to USA Today. 
A bulletin seen by the US outlet allegedly ""encouraged"" burner phones and rental or disposable computers for members of its team. 
""Like computers, the data and applications on cell phones are subject to malicious intrusion, infection and data compromise,"" the bulletin said.

A violin-maker has used components including steamed pear, berries and spring water to create a vegan violin.
Padraig O'Dubhlaoidh made the instrument, entirely free of animal products, in his Malvern Hills workshop during the coronavirus lockdown.
The body of the bespoke instrument is the first in the world to be registered with The Vegan Society's trademark, said the organisation.
Natural replacements for animal-based glues were used on the £8,000 violin.
Historically horsehair, hooves, horns and bones have all been used to create instruments, said the Vegan Society which added it was ""incredibly exciting"" to register the violin.   
""This will be music to the ears of so many violinists who have longed for a high-quality instrument that is free from animal products,"" said the charity's Ericka Durgahee.
Inlay around the edge of the instrument had been made from ""steamed pear which is dyed black,"" said Mr Dubhlaoidh.
Wild berries are used to dye the wood inlays and local spring water is gathered to be used in his adhesive.
The craftsman, who has been making violins for 40 years, said a customer had asked him to make a vegan instrument ""some years ago.""
""It was an intriguing question,"" he added. ""I thought how many vegans are there, potential musicians whose ethics won't allow them to play the violin - it must be awful.
""The world is changing a lot at the moment... particularly the young generation.. they're making big changes in the world and I'm very proud of it.""
While vegan violin strings and bows are available, it is only the body of the violin that has been registered with the trademark, explained the Vegan Society.

270;Pacific volcano: Science will explain event's ferocity;2022-01-17T16:08:21.000Z;[];['earth science', 'volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga volcano and tsunami', 'geology', 'tonga'];['ferocity', 'volcano', 'tsunami', 'tappin', 'science', 'know', 'pacific', 'prof', 'ocean', 'land', 'events', 'millimetres', 'explain', 'krakatau', 'right', 'survey'];"
The explosive eruption of Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai sent a shockwave around the world.
The event literally touched every corner of the globe as a pressure wave spread out in all directions to complete a full circumnavigation.
Scientists, of course, are now asking themselves why the eruption was so powerful. They also want to understand how the tsunami was created.
The answers to both these questions feed into future hazard preparedness, although to be honest, right now, these finer details are much less important than the immediate needs of nearby islanders.
Their lives have been up-ended by catastrophic flooding and ash fall-out.
Nonetheless, scientific insights will emerge; they're already being assembled.
The name Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HT-HH) refers to the two island structures that stood about 100m above the Pacific Ocean surface, roughly 65km north of Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa.
What wasn't apparent to the casual observer was the hidden edifice below-water - a volcanic mountain rising some 1,800m above the seafloor.
The HT-HH islands represented just the upper-most part of the rim of a caldera - the opening to the volcano - that was 6km across. It was in this submerged caldera that gas-rich magma came into contact with cold seawater to devastating effect.
For Prof Shane Cronin, from the University of Auckland, who's made a detailed study of this volcano, the water depth was critical.
""The caldera summit is about 150-200m below sea-level. That's just about the right depth for there to be quite strong, explosive interactions between the magma and the seawater,"" he told BBC News.
""Once you get much, much deeper, then what tends to happen is there's too much seawater, and it suppresses that explosive activity.""
Prof Cronin said a big event had been due. The last major eruption was in the year AD 1100, and prior to that there was a major episode 1,800 years ago. On that basis the repeat cycle was roughly 900 years. That's now.
The tsunami that followed could have been created in several ways. In the near-field, where waves over one metre high were recorded at the Nuku'alofa tide gauge, some component would have resulted from rock and ash initially thrown high into the sky then descending back down into the ocean to displace its waters.
What scientists can't rule out at this stage is whether the extreme energy in the event didn't also cause some kind of submarine flank failure on the volcano. Something similar occurred at Anak Krakatau in Indonesia in 2018, although that involved a large amount of material above water then becoming submerged.
""This is a possibility, for sure,"" commented Dr Vicki Ferrini from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 
""In data we collected in 2016, you could see a lot of big solidified chunks that looked like they had slid down the side of the volcano in the past. So, with an explosion of this size, you certainly wouldn't be surprised if further large sections of consolidated material had moved.
""The good thing is we have the baseline data to make a comparison when we go back in, but only when it's safe.""
For far-field effects, there is a lot of discussion around whether that shockwave could have contributed to the run-ups recorded in New Zealand, Australia, and at beaches and inlets along both North and South America and in Japan.
The idea is that the sudden change in air pressure punches down on the surface of the ocean.
""This can change the elevation in the ocean by millimetres to centimetres, and when this gets closer to land, if the conditions are right, it can generate tsunami. We know this happened for example in the great eruption of Krakatau in 1883,"" said Prof Dave Tappin from the British Geological Survey.
""We're working on it right now. Fortunately, over the past 20 years, we've developed the mathematics to numerically model these events to better understand them.""
What was so remarkable about that pressure wave is just how far it travelled.
The impact on the atmosphere from the explosive eruption was obvious in the earliest satellite imagery as an expanding ring of disturbance moving out in all directions.
Meteorologists, both professional and amateur, immediately recognised that they might be able to detect the signal even on the other side of the world.
In the UK - which is about as far away as you can get from Tonga - the barometers wiggled at the expected moment.
""These things travel at the speed of sound, so on Saturday night quite a lot of people lined up expecting something. And that's what happened - a slight increase in pressure (about 1.5 millibars) followed by a decrease lasting about half an hour,"" explained Prof Giles Harrison from the University of Reading.
""The distance from Tonga to the UK is about 16,500km, and with an interval of about 14 hours - that gives you the sort of speed you would expect, at roughly 300m per second.""
The Reading barometer had recorded a total three pulses by 7am UK time on Monday.
Again, Prof Harrison said there were parallels with the 1883 Krakatoa event. Victorian meteorologists reported similar signals.
In the coming weeks and months, as activity subsides at Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai, researchers will be able to get in close to examine the remnants of the two islands. Most of their above-water bulk has gone, not unsurprisingly given the ferocity of the blast.
But the bigger concern is getting assistance to the affected islands in the Tongan archipelago. Satellite imagery returned in just the past day reveals considerable damage.
""And there are longer-term problems that come from all that ash. It's going to impact on agriculture and water quality,"" said Prof Tappin.

274;Government says its climate change curbs inadequate;2022-01-17T17:47:17.000Z;[];['uk government', 'climate change'];['climate', 'change', 'mp', 'lucas', 'green', 'curbs', 'net', 'risks', 'inadequate', 'zero', 'plan', 'fast', 'moving', 'longer'];"
The government has admitted that its efforts to insulate the UK from climate change impacts have been inadequate.
The costs of climate change to Britain are ""high and increasing"", it says, and could reach many billions of pounds a year.
Ministers say they'll have to go much further and faster to curb the worst impacts.
It means climate change must be built into all long-term decisions, such as new housing or infrastructure. 
The aim should be to avoid costly remedial actions in the future.  
The government has also accepted that it must consider low-probability but high-impact events arising from a heating climate. 
The report is a response to an analysis of the UK’s vulnerability to climate change by the official advisers, the Climate Change Committee.
""Climate change is happening now. It is one of the biggest challenges of our generation and has already begun to cause irreversible damage to our planet and way of life,"" the report begins.
It earmarks 61 climate risks cutting across multiple sectors of society. 
Health and productivity could be affected, it says, with impacts on many households, businesses and public services.
The report warns of worsening soil health and farm productivity, reduced water availability, and impacts on alternative energy supply. 
For example, it notes, unless the UK takes further action, the cost of flood-related damages for non-residential properties is expected to increase by 27% by 2050 and 40% by 2080. 
That's with a temperature rise of just 2C - and even that relatively low figure is looking very hard to achieve.
If temperature rises to 4C – which the government’s science advisers say is possible - this increases to 44% and 75% respectively. 
The government says it’s already investing to adapt to climate change. 
It mentions: 
But critics say efforts so far have been diluted by inadequate finance from the Treasury for long-term schemes. Indeed the chancellor didn’t mention climate change once in his Budget.
Green MP Caroline Lucas MP said: ""It's crystal clear that we are moving nothing like fast enough to net zero emissions and the longer we delay, the more it will cost. The government acknowledges the risks. We have yet to see the action plan that will deal with them."" 
Ministers admit they must do much more. 
Climate Adaptation Minister Jo Churchill said: “The scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we can’t tackle it overnight, and although we’ve made good progress in recent year, there is clearly much more that we need to do.""
Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: ""After more than a decade in power, the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis.
""Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.""

283;Should social media sites censor misinformation?;2022-01-19T00:08:42.000Z;[];['freedom of expression', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'fake news', 'censorship', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['risk', 'social', 'misinformation', 'media', 'potentially', 'sites', 'censor', 'reach', 'point', 'harmful', 'harder', 'reduces', 'fact', 'isnt', 'seeking'];"
How do you solve a problem like bad information?
When it comes to understanding science and making health decisions, it can have life-or-death consequences. 
People dissuaded from taking vaccines as a result of reading misleading information online have ended up in hospital or even died. 
And inaccurate or completely made-up claims about 5G and the origins of Covid-19 have been linked to violence and vandalism. 
But completely removing information can look a lot like censorship, especially for scientists whose careers are based on the understanding that facts can and should be disputed, and that evidence changes. 
The Royal Society is the world's oldest continuously operating scientific institution, and it is attempting to grapple with the challenges posed by our newest ways of communicating information. 
In a new report, it advises against social media companies removing content that is ""legal but harmful"". Instead, the report authors believe, social media sites should adjust their algorithms to prevent it going viral - and stop people making money off false claims.
But not everyone agrees with that view - especially researchers who are experts in tracking the way misinformation spreads online, and how it harms people. 
The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) maintains there are cases when the best thing to do is to remove content when it is very harmful, clearly wrong and spreading very widely.
The team points to Plandemic - a video that went viral at the start of the pandemic, making dangerous and false claims designed to scare people away from effective ways of reducing harm from the virus, like vaccines and masks, and was eventually taken down. 
Social media companies were better primed for the video's sequel Plandemic 2, which fell flat after being restricted on major platforms, having nothing like the same reach as the first video.  
""It's a political question...what balance we see between individual liberties and some form of restrictions on what people can and cannot say,"" says Prof Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.
Prof Nielsen acknowledges that, although it's a relatively small part of people's media diets, science misinformation can lead to disproportionate harm.
But, he adds, given a lack of trust in institutions is a big driver of misinformation: ""I imagine that there are quite a lot of citizens who would have their worst suspicions confirmed about how society works, if established institutions took a much more hands-on role in limiting people's access to information.""
Echoing this concern, the Royal Society says: ""Removing content may exacerbate feelings of distrust and be exploited by others to promote misinformation content."" This ""may cause more harm than good by driving misinformation content...towards harder-to-address corners of the internet.""
The fact that those corners are ""harder to reach"", though, is arguably part of the point. It reduces the risk that someone who is not already committed to potentially harmful beliefs, and isn't seeking them out, will be exposed to them by chance.
Some of the violent protests that were driven at least in part by conspiracies had their origin not in obscure corners of the internet, but on Facebook. And there is little clear evidence that removing content drives people further into harmful beliefs. 
Scientific misinformation is nothing new. 
The incorrect belief in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism came from a published (and later retracted) academic paper, while widespread unevidenced beliefs in the harm of water fluoridation were driven by the print media, campaign groups and word of mouth.
What's changed is the speed at which false facts travel, and the huge numbers of people who can end up reading them.
Rather than removing content, one way suggested by the report's authors of tackling misinformation is making it harder to find and share, and less likely to appear automatically on someone's feed.
This video can not be played
This, Prof Gina Neff, a social scientist at the Oxford Internet Institute explained, was to ""ensure that people still can speak their mind"" - they just aren't guaranteed an audience of millions. 
""They can still post this information, but the platforms don't have to make it go viral."" 
The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank which monitors extremism, points out a substantial proportion of misinformation relies on the appropriation and misuse of genuine data and research. 
""This is sometimes more dangerous than outright false information, because it can take substantially longer to debunk by explaining how and why this is a misreading or misuse of the data,"" its spokesperson says. 
That's where fact-checking comes in - another tool which the Royal Society supports.
One of the most common pieces of vaccine misinformation over the past year - which the BBC has repeatedly fact-checked - was the notion that people are being harmed in high numbers by the jab. This claim is based on a misinterpretation of real figures. 
The ISD says research has shown that a small group of accounts spreading misinformation had a ""disproportionate influence on the public debate across social media"".
""Many of these accounts have been labelled by fact-checkers as sharing false or misleading content on multiple occasions, yet remain live.""
The Royal Society did not investigate removing the accounts of ""influencers"" who are especially prolific spreaders of harmful misinformation. 
But this is seen as an important tool by many disinformation experts, and research into ISIS and the far-right suggests it can be successful. 
When David Icke, a prolific spreader of Covid misinformation as well as anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, was removed from YouTube, research from the CCDH found his ability to reach people was considerably reduced.
While his videos remained on alternative video-hosting platform BitChute, their views fell from 150,000 on average before the YouTube ban to 6,711 afterwards. On YouTube, 64 of his videos had been viewed 9.6 million times. 
Research from Cardiff University, found that the de-platforming of Kate Shemirani, a former nurse and prolific spreader of Covid misinformation, decreased her reach in the short term.  
This video can not be played
""Part of the issue is that current models of de-platforming need to be developed. It's not enough to just take down a piece of content, or a small number of accounts,"" one of the paper's authors - Prof Martin Innes - explains. 
Research from organised crime and counter-terrorism shows the need to disrupt the whole network, he says.
But he believes ""this level of sophistication isn't embedded yet"" in the way we tackle disinformation that could put people in danger.

284;Sewage regularly dumped illegally in England and Wales rivers;2022-01-19T07:33:44.000Z;[];['sewage', 'pollution', 'rivers', 'environment'];['dry', 'rivers', 'discharge', 'early', 'dumped', 'known', 'england', 'wales', 'law', 'treating', 'sewage', 'illegally', 'spill', 'conditions', 'regularly'];"
Untreated sewage is being dumped illegally in rivers across the country on a regular basis, analysis shown to the BBC suggests.
It found seven water companies in England and Wales discharged untreated sewage into rivers and the sea more than 3,000 times between 2017 and 2021.
The water industry admitted action was needed to address the problem.
The fresh data comes a week after MPs warned of a ""chemical cocktail"" of pollutants tainting England's rivers.
The Environmental Audit Committee said raw sewage and microplastics were putting health and nature at risk.
Peter Hammond, a retired professor of computational biology and also a campaigner with Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said the statistics showed that the water industry was flouting poor regulation by the Environment Agency.
""In some cases, multiple sewage works are spilling into the same river causing damage for long periods of time, sometimes spilling as long as four months, six months almost without a break,"" he said.
He calculated that together the seven companies - Southern Water, South West Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, Yorkshire Water and Welsh Water - discharged untreated sewage from 59 treatment works that treat 4.5 million people's wastewater.
Water companies are allowed to discharge untreated sewage into rivers in exceptional circumstances - for example during heavy rainfall. 
They can be acting illegally if they discharge when the conditions are dry - this is known as a dry spill. Or they can be breaking the law if they are not treating enough of the sewage before they discharge it - this is known as an early spill.
Prof Hammond looked at data from ""event duration monitors"", which check every 15 minutes on whether a treatment works is discharging untreated sewage into a river. He then compares this data with rainfall data and with the companies' records on how much sewage they're treating.
In response to the report United Utilities, Southern Water and Welsh Water, questioned the accuracy of some of the data while Yorkshire Water said that Prof Hammond had ""fundamentally misunderstood"" the data.
According to the report the sewage treatment works at Dorking run by Thames Water was responsible for the highest number of unpermitted spills. 
Untreated sewage was discharged into the River Mole on 223 days over the last four years. Prof Hammond's analysis suggests none of them would have been permitted by the rules, because either the weather was too dry, or not enough of the sewage had been treated properly.
Thames Water said it ''regards all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable and will work with the government, Ofwat and the Environment Agency to accelerate work to stop them being necessary and say they are determined to be transparent"".
Prof Hammond said the Environment Agency is failing to detect thousands of illegal spills because it is not scrutinising the available data closely enough. 
''It's as if the Environment Agency is looking through a telescope and we're looking through a microscope.""
Water UK, which represents the water companies, said all the water companies agree there is an ''urgent need for action to tackle the harm caused to the environment by overflows"".
An Environment Agency spokesperson said where there was evidence of non-compliance ''we will not hesitate to pursue the water companies concerned, and take appropriate action"".
They added that 1,300 storm overflows and storm tanks at waste water treatment works have been identified as ''spilling frequently'' and that ''a major investigation into possible unauthorised spills at thousands of sewage treatment works is ongoing"".

286;Somali survivor: The resilience of living through serial suicide attacks;2022-01-19T00:07:24.000Z;[];['africa today podcasts'];['ready', 'exactly', 'tell', 'spokesman', 'reports', 'works', 'bbc', 'living', 'resilience', 'somali', 'attacks', 'going', 'serial', 'moalimu', 'survivor', 'filing', 'suicide'];"
Sunday's suicide bombing in Somalia's capital targeted a man who had survived four previous attacks. BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper considers why Mohamed Moalimu, who is now recovering in hospital, continues to brave a city wracked by violence.
I have a list of essential information stored on my phone. Right near the top, above my passport number and bank account details, is the name Moalimu, the number 16.5 and the words ""likes blue patterns and white"".
These are the shirt size and preferred colours of my dear friend Mohamed Ibrahim Moalimu, who used to work as the BBC's reporter in Somalia.
Whenever I visit Mogadishu I buy shirts for Moalimu. 
I love going to Jermyn Street in London, the Mecca for posh gentlemen's clothes. I sort through the dozens and dozens of colours, patterns and designs, looking for just the right thing. 
In fact, I have two such shirts waiting in my suitcase for the next time I go to Somalia.
The problem is, Moalimu might not be there. He is in hospital in Turkey. 
He was airlifted there in a little plane. It was not easy to manoeuvre his stretcher up and into the small space.
On Sunday, Moalimu was caught up in his fifth suicide attack. This time he was the direct target. 
A suicide bomber ran towards his car and detonated the explosives when he reached the place where Moalimu was sitting. 
There was little left of the attacker. The car was a mangled wreck.
I do not understand how Moalimu survived. He has a broken leg, chest wounds and other injuries but he is conscious and lucid.
If you were to meet Moalimu, probably the first thing you would notice is the terrible scars on his face. He got those in 2016 in his second suicide attack. 
He was at his favourite seaside restaurant. Fighters from Islamist militant group al-Shabab stormed in from the beach, besieging the place for hours.
Moalimu survived by lying in his own blood, pretending to be dead. 
He told me how the militants kicked people's bodies to make sure they had died, shooting those who flinched. 
It took months of treatment in Somalia, Kenya and the UK to heal him. The main fear was for his eyes.
It is difficult to relate the character of Moalimu to the dangerous world he lives in, and refuses to leave.
He is gentle, softly spoken and calm. 
Mogadishu, and many of the people in it, are excitable, loud and nervy. Not surprising given that the city has been at war for more than three decades.
I was in Mogadishu shortly after Moalimu was caught up in his first suicide attack. 
It was in June 2013 when al-Shabab smashed their way into a United Nations compound, spending about an hour inside killing as many people as they could.
Moalimu happened to be driving past when the militants struck. The remains of a suicide bomber landed on his car, smashing the windscreen. 
In his usual polite, unassuming way, Moalimu showed me his windscreen, which was well-and-truly smashed up. He drew out a gruesome photo of his car in the aftermath of the attack. 
He asked if I thought the BBC might pay for his windscreen to be repaired.
After all, he was working at the time. Reporting, as he so often did, on the violence in his hometown.
There is no way the BBC could cover Somalia the way it does without people like Moalimu.
He now works as a government spokesman, but when he was with the BBC, as well as filing his own reports, Moalimu was always ready to tell people like me exactly what was going on. 
To this day, whenever I call him, he starts off with a list of exactly what has happened that day - the assassinations, the explosions, the political in-fighting. 
He does this even when the purpose of my call is to ask him what kind of shirts I should bring him.
When Moalimu was my BBC colleague, he and one other person were the only ones I called before I went to Somalia. 
If Moalimu said: ""Don't come"" - I didn't, even if it seemed to be relatively quiet. If Moalimu said: ""Come"" - I came, even if the security seemed a bit ropey. 
I trusted Moalimu with my life. He was one of the unsung heroes of my profession.
I find it hard to understand why so much journalism gets attached to the name of one glorious, brave reporter, when there are often many others involved. 
The producer, the camera-person, the sound-person and, perhaps most important of all, the ""local"" journalist, sometimes called ""the fixer"", who knows pretty much everything and upon whom the team almost entirely depends.
Moalimu was one such person, as are a number of other Somali journalists with whom I work and who also risk their lives every day.
After he left journalism I told Moalimu how disappointed I was when he became the government spokesman. 
How could such a fair, honest journalist join ""the other side""?
As always, his response was measured. 
""I want to make a difference. I couldn't do that as a journalist. I need to work from inside the system. I want to be an MP and this is my first step towards that.""
After he took on his new job, I had to develop a more formal relationship with him. 
His shirts have also become more formal. They are stiff and white as he now needs to wear them with smart suits. 
But whenever I walk down Jermyn Street, I will always think of the joy of choosing shirts for him, trying to match colours and patterns with his serene, gentle character.

Snow has fallen in the Sahara Desert in north-western Algeria as temperatures plummeted to below freezing.
For children from nearby towns such as Mekalis, it was a welcome relief from the scorching heat of the world's largest hot desert.
The ice crystals formed stunning patterns in the desert sands.
Dunes - ideal for sliding - were also partially covered by snow.
The town of Ain Sefra - known as the gateway to the Sahara Desert - also saw snow. Temperatures in the town often reach 35 degrees Celsius in July and August.
Snow is not entirely unknown in the region, which lies between the desert and the Atlas mountains. 
This month's snow was not entirely surprising - it also happened in 2021, 2018 and 2017.
But the snow on the red sand dunes in December 2016 did come as a surprise. Residents of Ain Sefra said that it was the first time since 1979 they had seen snow, suggesting the phenomenon is now becoming more common.

290;In the name of God go, David Davis tells Boris Johnson;2022-01-19T18:13:41.000Z;[];['boris johnson', 'david davis'];['johnson', 'couldnt', 'david', 'millions', 'mum', 'boris', 'tells', 'thing', 'easy', 'davis', 'right', 'funeral', 'wasnt', 'lives', 'friends', 'god'];"

Former cabinet minister David Davis has joined calls for Boris Johnson to stand down, telling the prime minister: ""In the name of God, go.""
He said the PM had failed to take responsibility for his actions over lockdown parties in Downing Street. 
Mr Davis's remarks came after backbench Tory MP Christian Wakeford defected to Labour, minutes before Prime Minister's Questions began.
The PM batted away repeated calls to quit during the stormy Commons session.
Mr Davis's criticisms and Mr Wakeford's defection come as Mr Johnson is fighting to save his premiership after admitting attending a drinks event in Downing Street during the first lockdown.
So far six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests.
There are claims that the threshold of 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote and leadership election could soon be reached, but no official word has been given.
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, one of those to call for Mr Johnson to quit, said a no-confidence vote was ""near"" and ""getting closer"". 
But a former cabinet minister told the BBC that Mr Wakeford's defection seemed to be backfiring, as his actions had ""provided an alternative target for rage"" among Tory MPs.
Another Tory MP said he had been ""let down by a good friend"" and that his now ex-colleague had ""unified the party"".
The prime minister is urging fellow Conservatives not to pass judgement on him until a report on parties at No 10, by senior civil servant Sue Gray, comes out next week.
In his letter to Mr Johnson, Bury South MP Mr Wakeford said: ""You and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.""
At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed Mr Wakeford to his party and repeated his call for Mr Johnson to quit, saying his ""absurd and unreliable defences"" of No 10 parties were unravelling.
But the most dramatic intervention came towards the end of the session, when Mr Davis told Mr Johnson he had spent weeks defending him from ""angry constituents"".
He added: ""I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday he did the opposite of that. So, I will remind him of a quotation which may be familiar to his ear: Leopold Amery to Neville Chamberlain.
""'You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.'""
A defection is a rare thing. A coup for Labour. A temporary triumph for Sir Keir Starmer. 
There were whispers that Christian Wakeford was spotted talking to a former Labour MP over drinks this week, a few murmurs that he might be thinking about taking such a dramatic step.
But for it to happen, to see that crossing the floor moment, is unusual indeed.
Traditionally a defection can in fact unite the party who the MP has left behind - it's so drastic. 
But the Wakeford departure adds to the real sense of chaos in Westminster. And the reaction among his now former colleagues elected in 2019 may not follow that traditional path. 
Read Laura's analysis in full
The PM said he did not ""know what [Mr Davis] is talking about"", but insisted he took ""full responsibility for everything done in this government and throughout the pandemic"".
Speaking afterwards to the BBC, Mr Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said he had supported Mr Johnson until his interview on Tuesday, when he said he had not been told a party in the Downing Street garden risked breaking Covid rules.
Jake Berry, chairman of the Northern Research Group of Red Wall Tory MPs, most of whom won their seats from Labour at the 2019 general election, said he thought Mr Davis had ""misjudged the mood of colleagues"".
But he added that ""the next few weeks and months"" would prove whether the former minister was correct. 
Speaking at the Downing Street coronavirus press conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I can say with full confidence I have observed Covid 19 rules at all times.
""My mum lives alone. I couldn't see her. I couldn't go to a close friend's funeral. It wasn't easy but it was the right thing to do, as millions have done up and down the country when they were asked to.""
Who else has used the phrase, 'In the name of God, go'?
The phrase was first used by Oliver Cromwell in the 17th Century.
Conservative MP Leo Amery used the words during a Commons debate in 1940, following the UK's failed campaign against Nazi forces in Norway. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned two days later.
Ms Gray's team are talking to the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings, who says he warned the PM that the Downing Street garden party in May 2020 risked breaking Covid rules.
Mr Cummings has also accused Mr Johnson - who insists he thought the party was a work event - of misleading Parliament.

At PMQs, Sir Keir said the prime minister's defence requires the public to believe that ""as he waded through the empty bottles and platters of sandwiches, he didn't realise it was a party"".
He added: ""If the prime minister misleads Parliament, should they resign?""
Mr Johnson said: ""[Sir Keir] is continuing to ask a series of questions which he knows will be fully addressed by the inquiry, he is wasting this House's time, he is wasting the people's time.""
The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: ""The prime minister is taking the public for fools. Nobody believes him. Will the prime minister finally take responsibility? Resign, go, prime minister.

292;Radar satellite's stunning map of UK and Ireland;2022-01-19T08:28:59.000Z;[];['earth science', 'earth observation', 'space exploration'];['turbines', 'specks', 'turbine', 'square', 'radar', 'satellites', 'ireland', 'map', 'wind', 'units', 'towers', 'stunning', 'surfaces', 'uk', 'thats', '50m'];"
Here's a view of the UK and Ireland you won't have seen before.
The mosaic is made from imagery acquired by the NovaSar satellite. 
Looking somewhat like a cheese-grater, this specialist spacecraft pictures the Earth's surface using radar.
The beauty of this technology is that it detects the ground even when there is thick cloud or, indeed, when it's night-time.
Consequently, this map was assembled by NovaSar in just seven passes.
A traditional optical satellite, which views scenes at wavelengths familiar to our eyes, would struggle to make such a map in so short a time. Britain's famously grey weather would be a constant frustration.
""Radar is a very deterministic thing,"" said Andrew Cawthorne, the director of Earth observation at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), which built and owns NovaSar.
""You know that when you pass overhead, you're going to get an image without any external influences causing you problems.""
I can't render the full image on this page. The one in my possession is two gigabytes in size. But if you could open it on your computer, you'd see some glorious detail - of cities, bridges, ships, mountains, parklands, lakes and much, much more.
The mosaic corresponds to an area of approximately 1,500km by 1,168km (1.75 million square km), or 938 miles by 730 miles (685,000 square miles). 
Each pixel represents a square on the ground that's about 50m across, which is really interesting because you can see very clearly the wind turbines out at sea. The turbine units are much less than 50m across, but their towers have hard, metallic surfaces which are excellent reflectors of radar energy, so they show up as brilliant specks. 
There's a lot of information in the map. It can be used to study land-uses, for example, to understand the changing urban footprint of Britain or to monitor the types of crops being grown on its agricultural land.  
NovaSar was seed-funded by government grant. It is the only sovereign radar capability the UK has.
If Britain falls out of the EU's Copernicus programme with its radar satellite capability (continued membership is currently caught up in a dispute over Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland) then NovaSar will be the only direct space asset the UK can task around the globe to guarantee an immediate image of the ground.  
In development at SSTL is a new low-cost radar satellite called CarbSar. It is being developed in partnership with novel antenna designer Oxford Space Systems.
""OSS is developing this interesting wrapped-rib antenna and we're developing the front-end radar electronics that attach to that antenna. Quite a lot of the elements are on the bench now being tested,"" explained Dr Cawthorne.
""But although we have the money to build the CarbSar payload, we don't yet have the money to launch it.""
The UK government published its long-awaited space strategy in September, which set out the desire both to remain in the EU's Copernicus programme and to build a constellation of small Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance satellites.
However, no budget was announced to go with the strategy.
UK space industry figures have told the BBC that if the country's association to Copernicus fails to materialise then the unused subscription should be fully invested in home-grown systems. The sum involved would be €750m (£630m) over seven years.
""We could do a lot with that kind of money,"" said Dr Cawthorne.

297;A68: 'Megaberg' dumped huge volume of fresh water;2022-01-20T02:04:03.000Z;[];['earth science', 'earth observation', 'icebergs', 'british antarctic survey', 'climate change', 'oceans'];['volume', 'species', 'signal', 'megaberg', 'dumped', 'really', 'water', 'a68', 'strong', 'think', 'told', 'sensor', 'theres', 'huge', 'signals', 'deposition', 'fresh'];"
The monster iceberg A68 was dumping more than 1.5 billion tonnes of fresh water into the ocean every single day at the height of its melting.
To put that in context, it's about 150 times the amount of water used daily by all UK citizens.
A68 was, for a short period, the world's biggest iceberg.
It covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke free from Antarctica in 2017. But by early 2021, it had vanished.
One trillion tonnes of ice, gone.
Researchers are currently busy trying to gauge the impact A68 had on the environment.
And a team led from Leeds University has been back through all the satellite data to calculate the behemoth's changing dimensions as it moved north from the White Continent, through the Southern Ocean and up into the South Atlantic.
This has enabled the group to assess varying melt rates during the course of the megaberg's three-and-a-half-year existence.
One of the key periods, obviously, was towards the end, as A68 approached the warmer climes of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.

For a while, there were fears the giant block could ground in the surrounding shallows, blocking the foraging routes of millions of penguins, seals and whales.
But it never quite happened because, as the team can now show, A68 lost sufficient depth of keel to stay afloat.
""It does seem that it briefly touched the continental shelf. That's when the berg took a turn and we saw a small piece break off. But it wasn't enough to ground A68,"" Leeds's Dr Anne Braakmann-Folgmann told BBC News.
""And I think you can see why in the thickness estimates,"" added co-author Prof Andrew Shepherd. ""By that stage the berg's keel was 141m, on average, and the bathymetry (depth) charts in the area showed 150m. It was a close call in the end.""
By April 2021, A68 had broken into countless small fragments that were beyond tracking. But its ecosystem impacts will have been much longer-lived. 
Giant tabular, or flat-topped, bergs are now recognised to have considerable influence wherever they roam. 
Their freshwater inputs will alter local currents. And all the iron, other minerals, and even organic matter picked up through their lives and subsequently dropped into the ocean will seed biological production.
The British Antarctic Survey managed to place some robotic gliders in the vicinity of A68 to monitor conditions before the ice mass totally wasted away. 
The data retrieved from these and other instruments, although not yet fully analysed, was revealing some interesting features, said biological oceanographer Prof Geraint Tarling.
""We think there's a really strong signal in the changing flora of the phytoplankton species around A68, and also in the actual deposition of material to the deeper parts of the ocean. The particle sensor on the glider was picking up some very strong signals of deposition coming from the berg,"" he told BBC News.
Details of A68's changing shape and freshwater fluxes are contained in a paper published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

Watching the Red Arrows jet across the sky as a young boy, Todd Smith knew that flying was what he wanted to do when he was older.
After five years' training, costing £100,000, followed by two years working as a flying instructor, he finally landed his dream job in his late twenties - working as an airline pilot.
But in 2019, the travel firm he was working for - Thomas Cook - collapsed.
By this time Mr Smith had become increasingly concerned about the growing threat of climate change, and the aviation sector's carbon emissions.
""I started connecting the dots, and was met with an uncomfortable conflict,"" he says.
""I wanted to get involved in [environmental protest group] Extinction Rebellion, but knew it would be career suicide, and I had a lot of debt. It would be easier to return to the industry and pay off the debt.""
Yet with the pandemic grounding aircraft, Mr Smith, who lives in the Berkshire town of Reading, decided to quit his high-flying career for good.
""Of course I prefer flying and visiting exotic destinations, and earning a decent salary,"" says the 32-year-old. ""But when confronted with the climate and ecological emergency, how could I possibly prioritise my needs, when we need to think collectively about how to tackle the biggest existential threat to humanity?""
Mr Smith is now a climate activist. He acts as a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion and is the co-founder of Safe Landing, a movement of climate-conscious aviation sector workers.
Giving up his dream job was a tough decision, he says. ""I'm doing this out of desperation, not out of choice. Financially I've been really struggling, I'm in a huge amount of debt, it's been challenging.""
But he adds: ""Taking action has been cathartic and eased my anxiety.""
Mr Smith's campaigning comes as a United Nation's climate change panel warned last summer that the world faced increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding.
UN secretary-general António Guterres said the study was ""code red for humanity"". Last October, the UK pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target will require big growth and investment in the low-carbon economy.
Mr Smith is far from the only person to leave a previous job due to concerns about the environment.
After working in the oil and gas industry in Denmark for 10 years, Nader Beltaji has moved to a low-carbon career. He now works as a project manager at renewable energy giant RWE. 
""I actually did my master's thesis on solar power and I wanted to go into that direction, but at the time there weren't many opportunities that caught my attention,"" says the 33-year-old who now lives in Wiltshire. ""Now the landscape has completely changed.""
Currently working on the construction of an offshore wind farm off north east England, Mr Beltaji says he has more job satisfaction these days.
""Climate change is certainly very much in the news, and offshore wind is part of the UK's big energy strategy, so it's good to be part of that, and know you're working on delivering the targets,"" he says. ""Oil and gas feels like quite a dying industry.""
Rachel Bowcutt used to work in the UK's dairy industry, which is known for being carbon intensive. The UN estimates that the dairy sector's global carbon dioxide emissions total some 1.7bn tonnes annually. That is more than the aviation sector's pre-pandemic 915m tonnes.
Previously, Ms Bowcutt was operations manager for the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers for two years, before quitting to take up a job at perhaps the organisation's nemesis - The Vegan Society.
She went vegan after reading reports, such as this from Oxford University, saying that a vegan diet ""is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth"".
Ms Bowcutt says she had also started to feel uncomfortable about the dairy industry and its practices after watching a session at a work conference about the optimum time to take calves away from their mothers.
""It all felt a bit unnecessary in terms of animal welfare and the environmental impact. It got to the point where I thought this isn't for me anymore, and I wondered if there was an equivalent organisation for vegans - and the job came up.""
Ms Bowcutt, who lives in Leamington Spa, in Warwickshire, started at the Vegan Society last year. ""I have much more confidence about the work I'm involved in. I can see the benefits, it's easier to promote and a subject matter I really believe in.""
The move to low-carbon jobs is urgently needed, argues Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Denis Fernando.
""There is a climate emergency, and we need drastic action to make things happen, so we'll [need to] see more of a push towards green workforces,"" he says. ""Green jobs create jobs. Everyone wins.
""There's a strong understanding towards moving towards green and low-carbon jobs, and an overall trend of people who want to do it, but we are deficient in terms of green skills.
""There's intention, but government policy could do more to quickly get more apprentices so they can start building skills. It can't be done to scale unless the government gives more resources to local councils.""
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
A government spokesperson says: ""The UK is capitalising on the green industrial revolution, with over 56,000 clean jobs created and supported in the UK's green industries since the launch of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan. 
""These range from electric vehicle manufacturing in Sunderland, hydrogen facilities in Teesside, to new floating offshore wind farms and factories in Wales and Scotland.
""To build on this, we are ensuring people have the right skills for employment in Britain's new low carbon industries, through measures ranging from green skills boot camps, to dedicated apprenticeships, as we support new British industries, green jobs and economic growth.""
Mr Fernando says green jobs have multiple benefits, including reducing the impact on the climate and restoring nature, and can involve millions of us.
""Green jobs could be anything from working on renewable wind turbines or ecology, but also bicycle repair, customer service at a railway station or a warehouse manager for a freight warehouse going by rail rather than air.
""We really need try to think of the big agenda which everyone can participate in.""

301;Covid: Did Pfizer's boss cast doubt on his own vaccine?;2022-01-20T00:06:51.000Z;[];['coronavirus vaccines', 'reality check', 'pfizer'];['covid', 'risk', 'small', 'vaccine', 'unsafe', 'sideeffects', 'rare', 'stronger', 'boss', 'supported', 'taking', 'pfizers', 'valid', 'doubt', 'cast'];"
""I've never doubted Covid-19 vaccination... until now.""
Jerome doesn't follow news closely on Twitter, using the site mainly to tweet about sports and books he's enjoying. 
The 41-year-old bus driver, from Quebec has mostly supported local Covid restrictions, although he admits to growing ""fed up"", two years into the pandemic. 
His feed reveals him mildly grumbling about his children's home-schooling, among posts about favourite authors and Canada's national football team. 
But casually scrolling on the social-media site, one Monday early in the new year, he came across a video clip appearing to show the head of Pfizer suggesting his vaccine provided no protection at all against Omicron.
Albert Bourla could be seen saying: ""We know that the two doses of the vaccine offer very limited protection, if any."" 
Jerome tweeted: ""If this video is legit, it has to sound off some alarms somewhere, no?""  
But the clip had been taken out of context from a longer interview, with Yahoo Finance, in which Mr Bourla had been discussing high infection rates with Omicron. 
A Pfizer representative clarified he had been referring to research suggesting while ""two doses of [Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid vaccine] may not be sufficient to protect against infection with the Omicron variant"", vaccinated people were thought to still be protected against severe disease. 
Several studies suggest vaccines, even when they do not protect against infection, lessen the impact of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, and significantly reduce the chances of ending up in hospital or dying. 
Jerome told BBC News he was generally wary of things he saw online, and on looking into the video further had realised the clip was a ""small part of the whole interview"".
""It was clear to me that small clip probably shouldn't be taken into account to shape my conclusion,"" he said.
But he had ""almost slipped into being manipulated"". 
""I was really surprised and shocked, you know, I just almost couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" Jerome said.
And from that brief window during which he'd expressed doubts about vaccination, his account was flooded with comments from people he characterised as the ""anti-vax community"".
""I have never had so many notifications on my Twitter,"" he said.
""People were telling me things like, 'Oh, well, you know, it's about time you wake up.'""
Jerome was also sent countless links to further misinformation, claiming ""unbelievable side-effects from the vaccines"".
As is common online, people were taking valid points - the vaccine isn't very good at protecting against catching Omicron or it comes with a very small risk of extremely rare side-effects - and making big leaps to much stronger claims - the vaccine is unsafe or completely ineffective - not supported by the evidence.
Posts also left out crucial information - in vaccinated populations people have much milder infections or the virus itself comes with much greater risk than the vaccine of side-effects, including blood clotting, heart inflammation and death. 
Many posts also made promises of fellowship and community, calling him ""brother"". Jerome describes himself as living a happy and contented life - but can see how someone seeking ""that sense of belonging"" could be more easily swayed.
""It made me realise how easily people are manipulated through false sources of information,"" he said. 
In an online newsletter, writer Jordan Schachtel quoted part of Mr Bourla's comments to imply two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine now offered only ""very limited protection, if any"" against Covid-19.
The tweet Jerome initially saw casting doubt on the vaccine, appears to have referenced this newsletter.
Other social-media posts, videos and podcasts also directly referenced Mr Schachtel's newsletter but took it further, suggesting Mr Bourla's comments cast doubt on whether the vaccine was ""safe and effective"".
Several posts also referred to unrelated comments by Mr Bourla, on the US news channel CNBC, that vaccines ""don't have the safety profile that we hope we can achieve with [mRNA] technology"". 
However, on this occasion, he had not been talking about Covid vaccines at all.
A full transcript of the interview clearly shows Mr Bourla was talking about another vaccine - against the shingles virus - Pfizer plans to update.
Mr Schachtel's newsletter initially made this mistake and later corrected it - but not before these comments had been picked up by former US congressman Ron Paul, who has a large social-media following.
In a YouTube video, Mr Paul explicitly referenced Mr Schachtel's newsletter when he repeated claims Mr Bourla had said the Covid vaccine was not safe and provided no protection against Omicron. 
Claims Pfizer had ""admitted... current vaccines 'do not work'"" or ""offer 'zero' protection against Covid-19"", linking to Mr Paul's YouTube clip, then spread across numerous online platforms.
Research by independent scientists and public health experts has shown the positive impact vaccinations are having in preventing serious illness - particularly against the Omicron variant.
One study suggests people three months after a second vaccine dose are 70% less likely to develop severe disease from an Omicron infection, dropping to 50% after six months.
Another has found double-vaccinated people are 65% less likely to be admitted to hospital with Omicron than those unvaccinated. 
Also, many countries with high rates of vaccination have been experiencing very high Covid infection levels but far fewer deaths than during previous peaks.

Fake endorsements from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being used on social media to promote Bitcoin-related investment schemes.
Photos and bogus interviews with Prince Harry and Meghan and other celebrities are being used to attract investors.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says it is increasing worries about scam advertisements.
The number of consumers reporting possible scams to the watchdog has risen by more than 400% in five years.
In 2021, there were more than 34,000 reports from consumers with suspicions about possibly fraudulent investment offers, the FCA says. In 2016, it had been 8,000.
""People should be very wary when they see investment ads offering high returns, even if they appear to be endorsed by celebrities,"" a spokeswoman for the financial services regulator said.
The watchdog warns of growing concerns about get-rich-quick scams being advertised through social media or search engines.
Fabricated interviews with Prince Harry and Meghan have previously been used in investment claims - and there appear to be new attempts to use their names in online articles promising instant profits, shared on social-media platforms.
""People earning millions from home by using Harry and Meghan latest advice,"" says one of the latest fake headlines, in a story also using the logos of news brands, including the BBC, the Daily Mail, the Sun, Forbes, Good Morning Britain and the Guardian.
Another was headlined: ""Harry and Meghan shocked everyone in the studio by revealing how they making an extra £128,000 every month.""
Articles claim falsely that in TV interviews the couple backed investment schemes related to Bitcoin and crypto-currency trading.
""I let the software run and my profits stacked up like pancakes,"" a supposed investor is quoted as saying.
""It feels incredible having money rush in this fast and hard."" 
Another says: ""My ex-girlfriend dumped me because I was too poor. 
""Now I'm a multi-millionaire and I have an even better girlfriend.""
The online articles carry bogus claims of the backing of other wealthy figures, including Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson and Mark Zuckerberg.
The investment articles, seen by the FCA, appear to be linked to a website in Eastern Europe. 
The website was contacted but has not replied - and the online link now goes to a general feature on the Royal Family.
Representatives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been alerted.
The FCA wants consumers to be more aware of the threat of scams and to check if a company is regulated in the UK and on the financial-services register.
""If it isn't, you are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong,"" the FCA spokeswoman said.
Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime, says scammers are using social media to target a younger age group.
This can involve ""fake testimonials"" and pictures of famous people to ""help the investment seem legitimate"", it says.
In the financial year between April 2020 and March 2021, there were were 500 investment frauds found using bogus celebrity endorsements, with losses of over £10m, according to Action Fraud.
Citizens Advice director of policy Matthew Upton said the ""consequences can be truly devastating"".
""These schemes are becoming ever-more sophisticated and can leave people feeling incredibly vulnerable and isolated - to the point where they can't even tell their family and friends what has happened,"" he added.

309;Joe Biden one year on: Has the United States become ungovernable?;2022-01-19T13:51:50.000Z;[];['us politics', 'long reads', 'joe biden'];['world', 'united', 'view', 'suspect', 'strident', 'voting', 'states', 'biden', 'sympathetic', 'tone', 'joe', 'voice', 'ungovernable', 'day'];"
One of Joe Biden's central election campaign themes was restoring unity to an angry and divided nation. Twelve months after assuming office, things aren't any better, writes Nick Bryant.
Long before the sun had risen over the dome of the US Capitol on the day that Joe Biden was sworn in as president, technicians on the inaugural platform tested the teleprompter he would later read from by scrolling through America's most celebrated sermon: 
""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."" 
When I first saw the lines of the Gettysburg Address on those screens in front of the presidential podium, I thought it must be some kind of sick joke. However, the words of Abraham Lincoln could hardly be described as being out of place. Washington, after all, looked that morning like a military encampment. 
Troops had slept overnight in the corridors of Congress to protect it from seditionists, just as their forebears had done in Lincoln's day. The scaffolding of the inaugural platform had been used only two weeks before as a staging post for the January 6th insurrection. The Confederate flag had even been held aloft in the halls of US power, as American once again fought American. 
So the question posed by the country's 16th president seemed especially pertinent as the 46th occupant of the office prepared to assume power - could this country long endure?
Rather than speaking that day of national renewal, a platitudinous staple of presidential inaugurals, Joe Biden focused on national reunification. And though it was three words from his address that instantly entered the history books, ""democracy has prevailed,"" it was three short sentences that set out his presidential mission statement: ""Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation."" 
A year on, however, that plea for national unity sounds more like magical thinking. Far from coming together, the United States is in an even more perilous state of disunion. Often it feels as if the only thing that unites the nation is mutual loathing. America seems to be engaged in a forever war with itself.
Over the past 12 months, tensions have escalated over longstanding points of divergence, such as abortion rights. The country has found new things to argue about, such as vaccine mandates. It has also discovered new ways of fighting old battles. The conflict over critical race theory, the latest front in the country's left-right culture wars, is a novel way of carrying on the centuries-old debate over the legacy of slavery and segregation. 
During the past year, moments with the potential to help bridge divides, namely the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who murdered George Floyd, have been supplanted by events that ended up hardening divisions. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of murder after shooting dead two men during racial unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was an obvious case in point. 
To those who believed he should be convicted, Rittenhouse was a homicidal vigilante who recklessly waded into a racial protest carrying a military-style semi-automatic weapon. To his supporters, he was a patriot and American hero - one far-right website labelled him ""Saint Kyle"". 
The teenager became the latest poster boy of polarisation. The debate surrounding his trial degenerated into a rage-filled ruckus of overlapping and interlocking arguments about gun control, self-defence laws, policing and double standards in the criminal justice system. As is now the norm in US society, policy questions involving complex and nuanced issues were thrashed out in the midst of a firestorm, often in the most binary and emotive terms.   
On the Richter scale of American division, however, the Rittenhouse trial was only a moderate quake. The aftershocks of January 6th continue to be far more seismic. Rather than becoming a moment of Trumpian repudiation, the Capitol Hill insurrection ended up having a radicalising effect on the conservative movement. The so-called ""big lie"" that Trump won the election, a fringe conspiracy theory in the hours after Joe Biden was declared the victor, has since been adopted as mainstream Republican thinking.
What we are now witnessing is something without precedent in modern America - a former president, who continues to enjoy widespread backing from his party, refusing to accept the result of a clear-cut presidential election. Nor did the assault on democracy, its defenders would argue, end on the night of January 6th.
In the past year, Republican-controlled legislatures in more than a dozen states have passed restrictive voting laws. Laws have also been enacted making it easier to interfere in a partisan way with election administration, part of what Democrats claim is a a slow-motion coup to regain the White House at the next presidential election. Polling suggests, however, that more Republicans think that democracy is under attack than Democrats, another measure of disunity. 
Free and fair elections, the very mechanism designed to peacefully resolve disputes in a civil society, are themselves now at the centre of a society-splitting dispute. And at the core of that row is something even more fundamental, the failure to agree even on incontrovertible facts - in this case the objective truth that Biden won.  How can there be unity, in a country stewing in misinformation and conspiracy theories, when there is no longer a shared sense of reality? Truth is usually a prerequisite of reconciliation. 
Some fear that January 6th was a foreshock, a prelude to an even more deadly eruption. 
That explains the attention being paid to a series of recent books raising the spectre of further civil conflict and political unrest. In How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, the political science professor Barbara F Walter describes her country as an ""anocracy"", a mix between a democracy and an autocracy, and warns of further militia violence. In Divided We Fall, David French, an Iraq War veteran, fears states might even decide to secede from the union, the precipitant in the mid-19th Century of the American Civil War. The intellectual descendants of the plethora of books written since the turn of the century on US decline, they form part of a new genre - studies devoted to the prospect of American disintegration. 
Few American scholars think the country is on the verge of a full-scale conflagration, a Civil War 2.0, in which compatriots would take up arms against each other on fields of battle that would become modern-day equivalents of Fort Sumter and Antietam.  The more likely scenario, given the uptick in militia activity and the incendiary tone of political discourse, is of sporadic acts of political violence akin to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville or the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Yet even this lesser possibility is alarming.
Late in the  2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden actually travelled to Gettysburg to sound the alarm about the violent potentialities of division. ""The country is in a dangerous place"", he warned, speaking against the backdrop of a battlefield where tens of thousands of Americans ended up as casualties. ""Once again, we are a house divided."" Yet a president who cast himself as a consensus-builder, with bipartisanship in his bones, has not even managed to unite his party, still less his country.
As Biden is well aware, more battles loom on the near horizon. Sometime in 2022, the Supreme Court will deliver its highly anticipated ruling in Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organisation, which could overturn the constitutional right to abortion and lead to an even more balkanised America. The mid-term congressional elections are another potential flashpoint. Even in the event of a conflict with Russia over Ukraine or a clash with China over Taiwan, it is hard to imagine a patriotic surge strong enough to bring the country together. On the contrary, much like the coronavirus pandemic and January 6th insurrection, a military confrontation would more likely expose the nation's fissures.
On inauguration day a year ago, you could almost hear the relief in Joe Biden's voice when he reassured his country, and the world, that democracy had prevailed. But in his two set-piece speeches of this new political year - one marking the anniversary of January 6th and the other delivered in Georgia demanding the passage of voting rights legislation - it was possible to detect both an air of resignation and a strident partisan tone. Both may well be an indication that he knows in his heart of hearts that his reunification project has failed, and that national healing is beyond him. Historians may one day view this as a personal failing. But I suspect many will be more sympathetic. After all, could any president heal a broken land that looks increasingly ungovernable?
Maybe the best that can be hoped for as the country approaches its 250th anniversary on July 4th, 2026, is for it to remain in a state of largely peaceful co-existence: that its cold civil war will never become hot. As for whether the country can long endure? It is still an open question.

310;Apple AirTags - 'A perfect tool for stalking';2022-01-20T00:13:46.000Z;[];['apple'];['apple', 'didnt', 'stalking', 'perfect', 'rang', 'support', 'device', 'airtags', 'know', 'closely', 'watch', 'surroundings', 'confirm', 'told', 'tool'];"
This video can not be played
Amber Norsworthy lives in Mississippi with her four children.
It had just turned 3pm when she got home on 27 December. She received a notification on her phone. 
""My phone made a ding that I'd never heard before"", she says.
The notification told her that an unknown device had been following her movements. 
Ms Norsworthy, who's 32, went on to the 'Find My' app on her iPhone. 
""It showed me my whole route. It said 'the last time the owner saw your location was 15:02' and I was like, 'that's now, I'm at home'."" 
She rang the police, who told her they didn't know what to do. She has yet to find the device, which she believes is somewhere in her car. She says Apple Support was able to confirm it was an AirTag. ""I watch my surroundings very closely now,"" she says.
The BBC has spoken to six women in the US who say they have been tracked using Apple AirTags. 
The button-sized devices are designed to work with Apple's 'Find My' network to locate lost items. But there have been multiple reports in the US of the devices being used to track people. 
Apple told the BBC: ""We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag's privacy and security.""
The company also says AirTags have better security features than rival products. However, there is growing evidence that they are being used for criminal activity across the US.
Apple launched AirTags last April. They're small, smooth and circular - and took inspiration from other tracking products on the market, like Tile.
The idea is that they can be attached to luggage or keys - anything you could lose. You can track an item to within 0.1ft. But in the wrong hands, they can be used for a different purpose.
""If you create an item which is useful for tracking stolen items, then you have also created a perfect tool for stalking,"" says Eva Galperin, Director of Cyber-Security at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
""I have personally talked to several people who have found AirTags in their possession,"" she says.
Apple was aware, long before it released AirTags, that they could be used for criminal activity. On releasing them, Apple said that ""AirTags are designed to track items not people"". 
They created a series of safeguards that, they said, would protect people from being tracked. 
People with an iPhone would be alerted if an unregistered AirTag was moving with them. And the AirTags would make a beeping noise when separated from an owner for a period of time.
In December, the company also released an app which Android users can download. Tracker Detect allows users who aren't on the iOS operating system to be notified of a rogue AirTag.
But for several reasons, many people believe these safeguards don't go far enough. 
Anna Mahaney is from Georgia. She was alerted to an unknown device after she'd gone to the shopping mall. 
""I was pretty freaked out and I went to try to disable it. Every time I did that, it said it couldn't connect to the server."" She went to an Apple Store, where they suggested she should turn off her location settings. 
When she went to the local police, they told her there had been another similar report in her area. She believes the device is somewhere on her car.
The BBC has spoken to six women who all say they have been tracked with AirTags. One said she had found an AirTag taped to the inside of a bag. Others haven't been able to locate the tags.
All of them have questions about whether Apple is doing enough to stop their products from tracking people. 
Apple says AirTags will make a beeping sound between 8-24 hours after a device is detected moving with an unregistered phone. But it's easy to register an AirTag, and then disable it.
Anna Mahaney says Apple Support told her this could be why she hasn't been able to find the AirTag: ""It looks like what could have happened in my case was that the person that owns the AirTag tracked me until I got home, and then they turned off the AirTag.""
This isn't the only potential loophole in Apple's AirTag safeguards. Apple's app, designed for Android users to find an unwanted AirTag, has been downloaded by a tiny percentage of Android phones
The BBC asked Apple for figures on how many times the app has been downloaded on Google Play, Android's default app store. Apple didn't say, but Google Play puts the figure at around 100,000 downloads. To put that into context, there are around 3 billion active Android devices around the world.
Apple says that if you don't have an iPhone, people will be notified with another safeguard - a beeping sound that plays after an unwanted AirTag is detected. But there are problems with this too. 
""AirTags emit a 60 decibel beep. and it's really easy to muffle."" says Eva Galperin. ""I could muffle it just by closing it in my fist. I could muffle it by putting it between two couch cushions. It's impossible to hear by putting it, say, under your car bumper."" 
And the noise will only begin to play after eight hours. Critics argue that by then it is too late. 
In Bloomingdale Illinois, one police force has warned local residents about AirTags: ""We thought it was important to notify the people in our community that this is somewhat of an issue."" says Frank Giammarese, director of public safety at Bloomingdale Police. 
""Technology is great but unfortunately... some people have misused that."" 
There is an argument that Apple is being unfairly targeted. It's easy to buy tracking devices on the internet. 
The BBC asked its major competitor, Tile, what it was doing to protect the public from being tracked with its devices. Tile replied that it was ""developing a solution"" which would identify an unknown device near people. But that solution hasn't been released yet. 
The counter-argument is that AirTags are just very good at being located by a registered iPhone. The 'Find My' network uses almost a billion Apple devices around the world - and their Bluetooth connectivity - to create accurate and long-range tracking.
""I want Apple to require these devices to ask permission before you can be followed,"" says Anna Mahaney. ""With 'Find My Friends', if my husband wants validation, I have to okay that and give it to him. I cannot rationalise why a stranger can follow me and I don't have to give consent."" 
Amber Norsworthy believes AirTags should not be sold until Apple can work out how to better alert people: ""They should stop selling them for a period of time until they can work out some safety boundaries.""
Eva Galperin believes Apple needs to create better safeguards: ""I want them to work with Google in order to give Androids the same level of detection automatically in the background, as they already have for iPhones.""
The BBC put these criticisms to Apple, who said: ""We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag's privacy and security…If users ever feel their safety is at risk, they are encouraged to contact local law enforcement, who can work with Apple to provide any available information about the unknown AirTag.""

311;Was South Africa ignored over mild Omicron evidence?;2022-01-20T00:08:25.000Z;[];['south africa', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['africa', 'scientific', 'research', 'south', 'sufficiently', 'sheer', 'mild', 'evidence', 'ignored', 'werent', 'seeing', 'omicron', 'worst', 'rigorous', 'scientifically'];"
South African scientists - praised internationally for first detecting the Omicron variant - have accused Western nations of ignoring early evidence that the new Covid variant was ""dramatically"" milder than those which drove previous waves of the pandemic.
Two of South Africa's most prominent coronavirus experts told the BBC that Western scepticism about their work could be construed as ""racist,"" or, at least, a refusal ""to believe the science because it came from Africa"".
""It seems like high-income countries are much more able to absorb bad news that comes from countries like South Africa,"" said Prof Shabir Madhi, a vaccine expert at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand. 
""When we're providing good news, all of a sudden there's a whole lot of scepticism. I would call that racism.""
Prof Salim Karim, former head of the South African government's Covid advisory committee and vice-president of the International Science Council agrees.
""We need to learn from each other. Our research is rigorous. Everyone was expecting the worst [about Omicron] and when they weren't seeing it, they were questioning whether our observations were sufficiently scientifically rigorous,"" he said, while acknowledging that the sheer number of new mutations in Omicron may have contributed to an abundance of scientific caution.
South Africa's latest wave of Covid, which began in late November 2021, is now declining as sharply as it once rose and is likely to be declared over, nationwide, in the coming days. 
There are still concerns that the infection rate could spike again following the reopening of schools, but, overall, the country's Omicron wave is expected to last half as long as previous waves.
By early last month, scientists and doctors here were already sharing anecdotal evidence indicating that Omicron, while highly contagious, was resulting in far fewer hospital admissions or deaths than the Delta wave.
""The predictions we made at the start of December still hold. Omicron was less severe. Dramatically. The virus is evolving to adapt to the human host, to become like a seasonal virus,"" said Prof Marta Nunes, senior researcher at the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics department of the University of Witwatersrand.
The WHO continues to warn against calling Omicron ""mild,"" pointing out that its high transmissibility was causing a ""tsunami"" worldwide, threatening to overwhelm health systems. 
But South African scientists are sticking by their data.
""The death rate is completely different [with Omicron]. We've seen a very low mortality rate,"" said Prof Karim, who pointed to the latest data showing hospital admissions were four times lower than with Delta, and the number of patients requiring ventilation was similarly reduced.
""It didn't take even two weeks before the first evidence started coming out that this is a much milder condition. And when we shared that with the world there was some scepticism,"" Prof Karim added.
It has been argued that Africa - or at least some parts of the continent - may be experiencing the pandemic differently due to demographics and other factors. South Africa's average age, for instance, is 17 years younger than the UK's. 
But scientists in South Africa insist that any demographic advantage the population might have in terms of battling Covid is outweighed by poor health. Excess deaths in South Africa during the pandemic now sit at 290,000 - or 480 per 100,000 people - which is more than double the UK figure. 
""The fact is that South Africa has got a much more susceptible population than the UK when it comes to severe disease. Yes, we've got a younger population… but we've got an unhealthier population because of a higher prevalence of other co-morbidities including obesity and HIV,"" said Prof Madhi.
""Each situation and each country has some unique characteristics. But we've learned how to extrapolate from one setting to another,"" said Prof Karim.
The figure of 290,000 excess deaths has not been confirmed as an accurate reflection of the pandemic's toll in South Africa. It is three times the number of official Covid-19 deaths. 
But scientists here believe a majority of those excess deaths are probably due to the pandemic. Half of them occurred during the Delta wave, but, so far, only 3% transpired during the Omicron wave, said Prof Madhi.
South Africa's government declined to introduce tighter restrictions during the Omicron wave and bitterly criticised foreign governments for their initial imposition of strict travel bans from the region. 
Scientists here have generally welcomed the government's light-touch response, and now argue that other countries might do well to follow its example.
""We believe the virus is not going to be eradicated from the human population. We must now learn how to live with this virus and it will learn how to live with us,"" said Prof Nunes.
""The [low death rate from Omicron] shows we're in a different phase of the pandemic. I'd refer to it as a convalescent phase,"" said Prof Madhi. 
He observed that South Africa had, ""for all intents and purposes"", stopped quarantining and contact tracing, and he urged the government to stop testing for Covid-19 at a community level too, saying it was unnecessary and amounted to pointless ""bean counting"". 
Instead, he said the priority should be to minimise the number of people who are hospitalised by Covid-19. 
Prof Madhi also expressed concern that mixed messages about South Africa's growing success in fighting the pandemic could ""really diminish confidence in vaccines [despite the fact that] we know vaccines prevent severe disease"".
Although South Africa lags far behind countries like the UK in terms of vaccination rates, at least three-quarters of the population now enjoys significant protection from a combination of prior infections and vaccinations. 
Prof Karim acknowledged that Omicron's high transmissibility was causing temporary problems for countries like the US, but, citing South Africa's own experience, he said ""the good thing is that because [the infection rate] has gone up that fast, it'll go down that fast too, so the pressure on hospitals will be much less"".

312;False banana: Is Ethiopia's enset 'wondercrop' for climate change?;2022-01-21T06:47:45.000Z;[];['plants', 'agriculture', 'climate change', 'environment', 'food', 'ethiopia'];['enset', 'climate', 'perennial', 'change', 'hunger', 'tree', 'harvest', 'unusual', 'ethiopias', 'unique', 'wondercrop', 'traits', 'banana', 'false', 'thats', 'really', 'plant'];"
Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change.
The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study.
The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread.
Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa.
""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia.
Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia.
The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread.
Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range.
Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.
Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security.
""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger.""
Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops.
Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond.
There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize.
""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.
The research is published in Environmental Research Letters.

An astrophysicist has been killed in a ""reckless"" shooting while visiting his girlfriend in the US state of Georgia. 
At 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Sunday, officers were called to an apartment block in Clairmont Road in Brookhaven, Atlanta. 
Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Surrey, UK, was found in bed with a single gunshot wound to the head.
The Foreign Office said it was ""supporting the family of a British man following his death"". 
Brookhaven Police said the shooting of Dr Willson, from Chertsey, was ""random"" and involved the ""reckless discharge of firearms"". 
Dr Willson ""was in town from England visiting loved ones when the incident occurred,"" police said.
Police told local news station WSB-TV2 in Atlanta that it was ""a senseless act"" and Dr Willson was ""a completely innocent victim"".
Investigators also said he had just flown in to Atlanta. 
Officers had earlier been called to a neighbouring block of flats after reports of gunshots. They received a second call regarding a ""person being shot"" while they were checking the area. 
Dr Willson was a former PhD student at the University of Exeter in the south-west of England. 
The university said in a statement that Dr Willson was a ""much-loved member of our astrophysics team"".
It added: ""Our hearts go out to his family, friends and colleagues. We are offering support to colleagues at the university who will also want to commemorate his life.""
Dr Willson also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Georgia State University between 2017 and 2019, the university said.
No suspects have been arrested and police are seeking information from the public. Authorities are offering a cash reward for tips that lead to an arrest. 
Sgt Jake Kissel from Brookhaven Police described the location of the shooting as ""a generally safe area"". 
Sgt Kissel told BBC Radio Surrey that officers ""immediately responded to the priority call of someone being shot and that's where they met with a female caller who was rendering aid to her boyfriend who had been shot dead"".
He said: ""We are asking for our public's help in assisting us with this investigation. 
""Our investigators are currently following up on all leads to include potential video, eyewitness accounts as well as the evidence that was left on scene.""

317;Scores killed in Yemen prison air strike carnage;2022-01-21T15:37:45.000Z;[];['saudi arabian-led intervention in yemen', 'yemen', 'yemen crisis'];['scores', 'scene', 'msf', 'killed', 'know', 'strike', 'violence', 'carnage', 'missing', 'prison', 'air', 'mahat', 'yemen', 'told'];"
At least 100 people have been killed or wounded in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition which hit a detention centre in Yemen.
The incident happened when a facility was struck in Saada, a stronghold of the rebel Houthi movement, on Friday.
It followed nights of intensified bombing raids in the wake of a deadly Houthi attack on the UAE, a Saudi ally.
Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Arab states in a war against the rebels since 2015 which has devastated Yemen.
Tens of thousands of civilians, including more than 10,000 children, have been killed or wounded as a direct result of the fighting.
Millions have been displaced and much of the population stands on the brink of famine.
Hours after the air strike, rescue workers were still pulling bodies out of the rubble, and hopes of finding survivors are fading, says BBC Middle East correspondent Anna Foster.
The exact death toll is unclear. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said at least 70 people were killed, though the number is expected to rise. 
Houthi-run television showed pictures from the scene of men clearing debris with their hands and of wounded at a local hospital. MSF said one hospital had received more than 200 casualties.
""There are many bodies still at the scene of the air strike, many missing people,"" Ahmed Mahat, MSF chief in Yemen, told AFP news agency. ""It is impossible to know how many people have been killed. It seems to have been a horrific act of violence.""
Further south, three children were killed as they were playing football when an air strike hit a telecommunications facility in the rebel-held port city of Hudaydah, Save the Children aid agency said. 
There was a near countrywide internet outage around the same time, which Houthi media blamed on the attack on the telecommunications site.
Saudi Arabia said the coalition had carried out air strikes in Hudaydah but did not mention the attack in Saada. 
The coalition has stepped up air strikes since the Houthis carried out a rare drone and missile attack on the UAE on Monday. Three civilians were killed in what was the first deadly attack of its kind in the emirates.

318;Like a drone that you sit in – but would you feel safe?;2022-01-21T01:11:52.000Z;[];['transport', 'drones', 'air travel'];['wings', 'sell', 'feel', 'person', 'vehicle', 'sit', 'power', 'rotors', 'uses', 'ultralight', 'safe', 'theres', 'tetra', 'drone'];"
Peter Ternstrom was about nine years old when he first saw the movie, Return of the Jedi, at the cinema. The scene in which Luke and Leia take to hover-bikes on a high-speed chase through a forest left a particular impression on him.
""Absolutely, that has been an important inspiration for me,"" says Mr Ternstrom, who co-founded Swedish firm Jetson with Tomasz Patan.
Recently,  his company released a video of its prototype personal flying machine, the Jetson ONE, in action. The clip quickly clocked more than 12m views on YouTube in about four weeks.
The filming location, a desert-like area, was deliberately chosen for its sci-fi feel. It is actually a military training ground in Poland.
A helmeted pilot sits in the centre of what looks like a large drone, with its multiple spinning rotors. The craft zooms across the landscape, blowing up dust. 
This is an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL. Personal eVTOLs are among the smallest rideable aircraft around and generally have capacity to transport just one passenger - the pilot. 
The vehicle's diminutive size helps to keep down their price tag but there is another advantage for firms seeking to sell them. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that ultra-light vehicles - which weigh less than 254lbs (115kg) and have a maximum speed of 55kts (63mph; 101km/h) - can be flown without a pilot's certificate. 
This is the route that Jetson and a number of other firms are taking in order to get their products on to the market. But will these new-fangled flying machines actually be safe, especially if just about anyone can buy one?
Mr Ternstrom for one, is being slightly more cautious than he's legally required to be. The first Jetson ONEs will sell in 2023, if all goes to plan, but the founder says he wants the first owners to be people who hold, or who have held, a pilot's licence.
""If you have previous experience, we have said, 'OK, cool, you can buy one',"" he explains. These people will be ""ambassadors"" for the brand, he says. Everyone who buys one, for $92,000 (£77,000), will also get a two-day training course in Tuscany, Italy.
There has certainly been lots of interest from prospective owners. Three and a half weeks after the firm published its video, Jetson had taken pre-orders for 118 aircraft.
The Jetson ONE currently offers 20 minutes of flight time on a fully charged battery. But in a couple of years' time, Mr Ternstrom predicts this will rise to 30 minutes, thanks to better battery technology. As for safety, the drone is built with crumple zones around the pilot's seat to cushion the impact of a low-altitude crash. 
The vehicle can also continue flying after losing one of its propellers - though pilots in such situations will be prompted to land immediately. 
Plus, on-board software will attempt to automatically prevent dangerous flying behaviour. The software slows the vehicle down as it approaches the ground, for instance, and uses a Lidar (light detection and ranging) system to sense how far away the ground actually is.
But Mr Ternstrom knows that there is still the potential for things to go wrong, which is partly why he has stipulated that the first owners must have some flying experience.
""This is a machine made for mischief, basically,"" he adds. ""I want them to be very responsible.""
More technology of business:
No eVTOL aircraft are currently certified to fly in the UK, though the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) expects that the first flights of such vehicles could begin within five years - and this is likely to be for commercial rather than personal operation. 
""With that in mind, it is vital that a strong safety culture is built into the heart of eVTOL vehicles,"" says David Tait, head of innovation at the CAA.
The Jetson ONE is far from the only vehicle of its kind in development. The US-based company Opener will also soon bring its aircraft, the single-seater BlackFly, to market. 
A spokeswoman for the firm says safety is Opener's first priority. ""General adoption of eVTOL technology is not possible without it,"" she adds. New owners will have to take a training course before the company allows them to fly.
There's also the TeTra Mk5, which uses a combination of rotors and fixed wings to power itself. It also carries just one person but is too heavy to be classed as ultralight. However, it comes as kit-aircraft so must be assembled by the new owner, meaning that TeTra can sell the vehicle in the US, at least, without having to obtain full aircraft certification.
""That's why we're producing the kit planes,"" says Tasuku Nakai, chief executive at TeTra.
Some companies however, are going for full aircraft certification which can be a long process. Including AIR, an Israeli firm, which is designing a two-seater eVTOL. Chief executive and co-founder Rani Plaut says his company has been working with the FAA for nearly two and a half years. The certification process takes so long partly because electric propulsion is a relatively new frontier for flying machines, he says.
AIR's vehicle, the AIR ONE, is designed to continue flying even if it loses one rotor, or a battery, for example. 
""If worst comes to worst, we have a ballistic parachute system,"" says Mr Plaut. He says the firm aims to deliver its first vehicles to customers in 2024, pending FAA certification.
Many of these vehicles still require hundreds of hours of test flights, to ensure they fly as intended. And it remains to be seen exactly how responsible their eager new owners will be when they take them out for a spin.
""We know that most aircraft accidents are caused by the user. Hopefully the manufacturers will put into place certain safeguards in the system to limit the ability for a user to put the aircraft in an unsafe operating condition,"" says Darrell Swanson, director of Swanson Aviation Consultancy.
The relatively easy route to market that these very small eVTOLs are taking will get them into people's hands quickly, and allow early adopters to have some fun, says Mr Swanson.
That's all well and good in the near-term, he says. But if these aircraft are to play a role in improving urban mobility for city populations, they will have to carry more passengers, complement public transport, and be more accessible. Otherwise, says Mr Swanson, ""the price will go up and it'll be seen as elitist.""
For now, Mr Ternstrom is happy to market the Jetson ONE purely as a recreational vehicle. It is for having fun, he says. After all, practically everyone has had that thrilling dream where they can fly.
""This thing makes that dream possible,"" he says. ""It's just awesome. I love it.""

319;Tonga volcano: Plume reached half-way to space;2022-01-21T16:15:56.000Z;[];['earth science', 'volcanoes', 'tonga volcano and tsunami', 'geology', 'tonga', 'climate change', 'space exploration'];['steam', 'reached', 'volume', 'volcano', 'plume', 'water', 'particles', 'space', 'magma', 'little', 'times', 'halfway', 'tonga', 'seawater', 'degrees', 'supercharge'];"
An indicator of the great power of last Saturday's volcanic eruption in Tonga is the height reached by its plume.
UK scientists examining weather satellite data calculate it to be around 55km (35 miles) above the Earth's surface.
This is at the boundary of the stratosphere and mesosphere layers in the atmosphere.
Dr Simon Proud, from RAL Space, said these were ""unheard-of altitudes"" for a volcanic plume.
The most powerful eruption in the second half of the 20th Century came from Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Its plume is thought to have climbed to roughly 40km.
However, it's possible today's more accurate satellites would have given a higher altitude for the Philippines event, cautioned Dr Proud, who is affiliated to the UK National Centre for Earth Observation.
To work out the position in the sky of the plume from Tonga's Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, data from three weather satellites - Himawari-8 (Japan) GOES-17 (USA) and GK2A (Korean) - was used.
""Because they're all at different longitudes, we can use the parallax between their views of the eruption to determine altitude. This is a pretty well established technique for storm cloud heights, and should actually work better here as the altitude [and hence parallax] is greater,"" Dr Proud told BBC News.
Only a small part of the cloud is seen to get to 55km. This is most likely water vapour, rather than ash, that was pushed upward at the head of the updraft. The main umbrella of the plume is at 35km. A lower plume feature is evident in the lowest layer of the atmosphere - the troposphere.
The so-called Kármán line, which is often quoted as the atmospheric boundary with outer space, is at 100km.
US space agency scientists calculated the explosive force to be equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, which would have made the Tonga event 500 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. 
Prof Shane Cronin, from Auckland University, New Zealand, believes a special set of conditions came together at the underwater volcano to drive a big explosion.
A key factor, he said, was the depth below the ocean surface at which gas-rich magma came into contact with seawater - at just 150-250m.
""When the magma came out, there was not much pressure on it [from the water above],"" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme on World Service Radio.
""The gases expanded and blasted the magma apart. And then, as those little fragments of hot magma at 1,100 degrees encountered the cold seawater at 20 degrees, it flashed the seawater around those particles into steam. And when you do that, when you flash water into steam, you basically expand the volume by 70 times. So you supercharge your eruption.""  
Early data suggests the Tonga event could have measured as high as five on the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). This would certainly make it the most powerful eruption since Pinatubo, which was classified at six on the eight-point scale.
The Philippines volcano famously dropped Earth's average global temperature by half a degree for a couple of years. It did this by injecting 15 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. SO2 combines with water to make a haze of tiny droplets, or aerosols, that reflect incoming solar radiation. 
However, Dr Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts at the UK Met Office, said Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai would not have the same effect.
""Pinatubo did have a noticeable effect, but the Hunga-Tonga volcano's emissions were more than 30 times smaller at less than half a million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, so we don't expect that to have a cooling effect, even though it made a huge bang when it went off,"" he explained.

320;Franco Mulakkal: Hundreds write to Kerala nun who lost rape case against bishop;2022-01-21T00:51:06.000Z;[];['sexual violence', 'rape in india', 'india'];['franco', 'supported', 'case', 'order', 'write', 'rape', 'mulakkal', 'underwent', 'need', 'nun', 'judge', 'kerala', 'sexual', 'survivor', 'bishop', 'nuns', 'lost', 'narrated', 'hundreds'];"
Letters of support have been pouring in for an Indian nun after a bishop she had accused of repeatedly raping her was cleared by a trial court last week.
For the past two days, my social media timeline has been full of handwritten messages of support for the 50-year-old nun  who had accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal of raping her 13 times between 2014 and 2016. 
Most of the posts are from women, including activists, feminists, journalists and celebrities in the southern state of Kerala and many contain hashtags such as #withthenuns and #avalkoppam - a Malayalam-language word which means ""with her"".
The letters pledge support to ""the nun in her fight for justice"" - sometimes they just carry words of encouragement or snatches of poetry, or contain drawings and artwork.
""In these dark times, you are that ray of hope to millions,"" one wrote quoting Emily Dickinson. Another quoted from Still I Rise, Maya Angelou's poem that's become an anthem for feminists across the world.
Many wrote in saying they ""believed"" her words even though the trial court judge did not.
The accusations of rape against Bishop Franco have made headlines in India. The case shocked one of the country's oldest Christian communities and sparked widespread protests after the nun alleged that the Catholic Church had ignored her complaints. 
A powerful priest, Bishop Franco was arrested only in 2018 after a group of nuns sat on a hunger strike outside the Kerala high court. The Vatican temporarily relieved him of his duties. A month later, he was freed on bail. 
Over the years, the woman had been shamed on social media and one local politician was chastised by the National Commission for Women after he described her as a ""prostitute"".
Bishop Franco denied the charges against him and last Friday a trial court in Kottayam city found him not guilty. 
Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) G Gopakumar said there were ""exaggerations and embellishments in the statement of the victim"" and the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the bishop. He also spoke of rivalry in the church.
""When it is not feasible to separate truth from falsehood, when grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up, the only available course is to discard the evidence in toto. This court is unable to place reliance on the testimony of the nun... so I acquit the accused,"" he added. 
The verdict shocked many, but once the 289-page order became publicly available, it led to massive outrage in India with many pointing out that the judge seemed to be questioning the woman's conduct and moral character.
""When I read the judgement, I was shell shocked. I have only two words to describe it: judicial porn,"" historian and feminist researcher J Devika told the BBC.
""The order was not just to exonerate the bishop, it was also to demoralise the survivor and the other nuns who had supported her. It contains graphic descriptions of sexual acts and assault as narrated by the nun. The judge even details a breast examination she underwent. What was the need for any of that?"" she added.
A former Kerala high court judge called the verdict ""a clear case of miscarriage of justice"" and many activists and lawyers criticised it for focusing on the woman's conduct. 
Many asked if there was an appropriate way for rape victims to behave and the case drew comparisons with the acquittal last year of former magazine editor Tarun Tejpal that led to accusations of victim shaming. 
In the case of the Kerala nun too, ASJ Gopakumar asked why she had not stayed back at her sister's home after attending a religious event there but returned to the convent with the accused.
The Indian Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that in rape cases, the judges must not comment on the behaviour or character of the woman and the only question they should ask is - did the accused commit rape?
""But you get the sense the nun was on trial here,"" says Ms Devika. 
""The judge completely ignored the social setting in which the alleged crime happened. In the church, even the senior-most nun has to defer to the junior-most priest. And Bishop Franco is a very powerful man. But the judge overlooked that power dynamic."" 
Now as the state readies to appeal against the order in the high court, there has been an outpouring of support for the nun.
""Some of us came together and said let's do something to support her and five other sisters who have been helping her, to keep their morale up,"" said Athira Sujatha, a public policy professional and activist and one of the organisers of the letter-writing campaign.
On Wednesday morning at 11am - the exact time on Friday when ASJ Gopakumar had pronounced his order in court - Athira posted a letter on Instagram announcing the campaign.
""Your steadfast support to upholding justice by talking truth to power has been an extraordinary feat of hope and courage - not just to the survivor in this particular case but to survivors, bystanders and witnesses everywhere,"" she wrote.
Within two hours, she told the BBC, they had received about 200 letters. In 24 hours, their numbers had exceeded 1,000. Many others shared their letters on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Many addressed their letters to ""Sister X"" (the nun) while many expressed gratitude to the ""Sisters"" - five nuns who have been a pillar of support for her.
Many of them wrote about their personal experiences, saying that the nun's fight had given them the courage to speak out too.
""Girls like me across this seemingly unjust land are praying for you... You are loved, respected and honoured. There 'will' be light at the end of this really dark tunnel,"" wrote popular singer Chinmayi Sripada. 
Filmmaker Geetu Mohandas wrote: ""It will by no means be an easy task, but you can, and indeed you will, survive this journey.""
One woman drew pencil sketches of the nuns with a message in Malayalam applauding them: ""Your courage and persistence is unparalleled. No movement to get justice is a lost cause.""
Athira says when they put out the message asking people to mail their letters, they were apprehensive about what sort of letters they would get. 
""But we have not received one single negative message. People understand that the sisters need our support and they are all offering encouragement and solidarity.""
In her letter written in Malayalam, Ms Devika compared the sisters to fireflies.
""There may be sceptics who say that the fireflies cannot beat the night... Please tell them... If millions of fireflies get together, they may beat this unending night,"" she wrote.

321;Afghan women taken from their homes after speaking out;2022-01-21T20:50:18.000Z;[];"['kabul', 'afghanistan', ""women's rights in afghanistan"", ""women's rights"", 'taliban']";['order', 'taken', 'taliban', 'detained', 'suhai', 'scenes', 'shooting', 'speaking', 'say', 'women', 'talibans', 'shaheen', 'homes', 'seek', 'afghan'];"
The Taliban can threaten with a whisper. After 20 years of violent struggle, and the loss of tens of thousands of civilian lives, they took power here using brutal force. 
Even so, Afghan women refuse to be intimidated. 
Tamana Zaryabi Paryani is one of those women. It takes raw courage to stand up to armed men who want to take away almost everything you have achieved in life. 
Last weekend, she joined dozens of others to demand the right to work and the right to an education. The protesters were pepper-sprayed by Taliban fighters, and a number said they had been stunned by electric shocks. 
After making their voices heard, they returned home. Some feared they had been followed. 
On Wednesday night, at 20:00, armed men entered Tamana Paryani's apartment block in Kabul's Parwan 2 neighbourhood. She was alone at home with her sisters. The men began to kick the door. 
""Please help, the Taliban have come to my house, my sisters are at home,"" Ms Paryani pleaded on a video posted to social media. 
""We don't want you here now,"" she screamed. ""Come back tomorrow, we can speak tomorrow,"" she pleaded. 
""You can't see these girls at this time of night. Help, the Taliban have come to my house,"" she said before the video ended.
Since the Taliban took power on 15 August, women have complained that they are now prisoners in their own homes. 
And even there they are not safe. It is a violation of Afghan culture to enter a home that contains only women. 
But having dismissed women police officers, the Taliban do not have female personnel available to question women. 
Tamana Paryani has been missing for two days now. I went to her apartment to try and trace her. 
There was no-one inside the home. A large muddy boot-print was still visible on the front door. 
Neighbours said Ms Paryani had been taken away along with two of her sisters, and no-one has been to the apartment since. They would say only that ""an armed group"" had taken the sisters.
Other women protesters were targeted that night. Another, Parawana Ibrahimkhel, is also missing. Still, the Taliban denied taking them. 
In an interview with the BBC on Thursday, Suhai Shaheen, who hopes to become the Taliban's ambassador to the UN, said: ""If [the Taliban] had detained them, they would say they have detained them, and if that is the allegation they will go to court and they will defend themselves... This is something legal, but if they are not detained, and they are making such fake scenes and shooting films in order to seek asylum abroad.""
This video can not be played
One of Miss Paryani's friends told a different story.
From a safe location, in an interview with the BBC, she said, ""I told her as soon as possible, leave your home, take this more seriously you are in danger… When I got home, a friend, also a protester - I don't want to mention her name - she was crying that Tamana had been arrested by the Taliban and that she had released a video on social media.""
It is not known if the authorities are looking for the women. 
Most of the world refuses to recognise the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. More than half the population is going hungry because of Western-imposed sanctions. 
Under Taliban rule Afghanistan has become the only country in the world which publicly limits education on the basis of gender, which is a major sticking point in the Taliban's quest for legitimacy, and in the lifting of sanctions. The regular protests by women highlighting the issue are a source of embarrassment to the group. 
Regardless of who has Tamara Paryani, her sisters and her friends, the Taliban are collectively punishing Afghan women. 
Over the past 20 years women here have cast off cultural and family prejudice to live more freely -  decades of progress the Taliban appear determined to destroy.

Firefighters in County Durham have come to the rescue of a toddler who got his head stuck in a toilet training seat.
The crew from Darlington removed the rim and freed Edward after his head got lodged in the potty.
""It was not your 'bog' standard rescue,"" said the County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service.
""Somehow, he had managed to get his training seat stuck round his head, but our crews got to work quickly and managed to release him in no time.""

Some 90 tonnes of US ""lethal aid"" has arrived in Ukraine, amid tensions over Russia's troop build-up on the border.
It was the first shipment of a recently approved package of US military aid for Ukraine, and included ammunition for ""front-line defenders"".
The delivery followed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv this week, where he warned of a tough response if Russia was to invade.
Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade Ukraine.
US President Joe Biden approved the $200m (£147.5m) security support package in December.
The US embassy in Kyiv said the shipment demonstrated its ""firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereign right to self-defense"".
""The United States will continue providing such assistance to support Ukraine's Armed Forces in their ongoing effort to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression,"" it wrote on Facebook.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov thanked the US for the aid.
The shipment arrived hours after Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart held what they called ""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine.
Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Since then, some 14,000 people have been killed and at least two million fled their homes because of fighting between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed rebels. A fragile peace agreement was made in 2015.
Now, the head of the military defence alliance Nato has warned there is a real risk of a fresh conflict in Europe after an estimated 100,000 Russian troops amassed on the border.
Moscow has denied it is planning an invasion, but President Vladimir Putin has issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. 
He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security.

338;Burkina Faso: Shots heard near presidential palace;2022-01-24T01:07:31.000Z;[];['burkina faso'];['presidential', 'shots', 'outrage', 'heard', 'raised', 'military', 'public', 'palace', 'faso', 'suspected', 'power', 'neighbouring', 'killing', 'jihadists', 'near', 'burkina', 'mali'];"
Shots have been heard near the presidential palace in Burkina Faso's capital amid a mutiny by soldiers. 
Gunfire has also been heard at several barracks in Ouagadougou, with soldiers demanding the sacking of military chiefs, and more resources to fight militant Islamists. 
Hundreds of people came out in support of the troops, forcing authorities to introduce a night time curfew. 
The government said the crisis had been contained. 
It dismissed rumours of a new coup attempt, just over a week after 11 soldiers were detained for allegedly plotting a coup. 
It is the latest sign of growing discontent with President Roch Kaboré's government over its failure to quell the Islamist insurgency that has devastated the West African state since 2015.
Protesters in support of the soldiers set fire to the ruling party's headquarters. 
Gunshots were heard at military camps in the west and south of the capital, and at an air base near the main airport. 
Soldiers convicted of a coup attempt in 2015 are imprisoned at the camp in the west, known as Sangoule Lamizana.
Shooting was also heard at military bases in the northern towns of Kaya and Ouahigouya, the US embassy said.
The mutineers made several demands, including: 
In a televised address to the nation earlier, Defence Minister Barthélémy Simporé said there were ""localised, limited"" incidents ""in a few barracks"", and none of the ""republican institutions"" had been targeted.
Gen Simporé urged people to continue with their normal activities, saying the government would release further information in due course.
The location of President Kaboré is unclear, but the defence minister denied rumours circulating on social media that he was under arrest.
Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said that access to the web had been disrupted.
The killing of 53 people by suspected jihadists in November heightened public outrage against the government, and raised fears that the military would take power - just as it had in neighbouring Mali in May.
On Saturday, dozens of people were arrested in Ouagadougou for holding a banned rally to protest against what they described as the government's inability to deal with the militants.
Mr Kaboré, a former banker and prime minister, became president after winning elections in 2015.
The polls were the first since long-serving ruler Blaise Compaoré went into exile a year earlier following a popular uprising against his rule.

340;The people deciding to ditch their smartphones;2022-01-24T00:27:05.000Z;[];['addiction', 'life', 'mobile phones', 'lifestyle', 'work-life balance'];['phones', 'scrolling', 'single', 'deciding', 'playground', 'smartphones', 'park', 'parent', 'moments', 'recalls', 'pivotal', 'ditch', 'mobile'];"
In a world where many of us are glued to our smartphones, Dulcie Cowling is something of an anomaly - she has ditched hers.
The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over Christmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and text messages.
She recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three: ""I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent - there was up to 20 - were looking at their phones, just scrolling away,"" she says.
""I thought 'when did this happen?'. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don't think you get to your death bed and think you should have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online.""
Ms Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her smartphone had built up during the Covid lockdowns.
""I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots of services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process."" 
She plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.
About nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world. And we are glued to them - one recent study found that the average person spends 4.8 hours a day on their handset.
Yet a small, but growing number of people, enough is enough. 
Alex Dunedin binned his smartphone two years ago. ""Culturally we have become addicted to these tools,"" says the educational researcher and technology expert. ""They are blunting cognition and impeding productivity.""
Mr Dunedin, who lives and works in Scotland, says another reason behind his decision was environmental concerns. ""We are wasting exponential amounts of energy producing exponential amounts of CO2 emissions,"" he says.
He has become happier and more productive since he stopped using a smartphone, he says. Mr Dunedin doesn't even have an old-fashioned mobile phone or even a landline anymore. He is instead only electronically contactable via emails to his home computer.
""It has improved my life,"" he says. ""My thoughts are freed up from constantly being cognitively connected to a machine that I need to feed with energy and money. I think that the danger of technologies is that they are emptying our lives.""
Lynne Voyce, a 53-year-old teacher and writer from Birmingham, has moved in the opposite direction - she started using a smartphone again last August after a break of six years.
She says she was reluctantly compelled to buy one again due to having to deal with QR codes in restaurants, and so-called Covid passports, plus making it easier to keep in touch with one of her daughters who lives in Paris.
But she plans to give up it up again, if she can. ""After the pandemic, and when Ella [her eldest daughter] isn't living abroad, I might try and give it up again. It sounds like an addiction, doesn't it?""
When Ms Voyce first abandoned her smartphone back in 2016 it was to help encourage her daughters to reduce the time they spent on their handsets.
""They were glued to their phones. I thought the only way to stop it was to get rid of my own phone. And it made all the difference.
""For example, we'd got to a restaurant, and they would no longer see me pick up my phone.""
Not having a smartphone ""took a lot of pressure off my brain"" she says, ""I didn't feel like I had to instantly answer things or be available when out"".
Yet, while some worry about how much time they spend on their handset, for millions of others they are a godsend.
""More than ever, access to healthcare, education, social services and often to our friends and family is digital, and the smartphone is an essential lifeline for people,"" says a spokesperson for UK mobile network Vodafone.
""We also create resources to help people get the most from their tech, as well as to stay safe when they're online - that's hugely important.""
However, Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says there is a strong link between heavy device usage and relationship issues, quality of sleep, our ability to switch off and relax, and concentration levels.
""Many people have a constant drip feed of requests coming their way via their device, many with a false sense of urgency.
""They feel unable to lay boundaries down, with the result that they feel compelled to check their emails and messages last thing at night and first thing in the morning.""
If getting rid of your smartphone seems too much but you are concerned that you spend too much time on it, there are other measures you can take to reduce your usage.
While it might initially seen counterintuitive, more apps are emerging to curtail mindless scrolling.
For example, Freedom lets you temporarily block apps and websites so you can focus more. And Off The Grid enables you to block off your phone for a certain time period.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Ms Burke says it would be useful if more people monitored how much time they spend on their smartphone. ""Starting to realise exactly how much time you're frittering away each day on your phone can be a powerful wake-up call and catalyst for change.""
She also advises carving out short periods when you have your phone switched off or left at home, and gradually increase the wait period till you check it again.
Finally, she recommends choosing an image or a word that represents what you would rather be doing - if only you had more time - as your phone's screensaver.
""Considering most of us check our phones 55 times per day and some of us even 100 times, this is a great visual reminder of a more valuable way to spend your precious time,"" she says.
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

A lone gunman is dead after injuring four people inside a lecture hall at Heidelberg University, German police have said.  
They said the gunman was in possession of a ""long gun"", and that a large operation including emergency services was under way at the university's campus in Neuenheimer Feld. 
Some of those wounded were seriously injured, police said on Twitter. 
Heidelberg is a university town in the southwest of Germany. 
Police have asked people to avoid the area so rescue workers and emergency services are able to move around freely. 
Germany has been hit in recent years by a spate of attacks, mostly carried out by jihadists or far-right militants.
The country has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, and school shootings are rare. Anyone under 25 is required to pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. 
German newspaper Bild reported that the shooter was a student at the university, and had opened fire in the lecture hall before turning the gun on himself.

The military in Burkina Faso says it has seized power and overthrown President Roch Kaboré. 
The announcement was made on state television by an army officer, who said both the government and parliament had been dissolved. 
Mr Kaboré's whereabouts are unclear, but the officer said that all those detained were in a secure location. 
The coup comes a day after troops seized barracks, and gunshots were heard in the capital. 
Earlier, the ruling People's Movement for Progress (PMP) party said that both Mr Kaboré and a government minister had survived an assassination attempt. 
On Sunday, mutinying troops demanded the sacking of military chiefs and more resources to fight Islamist militants.
The army statement cited the worsening security situation and Mr Kabore's alleged inability to unite the nation as reasons for overthrowing him, AFP news agency reports. 
The statement was issued in the name of a group not heard of previously, the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration or MPSR, its French acronym.
""MPSR, which includes all sections of the army, has decided to end President Kabore's post today,"" it said.

343;Indoor PM birthday event was held during lockdown, says No 10;2022-01-24T19:17:28.000Z;[];['keir starmer', 'boris johnson', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['event', 'trip', 'taken', 'room', 'johnson', 'surprise', 'lockdown', 'held', 'mr', 'official', 'school', 'birthday', 'place', 'indoor', 'returned'];"
Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place.
ITV News reports up to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake.
No 10 said staff had ""gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes"". 
Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings of more than two people.
ITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 2pm on 19 June 2020, adding that it had been a surprise for Mr Johnson after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire.
It also reported that family and friends had been hosted in the prime minister's residence that evening.
But a No 10 spokesperson said: ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the prime minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.""
Under the Covid restrictions at the time, up to six people could gather outside, in a socially distanced manner.
But gatherings inside of two or more people were still not permitted indoors, except for certain reasons such as work or education.
A No 10 spokesperson said: ""A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.""
But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This is yet more evidence that we have got a prime minister who believes that the rules that he made don't apply to him. 
""And so we have got a prime minister and a government who spend their whole time mopping up sleaze and deceit.""
Sir Keir also repeated his call for Mr Johnson to resign.
The reports of a party for the PM's birthday come as senior civil servant Sue Gray is compiling her report into gatherings on government premises during Covid restrictions.
It is expected to be published later this week.

348;Hippos can recognise their friends' voices;2022-01-24T18:41:19.000Z;[];['animals'];['strangers', 'tell', 'apart', 'recognise', 'unfamiliar', 'probably', 'neighbours', 'voices', 'researchers', 'telling', 'hippos', 'friends'];"
Wild hippos are noisy creatures, their calls travelling long distances across lakes and rivers.
But until now the precise function of the loud ""wheeze honks"" the animals make has been a mystery.
Scientists studying hippos at a nature reserve in Africa say the distinctive honks enable the large mammals to tell friend from foe.
And the team says the animals can probably recognise individuals from their ""voices"".
Study leader, Prof Nicolas Mathevon, from the University of Saint-Etienne, in France, has studied the sounds animals make across the world, from leopard seals to hyenas.
He said hippos have a wide vocal repertoire, including grunts, bellows, squeals and ""wheeze honks"", but very little is known about their social communication.
 ""In their call, there is information about the identity of the individual - so they have 'voices' - and they are able to recognise each other by their voices,"" he said. ""This recognition ability supports the social relationships between individuals.""
To find out more about hippo communication, French researchers recorded the sounds of hippos living in the Maputo Special Reserve in Mozambique.
The wheeze-honk is the most common hippo call and the loudest- travelling as far as 1km, according to the study.
The biologists recorded the wheeze-honks of hippos and broadcast these from the shore of lakes to see how other individuals responded.
They found hippos could tell apart friends, neighbours and strangers from their voices. In addition to telling apart friend from foe (or, at least, unfamiliar hippos), the animals can probably distinguish between individuals, according to the researchers - though they can't be absolutely certain of this.
And despite appearing to be lounging around on the water, the large mammals were clearly paying close attention to their surroundings and responded immediately to the broadcasts.
The animals responded more aggressively to unknown hippos - with quicker, louder and more frequent calls, often accompanied by territorial displays of dung spraying.
Prof Mathevon said it was important to learn more about the biology and behaviour of hippos to help avoid human-animal conflicts.
The knowledge might also assist with conservation, he said, as wild hippos are sometimes moved from one location to another to keep local populations healthy.
The work may inspire conservationists to make recordings to allow local hippos to get used to the voice of the new ones before they arrive, he added.
Hippos are not yet endangered in the wild, but their numbers are plummeting fast. They are a source of animal-human conflict, with hippos causing hundreds of human deaths a year.
The research is published in Current Biology.

Some people are prepared to stand for hours in the freezing cold on a winter's night to watch and capture the Northern Lights. Meet the aurora hunters.
Michelle Cumming has been fascinated with the Northern Lights since she saw the phenomenon for the first time in September 2020.
""I've made last minute dashes in my unicorn PJs,"" says the 42-year-old, who lives in Moray on Scotland's north east coast 
""And I've had my backpack and flask prepared to go aurora hunting.
""I often take my dog Dexter with me, wrapping him up in a fleece blanket while we stand and watch the aurora. There have been several 1am excursions.""
Michelle, who works in admin at Moray Council, says her first encounter was during a walk on a beach at Lossiemouth.
""That night blew me away,"" she says. ""Not only did the aurora show but it danced.
""What I remember most vividly from that night is not only my awe at seeing such a sight, it was the chorus of wonder from the spectators in the darkness further down the promenade.""
The aurora is a natural phenomena caused by geomagnetic storms from the Sun. It can appear in the sky as rays of light which shimmer and ""dance"".
Dark autumn and winter nights offer the best chance of seeing displays - if skies are clear - and there are websites, apps and social media groups providing forecasts and alerts for when they might occur.
In the UK, Scotland is one of the best places to see the aurora but powerful displays have also been visible from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Aberdeenshire-based Jacquie Murray also tries to see the aurora whenever possible.
""I first encountered the aurora in 1986 driving a bus from Aberdeen to Peterhead,"" she says.
""I stopped the bus to allow the passengers to see it.""
Jacquie, a health and safety inspector with an energy company, took a keen interest in photography six years ago - mainly to capture images of the aurora.
She says: ""I have at times seen myself standing in the freezing cold in minus temperatures a good four to six hours either waiting or watching.
""You have to be keen and willing to drive to areas where there is little or no light pollution, check for clear skies, be patient - and look north.""
Chris Cogan is among the lucky ones who can see the aurora pretty much from his doorstep, living in the small community of Muie in Sutherland in the Highlands.
The 54-year-old joiner says: ""I sometimes go out for 15 minutes, take a few photos and go back in as the conditions or aurora are not the best. 
""Some nights I will watch the green arc of the aurora form, grow bigger and spread nearer to me and I will wait until she 'lets go' - aurora spotters' term for when it starts dancing and putting up huge beams.
""This can be a few hours waiting.""
Chris says some people may have seen the aurora without realising it.
""To the human eye they're just white light, like fog with stars on the horizon, but a camera or phone pick up the colour,"" he says.
""Some very powerful auroras, the human eye can see the green or orange.""
Alan Tough, an Elgin-based whisky industry chartered engineer, is another keen Northern Lights photographer.
He has been interested in astronomy since he was a boy, and remembers staying up to watch Neil Armstrong take his first steps on the moon.
Alan is a member of the British Astronomical Association and regularly sends reports and photographs to its aurora section. Like some other aurora hunters, he also frequently submits images to BBC Weather Watchers.
He says: ""Despite growing up under the dark skies of Speyside, I didn't see my first aurora until, probably, the late 1990s. 
""I've been seriously photographing the aurora ever since I got my first digital camera back in 2003.""
He has also seen the lights in Canada, Iceland and Norway - and he and his wife were almost shipwrecked while sailing back from the Arctic Circle on a Northern Lights cruise in 2019.
There are always eager new recruits to the band of people prepared to put up with freezing weather to catch a glimpse of the lights' ethereal glow.
Among them is Desiree Ventura, 33, who lives in Aberdeen - a city with a song about the aurora.
""I've been hunting the aurora for a couple of years now,"" says the content creator and amateur photographer, who is originally from Italy.
Last year, she photographed the lights for the first time but the display was only visible as a faint glow on her camera.
Then earlier this month she saw it for the first time with her own eyes from near Newburgh on the Aberdeenshire coast.
""It was such a strong event and the whole display was clearly visible to the naked eye. I was so excited,"" says Desiree.
""The show lasted for over an hour, but it was so spectacular that I didn't even realise I had been standing there for that long.""
Dawid Gierszewski, a 46-year-old window cleaner, has seen the aurora from Aberdeen beach.
He says: ""The aurora is a wonderful sight. It is evidence of how beautifully the world was created.
""Sometimes I stay outside for three to four hours waiting for or watching the aurora.""
The solar activity behind the aurora peaks in cycles of about every 11 years, and Caithness Astronomy Group chairman Gordon Mackie says the next few years could offer more opportunities for seeing it.
The 53-year-old chemist, who lives in Thurso, says: ""With the next peak due in a couple of years time we should see a good number of displays over the next four years. 
""For a few years around solar activity peak, sightings from the north of Scotland are fairly common.
""During the last peak in activity I was seeing the aurora more than 30 times a year.""
And he added: ""A good display is a magical sight likely to be remembered for a very long time. 
""I've seen it fill the entire sky numerous times - you look up in awe, mesmerised by the dancing lights.""

352;Climate change: 'Fragile win' at COP26 summit under threat;2022-01-24T17:56:25.000Z;[];['intergovernmental panel on climate change', 'cop26', 'paris climate agreement', 'climate change'];['climate', 'slip', 'seized', 'presidency', 'change', 'threat', 'summit', 'nations', 'mitigated', 'trust', 'risks', 'instead', 'opportunities', 'fragile', 'win', 'cop26', 'uk'];"
COP26 President Alok Sharma has warned that progress made during the summit is at risk of ""withering on the vine"".
Mr Sharma said that the agreements reached at the Glasgow climate meeting had been a ""fragile win"" for the world.
But unless the commitments made are turned into action this year, the chances of keeping global temperatures in check will be lost. 
Quoting from the popular film, Don't Look Up, he said this was no time to ""sit tight and assess"".
The UN's COP26 climate summit in November ended with a deal being struck in a bid to stave off severe climate change. This pact was the first ever UN climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases.
But the pledges didn't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C, seen by scientists as the threshold for dangerous impacts from global warming.
Twelve weeks to the day after the start of COP26 (so named because it was the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties), Alok Sharma delivered his first major speech since the gathering, at a Chatham House event in Central London. 
Mr Sharma is essentially in charge of the negotiations process until the next major conference, COP27, in Egypt in November. 
He highlighted the fact that, despite the pandemic, and frayed international relations, countries had worked together at COP26 to deliver the Glasgow Climate Pact.
That agreement, he said, was a significant achievement. 
In Glasgow, countries had agreed to return with new and improved carbon-cutting plans for 2030 by the time of the next major summit in Egypt in November.
The hope is that every nation will increase their national efforts in line with limiting global warming below 1.5C.
Mr Sharma also underlined the progress made in Glasgow on getting rid of the most polluting fossil fuel. 
""When my team and I were deliberating on whether we should aim to consign coal power to history, I was warned we would never get the word 'coal' in a COP text,"" Mr Sharma said. 
 ""Yet every country at COP has agreed to phase-down coal power.""
But the achievements in Glasgow will not survive if global leaders don't take concrete action this year, he explained.
""Unless we honour the promises made, to turn the commitments in the Glasgow Climate Pact into action, they will wither on the vine,""Mr Sharma told the audience. 
""We will have mitigated no risks. We will have seized no opportunities. Instead, we will have fractured the trust built between nations. And 1.5C will slip from our grasp. So my absolute focus for the UK presidency year is delivery.""
Mr Sharma outlined four key priorities for this year, the first of which involves getting countries to increase their actions on cutting carbon. He would be concentrating on getting the richer G20 group of nations to do more. 
There must also be a renewed focus on helping countries to adapt to climate change, and to make advances on the issue of loss and damage. 
Money was critical to progress, he reiterated.
Come November, leaders of the richer countries must be able to show that the $100bn (£74bn) promised every year from 2020 would finally be delivered. 
At a number of points in his speech, Mr Sharma referred to the South African deal put together at COP26. 
Countries, including the UK, are stumping up the cash for South Africa to transition away from coal. Mr Sharma indicated that this approach may well be used again.
""Where we can support them, as we're doing with South Africa, in going from coal to a clean energy transition, that's something that developed countries are going to have to do, increasingly.""

Thirty days after it was launched, the James Webb telescope has arrived at the position in space where it will observe the Universe.
The Lagrange Point 2, as it's known, is a million miles (1.5 million km) from Earth on its nightside.
Webb was finally nudged into an orbit around this location thanks to a short, five-minute thruster burn.
Controllers back on Earth will now spend the coming months tuning the telescope to get it ready for science.
Key tasks include switching on the observatory's four instruments, and also focusing its mirrors - in particular, its 6.5m-wide segmented primary reflector.
""There's a pretty intensive effort to take all of those 18 segments from their current state and get them to act as one big mirror, and also to get the secondary mirror into its optimised condition,"" explained Charlie Atkinson, the chief engineer on Webb at Northrop Grumman, the American aerospace company that co-led the telescope's development with the US space agency (Nasa).
""We do this using the science images, which is why we need to get the science instruments activated and checked out with some initial calibration work,"" he told BBC News.
Webb, billed as the successor to the famous Hubble Space Telescope, was launched on 25 December by an Ariane-5 rocket from French Guiana.
Its overarching goals are to take pictures of the very first stars to shine in the Universe and to probe far-off planets to see if they might be habitable.  
Europe's Ariane-5 gave the new observatory a near-perfect trajectory and velocity to get it out to L2. Even so, two course correction burns were necessary, with the third on Monday tipping Webb into its planned parking position.

The Lagrange Point 2 is one of five gravitational ""sweet-spots"" around the Sun and Earth where satellites can hold their position with few orbital adjustments, thus conserving fuel.
The other advantage is that Webb will not experience at L2 the big swings in temperature and light endured by space telescopes positioned much closer to Earth. 
This is vital for the mission. It's designed to view the cosmos in infrared light and must maintain therefore constant super-cold conditions for its hardware.
Infrared light has waves that are just longer than those of visible light. ""Seeing"" in the infrared will allow the telescope to, for example, look through dust to the see stars that would otherwise be obscured.
Webb will now circle L2, keeping the Earth and the Sun in a near-straight line.
""L2 is pseudo-stable,"" said Jean-Paul Pinaud, who leads the Northrop engineers that keep Webb on track.
""The flight operations team is preparing routine station-keeping burns. They'll be doing those every 20 days or so with the trajectory calculations provided by our flight dynamics team. We'll set them up in a similar way, and then fire the thruster. But the burns will be quite small.""
Hidden behind a big sunshield, Webb's optics and instruments will soon cool to about -230C (some sections of the telescope are already there). When that happens, controllers will switch on Webb's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to take a picture of a test star to begin the process of aligning the big mirror.
""We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned,"" said Nasa instrument systems engineer Begoña Vila. 
""But we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations.
""It's a long process. It can take up to three months during commissioning, and we are ready to do that,"" she told BBC News.
Focusing involves driving small actuators, or motors, on the back of the 18 segments of the primary mirror to harmonise their curvature. The current misalignment, which is measured in millimetres, will be brought down to one measured in nanometres - a factor of a million improvement.
Similar adjustments will be applied to the 74cm-diameter secondary reflector which sits out in front of the primary mirror and is used to bounce light back towards the instruments.
So far, the Webb mission has not put a step wrong. The launch and journey out to L2 passed off without incident.
And even the complex business of unfolding the telescope after it came off the top of the Ariane rocket was made to look like the easiest of rehearsals.
""We were thrilled with the precision and success of all those deployments,"" said Kyle Hott, the mission systems engineering lead at Northrop.
""It's pretty incredible to think that it was all just a concept on paper decades ago, and now it's actually here, arriving at L2. Morale is high and we're so very excited.""

Six people are reported to have been killed and dozens hurt in a crush outside a stadium hosting an Africa Cup of Nations match in Cameroon.
Video footage showed football fans struggling to get access to the Paul Biya stadium in a neighbourhood of the capital Yaounde.
Naseri Paul Biya, governor of Cameroon's central region, said there may be more casualties, AP News said.
Another report said a number of children had lost consciousness.
The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 but because of Covid restrictions it was not meant to be more than 80% full.
Match officials were quoted as saying that some 50,000 people were trying to attend.
Nurse Olinga Prudence told AP that some of the injured were in a ""desperate condition"".
The last 16 match between Cameroon and Comoros took place despite the incident and ended with a 2-1 win for the hosts.

Taylor Swift has criticised Damon Albarn, lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, after he said that she doesn't write her own music. 
Talking to the LA Times, Albarn replied to the interviewer calling Swift ""an excellent songwriter"" by stating ""she doesn't write her own songs"".
Swift responded on Twitter: ""I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this."" 
""I write all of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and so damaging."" 
Albarn said in the interview that he prefers Billie Eilish, who he called a ""really interesting songwriter"".
""I'm more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It's just darker - less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she's exceptional.""
Eilish co-writes her songs with her brother, producer Finneas.
When the interviewer said that Swift co-writes her music, Albarn responded: ""That doesn't count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I'm not hating on anybody, I'm just saying there's a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes.""
There was a swift backlash on Twitter, including from producer Jack Antonoff, who has worked with Swift extensively. 
Albarn later apologised, writing to Swift on Twitter: ""I totally agree with you. I had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologise unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand.""
This is not the first time Albarn has caused controversy when criticising pop stars. He once reportedly called Adele ""insecure"" after they had worked together on music that was never released. 
""It ended up being one of those 'don't meet your idol' moments,"" she later told Rolling Stone. 
""And the saddest thing was that I was such a big Blur fan growing up. But it was sad, and I regret hanging out with him.""
Albarn later denied calling her insecure, stating the reports were concocted from someone overhearing a conversation with a friend.

356;Climate change threatening buried UK treasures;2022-01-25T00:08:48.000Z;[];['archaeology', 'peatlands', 'climate change'];['climate', 'quite', 'preserved', 'opportunity', 'potential', 'change', 'state', 'pretty', 'used', 'buried', 'threatening', 'place', 'thrown', 'treasures', 'uk', 'romans'];"
Climate change is threatening to destroy treasures buried in the UK as the soils that protect them dry out. 
A Roman toilet seat, the world's oldest boxing glove, and the oldest handwritten letter by a woman are some of the extraordinary objects discovered in at-risk British peatlands.
It means climate change could undermine our understanding of our past, say archaeologists.
About 22,500 archaeological sites in UK may be in danger.
The problem is that changing weather patterns are drying out some peatlands - the waterlogged soils that cover about 10% of the UK.
Because peat contains very little oxygen, organic materials like wood, leather and textiles do not rot. They can survive for thousands of years, preserved by the stable anoxic chemistry of the soil. 
But if the soils dry, oxygen can enter the system, kick-starting the process of decomposition. If that happens artefacts can, quite quickly, rot away.
Excavating these potentially huge sites could cost hundreds of millions of pounds and take decades, by which time they may have been badly damaged.
The trustees of Magna, a Roman fort alongside Hadrian's Wall, fear the process is already under way at the site.
The warnings come as celebrations for the 1,900th anniversary of the start of construction of the wall begin this week.  
The land at Magna has subsided by up to a metre in places in the past decade. It is evidence of ""desiccation"" - the drying of the peat layer - fears Dr Andrew Birley, the chief archaeologist at the site.
It means ""an historical time capsule"" is at risk, he says, because only a tiny part of the site has so far been excavated. 
""This place has the potential to be quite frankly, amazing,"" Dr Birley believes. ""Pretty much everything the Romans used here for 300 or 400 years could have been preserved in more or less the same state it was thrown away, which is an incredible opportunity.""
Another fort a few miles along Hadrian's Wall gives an idea of the astonishing objects that could lie hidden at Magna. 
Digs at Vindolanda have uncovered the world's oldest boxing gloves - so well-preserved that you can still see the imprint of the boxer's knuckles on one. 
More Roman footwear has been discovered here than at any other site in the world.
It is also the source of the oldest handwritten message by a woman found anywhere.
In the note, Claudia Severa, the wife of the commanding officer of a nearby fort, invites her friend Lepidina to her birthday party on 11 September about 1,900 years ago.
""Oh how much I want you at my birthday party,"" writes Claudia. ""You'll make the day so much more fun. I do so hope you can make it. Goodbye, sister, my dearest soul.""  
Day-to-day objects like this provide a unique connection to the lives of ordinary people in ancient times.
""This sort of stuff doesn't normally survive, "" says Dr Birley, who works at both sites. ""It can give us amazing insights into what life was really like here on the Northern frontier almost 2,000 years ago.""
He says the priority at Magna now is to try to work out what is happening underground.
Boreholes have been dug, and electronic equipment measures the water flow and temperature every hour. 
At Teesside University, Dr Gillian Taylor is analysing the chemicals in soil cores from the site to try to understand the processes at work.
It would be a ""catastrophe"" for any organic artefacts if the peat dries, she says. ""The risk is they will disappear. We will lose our heritage if we don't look at what's occurring now.""
Fearing the worst, Dr Birley is planning to dig the first test trenches at the site next year. As a small charity, it's the earliest they can start given the cost and labour needed.
He says if it looks like the condition of the peat is changing rapidly and the treasures could be lost, a full excavation may be necessary.
And changing weather patterns are not just threatening the survival of Roman remains. Experts estimate that there are about 22,500 archaeological sites in or beneath peat in the UK.
Dr Rosie Everett, of Northumbria University, is part of a team that has been assessing the effect of climate change on peatland archaeology across the UK.
She says a host of historic sites in peatlands are under threat, covering the entire sweep of the country's history.
There are Palaeolithic pathways up to 12,000 years old, and Bronze Age burial sites as well as the remains of more modern settlements and industrial activities.
""Peatlands represent such a small part of the ecology of Britain, but they have massive potential to tell us about our past,"" says Dr Everett.
While an archaeologist working at a ""dry"" site might find 10% of what was once there, at a peatland site they may find as much as 90% of the material culture of ancient communities, say archaeologists.
""The loss of peatlands would have big implications for the understanding of the country's history but also for our climatic history and our environmental history,"" says Dr Everett.
That's why she believes there should be greater efforts to protect them.
Dr Birley agrees. ""If we lose places like this, we lose that direct connection to the people who lived in this island 2000 years ago,"" he says. 
""We lose the chance to learn as much as we can about them. And we lose part of our own heritage and part of our own history.""

The Metropolitan Police have launched an investigation into parties held in No 10 during the coronavirus pandemic.
Commissioner Cressida Dick said they were looking into ""potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations"" in Downing Street and Whitehall since 2020. 
She said the investigation was launched as a ""result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team"", led by civil servant Sue Gray.  
The Cabinet Office said Ms Gray's own inquiry would continue.
But it is not yet clear if the police investigation will lead to delays in its publication.
The news comes after fresh allegations of a birthday party being held for the PM in June 2020.
Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place.
But ministers have disputed the number of people attending, and called for ""patience"" while Ms Gray's inquiry is carried out to establish the facts. 
The first thing is to have a sense of proportion.
When you hear the words ""Met Police, investigation, criminal, Downing Street"" that sounds incredibly dramatic.
This is a big development in this story but we are talking about the potential issuing of fixed penalty notices - fines - we are not talking about big criminal trials or people going to prison.
So it is important to keep that sense of perspective.
There are also lots of things we don't know about this police investigation. 
We don't know how many of those high-profile parties are now being investigated and crucially we don't know if they were parties attended by the prime minister. 
We don't know if the prime minister is in the frame for being interviewed by the police.
So, lots of unanswered questions but it means this is going to rumble on at a much higher volume for a lot longer.

362;Ukraine: How will we know if war has started?;2022-01-25T11:09:57.000Z;[];['ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['available', 'ukraine', 'know', 'started', 'look', 'light', 'conflict', 'moscow', 'used', 'toolkit', 'war', 'need'];"
Everyone is trying to second-guess President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. The US is pulling embassy staff out as fears rise of looming conflict. But maybe it's already started, writes security and defence expert Jonathan Marcus.
The risk of an all-out war between Russia and Ukraine dominates the headlines. 
All the obvious questions are being asked. Will Russia attack? Is President Vladimir Putin determined upon war come what may? Or can diplomacy secure peace?
But we cannot see inside President Putin's mind.
So here's another question - how will we know when hostilities commence? 
The answer seems obvious. 
Clearly massed Russian tank formations crossing Ukraine's frontiers, or a massive rocket barrage or air strikes against Ukrainian positions, would mark a dramatic escalation in the crisis and a shift to a new phase of the conflict. 
The first alarms will come from the Ukrainian military itself, but Western satellites and intelligence-gathering aircraft may well spot the preparations for an imminent offensive. 
There will probably be clear signs of an impending onslaught, says Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the US-based Center for Naval Analyses.
Among them are ""the manning of formations"", he says, since a lot of what has been deployed is heavy equipment rather than the troops themselves. Other signs could be ""the dispersal of forces, an influx of logistical and support elements, and a shift in fixed-wing and rotary aviation"".
This video can not be played
But the question can also be answered in another way and for this we need to stand back and view the Russian campaign against Ukraine in its entirety.  
We need to look at the full toolkit available to Moscow and assess how it is being used. And in this light, when you ask -  how will we know if the conflict has started  - then the answer may be that it already has.
Hostilities have actually been under way for some years.
Let's start from where we are. 
Russia already occupies Crimea - part of Ukraine - and it provides practical assistance to anti-Kiev rebels in the Donbas region. 
Indeed it was the intervention of Russian armoured and mechanised units against Ukrainian forces in 2014 that prevented the pro-Russian rebels' defeat. Sporadic fighting has continued ever since. All sides supposedly support an international peace effort there, but little progress has been made.
Beyond this pressure there is also the threat to employ overwhelming military force.
The build-up of Russian combat formations around Ukraine's borders is extraordinary.  This includes a significant deployment of forces to Belarus - which also shares a border with Ukraine - which might provide a closer jumping-off point for an assault towards the Ukrainian capital Kiev itself.
This build-up is referred to by Russian spokesmen as an exercise and in no sense threatening. But its scale, the nature of the units deployed, and the gradual arrival of supplies and other ""enablers"" suggest that this is much more than routine manoeuvres.
Analysts have followed the build-up using civilian satellite photos. Numerous phone videos have been put online showing trains of equipment heading towards Ukraine or Belarus. And assessments of social media postings, correlated with the units seen to be on the move, provide a remarkable insight into what is going on. 
Irrespective of what Moscow may say, Ukraine and its friends in the West have every reason to be worried.
The next tool available to Moscow is an attempt to influence the narrative. 
On the one hand Russia says it is not preparing for war, though it very much looks as though it is. But, just as importantly,  it has a story to tell - a narrative - where far from Ukraine being the victim, it is in fact Russia itself that is threatened. 
This is the substance of the documents handed over to the US which seek to halt and in some ways reverse Nato expansion and create a new sphere of influence for Moscow.
While some aspects of Russia's concerns, like talks on strategic and other weapons systems, are widely seen as a good idea, on Nato enlargement it is unlikely to get any change - and it probably knows this.
But the narrative has another purpose too. It is the story that Russia tells to try to shape the way the whole Ukraine crisis is discussed, not just by Western governments or its own citizens, but by you and me, reading and writing this.
By all fair and rigorous independent analysis Russia is preparing for war with Ukraine, whatever its official spokesmen may say.  
There are other possibilities in the Russian toolbox too. Cyber-attack and subversion, for example. Ukraine certainly has been the subject of the former. Just over a week ago a number of government websites were hit though it was far from clear where the attack came from. 
More recently the UK Government has claimed evidence that Moscow has selected individuals to form a new government in Kiev - though whatever the suspicions, there has been no conclusive public evidence confirming Moscow's hand in such activities. 
Michael Kofman says that a cyber element could be an important part of any Russian attack, because they can cripple critical infrastructure and disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate a military effort.
When Russia seized Crimea we heard a lot of talk about ""hybrid"" and ""grey-zone warfare"" and the alleged deniability of the operation, whose participants, though uniformed, wore no military insignia. 
But there was no doubt who these troops were. And Crimea was seized with old-fashioned military force, rather than by some esoteric deception.
What is under way at present is the essence of ""grey-zone warfare"" - the blurring of the boundary between peace and war. 
That's not how we tend to view things in the West. 
But the Russian military has articulated a sophisticated doctrine that sees war and peace as a continuum where different tools are applied at different stages, sometimes in sequence, sometimes together, though with the same strategic aim.  
And that ultimately is why the conflict has already been joined. The only question is how far along the ""grey zone"" continuum President Putin is willing to go.

Pfizer and BioNTech have started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.
The companies plan to test the protection gained from the new vaccine as a booster jab and as three separate jabs in unvaccinated people.
More than 1,400 adults are expected to be enrolled in the trial, likely to be in the United States.
US company Moderna is planning to begin trials of its own Omicron-specific shot soon.
Oxford University and AstraZeneca have also started working on a new version of their vaccine.
Vaccine developers had always planned to tweak their original Covid vaccines as new variants emerged, but the arrival of the fast-spreading Omicron strain in the last two months has hastened that process.
Many countries have now offered a booster or third dose of their original vaccine, which has been shown to provide a good level of protection against serious illness and death - even against Omicron.
But protection against infection and mild symptoms is much lower and could decline more quickly.
""Staying vigilant against the virus requires us to identify new approaches for people to maintain a high level of protection, and we believe developing and investigating variant-based vaccines, like this one, are essential in our efforts towards this goal,"" said Kathrin U. Jansen, senior vice-president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer. 
Prof Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, said new data indicated that ""vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild to moderate disease wanes more rapidly than was observed with prior strains"".
""This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as it did with earlier variants, but with longer duration of protection.""
The companies say they expect to produce four billion doses of their Covid-19 vaccine this year, and this number will include doses of the updated vaccine if trials suggest it is needed.
In the trial of the new vaccine, 615 adults will receive two doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, followed by one or two doses of the Omicron-targeted jab.
A second group of 600 who received three doses of the current vaccine will get another of the current one or the Omicron vaccine.
Finally, a small group of 200 unvaccinated adults will receive three doses of the new Omicron-targeted shot.

In our series of letters from African writers, Algerian-Canadian football journalist Maher Mezahi, who is in Cameroon to cover the Africa Cup of Nations, reflects on how the recent deaths of fans at a stadium has left him with mixed feelings about the tournament.
When I was first asked to do a piece about my impressions about the tournament in Cameroon, I had wanted to compile a list of the things that make it so special and sets it apart from other major football competitions.
I was planning to celebrate African football. 
After all, Afcon is a special tournament, adored by everyone on the continent and intrinsically linked to pan-African values.
The first two in 1957 and 1959, for example, were used in part as a statement against apartheid in South Africa.
Players, fans and journalists have all spoken about how it is closer to the true spirit of football, rather than the more sanitised and corporate tournaments elsewhere. 
There is also the warm and friendly atmosphere as well as the pride that Afcon creates in all countries across the continent. 
Amongst the positive things are the medical protocols to deal with Covid-19, including pulmonary scans.
These are among the strictest in world football and intended to prevent any medical emergencies.
On the terraces, everyone lauds the carnival-like atmosphere that African football supporters manage to generate. 
Recognisable super fans are present at every biennial championship. 
Take Tunisia's ""Reda The Elephant"", who covers his belly in body paint and has the best goal reactions, or Ivory Coast's ""Petit Bamba"", who orchestrates the National Elephants' Supporters Committee dance moves.
""The atmosphere is so pure,"" says Alex Cizmic, an Italian freelance journalist, who has often been amazed at the relaxed atmosphere around the teams.
""In 2019 in Egypt, I was fortunate enough to attend one of the Uganda Cranes' training sessions. When it was over, I had a chat with star striker Farouk Miya, who I had never met before,"" he recalls in a surprised tone. 
""Then I arranged a quick call with his former coach Milutin Sredojevic, who I was in contact with. It all felt very familial."" 
And smaller nations have shone.
The Gambia and Comoros were debutants in this edition of the tournament, and they have done their nations proud.
Before The Gambia played their first match against Mauritania, I asked a Gambian friend to write down what he felt as the anthem was playing.
""I felt a real sense of pride, love for country, and honour hearing the Gambian national team anthem for the first time,"" he said.
""When the first goal went in, I couldn't do anything. Deep inside of me I was just proud, knowing what the goal means. It really united our country.""
But in one evening, all of the positive aspects of the Afcon have been overshadowed by a tragedy of unspeakable proportions.
As hosts Cameroon were set to play their second round match against Comoros at the new Olembé Stadium in the capital, Yaoundé, a bottleneck began to build outside. 
At around 19:30 local time, just half an hour before kick-off, thousands of fans were stuck in a crush that ended up killing eight people, including an eight-year-old boy, according to Cameroonian authorities. 
I had arrived at the stadium earlier in the afternoon, but even several hours before the match started, the incessant cordoning off of spectators was irritating. 
I have been to football matches in seven African countries and every time I make the same observation: there are so many police officers and so little safety.
For a stadium with a capacity of 60,000, it seemed extremely odd that journalists, supporters and everyone who was not a VIP were being ushered in through the same gate outside the campus. 
This video can not be played
Covid-19 testing and screening for vaccines further slowed down passage into the stadium. 
I did not know what had transpired until late in the second half when a colleague nudged me in the ribs and whispered: ""There's trouble outside.""
We ran out, but there was nothing to see. 
The only evidence of any problems was a handful of shoes and articles of clothing strewn on the ground.
A few minutes later rumours of deaths began filtering through. 
In the press room, journalists began sharing documents that listed the victims as well as videos of the tragedy. 
The following morning the Confederation of African Football (Caf) accepted shared responsibility for the incident and presented its condolences to the families. 
But matches were not postponed and the tournament is continuing. 
I do not think games should have taken place on Tuesday - the day after the tragedy. 
It seemed disrespectful to the families, and everyone involved in the competition is still trying to process what happened.
It does not feel like a time to talk about or celebrate football.

Boris Johnson has vowed to fight on as prime minister after facing fresh calls to quit over lockdown parties in Downing Street.
MPs are still waiting to see the findings of civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into the events, which had been expected on Wednesday. 
At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to keep a promise to publish the report in full.
Mr Johnson replied that he would ""do exactly what I said"".
Downing Street has said it is their ""intention"" to publish the report in the format in which Mr Johnson receives it.
The BBC understands that Ms Gray's report is essentially completed, but she has not yet sent it to the prime minister.
It seems likely MPs may have to wait until Thursday - or beyond - to see the report.
Mr Johnson has said he will give the opposition parties time to study its contents before he makes a Commons statement on it. 
Separately, the Metropolitan Police have launched an inquiry into potential Covid-law breaking in Downing Street, after being handed details of parties by Sue Gray.
At a stormy Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the prime minister had previously told MPs that ""all guidance was followed"" in Downing Street over gatherings during Covid lockdowns.
The Labour leader added: ""So since he acknowledges the ministerial code [governing standards of behaviour and forbidding ministers from misleading the Commons] applies to him, will he now resign?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""No.""
He accused Sir Keir of being ""relentlessly opportunistic throughout"" the pandemic by shifting his position on lockdowns, whereas he had got all the big decisions right.
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle had to step in several times to calm shouting MPs down, threatening some with expulsion from the chamber. 
Amid continued noise, Sir Keir said: ""The prime minister's continual defence is 'Wait for the Sue Gray report'. On 8 December he told this House, 'I will place a copy of the report in the library of the House of Commons'.
""His spokesperson has repeatedly stated that means the full report, not parts of the report, not a summary of the report, not an edited copy. So, can the prime minister confirm that he will publish the full Sue Gray report as he receives it?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""We've got to leave the report to the independent investigator, as he knows, of course when I receive it, I will do exactly what I said.""
The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, asked Conservative MPs to ""show the prime minister the door"" by triggering a leadership contest.
Mr Johnson has previously apologised for attending a ""bring-your-own-booze"" event in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, during the first lockdown, saying he thought it was a ""work event"".
Reports of a birthday party held for Mr Johnson in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 have also come to light this week.
Some Tory MPs have already demanded Mr Johnson's resignation, but many others say they are waiting for the Gray report before deciding whether to submit letters of no confidence in him.
At least 54 of them must write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, to set up a vote on the prime minister's future.
Currently, if a vote of confidence in the prime minister is triggered there cannot be another one for 12 months. 
The committee does not have plans to change the rules to allow two confidence votes within a year, despite reports this proposal had been considered. 
Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, repeated his staunch defence of the PM, insisting the reported gatherings were work events. 
He added: ""If people are working all day, they have got to eat, they have got to have lunch, they must be allowed to have a cup of coffee during the day."" 
Asked whether that needed to be wine and cake, which was said to be served at the events, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ""This issue about do people have [an alcoholic] drink when they are working is not absolutely set in stone one way of the other.""
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

375;Ukraine: What sanctions could be imposed on Russia?;2022-01-27T11:31:16.000Z;[];['russia', 'ukraine conflict'];['west', 'tradeoffs', 'ukraine', 'effective', 'willing', 'economic', 'high', 'impose', 'price', 'sanctions', 'russia', 'imposed', 'line'];"
Western powers are threatening severe economic sanctions against Russia if it were to invade Ukraine. 
Western diplomats are refusing to be explicit about specific penalties to keep Russia guessing and maximise their deterrent effect. So what sanctions might the West be planning?
One measure being considered would be to exclude Russia from the system known as Swift - a global financial messaging service. It is used by many thousands of financial institutions in more than 200 countries. 
Boris Johnson told MPs that banning Russia from this would be a ""potent weapon"". It would effectively make it very hard for Russian banks to do business overseas. 
This sanction was used against Iran in 2012 and the country lost significant oil revenues and a large chunk of foreign trade. 
But this sanction would have an economic cost for countries like the United States and Germany whose banks have close links to Russian financial institutions. 
The US could ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars. Essentially, any western firm that allowed a Russian institution to deal in dollars would face penalties. 
This would mean that Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world. 
This could have a huge impact on Russia's economy as most of its oil and gas sales are settled in dollars. 
Western powers could take action to block further Russia's access to international debt markets. 
The ability of Western institutions and banks to buy Russian bonds is already restricted - those curbs could be tightened. 
This would deprive the country of access to finance that it needs to grow its economy. The country's cost of borrowing might rise and the value of the Rouble might fall. 
Russia has prepared for this by reducing the amount of debt held by foreign investors. 
The US could simply blacklist some Russian banks, making it almost impossible for anyone in the world to conduct transactions with them. 
Moscow would have to bail out the banks and do what it could to avoid inflation rising and incomes falling. 
This would, though, have a major negative impact for western investors with money in those Russian banks. 
The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia. 
The US could, for example, stop companies selling any goods containing American technology, software or equipment. 
This could involve, in particular, semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smart phones, machine tools to consumer electronics. 
This would target not just Russia's defence and aerospace sectors, but whole swathes of its economy. 
Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. The sales are huge source of revenue for the Kremlin. 
The West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. 
A new gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany - called Nord Stream 2 - could be abandoned. It is ready to start operations but still awaiting regulatory approval.  
But, any curbs on Russian gas would raise prices across Europe, much of which is dependent on energy from the east. 
New sanctions could be targeted at individuals, including not only associates of Vladimir Putin but also the Russian President himself. 
This would most likely involve punishing acts of hostility against Ukraine or threatening its sovereignty or territorial integrity. 
Asset freezes and travel bans are the most likely options. But many such sanctions are already in force and have yet to change much Russian behaviour. 
The hope of US and European powers is that Russia's elite would put pressure on Mr Putin if they were unable to access their wealth in foreign countries and educate their children in western schools and universities. 
Some sanctions could be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. 
Such is the scale of Russian money in banks and property in the UK that the capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"". 
The UK government claims it is tackling this problem with ""unexplained wealth orders"", which require people to say where their cash has come from. 
But only a handful of these orders have ever been used. Some US organisations want the White House to push the UK harder on this. 
The main difficulty for the West is to decide what sanctions should be imposed and when. There are differences between countries on this. 
How much should the sanctions depend on the scale and nature of any Russian attack? If, to quote President Biden, there was a ""minor incursion"", what sanctions would be justified? And who should deploy them? 
When asked about this, US officials say there is unity of purpose but admit there might be a ""division of labour"" with different countries imposing different sanctions. 
Russia could also mitigate the impact of western sanctions by looking to China and other allies for support. 
The bottom line is that the most effective economic sanctions often come at a high price for those who impose them. There are trade-offs and not everyone in the West is willing to acknowledge them.

379;Why Boris Johnson is coming out fighting;2022-01-27T14:55:45.000Z;[];['conservative party', 'boris johnson'];['johnson', 'fighting', 'try', 'old', 'hari', 'opposition', 'coming', 'leadership', 'newscast', 'remind', 'sitting', 'reminded', 'told', 'boris'];"
There's a police investigation and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day - Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it.
The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. 
The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on.
And whatever you think of the saga, whether it's silly frippery, or whether it enrages you and brings back terrible memories of suffering during lockdown, the fact that No 10 is having to spend so much time and focus on battling through means inevitably, other important decisions or debates are getting squeezed out. 
One Tory figure working with the government on various policies says: ""Government is totally gummed up - it's horrible, nothing gets done or signed off."" 
Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? 
After weeks of allegations and claims and political mess, a band of his longstanding political friends now have what they seem to believe is a decent operation in place to shore him up. 
The prime minister has been seeing ""possibles"" and ""undecideds"" in Parliament - MPs who might be tempted to withdraw their support, or haven't yet made up their minds. 
Boris Johnson himself is said to be ""not in a bad place"" about what's going on, buoyed by a feisty outing at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. 
What his former adviser and old friend Guto Hari told us on BBC Newscast: ""What he did was remind not only the opposition of what they are up against when he is on form, but reminded anyone sitting behind him or alongside that front bench what they would be up against if they try to take the leadership of him. 
""It was a display of the alpha male gorilla in the jungle.""
There was no sign whatsoever of the contrite or apologetic impression Boris Johnson has sometimes given in the last few days - a display perhaps designed to show those who want him gone that he will fight and fight. 
It's hardly the first time he's had to wriggle through controversies. Here he was confessing to his strategy many years ago:
""I've got a brilliant new strategy, which is to make so many gaffes that nobody knows which one to concentrate on,"" he told the BBC's Booktalk in 2006.
""They cease to be newsworthy, you completely out-general the media in that way, and they despair.""
He added: ""You shell them, you pepper the media... you've got to pepper their positions with so many gaffes that they're confused.
""It's like a helicopter throwing out chaff, and then you steal on quietly and drop your depth charges wherever you want to drop them.""

But the odds are so different now.
He's the PM, not the London mayor or a backbench MP, and his leadership has been significantly damaged in the past couple of months. 
Getting through this is not just going to be about wisecracks here and there.
There's an expectation too that the government will finally publish its plans for ""levelling up"" next week. 
The white paper has long been pencilled in for the start of February and ministers may use it to show that they are, to use a phrase beloved by Boris Johnson, ""getting on with the job"". 
His allies also find comfort in the fact that the rebels are not centrally coordinated. Ministers have confronted them with questions about what their plan really is, accusing them of ""student politics"".
The Brexiteers who worked together to bring down Theresa May had a plan to install Boris Johnson. 
They were largely bound by ideology and the notion that Mr Johnson should take over. 
The groups this time are scattered, and don't have one idea, or one candidate, to rally around. 
Yet the disparate nature of the discontent doesn't mean that the prime minister can be remotely sure he'll get safely through, because it makes it harder for anyone in the Tory Party to see what's in the undergrowth. 
It's not clear how many secret letters calling for a leadership vote have been submitted. 
One Johnson ally, Conor Burns, jokes that the Royal Mail couldn't bank on making any money if they're relying on Tory MPs sending them in. 
But if it hits the threshold of 54 and it comes to a confidence vote, the estimates of what might happen are wild. 
One of Johnson's camp suggested to reporters they might have the support of as many as 300 Tory MPs out of 359. 
Right now that seems extraordinarily optimistic. 
Another member of the government who has done the numbers calculated there could be more than 160 votes against, so he'd just scrape through. 
But some government ministers say privately they wouldn't back him, and he could even lose. 
In other words, bluntly, no-one really has a clue.  
In the last few days, Boris Johnson has tried to show that he is still the biggest beast in the political jungle. 
But the threats to him are still very real, and as one former minister says, the ""assassins are lurking in the bushes"" now.

380;Why has Sue Gray's report not appeared yet?;2022-01-27T13:12:27.000Z;[];['boris johnson'];['likely', 'grays', 'appeared', 'truth', 'warned', 'social', 'sue', 'maintains', 'minister', 'rulebreaking', 'report', 'prime', 'telling', 'told'];"
The expectation across Whitehall is that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday.
So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does?
The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. 
And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry.
It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend.
While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work.
I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full.
What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police.
Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job.
So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings.
According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay.
The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content.
And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions.
Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed.
But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify.
Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings.
According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards.
From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run.
While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building.
She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff.
It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public.
Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation.
As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage.
As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgment on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness.
But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment.
So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgment on who is most likely to be telling the truth.
Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson.
But those close to the 'save Boris' operation aren't expecting a 'smoking gun' - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims.
While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry.
Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed.
And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated.
Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police.
But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture.
Ultimately any decision on law-breaking is for the police, not for Sue Gray - so it is perfectly possible that hers will not be the final word in this political drama.

The US economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1972 at the end of last year despite the emergence of the Omicron variant.
Official Commerce Department figures showed the economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the last three months of 2021.
That was far better than analysts had expected, as consumer spending and other activity remained robust.
For the year, the US economy grew by 5.7%.

382;F35-C fighter jet: Race is on to reach sunken US plane... before China;2022-01-27T16:47:18.000Z;[];['china', 'us armed forces'];['race', 'mystery', 'plane', 'jet', 'long', 'sunken', 'reach', 'ocean', 'navy', 'china', 'bed', 'confirm', 'fighter', 'f35c', 'came', 'retrieve', 'lying', 'happens'];"
A bizarre race against time is under way for the US Navy to reach one of its downed fighter jets - before the Chinese get there first.
The $100m F35-C plane came down in the South China Sea after what the Navy describes as a ""mishap"" during take-off from the USS Carl Vinson.
The jet is the Navy's newest, and crammed with classified equipment - and, as it is in international waters, is technically fair game.
Whoever gets there first, wins.
The prize? All the secrets behind this very expensive, leading-edge fighting force. 
Seven sailors were injured when the jet came down on Monday after it struck Vinson's deck during a military exercise. 
It is now lying on the ocean bed, but what happens next is a mystery. The Navy will not confirm either where it came down or how long it will take to retrieve it.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea and has increasingly taken steps to assert that claim in recent years, refusing to recognise a 2016 international tribunal ruling saying it had no legal basis.
National security experts say Chinese military would be ""very keen"" to get to the jet but a US salvage vessel looks to be at least 10 days away from the crash site.
That's too late, says defence consultant Abi Austen, because the black box battery will die before then, making it harder to locate the aircraft. 
""It's vitally important the US gets this back,"" she says. ""The F-35 is basically like a flying computer. It's designed to link up other assets - what the Air Force calls 'linking sensors to shooters'.""
China doesn't have that technology so getting their hands on it would give them a huge leap forward, she says.
""If they can get into the 35's networking capabilities, it effectively undermines the whole carrier philosophy.""
Asked if there were echoes of the Cold War here, she says: ""It's all about who's the biggest dog in the park! This is basically The Hunt For Red October meets The Abyss - it's a brilliant three-act play.""
Ms Austen, a former adviser to the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and former senior Nato and EU diplomat, said she believes any attempt by China to try to claim salvage rights was them ""stress testing"" the US.
It comes at a vulnerable and dangerous time following what some perceived as a disorganised and disastrous Afghanistan pull-out, she believes.
There is no doubt China wants this plane, although cyber espionage may mean they already have some knowledge of its interior, layout and workings, says Bryce Barros, a China affairs analyst and security fellow at the Truman Project.
""I think they would want to see actual parts of the plane, to better understand how it is laid out and find its vulnerabilities.""
The US Navy acknowledged in a statement that a recovery operation was under way following the ""mishap"" aboard USS Carl Vinson.
This video can not be played
So how would the retrieval actually work?
A team from the US Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving would attach bags to the jet's fuselage which will then be slowly inflated to raise the wreckage. 
This operation will be more difficult if the airframe is not largely in one piece. 
The aircraft was likely to have been armed with at least a couple of missiles carried either on its wings or in the internal weapons bay which could also complicate recovery. 
There is precedent for these winner-takes-all military cat and mouse games.
In 1974, at the height of the Cold War, the CIA secretly pulled a Russian submarine from the sea floor off the coast of Hawaii using a giant mechanical claw 
Two years earlier, the Chinese military secretly salvaged the UK submarine HMS Poseidon which sank off China's east coast.
And it is widely believed that China got its hands on the wreckage of a secret US ""stealth"" helicopter that crash-landed in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011.
Mr Barros said: ""We are sure the Chinese military got to see the onboard equipment and software then.""
The Guinness World Record-holding deepest successful salvage operation was the raising of the wreckage of a US Navy transport aircraft from the floor of the Philippine Sea in May 2019. 
It was some 5,638m (18,500 ft) below the surface,
One other option, of course, is to destroy the jet to stop it getting into the hands of Beijing.
""The easiest thing to do would be to torpedo it!"" said one military officer.
But that's not thought to be an avenue under consideration.

When US football team Kansas City Chiefs won a crucial game against the Buffalo Bills with just 13 seconds left on the clock, pundits called it one of the sport's best clashes of all time.
Dejected Bills fans left the stadium on Sunday devastated. 
But what happened next really softened the blow - Kansas fans started to donate $13 each to a charity set up by the Bills' quarterback Josh Allen.
In less than a week, $300,000 has already been raised.
Allen's charity has handed the money to the stunned bosses of the children's hospital in Buffalo, New York, it supports.
At the close of the nail-biter of a game, a Twitter account belonging to a Chiefs fan urged them all to donate $13 to mark the extraordinary 13 seconds it took to win the game.
The clash had widely been seen as a standoff between two of the greatest quarterbacks currently in the National Football League, Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs and Allen of the Bills.
Both had top performances, but in the dying seconds of regular time, Mahomes' team forced play into overtime and eventually won with the help of a favourable coin toss that led to a touchdown.
While the tough loss will hurt diehard Bills' fans for many seasons to come, the gesture from the Chiefs fans was obviously deeply appreciated.
The Oishei Children's Hospital tweeted: ""Wow we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of donations from #ChiefsKingdom.
""Thank you all! These donations help the ongoing need and ensure our team has the tools, training and programs to care for the kids.""

384;US Supreme Court: The women in the running to replace Stephen Breyer;2022-01-27T18:19:50.000Z;[];['us supreme court', 'united states', 'joe biden'];['stephen', 'judge', 'looking', 'meaning', 'left', 'replace', 'means', 'supreme', 'running', 'university', 'students', 'law', 'court', 'women', 'breyer', 'outside', 'league'];"
US President Joe Biden has affirmed that he will appoint an African-American woman to the top US court for the first time in history.
She will take up a seat to be vacated by liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who will retire in June.
Appearing with Mr Breyer on Thursday, Mr Biden promised a replacement with the ""experience and integrity"" needed for the role.
He said he'll announce his nominee by the end of February. Three judges are considered top contenders.
Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, is widely believed to be the top contender to replace Justice Breyer.
Born in Washington DC, Ms Jackson currently serves on the influential US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. Three current justices previously served on the court.
Previously, Ms Jackson also served as a district court judge in DC from 2013 to 2021.
The jurist has two degrees from Harvard University, which she attended as an undergraduate and as a law student, once serving as editor of the Harvard Law Review.
Ms Jackson has also clerked for three federal judges in the past, most notably Justice Breyer himself from 1999 to 2000.
In January 2021, she was among President Biden's very first judicial picks, to fill the court seat vacated by his current Attorney General Merrick Garland.
At that confirmation hearing, former House Speaker and Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan introduced her; Mr Ryan is a relative by marriage. 
""Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal,"" he said.
Leondra Kruger, 45, is in her eighth year on the California Supreme Court.
Born to a Jamaican immigrant mother and a Jewish father, the Pasadena native is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, where she was the first black woman to serve as editor of the Yale Law Journal.
Ms Kruger previously worked in the Obama Department of Justice, from 2007 to 2013.
During her tenure, she argued 12 cases before the US Supreme Court as deputy to the Solicitor General, the official who represents the government before the high court.
She reportedly twice turned down offers to serve as the Solicitor General.
The jurist also once clerked for late Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
Julianna Michelle Childs, 55, has served on the federal bench in South Carolina since 2010.
She also previously served as a circuit court judge in the state.
Unlike Ms Jackson and Ms Kruger, Ms Childs did not attend an Ivy League school, instead going to the University of South Carolina Law School.
In private practice, she was the first black female partner at a major law firm in the state. 
Congressman Jim Clyburn, an influential black politician in the state whose endorsement of Mr Biden is widely credited with turning his 2020 campaign around, has advocated for Ms Childs to be nominated because of her unorthodox resume.
Most recently, Mr Biden nominated Ms Childs to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Black women make up only about three percent of the federal judiciary, according to data from the Federal Judicial Center, the court system's research arm.
Dr Taneisha Means, a political science professor at Vassar College, who researches race and judicial politics, says that a history of racism, sexism and elitism in the legal profession contributes to the scarcity.
Black law students are often left on the outside looking in because they did not go to an Ivy League university, or because they never clerked for a federal judge, said Dr Means, meaning few ever become eligible for the high court.
Ms Means added that a gruelling confirmation process in the US Senate likely makes federal judgeships even less palatable. Recent analysis indicates non-white nominees often face much longer waits than their white counterparts to be confirmed by the mostly white chamber.
Strengthening the diversity of the judicial branch has been a key priority for the Biden administration.
The Senate confirmed 40 new district and appellate judges last year, the most for a president in his first year since Ronald Reagan in 1981. Among them are the first openly LGBT female judge, the first Muslim American judge and five black women.

Russia has moved about 100,000 troops - equipped with everything from tanks and artillery to ammunition and air power - to Ukraine's border but denies it is planning an invasion.
About 35,000 Russian personnel are permanently stationed near Ukrainian territory. 
And on Wednesday, the Russian defence ministry released pictures of military units on their way to a training site in Rostov, close to Ukraine's border. 
Some newly arrived units have travelled almost 4,000 miles, from the Russian Far East.
Most estimates put the number of Russian troops deployed around Ukraine - to the country's north, south and east - at about 100,000.
But one Ukrainian assessment, reported by CNN, says there are 106,000 ground troops and 21,000 navy and air-force personnel.
On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The intelligence is very clear that there are 60 Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine,"" about a third of the total available numbers.
In addition to the regular Russian troops, there are thought to be about 15,000 Russian separatists in Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
But some Western analysts say it is not clear that Russia has assembled everything needed for a ground invasion. 
They point to the absence of fully manned mobile field hospitals in some areas.  
The arrival of medical staff, they say, could indicate readiness to attack.
Satellite images provide additional clues. 
The presence of troops can sometimes be detected by the colour of tents.  
Those occupied are heated, melting the snow on their roofs and appearing darker from above. 
Armoured vehicles can be identified by their shapes. 
And tyre tracks or mud indicate vehicles on the move. 
A Russian force of several thousand has been moved to Belarus for a joint military exercise that will reach its peak between 10 and 20 February. 
The country's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, supports Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is less than 100 miles (150km) from the Belarus border.
And Western observers say the exercise, Allied Resolve, could provide an opportunity to rehearse a mission against Ukraine.
Images posted online claim to show military equipment, including armoured vehicles, tanks and rocket systems, travelling towards the area.
And Russia has announced the deployment of advanced Su-35 fighter planes to Belarus, along with air-defence systems, munitions and medical support.
Russia is holding worldwide naval drills, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, starting this month and running through February, involving about:
Six Russian Navy vessels, capable of landing main battle tanks, personnel and armoured vehicles, have passed through the English Channel on their way to exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.
But it is unclear whether the Black Sea and the Ukrainian coast may be their intended destination. 
Some analysts say an amphibious landing by Russian troops would be extremely difficult and the naval forces may be a ""feint"" to draw Ukrainian ground forces away from more likely routes of attack on land.

World leaders and survivors are marking Holocaust Memorial Day with remembrance services and events.
It honours the six million Jewish people murdered during the Holocaust, alongside the millions of other people killed under Nazi persecution of other groups.
The day also marks the 77th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, in what was then-Nazi-occupied Poland.
Set up in 1940, Auschwitz was initially intended to house Polish political prisoners - but it eventually became the largest of the Nazis' extermination camps, where Adolf Hitler's plan to kill all Jewish people - the ""Final Solution"" - was put in to practice.
About 1.1 million people were murdered there, mostly Jewish. 
Here are some of the memorial events that took place during this year's Holocaust Memorial Day.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (above, centre), the Speaker of Israel's Knesset parliament, Mickey Levy, (left) and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (right) laid wreaths at the concrete steles of Berlin's Holocaust Memorial.
Flags of the European Union, Israel and Germany were flown at half-mast in Berlin.
President of the lower house of the German parliament Baerbel Bas addressed a memorial ceremony at the Bundestag, in Berlin (below).
Mr Levi also spoke at the Bundestag.
In Brussels, survivor Margot Friedlander (below, left) sat next to European Parliament President Roberta Metsola to address a special plenary session.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex (centre) visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, now a museum, in Oswiecim, near the city of Krakow.
He joined survivors in placing candles at the ""death wall"", where Nazi SS soldiers shot and killed several thousands.
In Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (below, left) and Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, (right) attended a commemoration ceremony at the Mauthausen Memorial, the site of a Nazi concentration camp.
Mr Lapid also visited the Shoah Wall of Names memorial, in Vienna's Ostarrichi Park (below).
In Belgrade, members of the Serbian army's Honor Guard joined a memorial service at the monument for victims of the Nazi concentration camp Sajmiste.
Events were also held earlier in the week.
In York Minster's Chapter House, 600 candles were laid out in the shape of the Star of David.
Landmarks were lit up in purple in commemoration, including the Penshaw Monument near Sunderland in north-east England.

393;Why Germany isn't sending weapons to Ukraine;2022-01-28T22:01:46.000Z;[];['germany', 'ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['turn', 'united', 'sending', 'ukraine', 'aggression', 'word', 'strongest', 'states', 'think', 'weapons', 'germany', 'isnt', 'weapon', 'realistic'];"
Germany's refusal to send weapons to Ukraine has puzzled and angered some allies. But the reasons why Europe's most powerful country is standing back are historical and complex.
There's a great grassy plain to the east of Berlin where the soil tells terrible stories.
As farmers plough, their blades disturb human bones, weapons; the fragments of one of the most brutal battles of World War II.
It was spring 1945. Hitler was hiding in a bunker in Berlin, his troops in retreat. Soviet forces advanced from the east across the plain but, above them on a hill called the Seelow Heights, the Nazis had taken up a defensive position. 
It was, by all accounts, a muddy, chaotic bloodbath. The Soviets eventually prevailed, hastening the end of the war, but it's estimated up to 30,000 of their soldiers were killed.
To visit the memorial at Seelow Heights is to understand how deeply entrenched this country's history remains in the minds of many Germans - and how the horrors of the twentieth century still influence its foreign policy today.
It is one of the reasons Germany has refused to send weapons to Ukraine, prompting a furious response from politicians there.
This is, by and large, a nation of pacifists. 
An annual survey reveals that most Germans believe diplomatic negotiation is the best way to resolve conflict. German troops rarely participate in anything other than peacekeeping missions; there are few exceptions - and they were controversial - including the Balkans in the 90s and, more recently, Afghanistan.
It's also, ironically, one of the world's biggest arms exporters (though its output is dwarfed by that of the US and Russia). And it has strict controls over where weapons are sent, even if Angela Merkel's government was sometimes accused of not sticking to those rules. 
""Germany has a longstanding policy of restraint when it comes to military conflict of all sorts and weapons export is seen as fuelling conflict rather than reducing conflict,"" says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff from the German Marshall Fund. ""This longstanding policy says that Germany does not export arms into conflict zones.""
Germany has departed from that principle, to arm Peshmerga fighters battling IS in Northern Iraq. But the situation in Ukraine is different, he says. The reason is history - the Nazi killings of millions of people in Ukraine and Russia.
""To export arms into the bloodlands that Germany helped to create, to supply one part of the bloodlands with arms… against the other part of the bloodlands… is an anathema in the German political debate.""
The situation on the Ukrainian border is testing Germany's new coalition government.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz - who probably thought Covid would be his greatest challenge - is now under pressure from his international allies to shift his country to a new, more hawkish position.
His government - a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats - came to power at the end of last year promising a values-based foreign policy and even stricter constraints on arms exports.
Resisting calls - even from some within that government - to send weapons to Kiev, Chancellor Scholz has instead paid for a field hospital, offered to treat wounded soldiers in Germany and is sending five thousand helmets to Ukraine.
Because there's another reason for Germany's reluctance - many here simply don't believe that sending weapons will solve the crisis.
Scholz's foreign minister, Green politician Annalena Baerbock, points out that Germany is a financial donor to Ukraine and believes that is more effective than sending arms.
""I do not think it's realistic to believe such weapons exports could turn around the military imbalance. The best protection is to prevent further aggression. The strongest weapon, if you want to use that word, is that we, united as Nato members, as EU states, as the G7, make clear every new aggression will have massive consequences.""
Chancellor Scholz favours the dialogue-based approach pursued by his predecessor. Angela Merkel was instrumental, along with President Macron of France, in setting up the so-called Normandy format under which Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia aimed to establish a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine. It's hoped that same format might work now.
Nils Schmidt, foreign affairs spokesman for the chancellor's social democrats, says ""France and Germany are mediators and I think it's not very appropriate for a mediator nation to send weapons to Ukraine, to one conflict party, because we are trying to promote a diplomatic solution.""
And Germany is well placed for such diplomacy. Chancellor Scholz may not have Mrs Merkel's clout with President Putin. But, thanks to their histories, Germany's relationship to Russia is unlike that of many other Western countries.

Thousands of German firms do business there. Many Germans - including Angela Merkel - grew up behind the Iron Curtain, learning Russian at school. Her ability to communicate regularly with Vladimir Putin when other leaders could not, was often attributed to their shared experience of life in the Communist East.
What puzzles - and angers - many around the world (and a fair few in Germany too) is why Chancellor Scholz isn't playing his most obvious card.
The two countries' economic ties are perhaps most controversially embodied in the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which, if and when it comes online, would double the amount of Russian gas coming into Europe via Germany.
Chancellor Scholz is under pressure to scrap the project by way of a sanction against Russia. That he has not yet done so is, critics argue, emblematic of Germany's self-interest. 
It's a sore topic for his government. His social democrats, who say the pipeline is a private economic project, are behind it. But his partners, the FDP, say it's political and the Greens would dearly love to let it go. 
Mr Scholz has indicated that, should Russia invade Ukraine, all options will be on the table, including the pipeline. But, in his quietly spoken way, has gone no further, prompting some to wonder whether history will judge him canny or weak and hesitant.
""It's wise to have a certain level of strategic ambiguity so that Putin cannot start calculating which price he would have to pay in case of doing this or that,"" says Nils Schmidt. ""That's why is so important to have all these options on the table.""
And, in the meantime, as Vladimir Putin tests the nerves of the West, Germany faces fundamental questions about its pacifist instincts.
Even towards the end of the Merkel era, calls were growing for Germany to take on a more substantial military role on the world stage.
And, as visitors to Seelow Heights, who imagine the screams of Katyusha rockets and the shouts of dying men, will understand, Germany knows very well what is at stake - and the cost of getting it wrong.

394;British 'hitman' found guilty of plotting to kill Pakistani activist;2022-01-28T17:18:55.000Z;[];['pakistan', 'press freedom', 'human rights', 'imran khan', 'censorship'];['suspicious', 'services', 'reopen', 'lead', 'plotting', 'pakistani', 'officials', 'investigations', 'torturing', 'kill', 'hitman', 'british', 'trail', 'activist', 'guilty', 'swedish'];"
A British ""hitman"" has been found guilty of conspiring to kill a Pakistani dissident in the Netherlands. 
A court in London heard Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered £100,000 (about $134,000) to carry out the murder in Rotterdam last year. 
However he failed to track his target down, and was arrested on his return to the UK. 
Now a jury has given a unanimous guilty verdict of conspiracy to murder and he is set be sentenced in March.
The intended victim, Waqass Goraya, has told the BBC he is sure the Pakistani intelligence services were ultimately behind the plot and that it forms part of a wider crackdown on dissenting voices both inside and outside Pakistan. 
Pakistani officials would not comment on the case. 
Gohir Khan, from east London, had racked up debts of more than £200,000 whilst running a cargo company. He was working as a delivery driver for a supermarket, but reacted enthusiastically when he was contacted about a ""job"" in Europe by a contact in Pakistan. 
Khan claimed in court that he initially did not know what the job entailed, but he used fishing analogies in a WhatsApp conversation with a middleman man named as Muzzamil who was to take 20% of the fee.  
""Is it a deep sea fish or just tuna?"" Khan asked. Muzzamil, who was also known as ""Papa"" because of his resemblance to cartoon character ""Papa Smurf"", replied, ""just tuna, but not uk tuna, european tuna"".
Their grim intent was made clear when Khan discussed needing a ""tool"" or gun for the job, whilst at another point Muzzamil wrote about the target: ""It's not a SHARK… A little fish… Little knife / hook / worm with a string is enough."" 
The man they planned on killing was Waqass Goraya, a prominent social media activist and critic of the Pakistani military and government, living in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He was abducted and tortured whilst visiting Pakistan in January 2017 by suspected members of the intelligence services, and told the BBC he was convinced they had now attempted to have him killed in Europe. 
""They don't like being called out for enforced disappearances or their torture cells,"" he said, adding: ""It shows their cowardice. They are scared of people talking. People who are unarmed, with nothing but a pen or keyboard. They are more scared of them than the people with guns.""
Pakistan's powerful military did not respond to requests for comment, whilst the country's information minister refused to discuss the case. 
Government officials claim there is no clampdown on freedom of speech in Pakistan and the army denies interfering in politics, but human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about a series of violent attacks in Pakistan on journalists and activists who accuse the military of manipulating the country's electoral system.  
The threat to Pakistani dissidents extends to those outside the country too. 
Ayesha Siddiqa is an academic who has written extensively about the Pakistani military. In January 2019 she received a visit and letter from police in Britain warning of ""credible information"" that her life was in danger if she travelled back to Pakistan. 
Dr Siddiqa shared the letter with the BBC, and said her own inquiries had led her to find out, ""there was a contract on my head given to some Afghan warlords to be eliminated on return to Pakistan… if the temperature was raised I could be targeted in the UK as well."" 
Like Mr Goraya, Dr Siddiqa told the BBC she believed the Pakistani intelligence services were behind the threat. 
""I have no one else to suspect.""  
Three other Pakistanis living in the UK confirmed to the BBC they had contact with the police over the possibility of them being targeted in Britain. 
One of them, Fazal Khan, is a lawyer whose 14 year-old son Sahibzada Umer Khan was amongst the victims of a massacre at a school in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar by militants in 2014. 
Since then, he has filed numerous court petitions involving Pakistan's military authorities, most recently criticising them for their soft treatment of one notorious former militant leader, who was kept under ""house arrest"" before mysteriously escaping. 
As a result of his activism Mr Khan has faced threats from extremists and, he believes, the security services. In July 2020 Mr Khan survived an assassination attempt in Pakistan and later fled to the UK. 
Last April, British police warned him of a threat to his life, advising him to maintain a ""low profile"" and not to venture into public places. 
Mr Khan told the BBC two plainclothes officers gave him an ""emergency police number"" and said, ""you are in our system, if you feel anything abnormal then give us a call and an armoured vehicle will arrive to rescue you"". 
The officers did not specify the exact nature of the threat, but Mr Khan believes it must be linked to the Pakistani security services, describing being forced to live ""a life of fear"". 
Others elsewhere in Europe have also been warned by Western intelligence agencies, including Taha Siddiqui, a journalist who escaped an abduction attempt in Islamabad and now lives in France. 
At Kingston Crown Court, the jury heard Gohir Khan and the middleman Muzzamil discussed the possibility of further ""jobs"" after killing Mr Goraya. 
Waqass Goraya had been told in 2018 of threats to his life by the FBI. In February last year, before Gohir Khan had even travelled to the Netherlands, he was rushed out of his home in Rotterdam by Dutch intelligence agents and taken to a secure location. 
The operation targeting him at times appeared amateur and poorly organised, with Khan bemoaning delays in the process as ""dysfunctional"". Meanwhile, Khan produced fake doctored receipts and invented a fictional ""crew"" accompanying him in order to try to extract more money for the hit. 
Testifying in court, Khan, who was at times tearful, came across as a bumbling opportunist, describing for example how he crashed a car in Rotterdam within minutes of renting it as he wasn't used to driving on the right hand side of the road.   
When attempting to bypass Covid travel restrictions in order to travel to the Netherlands in June 2021, Khan asked a contact to pretend to be his brother living there. 
On arrival, however, he was questioned by a border official who called the ""brother"" on the phone and asked him how old Khan was in order to verify his identity. Unable to answer, Khan's ""brother"" hung up, and Khan was denied entry to the country. 
A few days later, Khan made the trip for a second time and was finally able to reach Rotterdam. He purchased a 19-inch knife and staked out what he believed was Mr Goraya's home. However, he soon realised the address he had been provided with was wrong. 
Muzzamil assured him that his ""boss"" had received a video of Mr Goraya at the address around six months earlier, but unable to locate him Khan returned to London. On leaving Rotterdam he was questioned by a Dutch border force officer about his trip. 
Struggling for an answer, Khan replied that he had been ""touristing"", leading the officer to refer him to police in Britain. They arrested him and eventually found his message history with Muzzamil. 
In court, Khan insisted he never planned to go ahead with the murder and simply wanted to extract money from Muzammil, telling police he only bought a knife in Rotterdam to cut bread and fruit with. The prosecution argued he fully intended to carry out the killing and the jury agreed, convicting him of conspiracy to murder. 
The Pakistan-based ""client"" who had ordered the hit was never named in court, though Muzzamil referred to a ""big boss"" who gave a green light to the operation and who he had worked with for around 20 years. 
Muzzamil's full identity has not been disclosed either, though he appears to be a British national living in Pakistan. Police officials said the case remains an ""active investigation"" and appealed for anyone with information about Muzammil to contact them.
Mr Goraya is urging the UK authorities to further investigate the case and all those involved. 
""It should not stop here… They have to go after the people who transferred the money, who ordered the hit."" 
He has no doubt that trail will eventually lead to the same Pakistani intelligence services he accuses of torturing him five years ago. He, along with other campaigners, also want Swedish and Canadian officials to re-open investigations into the deaths of two Baloch dissidents in 2021, both of which were found not to be suspicious. 
Some activists worry Britain's close diplomatic relationship and co-operation with the Pakistani authorities on counter-terrorism will lead them to play down the significance of the episode. 
Mr Goraya, however, is determined, not to be silenced. 
""Threats and intimidation don't work,"" he told the BBC. ""It makes people resilient. It makes their voice louder.""

397;How streaming services left us with too much to watch;2022-01-27T00:38:12.000Z;[];['coronavirus pandemic'];['plus', 'titles', 'robust', 'disney', 'thinks', 'left', 'watch', 'streaming', 'unique', 'survive', 'services', 'players', 'thats'];"
The stunning growth of video streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus, has transformed how we watch movies and TV shows. 
Here we speak to industry insiders, from producers to executives, to get their take on future trends for the so-called ""streamers"" sector. 
One of these is film producer, Miranda Bailey, who found that when her new movie premiered at this month's Sundance Film Festival there was a catch.
Due to Covid restrictions, the film - God's Country, starring Thandiwe Newton - could not be shown on a cinema screen at the annual event in the small Utah town of Park City. Instead, it had to be streamed to the festival's virtual attendees.
""Obviously it's a great disappointment, to me and the other filmmakers, to not have the experience of showing our movie to an audience of indie film lovers at Sundance,"" says Ms Bailey.
Historically, filmmakers show their new movies at Sundance and other festivals, to get cinema distribution deals. The focus has shifted to streaming platform contracts, or deals for distribution in cinemas and streaming simultaneously.
""Ideally, the filmmakers I work with would be sure to secure some sort of theatrical [cinema] run,"" says Ms Bailey. ""But with the pandemic right now that seems to be a promise no outlet can truly fulfil.
""Fortunately there are a plethora of streaming platforms with brilliant original content who care about indies, and are spending money for award campaigns like traditional [cinema] distribution used to do.""
The video streaming sector has become a huge part of the entertainment industry - a dominance partly driven by cinemas being shut down during the pandemic.
The world's largest platform, Netflix, had 222 million subscribers at the end of last year, 18.2 million more than in 2020. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime Video had 175 million viewers in 2021, while Disney Plus' base topped 118 million.
These vast user numbers are supported by studies that show a growing number of people now prefer to watch new release movies at home, rather than go to a cinema. One report last October found that this was now the case for 71% of Americans.
At the same time, we now stream TV shows at a time of our choosing more often than we watch programmes as they are broadcast by a traditional, linear channel such as BBC 1 or Channel 4.
The convenience of on-demand viewing is obvious, but Lisa Holme, group senior vice president of content and commercial strategy at US television company, Discovery, fears consumers are now put off by the sheer number of streaming services available.
""We now have a lot of content available across six or eight major streaming services, of which [our] Discovery Plus is one,"" she says. ""I think consumers are now finding themselves a bit overwhelmed by the choice.""
Ms Holme adds that some people are ""feeling confused and annoyed"" that they have to go to multiple streaming services to get all the content that they want. 
For the US, figures show that 46% of homes with broadband subscribe to four or more video streaming services. While in the UK, one study found 65% of homes subscribe to two or more of the providers.
Phil Hopkins, president of niche streaming channel Fandor, says in a crowded market like this standing out from the competition is crucial. His service specialises in showing independent or classic movies, plus foreign films and documentaries.
""The biggest challenge is that there are a lot similarities to the main streaming services, and they're not really doing much in the way of separating themselves to have their own identity,"" he says.
Mr Hopkins thinks that among the big players in streaming, Disney Plus is on the most robust footing. ""They have such an amazing legacy [of Disney titles to show],"" he says. ""But I don't know how many other streaming platforms can survive on their own merits... eventually people are going to get fatigue and look elsewhere for something that's unique and different.""
At streaming site Paramount Plus, its plan is to accelerate its popularity using live channels, a new feature where its most popular shows and movies go out at scheduled times on 20 genre-themed channels - mimicking traditional TV channels.
""Even in the era of on-demand, there is clearly a strong consumer appetite for reimagined linear channels that provide effortless, lean-back entertainment,"" says Tom Ryan, president and chief executive of ViacomCBS Streaming, the owner of Paramount Plus.
Whereas at streaming app Struum, its plan is to make life easier by offering streams from numerous other providers all in one place. This means if you sign up you can access 25 sites, from the likes of the BBC, FilmBox, Magellan TV, Tribeca and Tastemade.
""Viewers want to find that next gem of a show or unknown movie,"" says Lauren Devillier, chief executive of Struum. ""We provide a curated experience so people can 'go deep' on a particular subject.
""You love documentaries? We have hundreds. True crime? LGBTQ? We have all of it for you in one subscription, making simple what might otherwise be confounding.""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Paul Erickson, senior analyst at market research firm Parks Associates, says the growth of streaming services was fuelled by the pandemic and continues today despite the general relaxation of lockdown rules.
Yet, he cautions that subscription growth in the streaming video market has already begun to slow. He says many consumers are now experiencing ""subscription overload"" and becoming more discriminating with their spending.
But as the streaming services wrestle each other for our affections, what does it mean for cinema chains? Are they doomed? 
Far from it, says Paul Serwitz, president of US firm Landmark Theatres. He points out that attendances ""steadily increased"" in 2021. ""[And] expectations are for cinema attendance to continue increasing as consumer confidence improves with the Covid evolution, and more compelling film content.""
But Tearlach Hutcheson, vice president at US cinema chain Studio Movie Grill, says while regular film goers have returned to cinemas, ""it is the casual movie goer who hasn't"".
US National Public Radio TV and media critic Eric Deggans says cinemas will need to improve the experience for film goers to compete with streaming. 
""We're always going to have movie theatres but what form are they going to take? How many of them are there going to be and what kinds of films are they going to show? All of that is up in the air.""

A 35-year-old man has been found guilty of stalking British number one tennis player Emma Raducanu. 
Amrit Magar from Edgware was convicted at Bromley Magistrates' Court on Friday and will be sentenced at a later date.
Magar was captured on door camera footage at the 19-year-old player's south London home, where she lives with her parents, leaving notes and cards.
In a statement to the court, reported by the Daily Mail, Raducanu said she was now fearful of going out alone.
""Since all this has happened, I have felt creeped out. I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own,"" she told police in a statement.
""Because of this I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again. I don't feel safe in my own home which is where I should feel safest.""
Magar visited Raducanu's home a number of times during December last year. 
On one occasion, the former Amazon delivery driver left a hand-drawn map to show the tennis player he had walked 23 miles from his house in north-west London to reach her.
He also left her a note which read ""you deserve love"".
Raducanu, the reigning US Open champion, was named BBC Sport Personality of the Year in December.

403;Climate change: Key crops face major shifts as world warms;2022-01-26T19:02:29.000Z;[];['intergovernmental panel on climate change', 'coffee', 'cop26', 'climate change', 'coffee production'];['major', 'perfect', 'shifts', 'crops', 'key', 'face', 'change', 'coffee', 'mean', 'management', 'world', 'expand', 'options', 'warms', 'possible', 'climate', 'grown', 'growing', 'regions'];"
The parts of the world suitable for growing coffee, cashews and avocados will change dramatically as the world heats up, according to a new study.
Key coffee regions in Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Colombia will all ""drastically decrease"" by around 50% by 2050.
Suitable areas for cashews and avocados will increase but most will be far from current sites of production. 
The authors say that greater efforts must be made to help farmers adapt.
Coffee is one of the world's most important crops, not just as key beverage but as a livelihood for millions of small farmers. 
And thanks to growing consumer preferences in richer countries, demand for avocados and cashews has increased substantially in recent decades. 
While the threat to coffee from climate change has been well documented in recent years, there is little information about how rising temperatures will impact avocados and cashews. 
In this study, the authors looked at how rising temperatures and changing rates of precipitation will impact the three crops over the next 30 years. The researchers have also, for the first time, incorporated information about land and soil characteristics.
Coffee is the most susceptible crop to high temperatures. In those countries accounting for the majority of the world's production of Arabica - the dominant coffee variety - suitability for growing the crop will decrease by around half by 2050 - a ""drastic"" reduction, according to the report.
Some key areas will see a heavier impact. In the lowest temperature scenario, there would be a reduction of 76% in Brazil's most suitable areas for coffee. In Colombia it would shrink by 63%.
Some regions at the northern and southern ends of today's growing areas will become more suitable, including Argentina, South Africa, China and New Zealand among others. 
But according to the authors, this doesn't mean that these new regions can easily replace the current sites. 
""The key message for those that are in the main producing regions today is that farming systems have to adapt to the changing conditions,"" said lead author Roman Grüter, from Zurich University of Applied Sciences. 
""If there is already coffee grown in a new area where it is just about possible with some management options, it might get easier or might be possible to expand but it doesn't mean that we will get perfect coffee growing regions within 10 years or so.""
For cashews, the picture is different. Overall, the areas of the world that are highly suitable for growing the crop will increase by 17%. 
However, in some of the countries that currently are reliant on cashews as a key cash crop the news is not good. India loses significant areas of suitability, while Benin loses half its suitable areas under the lowest modelled increase in temperature.
For avocados, the picture is also complicated - especially in the biggest producing countries. 
Mexico, the world's largest producer, sees a major increase in suitable lands, up over 80%. However, Peru - another major grower - loses around half its suitable areas under the same climate model. 
While the rise in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns might make some areas more suitable, the authors are concerned that a major shift to develop these crops in new regions might see more forests converted to farmland or a rise of invasive species. 
""In regions that might get more suitable for growing those crops, it is important to make sure that there are no negative environmental impacts such as deforestation,"" said Roman Grüter.
""In all of these changes, the local stakeholders, the local communities have to get involved in these changing processes. It should be really participatory.""
A temperature rise of around 1C over the past 30 years has seen farmers in Sicily turn to a range of new crops more suited to warmer conditions. 
One of them is Andrea Passanisi, who grows avocados close to Mount Etna. Along with other producers, this change has been very successful for Andrea. 
However, as temperatures continue to rise, growing conditions are getting more difficult. 
""The real climate change here is in the seasons,"" he told BBC News. 
""Once it was cold in November and December, now it is January or February - that is not good for avocados.""
Increased levels of drought and intense downpours are also challenging for farmers. 
""If you grow on land that's not suitable for avocado, it's the end,"" Andrea said. 
""We will continue to grow, as we have good land, but we will not have as much fruit.""
While the changing temperatures might seem to be bad news for current growers of these crops, there are some active steps that producers can take that could mitigate climate change. 
""It is possible that some regions where avocados are currently grown the use of the genetic variability of avocado might help,"" said Dr Joaquin Guillermo Ramirez Gil, from the National University of Colombia, who wasn't involved in the new study.
""This species has three 'races' with different geographical origins, which makes it quite 'plastic' to adapt to different climatic conditions.
""There are also local adaptations and new management alternatives such as the use of bio-stimulants and nanotechnology-based products as a basis for reducing stress due to extreme weather conditions.""
The research has been published in the journal Plos One.

405;The scramble for cargo aircraft as shipping costs soar;2022-01-28T00:08:44.000Z;[];['boeing', 'airbus group', 'transport', 'freight transport', 'aerospace'];['volume', 'sent', 'air', 'scramble', 'market', 'vaccines', 'roughly', 'costs', 'cargo', 'value', 'short', 'aircraft', 'terms', 'soar', 'freight', 'shipping'];"
Last summer, as the shipping supply crisis worsened, a cargo aircraft in Italy was rapidly loaded with thousands of lipsticks. They were bound for the US, on a tight deadline.
Mehir Sethi, chief executive and founder of California-based beauty brand True + Luscious, says she had relied on sea freight for years. It had always been reliable.
But to get those 15,000 lipsticks to her customers on time, her only option was to pay to send them by air.
""At great pain to myself, we had to do it for two time-sensitive shipments. These were goods that were already committed to retailers.""
The lipsticks were flown-in at a slight loss to the business, but she says it was worth it to keep the clients.
Firms have been making thousands of decisions like this in recent months. And there is no sign of let-up yet. 
""We have used a lot of air freight, which we're not excited about, but it's a necessary thing with the challenges we're all being faced with,"" explained David Bergman, chief financial officer for sportswear brand, Under Armour, on an earnings call in November.
The Eastman Chemical Company similarly reported resorting to air freight to ship specialty plastics. 
A US Census Bureau service called USA Trade Online, that tracks cargo flows in and out of the country, notes in the first 10 months of 2021, 78.9 million kg of car parts were sent by air from Asia to the US - a staggering increase from the 3 million kg shipped during the same period in 2020. 
More technology of business:
Sending goods by air has always been expensive. But now it is more expensive than ever.
Air freight costs from Asia to North America ""have hit levels I've never seen before, $15 (£11) per kg which is just insanely high,"" says Greg Knowler, senior Europe editor at IHS Markit's Journal of Commerce. 
Delays affecting sea freight are partly to blame for this but so is the huge fall in passenger flights since the start of the pandemic.
More than half of all the air freight in the world usually travels via 'belly cargo' in the holds of passenger planes. But with far less of that space available, airlines have been scrambling to convert passenger aircraft into freighters, and bring older models out of retirement.
AirBridgeCargo Airlines, a subsidiary of Russian air freight specialist, Volga-Dnepr, is boosting its fleet with an additional six aircraft, after what Alexey Zotov, commercial director, says has been a ""peak season we never had before"". 
Backlogs at airports  have ""rolled over like [a] snowball since early autumn,"" he adds.
Some carriers, such as Air Canada, have also rushed cargo aircraft into service sooner than planned - before they've even had a chance to finish their paintwork, in some cases.
Manufacturers, including Airbus, have been inundated with requests to convert former passenger aircraft to carry more cargo, just to get additional capacity into the sky. The process includes removing the passenger seats and installing larger doors. 
""We're seeing a lot of people buying these conversions, they're sold out for the next two to three years,"" says Crawford Hamilton, head of marketing for freighter marketing at Airbus.
""That's something that we were not in a position two years ago to say.""
While air freight only represents roughly 1% of the entire freight market in terms of volume, it accounts for about 35% of the value. Sometimes, expensive products such as consumer electronics and fashion goods that have a short market life are sent by air. Plus, during the pandemic, planes have carried countless loads of vaccines and personal protective equipment.
Airbus has also launched a new air-cargo service using its five-strong fleet of BelugaST aircraft, also known as flying whales thanks to their huge fuselage.
The question is whether demand for air freight will remain strong, even if the pandemic subsides. With lots of aircraft permanently converted to carry freight, and belly cargo capacity rising once again, Robert Mayer at Cranfield University questions whether there might be too much capacity in the market half a decade from now.
Yet aircraft manufacturers seem confident. Airbus expects rising demand for dedicated cargo carriers in the coming years - and it has just launched the A350F aircraft in anticipation of that.
It can carry as much cargo, in terms of volume, as a Boeing 747 but is 40% more fuel efficient. This is achieved partly through the use of lighter materials, composites and titanium in the body of the aircraft.
Boeing, too, is bullish. It forecasts that the number of air freighters will grow globally by 60% between now and 2039. If correct, manufacturers will need to build 2,400 new cargo carriers by then.
Tom Sanderson, director of product marketing at Boeing, says it may introduce a freighter variant of its latest wide-bodied passenger jet, the 777X, but it would be ""multiple years"" before it came into service.
More freight might move by air in the coming years but that could lead to an unwelcome rise in emissions unless aviation gets greener.
Both Boeing and Airbus are currently testing ""sustainable aviation fuels"", including biofuels from renewable sources that can be used on existing aircraft instead of fossil fuel-based propellants. 
Small electric planes will are also likely to become more common. DHL Express has ordered 12 fully electric aircraft from Eviation, for example. 
Besides the prohibitive cost, one thing that puts Ms Sethi off using air freight more often to fly in her beauty product is the environmental impact.
""It would definitely bother me, just the sheer increase in our carbon footprint as a company if we were to rely on air freight,"" she says.
Like many others, she is reconsidering her reliance on global supply chains. She has decided to source some of her products from suppliers closer to home, to avoid shipping problems in the future.
""Some of the orders we were placing to our Italian manufacturer will now go to our New Jersey manufacturer,"" she says.
""I just can't cut it too close any more.""

419;How the high cost of living is hitting Singapore's poor;2022-01-31T00:02:24.000Z;[];['singapore', 'asia', 'asia pacific', 'inflation', 'cost of living', 'food'];['wave', 'hitting', 'understand', 'persistent', 'singapores', 'high', 'cost', 'price', 'living', 'times', 'poor', 'surges', 'inflation', 'going', 'temporary', 'really'];"
In South East Asia you don't get much more of a staple food than chicken rice. Found in almost every food court and hawker centre, it is considered one of Singapore's national dishes. 
Daniel Tan, who owns six chicken rice stalls, has previously charged $2.20 (£1.60) for a small portion. But Covid has seen the cost of his ingredients rise sharply.
The price of chicken has gone up by 50% and vegetable costs have more than doubled since January 2020, he says. 
""We've been absorbing the costs for a significant period of time,"" he tells me as we meet at one of his OK Chicken Rice stalls in the north of Singapore. 
""When the pandemic hit our first thought was this was a short-term emergency - six months, maybe a year - so we held [prices] for as long as we can because we were hoping for the whole thing to be over.""
But when his electricity bills also jumped, Mr Tan decided it was time to raise prices. ""A thousand dollar electrical bill for a chicken rice store really is not sustainable,"" he says.
""If I go on any further, either my staff are not paid or I have to close down some stores and that's not what we want to do.""
Due to border closures and new employment regulations, Mr Tan has faced staff shortages and higher salaries, which all feed into rising costs for his business.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says global food prices rose 28% in 2021.
""The last time food prices were this high was in 2011, when policymakers were actually warning about a global food crisis,"" says Dr Abdul Abiad of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
These latest price rises are due to higher energy costs, which affect food and fertiliser production, with global supply chain issues compounding the problem.
Even in a wealthy nation like Singapore, it means that the number of families seeking help has increased.
""What we have seen when we make the door-to-door deliveries is that young families [with] both husband and wife working a part-time job or in the gig economy - these were the families that got impacted when Covid hit and all the part-time work dried up,"" says Nichol Ng, co-founder of Food Bank Singapore. 
It is not just the poorest 10% of the population who now need help, she says: ""It has slowly crept to maybe 20% of the population including middle income families that might not even know where to get help in the first place.""
And it is also not just higher food prices that are affecting those in need. ""Due to Covid, everybody's self-awareness about looking after themselves in terms of hygiene has increased,"" says Ms Ng.
But higher palm oil prices mean that shampoos, hand soaps and sanitisers have also become a lot more expensive.
""Up to 20% of our requests thus far, especially starting from the second half of last year, has been pivoting towards personal hygiene products,"" she adds.
Ms Ng is also concerned that the current wave of inflation does not seem to be temporary. ""In the past, at certain times of the year, you might see these price surges but it seems that this inflation is going to be persistent - and none of us really have that crystal ball to understand when it is going to end,"" she says.
Elsewhere in the region the impact of higher prices is even more severe. The latest FAO report shows more than 375 million people in Asia faced hunger in 2020, an increase of 54 million from the previous year. 
In 2020, the Global Food Banking Network saw the number of families needing help increase by more than 130% to 40m, with half of them living in Asia.
This is despite the fact that food price increases in Asia have been more muted than in the US or Europe, where inflation has soared to levels not seen in decades.
There are several reasons for this, including a good rice harvest in 2021, says the ADB's Dr Abiad. While maize prices rose 44% last year and wheat by 31% , rice prices dropped 4% . ""So rice being the main staple in many Asian economies contributed to a food price inflation being lower in the region,"" he says.
Asian nations also produce a lot of their own food, which has been sold in domestic markets rather than being exported. Governments have also been working to ensure that food supplies have been stable, says Dr Abiad.
In the Philippines, for example, liberalisation of rice imports has allowed the supply of rice to improve which has kept prices low. 
Meanwhile, China has been stockpiling various important food products, which has resulted in it bucking the trend, with the country's food prices falling in 2021. 
But it has also led to criticism that the world's second biggest economy, which accounts for 20% of global population, is hoarding supplies as it is estimated to hold 69% of the world's corn reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat by mid-2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. 
Singapore imports the majority of its foodstuffs, but so far big supermarket chains like NTUC FairPrice have decided not to pass on higher prices to consumers. 
To keep the prices of key products stable, the firm says it is employing various strategies including ""stockpiling of daily essentials, forward buying and diversifying our import sources to over 100 countries"".
NTUC FairPrice also has more than 2,000 own-brand products such as rice, oil, toiletries and cleaning products that it says are at least 10% cheaper than comparable popular brands.
Mr Tan of OK Chicken Rice, who also owns three mini supermarkets, says smaller retailers tend to take their cue from larger rivals when pricing goods.
""They act like a central bank to the rest of the grocery players in Singapore. The good thing about it is that inflation doesn't spike up as much during a crisis but the bad side effect is that entrepreneurship is stifled and only semi-government players can survive,"" he says.
""The question is, after the whole thing is over how many smaller players are left?"" asks Mr Tan. 
Global food prices are expected to remain high this year and the FAO's David Dawe says this is of concern for Asian governments because price hikes have not yet worked their way through the system.
""If global prices continue to rise, there will be an impact, especially for lower income families who spend bigger proportion of their income on food.""
Economists like Mr Dawe and Dr Abiad remain optimistic that Asian countries will continue to be shielded from double-digit food inflation.
But for those on the ground, like Mr Tan and Ms Ng, the issue feels more acute. They wonder whether higher prices, rather than being transitory, will linger on just as the pandemic has.

Two police officers have been shot dead in western Germany during a routine traffic stop. 
At 04:20 local time (03:20 GMT) the officers stopped a vehicle in the Kusel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, a state on the French border.
A 29-year-old male officer and a 24-year-old female officer were shot dead at the scene. The latter was still a student at police academy.
Police have launched a manhunt for the perpetrators.
Roads in the area remain closed and authorities have urged people not to pick up hitchhikers, saying at least one suspect is armed. Officers have also expanded the hunt to the neighbouring state of Saarland.
Some details of the incident are unclear. As yet there is no description of the attackers, the vehicle, or the direction they fled, and police have not suggested a possible motive. 
German newspaper Bild reports that the officers sent two radio messages from the road. 
In the first, the officers reportedly said that they had stopped a suspicious vehicle and discovered dead game in the boot.
A second message followed soon after, the paper added. ""They're shooting at us!"" the officers reportedly said, before radio contact broke off. 
By the time reinforcements arrived the female officer was already dead, local media report. Her colleague died soon after. 
Sabrina Kunz, state chairwoman of the police union, said their thoughts are with the relatives and colleagues of the dead.
""We are living through the true nightmare of all police officers,"" she said, adding she was ""stunned"" by what had happened.

422;Downing Street parties: What is the police investigation?;2022-01-31T15:37:20.000Z;[];['boris johnson', 'metropolitan police service', 'cressida dick', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['johnson', 'party', 'restrictions', 'parties', 'held', 'downing', 'street', 'minister', 'gathering', 'prime', 'work', 'staff', 'investigation'];"
The Metropolitan Police is now known to be investigating 12 gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall during the coronavirus pandemic.
The exact number was revealed in an update on a separate inquiry into the parties, being carried out by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
Ms Gray has published the initial findings of her inquiry into the parties.
It lists 16 alleged parties or gatherings held by government staff during Covid restrictions.
She says that police are investigating all but four of these, and consequently, she is ""extremely limited"" in what she can say.
Those being looked into by the Met include a gathering on 13 November 2020 held in the No 10 Downing Street flat, where the prime minister and his wife live. They are also looking at a gathering in the No 10 Cabinet room on 19 June 2020, to mark the PM's birthday.
Last week, the Met asked for the Gray report to leave out details of parties being investigated by police, to ""avoid any prejudice to our investigation"".
This led to some claims that the most serious allegations against Downing St staff - and possibly the prime minister - could be watered down.
Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers would not normally investigate past breaches of Covid-19 regulations.
But she said retrospective investigations were carried out for ""the most serious and flagrant type of breach"" where there was evidence and certain criteria were met, including:
This video can not be played
In some ways this is a very straightforward investigation for the police, says BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford.
Much of the legwork will have been done and the police need to decide who was at the events and whether they had a good reason to be there, he says.
""This is not a multi-month investigation, this is something that should be containable in a small number of weeks.""
The investigation will be carried out by the Met's long-standing Special Inquiry Team - the UK's principle counter-political corruption unit. 
The unit has previously carried out more than 170 investigations - such as people using a position of political power for their own gain, misconduct in public office and electoral fraud.
Under the Coronavirus Act, Covid breaches are classified as summary offences. 
This means they do not come with prison sentences, but are punishable by fines. 
During the summer of 2020, the Met Police had the power to fine people £100 for the first Covid offence (lowered to £50 if paid within 14 days). Fines for subsequent offences could then double, up to a maximum of £3,200.
Failure or refusal to pay the fine could result in being prosecuted and having to go to court.
However, the fact the police are investigating Downing Street events does not mean ""fixed penalty notices will necessarily be issued in every instance and to every person involved"", Dame Cressida said.
Asked by journalists whether the prime minister was willing to be interviewed by officers, his spokesman responded: ""Anyone asked to will cooperate fully as you would expect.""
Back in 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police in the course of an investigation. 
The investigation was into allegations that peerages were given out in return for donations.
Mr Blair was not interviewed under caution, so he was treated as a witness rather than a suspect.
In July 2007, it was announced that no-one would face charges.
The prime minister said he welcomed the Met's announcement because it would ""help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters"". 
His spokesman said Mr Johnson did not think he had broken the law.
Opposition parties have repeated their calls for him to resign.

426;Newcastle's Covid response documented through photography;2022-01-30T01:27:18.000Z;[];['tom warburton photography', 'newcastle city council'];['covid', 'photography', 'im', 'job', 'response', 'tom', 'involved', 'thing', 'projects', 'ive', 'newcastles', 'glad', 'photographed', 'overwhelmed', 'documented'];"
An amateur photographer who found himself at the centre of the Covid-19 pandemic has told how he documented the response in Newcastle.
Tom Warburton, director of city futures at the council until his recent retirement, has spent almost two years capturing the highs and the lows as the city ""really pulled together"".
Armed with his camera, he started the project on 16 March 2020 when council managers were called for a briefing at the Civic Centre - the first socially-distanced event they had seen.
One week later, the prime minister announced the first national lockdown.
Registered as a key worker and a keen photographer since he was a teenager, Tom said when Covid arrived he knew it was going to be a ""big story"".
""We knew it would be a significant episode for the city,"" he said.
""It was clear to us that the reaction of the local communities, and how the city responded could and would make a real difference.""
In the early stages this was the need for emergency food and support to families struggling in lockdown, as well as PPE supply to care homes, and keeping key council services going such as bin collections and social care.
Later, it moved on to preparing the city to reopen safely, economic support for businesses and helping the NHS roll out the vaccination programmes.
In 2021, moving on from capturing the council's response, Tom worked to broaden the range of subjects - visiting hospitals, funeral directors, foodbanks and the vaccination buses.
""The Covid ICU ones are probably the most poignant,"" he said.
Tom has moved back to Cumbria where he grew up - but the project is continuing. 
He would like to photograph stories from the city's faith communities, the education sector, voluntary groups and families of those who lost someone to Covid.
He then hopes to donate the collection to the Tyne and Wear Museum and Archive Service.
Tom said: ""I'm glad I've done it. It was on top of my day job and I was actively involved in several of the projects you see photographed, so sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the whole thing.
""But looking back I'm just amazed and immensely proud of the people involved in keeping the city functioning for these two years.""
He also paid tribute to the ""millions of unsung heroes who just leant in and kept things going"" in cities around the world.

Sue Gray has blamed a ""failure of leadership"" for allowing parties to take place in Downing Street when the country was under strict lockdown.
In long-awaited findings, the senior civil servant says some events ""should not have been allowed to take place"".
Ms Gray investigated 16 separate gatherings - including three that were not previously known about.
Boris Johnson said he accepted the findings in full, as he faced questions and criticism from MPs.
In Ms Gray's findings, she confirms that the Metropolitan Police is investigating 12 events - on eight separate dates - for alleged Covid-rule breaking.
These include the 20 May 2020 ""bring your own booze"" event in the Downing Street garden, which the PM has apologised for attending, and the PM's birthday party on 19 June 2020.
And the police are also investigating a gathering on 13 November 2020 at Mr Johnson's Downing Street flat.
Asked by Labour MPs if he was at that party, Mr Johnson said he would not give a ""running commentary"" on something that was being investigated by the police.
Ms Gray says she has been ""extremely limited"" in how much she can say by the Met's inquiries, and she could not publish a ""meaningful"" report at this stage. 
But she does make pointed criticisms of the culture in Downing Street among senior civil servants and staff, adding that some of the gatherings did not observe the high standards ""expected of the entire British population at the time"", and that too little thought was given to how they might appear to the public.
""There were failures of leadership and judgement by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,"" she writes.
""Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.""

She adds that the ""excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time"", likely to be a reference to reports of drunken behaviour in the Number 10 garden and staff filling a suitcase with bottles of wine, and recommends a ""robust"" policy on alcohol consumption.
The report is crucial to Mr Johnson's premiership, which has been rocked by weeks of damaging headlines about parties in Downing Street and other government buildings.
Many Conservative MPs had said they were waiting for its findings to decide whether to try to oust him from office.
If at least 54 of them submit letters of no confidence to the 1922 Committee, representing backbench Tory MPs, they can set up a vote on his position.
Mr Johnson addressed a meeting of the committee on Monday evening, after which cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the ""mood was positive"".
A long-standing critic of the prime minister said there was little chance of opponents gathering the signatures needed to trigger a vote, but called the party ""deluded"".
In his Commons statement earlier, the PM vowed to learn from Ms Gray's initial findings, saying: ""I get it and I will fix it.""
""I am sorry for the things we simply didn't get right and also sorry for the way this matter has been handled,"" he said, as he promised a shake-up of the way Downing Street is run.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the British people believe Mr Johnson should ""do the decent thing and resign"" but he is ""a man without shame"". 
The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the Commons chamber after accusing the prime minister of lying to MPs about the events.

The PM said he would create a specific Office of The Prime Minister, carry out a review of the civil service code of conduct and bring in measures to improve the way government works.
He faced repeated opposition calls to resign after his statement, and to publish the Gray report in full. 
Some Tory MPs backed the PM, but others joined in with criticisms.
His predecessor as prime minister and Tory leader, Theresa May, said: ""The Covid regulations imposed significant restrictions on the freedoms of members of the public. 
""They had a right to expect their prime minister to have read the rules, to understand the meaning of the rules and indeed those around him to have done so too and to set an example in following those rules.""
Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told MPs that the prime minister no longer had his support.
Aaron Bell - reported to be among backbench Tory MPs to be calling for a no-confidence vote - sad he had followed strict Covid restrictions at his grandmother's funeral and asked Mr Johnson: ""Does the PM think I am a fool?""
Ms Gray was forced to rewrite her report after the Met asked last week for only ""minimal reference"" to be made to events they are looking at, in order to ""avoid any prejudice to our investigation"".
The leading investigator, Commander Catherine Roper, said officers had been handed ""well over"" 500 pieces of paper, and more than 300 photographs so far. 
They expect to approach in writing, or via email, individuals ""identified as having potentially breached"", added Ms Roper. 
Downing Street said the PM would ""ask Sue Gray to update her work in light of what is found"" by the Metropolitan Police, when they have finished their inquiries.
""He will publish that update,"" added a spokesperson.

There are 14% more tree species than previously thought, according to what researchers are calling the first ""scientifically credible"" estimate.
Of the 73,300 estimated species, the researchers predict there are 9,200 that are yet to be discovered.
But most rare species are in tropical forests, fast disappearing because of climate change and deforestation.
The study is based on a database of tens of millions of trees in more than 100,000 forest plots around the world.
The researchers used statistical techniques to predict the likely number of tree species, correcting for gaps in existing data.
The findings suggest more must be done to protect the incredible life forms needed for food, timber and medicine and to fight climate change by sucking carbon dioxide from the air.
Lead researcher Dr Peter Reich, of the University of Minnesota in St Paul, said the findings highlighted the vulnerability of global forest biodiversity.
""Our data will help us assess where biodiversity is the most threatened,"" he told BBC News. 
""This is in the tropics and subtropics of South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania and those are places where we discovered hotspots of known and unknown rare species. 
""Knowing about these hotspots, hopefully, can help prioritise future conservation efforts.""
South America - the continent with the most ""missing"" species - has about 43% of the total number, followed by:
Diverse natural forests are the most healthy and productive, important to the global economy and to nature.
The vast majority are in tropical countries where deforestation is largely driven by:
More than 140 international researchers worked on the study, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.
Dr Yadvinder Malhi, of the University of Oxford, said tropical forests were the ""global treasure chests of biodiversity"" and significant absorbers of carbon dioxide emissions, slowing global warming. 
""This study shows that tropical forests are even more diverse in their trees than we had previously imagined,"" he said.

436;Gray report: Uncomfortable questions for Boris Johnson;2022-01-31T16:00:36.000Z;[];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson'];['johnson', 'wrong', 'uncomfortable', 'gray', 'repeatedly', 'office', 'ms', 'went', 'sacrifices', 'questions', 'public', 'point', 'period', 'report', 'whats', 'boris'];"
Sue Gray's initial report might be short on detail. But what she makes perfectly clear is that even the bare bones of what went on in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during lockdown were unacceptable in her view.
In Whitehall speak, to say there were ""serious failures"" in leadership is near-condemnation.
Ms Gray reveals that three new gatherings took place that weeks of reporting have not previously uncovered - and she confirms that a dozen of them are being investigated by the police.
Most risky for No 10, we can now be sure that three events the police are looking into were ones Boris Johnson himself attended.
There's an investigation, too, into what happened not just in the government buildings, which are a warren of multiple rooms, but a gathering in the private flat above the shop. 
What's also fascinating is that Ms Gray repeatedly makes the point that what went wrong matters not just because it was ill-advised in the office, but because the public were being asked to make their own sacrifices during this period.
That's why all of this has concerned so many members of the public. That's why so many Tory MPs have been angered by what went on.
By Ms Gray's counting - after interviewing more than 70 people - on 16 occasions, some of those who worked at the heart of government did not obey those rules.
Forget all the process around what and when the report would be published, the back-and-forth with the Met, the claims and denials.
This is an official verdict that Downing Street will try to move on from, but not all of the public, not all of his MPs, may be able to forgive.

437;Sue Gray: Boris Johnson focused on saving his own skin, says Keir Starmer;2022-02-01T09:15:25.000Z;[];['conservative party', 'coronavirus lockdown measures', 'keir starmer', 'boris johnson'];['focused', 'party', 'saving', 'parties', 'skin', 'starmer', 'mitchell', 'gray', 'scandal', 'saying', 'boris', 'johnson', 'judgement', 'keir', 'sue', 'mr', 'today', 'speaking', 'warned'];"
Boris Johnson is focused on ""saving his own skin"" rather than key issues, after findings into No 10 lockdown parties were published, Sir Keir Starmer says. 
The update delivered by Sue Gray blamed a ""failure of leadership"" for rule breaking in Downing Street.
Mr Johnson met Tory MPs on Monday to reassure them about his premiership and to promise a shake-up in No 10. 
But the Labour leader accused the PM of becoming distracted from problems like the cost of living crisis.
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab defended his boss, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had ""expressed contrition for his overall responsibility"", and had a plan to fix the running of No 10.
But fellow Tory MP Andrew Mitchell told the same programme the PM was running government like a ""medieval court"", and he was doing ""great damage"" to his party. 
Metropolitan Police officers are looking into 12 events for alleged breaches of lockdown rules, including three the PM reportedly attended and one in his flat.
In her partial report, released on Monday, senior civil servant Ms Gray said she had been ""extremely limited"" by the police investigation in how much she could say, so a ""meaningful"" report could not be released yet.
She will publish an updated report on lockdown parties in No 10 once police finish their inquiries, Downing Street has said.
A number of Conservative MPs had said they are waiting for Ms Gray's full report to decide whether to try to remove the PM from office.
But Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed the ""mood was positive"" in the party after Mr Johnson addressed a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs on Monday evening.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said the Mr Johnson had become distracted by trying to save his own premiership.
He said: ""So many people are worried about issues such as their energy bills, which are going through the roof, and the prime minister is spending all of his time saving his own skin.
""We now know that he had a meeting planned with the chancellor last week to discuss energy bills, but that was cancelled because he was having meetings to save his own job."" 
But Mr Raab insisted the government was ""getting on with the job"", despite the ongoing investigation. 
""[The PM] recognised that, as Sue Gray said, the standards expected in No 10 were not as they should have been,"" he told Today.
""He said he did take responsibility and he apologised, and he provided a plan of action.
""But if you look at the big judgement calls... the prime minister has got these right. This government has got a plan.""
Asked if Mr Johnson had admitted to breaking any of the rules himself, Mr Raab said: ""The prime minister has been very clear that he acted in good faith at all times.""
It was only 12 pages, but there was one very damaging and difficult conclusion in the terse summary of Sue Gray's report.
It is there now in black and white for all to see - there was rule breaking at the top of government when the country was living through lockdown.
The prime minister's original claim that all the guidelines were followed seems almost farcical now.
Downing Street's early dismissals of the claims, even some of Mr Johnson's allies admit, now seem ill-advised. The Tory leader was savaged in the Commons, including by some of his own side, the disbelief and despair led by the former occupant of his address.
The publication, however, has not toppled over an overwhelming set of dominoes.
There are Conservative MPs who are incandescent. There is also a band of loyalists determined to help him stay on, almost whatever happens next. 
Read more analysis here.
On Monday in the Commons, some of the PM's backbenchers expressed support for him - but others issued stinging rebukes in light of the findings.
Former Prime Minister Theresa May asked if he had read or understood the Covid rules created by his government, or whether he ""believed they did not apply"" to No 10, while ex-cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said the PM no longer had his support.

Speaking to Today on Tuesday, Mr Mitchell warned the issue of parties was ""a crisis that is not going to go away and is doing very great damage to the party"", saying: ""It is more corrosive in my judgement than the expenses scandal was and it will break the coalition that is the Conservative Party.""
The former government whip also criticised the PM's running of No 10, telling the BBC: ""I think the problem is that Boris [Johnson] is running a modern government like a medieval court.
""You need to rule and govern through the structures, through Whitehall, through the cabinet for National Security Council.
""Many of us thought he would govern in the way he did when he was Mayor Of London, through being a chairman of a board, running a very good team - that is not what has happened here."" 
In his meeting with Tory MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister promised he would make changes to his political operation, perhaps later this week. 
This is expected to include the departure of some back room staff, and possibly a new chief whip to replace Mark Spencer, with some limited ministerial moves, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said.
No 10 has also indicated that it will support the formation of new policy groups of backbenchers to feed views more directly into government. 
Mr Johnson also told MPs that the Australian pollster, Lynton Crosby, would be making a return to the operation. There is no detail from Downing Street on what his role will be.

438;The deadly battles that tipped Myanmar into civil war;2022-02-01T00:40:10.000Z;[];['myanmar coup ', 'myanmar', 'asia'];['training', 'civil', 'deadly', 'myanmar', 'thwe', 'university', 'student', 'shot', 'serious', 'battles', 'school', 'relented', 'tipped', 'war', 'pdf', 'protests'];"
Myanmar is seeing increasingly deadly battles between its military and organised groups of armed civilians, new data suggests. Many of those fighting the military are young people who have put their lives on hold since the junta seized power a year ago. 
The intensity and extent of the violence - and the co-ordination of the opposition attacks - point to a change in the conflict from an uprising to a civil war.
Violence is now spread across the country, according to data from conflict monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). Reports from the ground also suggest the fighting has become increasingly co-ordinated and has reached urban centres which have not previously seen armed resistance to the military.
Although precise death tolls are hard to verify, Acled - which bases its data on local media and other reports - has collated figures to suggest about 12,000 people have been killed in political violence since the military seized power on 1 February 2021. Clashes have grown deadlier month on month since August.
In the coup's immediate aftermath, most civilians died as security forces cracked down on nationwide demonstrations. Now, however, the rising death toll is a result of combat - as civilians have taken up arms - Acled figures show.
UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet agreed in an interview with the BBC that the conflict in Myanmar, also known as Burma, should now be termed a civil war and called on the UN Security Council to take ""stronger action"" to put pressure on the military to restore democracy. She said the international response to the crisis had ""lacked urgency"" and described the situation as ""catastrophic"", warning that the conflict now threatened regional stability.
The groups fighting government forces are known collectively as the People's Defence Force (PDF) - a loose network of civilian militia groups largely made up of young adults. 
Hera (not her real name), 18, had just finished high school when she joined anti-government protests following the coup. She has put university plans on hold to become a PDF platoon commander in central Myanmar. She says she was motivated to join the PDF after the high-profile death of student Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing who was shot during the February 2021 protests. Hera's parents were initially concerned when their daughter began a PDF combat training course, but they relented when they realised she was serious. 
""They told me: 'If you really want to do it, do it to the end. Don't give up halfway.' So I talked to my trainer and fully joined the revolution five days after the training.""
Before the coup, people like Hera had grown up enjoying a degree of democracy. They deeply resent the military takeover and are being supported and trained by other ethnically-driven militias in the border regions who have been fighting the military on and off for decades. 
The BBC used figures from Acled, the non-profit organisation, which collects data on political violence and protests around the world. It draws on news reports, publications by civil society and human rights organisations, and security updates from local and international organisations. 
While Acled does not independently verify each news report, it says its data on fatalities are continually updated as new information about events and fatality estimates become available. This is due to the difficulty in capturing all relevant events in a conflict zone where reports can often be biased or incomplete, as well as Acled's policy of recording the lowest estimates reported. 
However, it is impossible to get a fully accurate picture of events given both sides are engaging in a fierce propaganda war. Journalists' reporting is also heavily restricted. 
The BBC's Burmese Service also collected information on fatalities from clashes between Myanmar's military and the PDF from May to June 2021. This was consistent with trends in Acled's data.
The PDF is made up of people from all walks of life - farmers, housewives, doctors and engineers. They are united by a determination to overthrow military rule. 
There are units across the country, but it is significant that young people from the Bamar ethnic majority in the central plains and cities are taking the lead - joining forces with youths of other ethnicities. This is the first time in Myanmar's recent history that the armed forces have faced violent opposition from young Bamars. 
""Many [civilians] have gone into these militias or created these so-called peoples' defence forces,"" Ms Bachelet told the BBC. ""So that's why for a long time, I've been saying that, if we're not able to do something more strongly about it, it will echo so much the Syria situation.""          
Nagar, a former businessman who controls several PDF units in the Sagaing Region in central Myanmar, told the BBC that it is not an equal fight. The PDF began with only catapults, although they have since made their own muskets and bombs. The heavily armed military has aerial firepower - used frequently in recent months. It can procure weapons from countries openly supportive of the junta - including Russia and China. 
An open source investigation by Myanmar Witness - shared with the BBC - confirmed that Russian armoured vehicles were unloaded in Yangon a few weeks ago. 
But the PDF's strength is its support on the ground in local communities. What began as grassroots resistance has become more organised, daring and battle-hardened. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has helped set up and lead some PDF units - and keeps in touch with others more informally. 
The PDF have homed in on soft government force targets, such as police stations and poorly-staffed outposts. They have seized weapons, and have bombed junta-owned businesses including telecom towers and banks. 
Nagar says the PDF have no choice but to take on the future of the country themselves. ""I think resolving the problems at a round table no longer works today. The world is ignoring our country. So I will arm myself.""
Hera, who joined the PDF with her older sisters, says their aim is to ""root out the military dictatorship"". 
""The military has killed innocent people. They destroyed people's livelihoods, properties and possessions. And they terrorise people. I can't accept that in any way."" 
There have been several incidents of mass killings of civilians by the military, including the deaths of at least 40 men in July - and the killing of more than 35 men, women and children in December. 
The BBC has spoken to a man who survived another attack by the military - also in December - by playing dead. Six men - unable to run away when soldiers entered their village in Nagatwin in central Myanmar - were killed. Three of them were elderly and two had mental health conditions, villagers say. The man who survived says junta troops were looking for resistance fighters.

The widow of one of the dead men says her husband's body showed signs of torture. ""They killed an old man who couldn't even speak well enough to explain. I will never forget it. I cry whenever I think about it,"" she told the BBC.
The military rarely gives interviews, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC in late 2021 junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, described the PDF as terrorists - using the label as justification for action against them. 
""If they attack us, we have ordered [our troops] to respond. We are trying to secure the country and the regions by using appropriate force in order to achieve a reasonable level of security,"" he said.
It is difficult to estimate the exact number of fighters on either side. Officially, Myanmar's military numbers about 370,000 troops - but in reality it could be much smaller. There have been fewer recruits in recent years - and also defections since the coup. Similarly, it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the number of people in the PDF.
In addition to the units formed by the NUG, some PDF members are being trained, sheltered and even armed by ethnic armed groups operating along the border. Some of the groups had signed ceasefires with previous governments - those ceasefires have now broken.
The PDF has now publicly apologised to ethnic militias for previously believing military propaganda that the groups had wanted to dismantle the country. The PDF is now unanimously calling for a future federal state in which everyone will have equal rights.  
A nun - who knelt in front of a police frontline in March 2021 to protect protesters in the wake of the military coup - has told the BBC that the political upheaval since the takeover has had a seismic effect on the lives of the public. 
""Children can't go to school. Education, health, social and economic and livelihood - everything has gone backward,"" says Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng.
""Some aborted children because they couldn't provide for them due to the poor economy. Parents can't guide their children properly because of livelihood difficulties.""
But the nun says she admires the young people who have joined the fight. 
""They are brave. They don't mind [sacrificing] their own lives in working to achieve democracy, for the good of the country, to get peace and to get this country liberated [from military rule]. I praise them, I'm proud of them and I respect them.""

445;Why cows may be hiding something but AI can spot it;2022-02-01T00:01:25.000Z;[];['rspca', 'agriculture', 'artificial intelligence', 'dairy farming'];['technology', 'scores', 'research', 'oikonomou', 'peerreviewed', 'roughly', 'prof', 'cows', 'ai', 'team', 'hiding', 'spot', 'terms', 'experts'];"
As cow number 2073 makes her way out of the milking shed and passes in front of a nearby camera, the computer identifies her and watches every step. 
She is only on screen briefly but here is a slight unevenness to her gait, which she is trying to hide. 
A human might not notice that something is wrong but the machine picks it up.
""Really, we want to completely replace any manual watching of animals when the cow sleeps, or she eats,"" says Terry Canning, co-founder and chief executive of CattleEye. 
His firm's technology automatically detects early signs of lameness in cattle. It is confined to milking sheds, for now, but is already being rolled out on dairy farms, mostly in the US and UK. About 20,000 cows are currently under the system's watch.
Farms are increasingly turning to automation for many reasons - among them, to cover labour shortages. But new tech also offers potential improvements in animal welfare and a reduction in emissions, says Mr Canning.
""We've actually calculated, that if you can reduce lameness levels by 10% on a farm, there's a saving of half a tonne of carbon per cow per year,"" he explains.
Lameness is caused by injuries or infections and can be very painful. Lame cows produce less milk and if it goes untreated it can mean that they end up being culled.
University of Liverpool researchers have studied CattleEye's system on three farms to check its accuracy. 
In research funded by the firm (which is yet to be peer-reviewed), Prof George Oikonomou and his team compared mobility scores for cattle made by two human experts with those made by CattleEye. They found that the technology was roughly 80-90% in agreement with the two experts - in terms of judging which animals were lame. 
When 84 of the cows were subsequently checked for foot problems, the researchers found the AI system had performed slightly better than a human expert in terms of selecting those that had tissue damage in their hooves among the animals it had designated as lame.
A separate study, also led by Prof Oikonomou but funded by the Welsh government's Farming Connect scheme, found the introduction of CattleEye at one Welsh dairy farm with 300 cows, saw the proportion of animals with mobility issues fall from 25.4% to 13.5% after six months.
CattleEye is just one system bringing higher levels of automated surveillance to farms. Other devices for tracking their health include Moocall sensors.
These are strapped to a cow's tail and indicate when they are about to give birth. The sensors pick up a characteristic up and down motion of the cow's tail that occurs prior to calving.
Yet, there are plenty of farms that have not yet adopted these technologies. Dr Sarah Lloyd, her husband and family, run a farm in rural Wisconsin with about 400 cows. All of the milk they produce goes for cheese production.
""The cost of the technology just can't be borne by our milk price,"" she says. Her husband Nels Nelson prefers to work ""with his sleeves rolled up"" rather than rely on machines, she adds. He's not anti-tech but the family don't see a benefit in investing in AI-based systems.
Others take a different view. Dr Jeffrey Bewley is an analytics and innovation scientist at the dairy cattle breed organisation, Holstein Association USA. He grew up on a Kentucky dairy farm and has studied the industry ""my entire life"". He has done some consulting work for farm tech firms, though not for CattleEye.
He says there are tell-tale signs of lameness in cattle that farmers will spot - cow's back might arch a little bit, her head may bob or the length of her strides will get noticeably longer or shorter. 
But lameness is something that cows naturally try to hide because they have evolved as prey animals. So, technology that helps the farmer spot the earliest subtle signs of lameness could be useful, he explains.
The animal charity RSPCA says it welcomes new technologies for monitoring cattle, as identifying lameness can be quite subjective for human observers and so such systems could make mobility scoring more accurate.
But the organisation says that since these are novel technologies and their validity is still developing ""they cannot replace regular mobility scoring using a valid, reproducible method"".
More technology of business:
AI will gradually play a bigger role on our farms - but exactly to what extent is unclear, and whether it will really improve conditions for the animals themselves?
""I've been in several bulk barns, several dairies that are shifted to robotics and the cows are just friendlier. You can walk among them and they don't seem to be excited at all,"" says Jack Britt, professor emeritus at North Carolina State University, who has consulted for various farm tech companies. 
Yet, not all interventions have to be high tech. Simply adding grooves to the concrete on which cows walk to and from the milking shed, can improve their stability and reduce their chance of becoming lame, he says.
Nonetheless, he predicts in 50 years' time 90% of the human labour on farms will be replaced by machines. 
It is not a vision shared by Dr Lloyd. While she accepts it can be challenging to find human farm workers, she would rather keep trying than turn to machines. ""I'd prefer to have more human eyes working on farms and making a living,"" she says. 
""That's important for the economic life and social life of our community.""

446;True story? Lie detection systems go high-tech;2022-01-31T00:03:00.000Z;[];['israel'];['remained', 'dry', 'mouth', 'lied', 'true', 'person', 'nervous', 'detection', 'hightech', 'period', 'individual', 'systems', 'theory', 'guilty', 'lie'];"
Prof Yael Hanein sticks a number of electrodes to the left side of my face.
""Move your eyes, blink, smile. Now try to relax,"" she says. ""We will see if you are a good or bad liar shortly.""
Prof Hanein and colleague Prof Dino Levy lead a team at Israel's Tel Aviv University that have developed a new method of lie detection.
They say they have identified two types of liars - those who involuntarily move their eyebrows when they tell a fib, and those that cannot control a very slight lip movement where their lips meet their cheeks.
Their software and its algorithm can now detect 73% of lies and they intend to improve that as they develop the system. ""When you try to conceal a lie, one of the things you try to avoid is any sort of body reaction,"" she says.
Prof Levy adds: ""But it's very, very hard for you to conceal a lie with this technology.""
Methods of lie detection have probably been around for as long as tall tales have been told. One of the first documented examples comes from 1000BC in China, where a suspect would have to fill his or her mouth with dry rice.
After a period of time the grains would be checked, and if they remained dry then the person was determined to be guilty. The theory was that if the individual had indeed lied he or she would be fearful or nervous, and therefore have a dry mouth.
The early 20th Century saw the invention of the first lie detection machines or polygraphs. The most well-known of these is the ""analogue polygraph"", which typically has three or four ink-filled needles that dance round on a strip of moving paper.
The suspect has sensors attached to their fingers, arms and body and the machine then measures breathing rate, pulse, blood pressure and perspiration as they answer a series of questions.
Yet there are continuing concerns about the accuracy of these machines and whether it is possible to fool them. So researchers and technology firms around the world are working to develop more high-tech polygraph systems.
At Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Dr Sebastian Speer and his team are using an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine to spot if someone is lying or cheating. They do this by looking out for colour changes in brain scans in response to questions.
""Essentially we see [different] areas [of the brain] that are more strongly activated [light up on the scans] when someone decides to cheat or to be honest,"" says Dr Speer.
One high-tech lie detection system already in use is EyeDetect from Utah-based firm Converus. This focuses on involuntary eye movements to detect lies.
A subject is asked to answer a number of true or false, or yes and no, questions. As they do so, eye tracking software watches and studies their responses. The result is then provided within five minutes, and it claims to be 86-88% accurate.
Converus (the world is Latin for ""with truth"") says EyeDetect is now used by more than 600 customers in 50 countries, including over 65 US law enforcement agencies and nearly 100 worldwide.
Chief executive Todd Mickelsen says the test is being utilised by authorities and firms to screen for numerous things: ""These could include prior crimes, drug use past or present, unreported disciplinary action, lying on a job application, terrorist ties.""
Meanwhile police detectives can use EyeDetect to ask specific questions regarding a crime.
It is important to stress, however, that the legality of lie detectors varies greatly from country to country,
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
In the UK, polygraphs have been used by the probation service ""in the management of people convicted of sexual offences"" since 2014. And they are now being trialled regarding domestic abuse offenders.
But the results of polygraph tests cannot be used in criminal cases in the UK's three separate legal systems - England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
At the same time, UK employers are allowed to offer a lie detection test to staff, but this has to be optional.
In the US, the rules differ from state to state, with the further complication of US-wide federal law on top.
For instance, California allows lie detection test evidence in state-level criminal court cases if both sides agree, yet in New York state it is not allowed under any circumstances. And US police forces cannot require that a suspect or arrested person undergoes a test.
Meanwhile, The Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act prevents firms from putting job applications through a test.
Former CIA officer Christopher Burgess cautions that lie detectors should not be been seen as the be-all and end-all for proving the guilt or innocence of criminals - or spies.
""It's one tool used during the interrogation phase of an investigation,"" he says. ""Evidence is how liars, scoundrels, cheats and fabricators are sussed out."" 
Mr Burgess, who is now a security analyst, adds that the devices are not completely accurate, and says that he himself was once wrongly implicated by a false test result back in the mid 1990s.
As more high-tech lie detection systems enter use, he says there remain ""ethical and moral questions"".
Back at Tel Aviv University, the researchers hope that the electrodes will eventually be replaced by video cameras and software able to spot a liar from a distance or even via an internet link, based on facial muscle movements.
""In the bank, in police interrogations, at the airport or online job interviews, high-resolution cameras trained to identify movements of facial muscles will be able to tell truthful statements from lies,"" Prof Levy predicts.
After my interrogation I ask if I have passed.
""You're not a very good liar,"" the two professors jest.

447;Laura Kuenssberg: MPs resolved to leave PM on probation;2022-01-31T23:29:50.000Z;[];['conservative party', 'coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson'];['resolved', 'gone', 'laura', 'probation', 'know', 'kuenssberg', 'pass', 'leading', 'summon', 'mps', 'hindered', 'minister', 'dont', 'whats', 'leave', 'fact'];"
It was only 12 pages, but there was one very damaging and difficult conclusion in the terse summary of Sue Gray's report.
It is there now in black and white for all to see - there was rule breaking at the top of government when the country was living through lockdown.
The prime minister's original claim that all the guidelines were followed seem almost farcical now.
Downing Street's early dismissals of the claims, even some of Mr Johnson's allies admit, now seem ill-advised. The Tory leader was savaged in the Commons, including by some of his own side, the disbelief and despair led by the former occupant of his address.
The publication, however, has not toppled over an overwhelming set of dominoes.
There are Conservative MPs who are incandescent. There are also a band of loyalists who are determined to help him stay on, almost whatever happens next. 
And late on Monday, they were not suddenly full of new panic that it was all about to fall apart - indeed, after what they believe was a better outing for Mr Johnson in private in front of his MPs on Monday night, they believe the would-be rebels who want to see him gone don't have any meaningful new momentum.
Remember the process that Tory MPs can use to trigger a contest for their leader is secret, so no-one can be sure how near or far the malcontents are from the threshold of 54 private letters which would press the button on a contest. 
It cannot have been easy for many of them to endure Keir Starmer's stand-out speech in the Commons on Monday, when he quoted Thatcher at them, urging them to act to end what seems to him, and some of them, a sorry saga. 
Yet Boris Johnson's helped by the fact the report has not yet named any specific names. The verdict was damning, but not personal, the criticisms sharp but general.
And those who want him gone are also hindered by the fact that they don't yet agree on who or what should come next if they summon up the courage to take action. One minister who is certainly in that camp described it as 'the battle of the Alamo, we can see what's coming, and we know the captain is leading us badly, but we don't yet know who to pass the baton to'. 
Yet Downing Street is not clear of danger. Sue Gray's findings put this whole mess back under the public's nose. How the polls shift in the coming days and weeks will help shape Downing Street's fortunes, for good or for ill.
The embarrassment of the coming police report could dramatically make things even worse. Events that we know he attended are now officially under police investigation, including one in his own home, the Downing Street flat. And extraordinarily the police are even confirming publicly how many photographs and pieces of evidence they have.
Boris Johnson has reduced the fever in his party by making his MPs a set of promises - to change his team in Number 10, potentially some expect a new chief whip, a few ministerial moves as well as departures of some of his backroom staff.
He's promised the return of the campaigner Lynton Crosby, which doesn't at this stage seem like a formal new appointment, more like a vow that he'll take stronger advice.
Many rational MPs seem to have resolved to leave Mr Johnson on probation - break the commitments he made to them and that could quickly change.  For now it seems the prime minister has survived the day. Yet in time, his MPs will judge whether just getting through is enough.

450;The myth of a 'super-charged' immune system;2022-02-01T20:31:27.000Z;[];['immune system'];['self', 'matter', 'supercharged', 'passage', 'means', 'immune', 'myth', 'harm', 'list', 'guest', 'system', 'tool'];"
Suddenly we are all talking about immunity - but how much do we really understand? Science writer and YouTuber Philipp Dettmer unpicks one of the most common misconceptions.
Next time you wake up feeling a bit under the weather, spare a thought for the army of soldiers fighting millions of enemies on your behalf.
Inside the fortress of your body.
While intruders attack hundreds of thousands of your cells, your immune system is organising complex defences, communicating over vast distances and dishing out a swift death to millions, if not billions, of these invaders. 
All the while you are standing in the shower, mildly annoyed at being sick.
What you are feeling - the snotty nose, the raised temperature, the sore throat, the general feeling of being a bit ""off"" - is actually the effect of this battle going on out of sight.
The immune system is complicated in the sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature. It is the most complex biological system in the human body, other than the brain.
And it's being talked about now more than ever before. The pandemic has introduced a new vocabulary into our lives. We talk about natural immunity in people who have recovered from Covid and immunity from vaccines.
Jabs, boosters, side effects... these are suddenly subjects of conversation as common as the weather.
But talking more about immunity doesn't necessarily mean we understand it more. Let's take an example. Perhaps the biggest misconception is the preoccupation society has with attaining a strong, ""super-charged"" immune system.
The internet is filled with products that promise to do exactly that. From infused coffee to protein powder, from mystical roots dug up in the Amazon rainforest to vitamin pills, the list is endless.
But what a lot of people fail to understand is that the immune system can be dangerous. It's not a thing we want to be unleashed inside us without limits. 
In a world where self-improvement is big business, the idea of charging up your immune system is very appealing - but it's not a strong immune system we want, but a balanced one that keeps all the different systems in check. 
We are talking about a complex and interconnected collection of hundreds of bases and recruitment centres all over your body. They are connected by a superhighway, a network of vessels, as similarly vast and omnipresent as your cardiovascular system. 
On top of organs and infrastructure, billions of immune cells patrol either these superhighways or your bloodstream and are ready to engage your enemies when called upon. Billions more sit guard in the tissue of your body that borders your outsides waiting for invaders to cross them. There are also trillions of protein weapons that you can think of as land mines. 
Your immune system also has dedicated universities where cells learn who to fight and how, complete with the largest biological library in the universe, able to identify and remember every possible invader that you may ever encounter in your life.
At its very core, the immune system is a tool to distinguish the other from the self. It does not matter if the other means to harm you or not. If the other is not on a very exclusive guest list that grants free passage, it has to be attacked and destroyed because the other might harm you.
You've probably got the picture by now - it's a highly complex system made up of many different components. A well-functioning immune system is very good at using just the right amount of force for any given infection. So the idea of strengthening these systems to be more aggressive is ridiculous. 
Instead of a rugby player smashing into things, you want it to be a ballet dancer - highly trained, precise and able to strike with ease but dancing in harmony with the music.
There is an old Greek word homeostasis, the balance of all things, which is what we should strive for.
It's such an intricate system, so many things could go wrong if it was made more powerful. It could overreact to a minor infection. This misunderstanding is partly because people lack a good mental image of what the term means. They think of it as an energy shield that you can charge up. But it's not a thing at all, it's a multitude of things. 
In reality, nobody knows how many cells of which kinds and at what activity level are necessary to have your immune system work optimally. Anybody who says that they know what is needed is probably trying to sell you something.
At least for now, there are no scientifically proven ways to make your immune system more aggressive through a superfood or pill. And if there were, it would be very dangerous to use them without medical supervision.
People prefer easy, quick solutions but health depends on very boring things that people don't want to hear. Exercise, a balanced diet and reduced stress. We all know these are good for us but we don't want to do it.
The most important thing is to eat a diet that provides you with all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs, for example fruits and vegetables. Your immune system constantly makes many billions of new cells and they need feeding. 
The positive health effects of even moderate regular exercise have been known for a long time. Good circulation allows your cells and immune proteins to move more efficiently and freely, which makes them do their job better. Exercise can also slow down its decline in old age.
Leading less stressful lives has tangible benefits to our health in many ways, and one of them is the immune system. Without going into too much detail, stress can set off chains of events that disrupt the work and the balance of that system.
So why do some people seem to get colds and flus more than others? There are three reasons for that.
The reality is we are not the same. Lifestyle choices do matter. Maybe you smoke or you don't eat as well as others. Maybe you have a very stressful job or a job that exposes you to viruses, or perhaps you just don't get off the couch. 
And there's genetics. Everyone is a bit different. One person might be better at fighting viruses and another better at fighting bacteria. 
And thirdly there's perception. Everyone claims to know someone who says they never get sick but that's not true. 
So maybe the next time you do wake up with a runny nose or a bit of a sweat, spare a thought for the army of helpers that's keeping you alive.
And instead of cursing your luck, maybe give thanks.
