Five Great Reads: parental advice about parenting, dumped by the mob, and thriving beyond the ‘Brimley line’;2023-01-27T21:00:00Z;['Kris Swales'];['N/A'];"Good morning good readers, life moves pretty fast and we’re already four weeks into 2023. So far, so normal on my end, which I’m chalking up as a small victory. It’s already been a busy news year, and if you find yourself missing out on the stories that matter we have two weekday newsletters just for you. Morning Mail delivers our agenda-setting local reporting and overseas developments to your inbox, and the Afternoon Update wraps up the biggest events that went down when you were working hard to make a living. That’s enough 1980s film references for now. Here are the deeper reads that hooked me in this week. And I’ve saved the deepest for last … 1. How 26 January exposed voice campaign’s challenges
With each passing year Australia’s national day presents even more to unpack. “The noisiest day of the year,” writes political editor Katharine Murphy, “is both totemic and bitterly contested.” And this year the contest coalesced around the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum. Murph and Canberra bureau colleague Josh Butler took the temperature on the ground at Invasion Day rallies in the nation’s capital, and found opinion divided. “Fuck your voice,” screamed one sign. “When they stand over there with them,” Nioka Coe-Craigie said, gesturing towards parliament, “they lose the right to speak on behalf of our people.” Opposition to the voice was less enthusiastic in the crowd. As one protester, Nell, observed: “There’s no power unless you get in that door [of parliament].” The conclusion? “While we can’t know the future, the scenes at Thursday’s rallies expose the perennial problem for Labor. Critics on the right will chide the government for going too far, while critics on the left want them to go further. With only a simple yes or no vote available in the referendum, the government is entirely alive to the possibility of being sandwiched and outflanked on both edges.” How long will it take to read: Three minutes. Further reading: Paul Karp’s explainer on why a voice to parliament won’t affect First Nations sovereignty. 2. ‘Don’t become the expert in the baby’ You know what they say about opinions – and when it comes to parenting, you better believe everybody has got one. But when Bridie Jabour was struggling to cope as a first-time mum, those seven sage words of advice from her mother set her on the right track. Notable quote: “She told me when my partner’s home he’s going to do things differently. He’s going to feed the baby differently, bathe the baby differently, put the baby to sleep differently. You may look at them bathing the baby and think it’s the most ridiculous method you’ve ever seen, but walk away.” How long will it take to read: Two minutes Further reading: The Words to live by series has been running all through summer and isn’t finished yet. Or if you want to know more misconceptions about the “magic” of parenting, Isabelle Oderberg has you covered. 3. The massive crime scandal behind the UK’s rubbish Seems Tony Soprano isn’t the only mob boss with an interest in the sanitation industry. In Northern Ireland, as husband-and-wife investigative reporters Dan Ashby and Lucy Taylor discovered, if you’ve got a rubbish disposal problem there are crime gangs who will happily get rid of it for you – for a price. While the gangs profit, it’s the environment that ends up paying. At one special conservation site where waste equivalent to about 20 Titanic ships was dumped, everything from asbestos to arsenic was detected during a £100m (A$175m) clean-up job. Notable quote: “Just think about what you throw away,” says Ashby. “It’s a stunning amount. That waste has to be dealt with, and someone has to pay someone to deal with it. It’s low risk for criminals and you’re being paid to do the crime. It is an extraordinarily brilliant business.” How long will it take to read: Three minutes 4. To the ‘Brimley line’ and beyond
Regular readers of Guardian Australia will be familiar with the “Barnaby line”, an invisible electoral boundary penned on to the map by rural editor Gabrielle Chan. But the “Brimley line”? It refers to the age at which 50-and-a-bit Wilfred Brimley played an “old” man in Ron Howard’s 1985 hit Cocoon, and a Twitter account tracks current celebrities as they reach 18,350 days old. Van Badham has noticed a trend in the current awards season: from Ke Huy Quan to the irrepressible Jennifer Coolidge, people beyond the Brimley line are thriving. And it comes as she admits to looking in the mirror, poking at her cheeks and trying to convince herself that “some surgical rerigging would be quick, easy, painless and risk-free”. Notable quote: “There was a time when being young was conceived as a boxed window of opportunity to find true love and sexual fulfilment, to have children, to feel physically strong and healthy, to enjoy the powerful sensation of potential. Yet improvements to wealth, health, wellbeing and technology, a liberalising society, and the changed nature of work and the built environment have stretched that capacity window well beyond the narrow frame of youthful years.” How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. Pamela Anderson reclaims her story The former Baywatch star and (by her own admission) serial wife to bad husbands is five years and counting beyond the Brimley line, and determined to tell her story her own way. Charlotte Edwardes, in her first assignment for the Guardian, coaxes one stunning admission after another from the 55-year-old actor who has gone cold turkey on men and taken a long, hard look at her life. The result? A forthcoming Netflix documentary and a new appreciation for young Pamela’s survival. “How did I get through all that? How did I make those choices?,” Anderson says. “But I also have empathy for myself. I see that I just didn’t have the tools.” The Tommy Lee years: You may have seen the sex tape, or the unauthorised miniseries about the sex tape. But despite Anderson’s frank disclosure of multiple red flags (including spiking her drink with ecstasy on their first date) she still concludes the Mötley Crüe drummer is the love of her life. “I know it wasn’t perfect but, you know, no one’s perfect. We made two beautiful babies and so I don’t have any regrets.” How long will it take to read: Eight minutes.

 Friday briefing: Rishi Sunak’s plan to resurrect the Tory poll rating is underway – does he stand a chance? ;2023-01-27T06:49:30Z;['Archie Bland', 'Nimo Omer'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Yesterday, Rishi Sunak gathered his cabinet ministers in a retreat at Chequers for an all-day strategy session that was supposed to figure out the scale of the electoral task ahead and how they can turn around their abysmal poll ratings. The local elections in parts of England and all of Northern Ireland are set to take place in three months and a general election is less than two years away. If the Tories wants to win, Sunak has a very large mountain to climb. Today’s newsletter, with Guardian political correspondent Kiran Stacey, is about the scale of the challenge, and what Sunak thinks he needs to do to meet it. Five big stories West Bank | There are concerns over escalating violence after Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians during a West Bank raid, marking the single deadliest day in the territory in decades. Two rockets were fired from Gaza early this morning, and Israel responded with multiple air attacks on the Gaza Strip. Scotland | Nicola Sturgeon has told the Scottish parliament that Isla Bryson, a transgender woman who was found guilty of raping two women before transitioning, will not be imprisoned in Scotland’s all-female Cornton Vale prison after news the offender had been transferred there on Tuesday before sentencing. Windrush | Wendy Williams, the head of the inquiry into the Windrush scandal, has expressed disappointment and concern after the home secretary announced that she has dropped three key reform commitments, three years after the recommendations were accepted fully by the government. Crime | A 61-year-old man from Leyland in Lancashire has been charged with assaulting the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, on public transport in London. Media | BuzzFeed has said that it will be using technology from ChatGPT’s artificial intelligence firm, Open AI, to personalise and enhance its online quizzes and content. The media company announced last month it would cut about 12% of its workforce to bring down costs. In depth: ‘Talk to Tory MPs, and they are expecting a landslide defeat’
Two ministers under investigation and seven days of unremitting bad press that involved everything from being fined for not wearing a seatbelt to travelling from London to Lancashire on a 14-seater RAF jet – Sunak needs all the help he can get right now. The meeting at Chequers (above) was the latest attempt to come up with a plan to win back the country. But while Sunak told his ministers that they must “relentlessly focus” on inflation and the NHS to have a chance at the next election, the difficulty of that approach was made abundantly clear in an interview he gave soon afterwards: inevitably, the focus was on Nadhim Zahawi. So how can Sunak go about turning the tide? *** The predicament Local elections. With the first big electoral test for the government fast approaching in May, high on the agenda will be how to secure the so-called “blue wall” seats that are up for grabs. Unfortunately for Sunak, the polling still stinks. The Conservatives remain stuck at a stubborn 20-point deficit to Labour across multiple pollsters. An Ipsos poll for the Economist last week found that 61% of the public think the country is headed in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, a poll by Redfield and Wilton Strategies of 40 crucial “red wall” seats finds Labour hanging on to 90% of its 2019 voters, against just 55% for the Conservatives. The Conservative party is disunited. It was presumably pretty awkward at Chequers when the person who was supposed to be heading up the meeting no longer had a formal role – but was nonetheless there. The row surrounding the party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, and his tax affairs has overshadowed pretty much everything, with his own constituents in Stratford-upon-Avon calling on him to resign. And Zahawi isn’t the only senior Tory cabinet minister giving Sunak a headache. The Guardian’s Pippa Crerar reported that the investigation into the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, is far more broad than was initially known. At least 24 civil servants are involved in complaints against Raab, leaving him fighting for his political life. All this is happening as backbenchers line up to tell anyone who will listen of their displeasure with the way the party and country are being governed. “His problem is that he only really has a mandate from them – not even from the party members,” Kiran said. “He really needs them to stay on board, and that has led to the perception that it’s easy to push him around.” The splits in the party are not just coming from one faction either – with Jessica Elgot reporting last week that some senior Tories expect more liberal Conservatives to start making demands after recent concessions to the right over planning, the environment and online safety. “We cannot have a situation where the prime minister is so frightened of his own party that 30 colleagues can get him to change his mind about anything,” one former cabinet minister said. All this would be much easier to manage if it weren’t for the spectre of Boris Johnson in the background, and the continued view among some MPs that he would be a better electoral bet. The economy isn’t doing too well either. Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget will be his second fiscal statement since setting light to Liz Truss’s plans in the autumn. And even though the UK avoided a technical recession in November and inflation has now fallen for two months in a row, the cost of living crisis continues to bite many households who are contending with the fastest annual rise in food prices since 1977. Real-terms pay is falling, strikes feel near-constant, and even the Brexit-backing billionaire James Dyson thinks that any growth that can be found is “despite government, rather than because of it”. With myriad problems on his plate, it seems that Hunt remains single-mindedly focused on inflation, and sees bringing it down as the key to everything. And, to the dismay of his colleagues, tax cuts are still off the table. Instead, Hunt will focus on tackling British “declinism” by pushing policies that allow the private sector to “re-tool” the UK’s industrial base. *** The prescription
Capitalise on Sunak’s relative popularity. OK, the public doesn’t actually like him – that Ipsos poll finds a -9% net favourability rating and Omnisis has him 13 points behind Keir Starmer – but he’s closer to the Labour leader on an individual basis than his party. Part of the Conservative plan visible in last week’s trip to the north of England is to “sell him across the country”, Kiran said. “They think he’s good off-the-cuff and they want to show people that. Obviously that’s no good if you can’t also translate it to a big speech or a TV hit, but he is very good on detail.” For that to work, Sunak appears to recognise that he has to take public anger with the government on the chin. “He was almost trying to get people to be more combative in their questioning – he said, you don’t have to just ask me about levelling up. People need to see that he understands that the government bears some of the blame for where the country is.” The Daily Mail reported some optimism ahead of the awayday that it can be done: Isaac Levido, the election strategist, was expected to tell ministers that there was a “narrow” path to election victory because Starmer’s lead is “softer than it looks”. Get the barnacles off the boat. Cliched though that Lynton Crosbyism is, it remains a succinct summary of familiar advice: focus relentlessly on the issues that matter to voters and abandon everything else. In 2023, that might mean the economy and the NHS, and much less about culture wars: witness the recent decision to abandon Nadine Dorries’ plan to privatise Channel 4. But that’s much harder because of Sunak’s authority problem in his own party. “If you want the barnacles off the boat, you need to be able to stand up to MPs who want to keep their pet projects in place,” Kiran said. “Some of those barnacles are quite cherished.” Show some progress. From inflation to the small boats crisis in the Channel, the five pledges were widely noted for how limited they were. Still, they offer the most plausible path to being able to argue that the UK is headed in the right direction. Kiran said: “The campaign they really want to run is a bit like the 2015 one [which saw David Cameron win a Conservative majority after five years of coalition]: ‘difficult decisions have been taken, but there is a better future to come’. Maybe some tax cuts and spending increases after doing the hard bit. But that is a tougher sell when you’ve been in government for 13 years.” *** How likely is all this to work? Not very. “Sunak is in the worst possible situation,” Kiran said. “He hasn’t got enough time to make a massive difference in policy terms, but there is long enough for the sheen of new leadership to have faded. That’s very awkward.” It’s perhaps a marker of the two largest parties’ internal psychodramas that both are pessimistic. “Talk to the Tories, especially MPs from the ‘red wall’, and they are expecting a landslide defeat,” Kiran said. “Labour people are very cautiously optimistic that they might get a hung parliament. A lot can change before an election – but the fundamentals for Sunak are so bad that it’s very hard to see how he gets back.” What else we’ve been reading Imagine finding the sound of your partner eating so distressing that you ended the relationship.

TV Three Minutes: A Lengthening (BBC iPlayer) This combination of historical investigation, documentary and art piece is astonishing. It takes as its starting point a short home movie shot in Nasielsk, Poland, in 1938. There were 7,000 inhabitants. Of those, 3,000 were Jewish – and only 100 survived the Holocaust. Director Bianca Stigter “lengthens” this clip in many unexpected ways, with poetic narration from Helena Bonham Carter. Rebecca Nicholson Music Sam Smith – Gloria Unholy, a chart-topping collaboration with Kim Petras, represented a departure for Smith, featuring a dramatic choral hook and a stark electronic sound. Things have changed, at least a little, but there’s still something underwhelming about this new album. Its best song might be the disco-fied I’m Not Here to Make Friends, about finding a one-night stand on the dancefloor.

The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
A decade-long study has identified six factors which may help individuals to slow cognitive decline and reduce their risk of developing dementia. A healthy diet, regular exercise, active social contact, cognitive activity, and abstaining from smoking and alcohol were identified as crucial to slowing down memory loss, according to researchers from Beijing’s National Center for Neurological Disorders. Their research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that people with four to six healthy behaviours were almost 90% less likely to develop dementia compared to those who were the least healthy. Dr Susan Mitchell, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that the study “adds to the substantial evidence that a healthy lifestyle can help to support memory and thinking skills as we age”.

The tap you drink from in your house says a lot about you | Jack Vening;2023-01-26T14:00:25Z;['Jack Vening'];['N/A'];"Recently I drank from the forbidden tap and it did not harm me. I was as surprised as anyone. And yet, lying awake at night, I know that what I did was deeply unnatural and the experience has surely changed me in ways it will take years to fully comprehend. The tap you drink from says a lot about you. There’s a hierarchy to the taps in your house, and even if you don’t observe it consciously you probably abide by it in some way. You may argue that the water all comes from the same source, but its taste is inarguably defined by the vibe of its tap. As we are hardcoded to interpret the taste of water as a sign of the integrity of our environment, that’s everything – would you rather choose a pristine alpine spring over a grey creek with a skeleton at its banks? And if you really believed it was all the same you’d be boiling your pasta with water from the bathroom tap. Imagine. God exploded Sodom and Gomorrah for less.
The kitchen A confession: growing up I would usually get my water from the bathroom tap. The kitchen pipes were old and grimy. The mid-century water pressure made them shake like a giant murderer rattling his cage in hell. It tasted like how I imagine the Titanic now does, and it gave the same satisfaction of licking moisture from a dungeon’s walls for survival. This isn’t the way it should be. Once we’d renovated our ancient pipes the kitchen tap became my primary water source, as nature intended. The kitchen should be your primary drinking source too, full stop. Kitchen tap water tastes like it’s meant to be drunk. It feels better in the body. Not only is it the most hydrating and physically nourishing tap, being located where food is made and stored, it’s also near the cups, so unless you like carrying a mug around on your belt like some character from The Canterbury Tales, you know this is your first port of call. Bathroom tap The bathroom tap has an important place in the house. It’s for cleansing. It’s for healing, routine, ritual. Thus, it’s mostly drunk from under certain conditions, and never recreationally. It can be taken in the middle of the night or ported to the bedside table (suggesting soporific properties). It can be collected in the mouth while showering because you’re too hungover to bend down to a tap or walk to the kitchen. If this is your primary drinking tap then you’d better have a good excuse, like when you eat nothing but orange vitamin C tablets because you don’t have any real snacks in the house. Garden tap This is a specialist tap and should only be drunk from by your dad or for if you’re trying to wash out the taste of a bug that flew into your mouth when you were running around carelessly. This is a tap for dogs and plants. The water it produces is wild and should not be taken lightly.
Certainly there’s something compelling about that? It’s at odds with the civilisation we believe ourselves safe in. To drink from it is to glimpse a distant, primordial era, when we all drank blood and didn’t have to remember so many passwords. It’s a reminder of who we once were, who we may one day be again. Plus it sometimes has slugs in it, so watch out! Laundry tap But there is a darker road – that of the laundry tap drinker, a road I now find myself travelling down for better or worse. Previously I thought this would be a tap you would only drink from in a survival situation, or if you were one of those special forces guys whose perception of reality has been altered by intensely late nights. Now I know who it’s for: thirsty fools, disoriented by the tumult of the secondhand dryer, distracted enough to do something irreversible. This is the tap nobody should drink from.

Thursday briefing: How Justin Bieber selling his back catalogue for $200m could change music;2023-01-26T06:40:00Z;['Nimo Omer'];['N/A'];"Good morning. For the last 15 years, Justin Bieber has been a mainstay of pop music. Rising above the surfeit of teeny-boppers discovered on YouTube in the mid-to-late 2000s, Bieber’s meteoric rise made him one of the most successful musicians of our time, all while his frontal lobe was still developing. Despite vitriol from critics, the Canadian musician has sold over 150m records worldwide, with all six of his albums going platinum or multi-platinum, all before the age of 30. Now, Bieber has decided to cash in early, following a path usually reserved for older musicians such as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen in selling the rights to his music. A long-rumoured $200m (£162m) deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital covers more than 290 titles released before the end of 2021, with Universal Music Group retaining the rights to the master recordings. But beyond the blockbuster figures, the world of music catalogue acquisitions is a confusing, peculiar one, with companies paying premium prices and vacuuming up every hit they can find. I spoke to music business reporter Eamonn Forde about why more and more artists are selling up. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Police | The Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, has predicted that “two to three” officers a week will face trial for crimes such as violence against women and dishonesty. Rowley has vowed to clean up the Met, as the force continues to be dogged by scandals. Politics | At least 24 civil servants are involved in complaints against the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, the Guardian understands. The severity of some of the claims and the extent of the investigation have led to doubts from government insiders about how long Raab can stay in his position. Crime | The father of Jake Davison, the man responsible for the Plymouth shooting, said he tried to warn police not to give his son a shotgun licence, telling the authorities that he lived in a “volatile environment”. Police revoked Davison’s licence in 2020 after he assaulted two teenagers in a park, but returned his shotgun in 2021 – weeks before the killings. Society | The 2021 census has found that 16 to 24-year-olds are more than twice as likely to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or another minority sexual orientation than the overall population. US | Civil rights groups and online safety advocates have roundly condemned Meta’s decision to allow Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram following a two-year ban. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, has written there are “new guardrails in place to deter repeat offences”. In depth: ‘The money offered is so ridiculous you really have to have a good reason not to sell’
Vinyl, CDs, MP3s, piracy, streaming, back to vinyl – there are few sectors that have gone through as many changes as the music industry, with each marking a new era and often leading to significant restructuring within the business. So, what does this new period of siphoning tens of thousands of songs from the past mean for the industry’s future? *** Why are these deals happening? There are a multitude of reasons why companies are spending so much money on music catalogues. For one, for the first time in a long time, the industry is in a period of steady growth after a long period of decline. “Over the last seven or eight years, the record industry, which was previously seen as a very toxic and dangerous area of investment, has suddenly become fashionable again, essentially because of what’s happened in streaming,” says Eamonn. In the US, album consumption increased by 11% in 2021. In 2022, that number declined but was still steady, at 9.2%. And with TikTok propelling older tunes to the top of the charts, it’s no surprise that people are combing through back catalogues to find hits from previous decades. So, as catalogues sell for unusually high valuations, it is pretty clear why artists are willing to hand over some or all of the rights to their music. “The money being offered is so ridiculous that you really would have to have a good reason not to sell or nerves of steel”, Eamonn says. In the past, catalogues would trade at “multiples” of nine or 10 times what they earned in the last 12 months after royalties were paid out to the performers and songwriters. In recent years those multiples have been rocketing: the Wall Street Journal reported that catalogues have been bought for as much as 30 times their average annual royalties. Not only does it give musicians a huge payday, it also means that, for those who are in their twilight years, their families do not have to worry about navigating the minefield of the music industry. Their inheritance can be cash and stocks, instead of complicated music estates that leave them open to exploitation. As for the businesses like Hipgnosis, these deals are proving to be lucrative because music is steady. Generally speaking, people listen to music when times are good and when times are bad. These deals are a way to reframe music royalties as an asset class unto themselves, not unlike gold or oil. But the sheer size of the deals have prompted many to ask whether they are overvalued or hyper-inflated. *** But there are risks
In true disruptor fashion, Merck Mercuriadis, the co-founder of Hipgnosis (pictured above), has said that he wants to “destroy” the traditional model of music publishing. In its first two and a half years, his sharp-elbowed company spent $1.7bn on the rights to more than 57,000 songs. Its bullish attitude has attracted more people to the music catalogue market. By the end of 2021, that number had swelled to $2.5bn. But there have been many over-valued companies, and entire industries, that have realised that destabilising a sector is not necessarily a viable long-term business plan in and of itself. The risks have been apparent for a while: “You’re not just paying at the top of the market, you’re paying at the top of a massively overinflated market,” says Eamonn. The money that is sloshing about is immense: Stevie Nicks sold her catalogue for $100m. Bob Dylan shed his for a cool $300m-400m. Bruce Springsteen tops the lot at $550m. But as recession rears its ugly head, the market has started to cool down. It also remains to be seen whether companies like Hipgnosis can earn back the amount of money they are spending. After five years of investment and disruption, 2023 could be the year that their chickens come home to roost – are they going to sell, or will they stick it out and hold on to – and work on – these catalogues for 50 or 60 years? *** … and long-term impacts With all this fixation on buying up catalogues – both from relatively new players focusing on “song management”, and established music corporations –what will this mean for new artists? Because, no matter how good Dylan et al are, 60s and 70s rock anthems are not the only music that matters. “New artists are coming into an entirely new environment,” Eamonn says. “Publishers are going to have to react to what’s happening in the market and that might mean having to do deals where the [artists’] rights are given back to them after a shorter period of time or they pay them a much better royalty rate.” An unexpected consequence could be a more equitable industry for newer talent. Conversely, it also might mean that publishers who are spending huge sums of money on these catalogues will have less money to invest “in the short-term on the new stars of tomorrow,” Eamonn notes. While there might be merit in wanting to invest in artists in an industry that has historically exploited them, ultimately it seems likely the rate of growth and the size of these deals are not sustainable. The industry is not a stranger to massive booms and even bigger busts. Whether or not this is another case of a bubble waiting to burst will become clear in the next couple of years. Indeed, says Eamonn: “This is a very strange moment for catalogue acquisition.” What else we’ve been reading Is sympathising with a fat person better than laughing at them?

Day in the Life: Ana Pradas;2023-01-25T12:21:37Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Introducing the wonderful Ana Pradas, a senior visual designer on our editorial tools team. From making collages as a teenager in Madrid to being a part of some of the Guardians most creative projects, please enjoy learning about Ana’s fascinating journey through her career in design. How did you discover your path into design? I guess I have always been drawn to it. I remember collecting magazines to make collages when I was a teenager, and going to museums was something we did often as a family when I was growing up. I didn’t realise until much later that people could earn a living through design. I studied advertising in university. I initially wanted to be an art director, but I needed a job and applied for a role as an account executive at an ad agency. I got it. It taught me a lot about how to manage team dynamics, client relationships and the production side of things. But after four years I was still thinking about creative roles. I signed up to do a graphic design course after work during the summer months and decided to quit advertising afterwards. It was 2014 and the unemployment rate in Spain was still astronomical. Some people thought I was crazy for quitting a permanent job to pursue design but I had some savings and took the leap. I did an internship in Madrid and then a postgrad in editorial design in Barcelona. I learned about Tibor Kalman, Fantastic Man, The Face, Willy Fleckhaus, Nova, Port, Richard Willey ... and Mark Porter. He gave a lecture about his work, his early career at Colour magazine, as the creative director at the Guardian and then at his own studio. When he asked if anyone would be interested in applying for an internship at his studio in Bath, I didn’t think twice. I got the internship and moved to the UK.
How did you end up working for the Guardian? After 18 months with Mark working on print, I moved to London to work with another ex-Guardian designer, Mark Leeds, where I slowly started to work on more digital projects. Growing up, my parents always bought the newspaper on the weekends. It was part of the routine before lunch on Sundays. El País had a kids supplement called El pequeño País (the little El País) and another aimed at young readers called Tentaciones (Temptations) that were my gateway into newspapers. When I moved to the UK I was homesick and missed that routine so I started buying the Guardian on Saturdays. Review was my favourite supplement back then, I still have some of the old issues saved. I was really keen to work at the Guardian so when I saw a job post for a digital designer on Instagram, I applied. What led you to pursue a UX role at the Guardian? It was pure luck. I had been working only on editorial projects before I joined but my role as a digital designer at the Guardian meant working between the editorial department (doing illustrations for articles and investigations. I loved it!) and product & engineering (I was part of the team that redesigned the Editions app in 2019). I hadn’t given UX much thought before working on the Editions app. It was through the senior UX designer in the team that I learned how critical it is for a good product. We sat together and she would question everything she thought wasn’t right. She always advocated for the users, even if it meant being uncomfortable and challenging the stakeholders. During 2020 I joined the editorial tools team and started taking more of a hybrid role, where I had to do UX research, UX design and UI. I find research the most challenging area of product design. You need to completely let go of your ideas and assumptions and allow the users to tell you what they think without any guidance of what you want to hear. You want users to be honest and sometimes that means them tearing apart what you designed. When the digital design team was reorganised in 2021 I had to decide what route to pursue —editorial or product— and I ended up choosing the latter. What does a typical day look like for you? I wake up very early even if I don’t mean to, so I will make myself a coffee and go for a walk before the work day starts. I try to get some focus time before I have to join standup. I’m most efficient in the morning and, as the day progresses, I find it harder to concentrate. I spend most of my day between Figma and meetings. But if I’m feeling stuck I might go for a walk or grab a pencil and paper. Sometimes I just need to get away from screens to be creative. I also find pairing with other designers really helpful. Sometimes just sketching scribbles together can really help crack the challenge. Because I have to think about research, UX and design, and they require very different mindsets I have little rituals depending on what I need to work on to help me focus. If I need to spend some time working on research analysis or being creative, I might go for a quick walk, make a cup of tea and put a chill soundtrack on in the background. If I need to work on design specs or something more admin-like, I’ll probably go to a coffee shop or listen to the radio or a podcast. What project are you working on right now? I usually work on a mix of small and big projects for editorial tools at the same time. The two main projects that I’m working on at the moment are Pinboard, an extension to our editorial tools, and Wordiply. Pinboard helps collate the communication and assets of a story alongside it rather than spread between emails, chats and notes. Its goal is to help streamline the production process. It will be used by the editors, reporters, production editors, picture desk … everyone in the newsroom. Readers will never see it although it will impact how the stories they read get put together. We started this project at the beginning of the pandemic. I vividly remember shadowing people in all sorts of roles within the newsroom. We were all working from our kitchens and bedrooms. In a sense I think all of us being remote made it easier for the team to be able to talk with so many different people across desks and offices in editorial. It’s been a really interesting project to work on from ideation to delivery, with a lot of collaboration between us and the editorial department. Wordiply is an interesting one because it’s not something I normally get to do. It’s a puzzle game, the sibling of a feature about how to create the next Wordle. I was brought into it by the nonfiction books editor and a developer on the team because of a hack day project I had helped with. After a few iterations, we recently decided to launch it to see if people will like it. What advice would you give your younger self? It’s OK if things don’t work out. Have fun and try new things. Development of digital products is central to the Guardian. You could be building the products that showcase our progressive and independent journalism, crafting the tools that journalists use to write their stories, developing the services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe, or safeguarding our financial future.

Wednesday briefing: The ‘glacial’ response to calls for new rights for menopausal women at work;2023-01-25T06:56:01Z;['Archie Bland'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Last year, the House of Commons’ women and equalities committee made a set of significant recommendations on how to better protect the workplace rights of women experiencing menopause. Yesterday, three and a half months late, the government accepted a few of the proposals in principle or in part – although committee chair Caroline Nokes said that it had committed to “very little new work”. Zoe Williams describes the areas of agreement as “the floppy, pointless bits” to which nobody could possibly object. Meanwhile, the government rejected five recommendations, including more radical ideas about better protections against discrimination, arguing that agreeing to them could … discriminate against men. That response was “complacent” and progress has been “glacial”, Nokes said – adding that it left her “unconvinced that menopause is a government priority”. Today’s newsletter, with the Open University’s Prof Jo Brewis, is about what kind of issues face women experiencing menopause in the workplace – and what it would it look like to take them seriously. Five big stories Ukraine | Berlin is reportedly set to succumb to huge international pressure by announcing that it will send German-manufactured Leopard tanks to Ukraine and allow their re-export by other European allies. The US also appears poised to begin work towards sending its own M1 Abrams tanks, which could have significant implications for Kyiv’s efforts to repel Russian forces. Levelling up | Councils are being forced to freeze levelling up projects or find millions from their own squeezed budgets to complete works because of soaring costs which have exceeded government grants. At least £500m has been lost from different levelling up funds due to inflation and rising costs. US gun violence | Joe Biden has again called on Congress to pass a bill banning assault weapons, following a string of recent mass shootings in California that in total killed at least 18 people. Biden said that the “commonsense” bill should be passed immediately. BBC | Richard Sharp has insisted that there was no conflict of interest when he was appointed the chair of the BBC by Boris Johnson, following allegations that he helped the then prime minister secure a loan of up to £800,000 only a week earlier. Entertainment | Everything Everywhere All At Once, the action comedy starring Michelle Yeoh, is the frontrunner heading into this years Oscars, with 11 nominations. The news that Ireland has a record 14 nominations, including nine for the Banshees of Inisherin, prompted jokes that the ceremony should be relocated from Los Angeles to Dublin. In depth: ‘The only way round the problem is going through it’
In 1857, Dr Edward Tilt published the first full-length work on menopause in English, “The change of life in health and disease”. He described it as “a loss of feminine grace”, and prescribed remedies including opium, morphine, and vaginal injections of lead acetate, more recently an ingredient in hair dye: “Menopause can cause alcoholism or mania, and could even make women murderously violent,” he wrote. “I suggest a small glass of sherry before dinner, if the woman becomes hysterical then chloroform may be administered.” If the general view of menopause is a little less medieval now, it is still, by many accounts, a taboo subject. And in the workplace, the issue is arguably more urgent than ever. There are 4.5 million women aged 50-64 in employment. The number went up by 21% between 1992 and 2018, against just under 12% among men. And while in 1986 the average age at which women left the labour market was 60, in 2020 it was 64. “Some women certainly still worry about how they will be viewed if it is talked about,” said Professor Jo Brewis, who has been researching menopause in the workplace since 2016 and was a witness to the inquiry. “They think – please don’t give them another reason to discriminate against us. But menopause is a practically universal experience for people with ovaries. So the only way round that problem is going through it.” *** How does menopause affect women at work? While there has been significant progress in how employers think about the menopause in recent years, there is still plenty of evidence that menopausal and perimenopausal (when symptoms begin before periods stop) women are at a disadvantage. A 2019 survey by the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) found that three in five menopausal women, mostly aged 45-55, said they had been negatively affected at work. And research published in 2021 suggests that women in the UK with problematic symptoms at the age of 50 were 43% more likely to have left their jobs five years later. Although they vary widely, there are very real problems that can arise from menopause: difficulty sleeping, headaches, and hot flushes – but also cognitive challenges, anxiety, and depression. (This excellent recent piece by Gaby Hinsliff lays out some of the mental health effects.) Some of this can be exacerbated by workplaces where it is impossible to control ventilation or temperature, or with inadequate access to toilets – but there are subtler cultural and social factors, Brewis said. “Yes, it’s things like ventilation, but it’s also about support and compassion and women feeling reluctant to disclose their symptoms,” she said. “There can be a vicious circle effect, where not only do the symptoms make working life more difficult, but working life makes the symptoms more difficult, as well.” All of that is multiplied by fears about women losing ground at work if they admit to symptoms stereotypically viewed as making them less capable, worse leaders, and somehow “past it”. While MPs heard evidence that workplace discrimination is “widespread” and “shocking”, only 44 of nearly 79,000 employment tribunal decisions between 2017 and 2021 mentioned menopause. Brewis told the inquiry that research on menopause in the workplace is largely “about professional or managerial white, middle-class, able-bodied women”. And it also heard evidence that there are underreported challenges with menopause for women of colour, younger women – who in rare cases may also experience menopause – and LGBTQ people, with hardly any evidence available about the experience of trans men and non-binary people. “We really urgently need that research,” Brewis said. Even without it, one conclusion appears safe to draw: “In many cases, it’s the context that is the problem as much as the symptoms.” *** What did the committee want to do?
A lot of things. The committee, led by Conservative MP Caroline Nokes (above), asked in its report (pdf) for a range of changes, running from cheaper hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and improved GP training to piloting specific menopause leave policies and making it a right to request flexible working from day one of employment. Perhaps most radical, though, were proposals around discrimination. The committee called for an update to the Equality Act so that discrimination cases could be brought on the basis of two separate characteristics, a step that would make claims on the combined basis of age and sex possible, and significantly increase protections for older women (among others). It also said that menopause itself should be made a new “protected characteristic”. At the moment, women often make a discrimination claim on the basis of disability, which makes proving their case more difficult and strikes many as a false description of what menopause and the discrimination stemming from it are. *** What happened? In September, Brewis wrote that as the co-author of a previous Government Equalities Office report on menopause’s effects on women’s economic participation, she felt the government had “failed to take us seriously”. “Nevertheless,” she added, “this time I’m optimistic.” The government did accept (pdf) some of the report’s recommendations in whole or in part, agreeing to improve GP training, make changes on flexible working, and appoint a menopause ambassador to monitor businesses’ progress. Deborah Garlick, founder of training and support group Henpicked, said in a Woman’s Hour interview yesterday that she viewed some of those outcomes as “really good wins”. But it rejected five of the recommendations – among them those which appear to have the greatest potential to improve menopausal women’s rights. The idea of making menopause a protected characteristic was rejected in part because it could create discrimination “towards men suffering from long-term medical conditions”. Yesterday, Brewis said she was “so disappointed – that’s a very weak word for how I feel. I thought that the arguments the committee made were so convincing about the impact that I really didn’t see how it could be ignored.” There are some concerns that menopause is hard to precisely define in law. But, said Brewis, “there are other protected characteristics which can be unclear at the margins. There would be ways of establishing this as there are in other cases.” She said that the concern about men’s rights was “spurious”. *** So where does that leave menopausal women? Those who supported the committee’s findings are keen to note that significant progress has been made in recent years – a change which Garlick described as a “magnificent shift”. In 2016, she said, not a single employer in the UK that she was aware of in the UK had a policy on menopause; now, three in four have one in place, she said. Brewis said: “That’s a huge change, and testament to people taking the issue seriously now. But we still have a long way to go. And I don’t think the government has done very much to support any of it.” Frustrated though she and others are for the women who would benefit from new protections, they also make a broader argument. “If women going through menopause aren’t getting the support they need, that rebounds on their family and friends,” Brewis said. “They are less likely to be in work, more likely to be on benefits. There are ripple effects. It is not just a ‘women’s issue’.” What else we’ve been reading

The Daily Mail has “2.5 trillion reasons UK must go for growth” – that’s about the national debt. The Daily Express says to the chancellor “Be warned! Increase our pension age at your peril” – it’s reportedly being considered to “save billions of pounds”. The Metro says “Treasury rules out tax cuts after being surprised by UK’s record borrowing”. “Economy is failing to bound back fast enough” is the top story in the Times. “Deadly failings”, says the Daily Mirror, about the multiple errors by probation officers that let Jordan McSweeney kill Zara Aleena when he should have been back in prison.

Five Great Reads: Jacinda Ardern’s shock exit, a 25-year quest for justice and finding love without swiping;2023-01-20T21:00:05Z;['Imogen Dewey'];['N/A'];"Good morning. There’s still a residue of holiday, as one friend described it to me, but the year does feel more or less fully under way – especially if you’re on the road at peak hour. Today though, the birds are singing, the sun is shining (depending on where you are in Australia) and the weekend is here. Don’t forget that when you do switch back into news mode next week, that you can sign up for twice-daily briefings straight to your inbox: the Morning Mail, or the Afternoon Update. (Or both! Abundance mindset!) These are five stories that grabbed me this week. 1. ‘Be strong, and be kind’
The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, made the shock announcement this week that she is stepping down. Much has been said about her legacy of kindness “as a guiding political principle”. But, as Henry Cooke writes in this analysis, her decision leaves the country’s Labour party – currently without another standout figurehead – in a precarious position ahead of the October election. He pays tribute to Ardern’s strengths, but asks compelling questions about the longevity of her vision of social democracy – and our attachment to political cults of personality more generally. As Cooke writes: “If your plan to win an election hinges so strongly on an individual, you always run the risk of them leaving the field.” Why should I care about this? From Trump to Lula, all sides of politics seem unable to pull too far from the allure of a main character. Think of how Boris Johnson still has the power to derail most conversations about UK politics. How long will it take to read: a minute and a half. 2. ‘A very disturbing situation’ Terry Irving, an Aboriginal man from north Queensland, spent four-and-a-half years in prison for a bank robbery he did not commit – after a jury took 10 minutes to find him guilty. Queensland correspondent Ben Smee’s piece on this “case full of holes”, and the chance meeting that catalysed Irving’s 25-year quest for justice, is gripping. How long will it take to read: five and a half minutes. Further listening: our Full Story podcast on the malicious prosecution of Irving, and why it’s so hard to pursue justice for a wrongful conviction in Australia. 3. Monstrous maestro
It’s not even out here yet (you still need to wait until Thursday), but the discourse around Todd Field’s cancel culture film has broiled for months. Xan Brooks wades in, asking if Tár’s lack of box office traction has something to do with its unlikeable female protagonist – and its broader ambiguity. “It’s a discourse on the discourse, like a tennis ball bouncing back and forth, all but daring the viewer to pick a side,” he writes. “Crucially, bracingly, we’re not being told what to think.” How long will it take to read: a bit over three minutes. Further reading: someone who’s not unsure about the film is leading British conductor Alice Farnham, who writes rapturously for the Observer about the power of normalising women (problematic or not) on a notoriously male podium. 4. A saltwater salve Our day at the beach series runs the gamut from shark attacks to secret sex. One that will stay with me longest is Mostafa Rachwani’s meditation on the “crude border” drawn through Sydney (and across its beaches) by the Cronulla riots. In the wake of the violence, he and his friends felt despised by the city – and, as they grew up, ventured back east to reclaim a place on the sand. “Going to the beach became a political act for us,’” he writes. “I remember walking along Bronte beach, blinded to the gorgeous view by the social politics of just being there at all.” Then, one day in the waves, he felt something within him lighten. Notable quote: “Underwater, I felt my anger ease, the boiling rage doused by cool swells. I felt free from the politics of my existence for the first time, if only for a moment.” How long will it take to read: a bit less than two minutes. 5. Dating burnout Four couples talk about quitting the apps, and reveal how they found love without swiping. Horses for courses: plenty of people meet someone important (or at the very least, diverting) online. But internet dating can also feel, in writer Lizzie Cernik’s words, “soul-destroying, unnerving and transactional”. Those she spoke to found their IRL encounters: Were less inhibited by dating rules. Made it easier to gauge someone’s real self, and harder for people to hide bad behaviour. And (as far as I can see) just generally eased their fatigue and disillusionment with the whole business. The takeaway: apps can, obviously, be a fun and practical way to meet people. But as some of the interviewees here point out, they can also push users into a sort of shopping-list mode – and away from the unexpected connections that could surprise them in the best way. How long will it take to read: four or so minutes. Sign up Enjoying the Five Great Reads email? Then you’ll love our weekly culture and lifestyle newsletter, Saved for Later.

Monday briefing: Does the Davos conference really have the answers to the world’s problems?;2023-01-16T06:46:32Z;['Archie Bland'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Every year, politicians, corporate grandees, civil society figures and celebrities head to Davos for the annual summit of the World Economic Forum. As this year’s version – the first at full scale since the coronavirus pandemic - begins tonight, First Edition is going to make the wild assumption that you’re not one of them. (Apologies to Idris Elba.) Over the next four days, attendees will put their heads together in public and private forums with no less a purpose than “solving the biggest issues facing our world”. But in an era of global polycrisis, many argue that Davos is no longer fit for purpose – and instead acts as a reminder of how ill-equipped capitalist orthodoxy is to figure out a better future. One measure of its waning influence: neither Rishi Sunak nor Jeremy Hunt will be attending this year. But there will be more than 100 billionaires. Today’s newsletter – with the help of Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor and a sceptical veteran of around 30 previous summits – will tell you what you need to know about the world’s biggest talking shop. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Protest | Police are to be given the power to shut down protests before any disruption begins under a new public order crackdown in England and Wales. Civil liberties campaigners have expressed outrage at a plan to counter “guerilla” tactics used by environmental protesters such as “slow marching”. Nepal | At least 68 people were confirmed dead as hope faded for any survivors after a plane with 72 onboard crashed in Nepal, the Himalayan country’s deadliest aviation disaster in three decades. Euston shooting | A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a drive-by shooting outside a church on Saturday left a seven-year-old girl in a life-threatening condition. A 22-year-old man was arrested after a car was stopped in Barnet, shortly before 4pm on Sunday. NHS | Keir Starmer has said Labour is prepared to reform the NHS to prevent it dying, as he said the current system of GP visits “isn’t working”. The Labour leader said his party was going to tackle “bureaucratic nonsense” in the NHS and argued for an increase in self-referral in some cases. UK politics | A man in his 60s has been arrested on suspicion of a terror offence after traces of uranium were found at Heathrow airport at the end of December, Scotland Yard has said. Border Force officers found the radioactive material with a shipment of scrap metal, reportedly on a flight from Oman, on 29 December. In depth: ‘There is an argument we’ve reached peak Davos’
*** What is Davos? It’s a Swiss ski resort town of 11,000 people. It’s also the shorthand for the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF): an assembly of (this year) 2,700 A-listers who come together – often by way of private jet – with the opaque goal of holding “constructive, forward-looking dialogues and [helping] find solutions through public-private cooperation”. Another way to view it as the world’s grandest networking event. In 2012, French writers Emmanuel Carrère and Hélène Devynck described it (PDF) as “a place where there is an enormous concentration of very famous people, with very real power”, who navigate the event without the usual impenetrable entourage because of the almost total absence of a general public, of gaping onlookers, of ordinary men and women. Apart from the local people, who almost all work for the Forum either as chauffeurs, waiters or police officers, the only people with whom you come into contact are also participants, so anyone you meet will, reliably, be one of us. Larry Elliott – who has attended since the 90s – says that things are less free-flowing than they used to be. “When I first went, it really was completely unspun,” he said. “Now there are PRs all over the place. People have badges allowing them different levels of access.” (Larry gets into the conference centre, but not IGWEL meetings – or “Informal Gatherings of World Economic Leaders”.) *** What’s on the agenda this year?
In 2023, WEF says that it will focus on how “the current crises, as serious as they are, are manifestations of larger systemic deficiencies accrued over time”. With a nod to the impact of the war in Ukraine and the ongoing ripples from the coronavirus crisis, this year’s slogan is “cooperation in a fragmented world”. If that sounds like a less confident assertion of global capitalism’s successes than you are used to, you’re onto something. Last year, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz wrote for the Guardian that at the slimmed-down 2022 event, “a forum traditionally committed to championing globalisation was primarily concerned with globalisation’s failures”. “There is a particular Davos worldview: globalisation offers more solutions than problems, but it needs to be managed.” Larry said. “It is a more difficult environment for that now. Countries are more inward-looking, they’re shortening their supply chains, they’re making sure they’re not so vulnerable to global events. There is an argument that we’ve had peak globalisation, and we’ve had peak Davos, as well.” Only one leader of a G7 country – German chancellor Olaf Scholz – is attending this year, and Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are also missing. There will be no Russian oligarchs because of sanctions against Moscow. But Bloomberg calculates (£) there will be 40 per cent more billionaires than attended a decade ago. As Larry wrote yesterday: “As the risks to peace, prosperity and the future of the planet have increased so the willingness to cooperate – the spirit of Davos, as [WEF founder Klaus] Schwab likes to put it – has ebbed.” *** What’s the argument for Davos as a force for good? The best case for its value is that it provides a unique venue for world leaders and thinkers to work on big problems in an unfettered way. Those who still see global capitalism as the best engine of economic growth for all naturally agree – but the WEF can also point to outcomes that might seem to cut against that worldview, like the 2011 genesis of the New Development Bank, designed to provide funding for major infrastructure projects in emerging economies. Gavi, founded as the “Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation”, has led calls for poorer countries to be given access to coronavirus vaccines, and was launched at the forum in 2000. Some critics of the existing system view a presence at Davos as important. Participants last year included representatives of Amnesty, the International Trade Union Confederation, Oxfam and the WWF. There have been some real changes to the composition of the summit, Larry said. “There never used to be trade unionists or the likes of Greta Thunberg.” And while it’s hard to measure concrete outcomes, “it does tend to set the tone for other gatherings with more executive power. The leaders of the IMF and the WTO are there, so are central bankers, and to some extent what they hear shapes the direction of the year ahead.” *** Why is it criticised?
The likes of Oxfam and Amnesty will always be in the minority. Davos is frequently attacked for exactly the features that it claims as its virtues: its status as an elite forum which seeks to change the world through informal conversations. Most attendees are still rich white “Davos men”, and the idea that they are best placed to solve global problems rankles with many observers; instead, they argue, the Davos elite tinkers at the margins of a broken system and heads off demands for more radical change. “It has a massive blind spot,” Larry said. “There’s nothing quite as nauseating as seeing a bunch of billionaires banging on about doing something about global inequality but refusing to accept that they need to pay a bit more tax. There is a gap between the Davos analysis and the willingness among most participants to do anything about it.” Those extremely plausible arguments can sometimes curdle into a more conspiratorial view. In 2020, Klaus Schwab and the then Prince Charles proposed a “Great Reset” – a call for a new, more sustainable economic model coming out of the coronavirus crisis. While there are legitimate criticisms of that idea, it has also proved a breeding ground for muddled claims that Davos attendees perpetrated a “plandemic” to bring about a global socialist government run for the benefit of a mysterious cabal of billionaires. *** So what are the chances that it can produce something positive in 2023? “We have clearly moved towards a more fractured global polity in the last few years,” Larry said. Asked for measures of success by the end of the year, he said: “Some serious attempt to push forward with net zero, some attempt to introduce a global tax regime which taxes more equitably, a sense that the global economy is through the worst and co-operation rather than division is back.” He rates the chances of those successes at 10%-20%. He is also cautious about over-interpreting what Davos can do. “Despite what people might think, it has no executive power,” he said. “It really is just a talking shop, albeit an elite one. No doubt deals are being done behind the scenes, CEOs in hotels, but there’s no hollowed-out volcano where the future of the world is being decided. It’s very long on rhetoric, and short on action.” What else we’ve been reading

Premier league | Arsenal took advantage of Manchester City’s defeat to Manchester United, beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the north London derby to open up an eight-point gap at the top of the table. Meanwhile, Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 1-0 and Newcastle beat Fulham 1-0. Women’s super league | A late header from Chelsea’s Sam Kerr denied Arsenal all three points in the Women’s Super League, maintaining a three-point gap over their London rivals at the top of the table with a 1-1 draw. Kerr’s 89th-minute equaliser cancelled out a 57-minute penalty for Arsenal from Kim Little.

Professor Tim Entwisle had always been immersed in the plant world growing up, but started taking it more seriously at university and realised he wanted to dedicate his life to botany. His colleagues recall Entwisle’s fascination with unique and obscure groups of plants that people “didn’t take any notice of”. In the following decades, his career has grown, having had stints at Kew Gardens in London and Sydney’s Royal Botanic Garden. Since 2013, Entwisle has been at the helm of Melbourne’s Royal Botanic, using innovative techniques to attract more people to the gardens while still centring science-based conservation. He has expanded its programs and boosted visitor numbers significantly during his tenure, which was an important part of his mission when he joined the gardens: “People wanted to come back into their garden and perhaps we almost needed that to remind us how important they were,” Entwisle said.

Friday briefing: Why the Tories could blink first in the fight over public sector pay;2023-01-13T06:41:11Z;['Nimo Omer'];['N/A'];"Good morning. In a bid to restate the Conservative party’s reputation as the party of “fiscal responsibility” and “economic competence”, the government took a hardline position last year against pay rises for public sector workers despite high inflation rates and worsening working conditions. Instead of negotiating with unions, ministers have gone the other way, ushering in new anti-strike legislation to settle the resulting industrial disputes that have, at points, ground the country to a halt. This has only inflamed the situation, with union leaders stating that they will challenge the legislation in court and continue to exercise their right to strike. The back and forth seems endless, and with every passing moment, the chances that the public assign this period of turmoil and economic hardship to the Tories’ failures increases. So the question is, who will relent? I spoke to Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker about whether the government is finally backing down. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Energy | Average annual energy bills are expected to dip below £2,500 from July because of a drop in wholesale gas prices that has alleviated some of the pressure on households across the country. Police | Home Office figures have shown that 90 police officers and staff were found guilty of crimes, including for sexual offences, corruption and violence last year. The total number for convicted officers could be higher as these figures only include cases that came from a complaint, conduct matter or recordable conduct matter. Cybercrime | The ransomeware attack that has hit Royal Mail has severely disrupted its overseas deliveries. The postal service received a ransom note purportedly to be from LockBit, a hacker group that is thought to have links to Russia, who have threatened to publish the stolen data online. Lisa Marie Presley | Singer and only child of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, Lisa-Marie, has died at the age of 54. She was rushed to hospital from her home in Calabasas, California, after a reported cardiac arrest on Thursday. Oil | A new study has found that Exxon, one of the world’s largest oil companies, “predicted global warming correctly and skilfully” in the 1970s and then spent decades downplaying the risk in order to protect its core business. In depth: ‘The worst thing a government can have is a reputation for the country falling apart around them’
“The best way to stop strikes, say the unions, is to do it before the ballots go out. Do it early, because that’s before the battle lines get drawn,” Peter says. But in that moment, the government was tearing itself apart, jumping from leader to leader, scandal to scandal, too preoccupied in its own mess to see the storm that was brewing. Six months later, the country seems to be stuck in deadlock as public sector workers declare that they have had enough and walk out en masse. So where are negotiations at now? *** Rail disruptions Eight months of action, which have cost rail companies hundreds of millions of pounds in lost revenue and had huge impacts on the economy more broadly, could be coming to an end according to Network Rail. Earlier this week at a committee hearing, they said the chances of a settlement with the rail unions were “seven out of 10”, as they just need 2,000 more members to accept a deal worth 9% over two years, with guarantees on jobs and other benefits. However, RMT leader Mick Lynch said on Wednesday a deal is “a long way” off – and accused the government of sabotaging the negotiations before Christmas. Union bosses have said that they are willing to keep this fight going and they are in it for the “long haul”, should the government not meet their demands. They dismissed the offer as a 20% real-terms pay cut when inflation, many years without a pay rise and declining working conditions were all factored in. Still, there are glimmers of hope: yesterday it was reported that the RMT and TSSA agreed to work jointly with train operators towards “a revised pay off”. Luke Chester, the organising director at the TSSA union, said the discussions were “interesting” and “detailed” – a much more positive development from just two days prior. *** NHS strikes For months, the government has had little else but tough talk for health unions. Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has been accused of “belligerence” and “holding the country to ransom” because of his exceedingly rigid attitude to pay. In December, the government refused to negotiate with nurses on pay to prevent strikes, insisting that its hands are tied as they cannot go beyond what the NHS pay review body has recommended for the 2022/23 year. But as time wore on, this position has become increasingly impractical for the government, as more and more workers agree to join the picket lines and front pages continue to be dominated by shocking images overlaid with headlines like “500 deaths a week” and “emergency care meltdown”. So it was promising when Barclay finally offered to come to the table. That hope was, however, short lived and talks with health unions quickly broke down. The government floated the idea of a one-off payment, which was quickly dismissed by unions as it would not safeguard future pay. “It’s also not even clear if the Treasury would agree to this – Steve Barclay seems to be saying we could potentially do that. But the Treasury is saying they’ve not had any talks about it,” Peter says. The talks themselves seemed to do little else but cause further anger. Now, not only are strikes set to go ahead, 14 unions representing more than one million NHS staff said that they would not cooperate with the pay review body until the government settles this year’s dispute. It does however look like the government is starting to buckle under the pressure, despite their long-held intransigence. Senior sources have told the Guardian that Barclay has privately conceded he will have to increase his pay offer to NHS staff – but the Treasury has made clear that the money will have to come from within the existing health budget, meaning there could be further cuts to the already struggling health service, further aggravating the already poor working conditions. “There’s still a lot of hurdles to overcome. It’s really not clear where we are,” says Peter. *** Education problems
One major teaching union, NASUWT, had their strike ballots returned, with an overwhelming 88.5% of members supporting the move. However, the turnout was just 42%, below the legal threshold for a strike. A ballot by the NAHT, representing headteachers and school leaders in England and Wales, has yet to report back the results. The largest education union, the NEU, will close its ballots today and declare the results on Monday. The battle lines for this fight are still unclear. The prediction is that union members will vote for the strike – an initial ballot in October found that 86% of the NEU’s members would be willing to take strike action to demand a pay rise. If this happens, widespread state school closures are expected. However, with NASUWT failing to get out the vote, the unanimity hoped for by the unions will not be there. The joint general secretaries of the NEU, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, have said that there has been “no concrete progress” made in the talks with the government – but that does not necessarily mean all is lost. “While some of the health unions have said they’re not even going to engage in submitting evidence to the pay review bodies, the education unions have said they are going to do that, indicating that they’re perhaps a bit more engaged with the government,” Peter says – and are therefore more likely to be open in negotiations. *** No way out? Whichever way these strikes go, it’s clear they have become politically toxic for the government: “One of the worst things that government can have is a reputation for the country falling apart around them,” Peter says. “Ongoing strikes reinforce the sense that this is a country where nothing works, and ultimately people will almost certainly blame the government for that.” What else we’ve been reading The shroud of shame and secrecy that surrounds mental health and menopause is gradually being chipped away at, and Gaby Hinsliff talks to women who have suffered and the doctors trying to change the “put up and shut up” attitude the medical profession has employed for so long.

Thursday briefing: How disease, famine, and gang warfare brought Haiti to its knees;2023-01-12T06:53:51Z;['Archie Bland'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Earlier this week, the terms of Haiti’s last 10 remaining senators officially expired, leaving the country without a single elected government official. Disastrous though that state of affairs is, in one sense it is nothing more than a symbol: since the assassination of president Jovenel Moïse in 2021, the Caribbean country has been in a state of electoral and constitutional turmoil. It now faces a set of intersecting catastrophes that are arguably unmatched by any in its history: famine, cholera, devastating gang violence, fuel shortages, and economic collapse. And there appears to be no end in sight. Today’s newsletter, with historian Professor Matthew Smith, will help you understand how Haiti got here, the depths of the crises engulfing the country, and what might happen next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Misinformation | The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has lost the party whip, probably permanently, after he provoked widespread fury among colleagues and elsewhere by comparing the use of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust. Chief whip Simon Hart said Bridgen had “crossed a line, causing great offence”. Energy bills | Ministers are being urged to stop the forced installation of prepayment meters after revelations that 3.2 million people – the equivalent of one person every 10 seconds – were left with cold and dark homes last year as they ran out of credit. Partygate | Boris Johnson joked to No 10 staff that a party during a Covid lockdown was “the most unsocially distanced party in the UK right now”, it has been reported. The alleged remarks cast doubt on the former prime minister’s claims he did not know gatherings broke Covid laws in place at the time. Joe Biden | The US president is facing fresh scrutiny over his handling of government secrets after a second batch of classified materials was reportedly found at a location linked to him. Jeff Beck | The celebrated guitarist, who played with the Yardbirds and led the Jeff Beck Group, has died aged 78. Beck was often described as one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Read Alexis Petridis’ tribute. In depth: ‘This situation is unprecedented – it’s really difficult to see a way out’
The departure of Haiti’s last 10 senators could hardly be a clearer sign of the lack of political order in Port-au-Prince. But from the national assembly to the supreme court, the apparatus of democracy had already broken down. In the place of a functioning state has come something close to anarchy. “The situation is unprecedented in Haiti’s history,” said Prof Matthew Smith, a historian of Haiti who joined UCL in London as director of the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery after many years at the University of West Indies. “You could see the country’s history as a series of crises with brief periods of hope and peace – but there hasn’t been anything like this.” He said that the situation brought to mind a 19th-century Haitian saying: “Constitutions are made of paper. Bayonets are made of steel.” *** How did Haiti get here? The immediate crisis can be traced back to before the assassination of Jovenel Moïse at the hands of Colombian mercenaries with unknown paymasters: Haiti has not held functional elections since 2019, and the country has been in a fragile state since the 2010 earthquake that killed up to 300,000 people. But Moïse’s death in July 2021 – and a new earthquake the following month – sent the situation spiralling out of control. Moïse was replaced by acting president Ariel Henry, who is unelected, and widely viewed as illegitimate. In September, the G9 gang coalition, led by former police officer Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier, blockaded the country’s main port and fuel terminal after Henry caused fuel prices to double when he announced a cut to fuel subsidies – a development that brought the crisis to new heights. Haiti is now experiencing its worst-ever famine, with 4.7 million people facing acute hunger. At the same time, Smith noted, it is impossible to understand the current situation without acknowledging the dark history of international interventions, including US occupation from 1915-1934, that have blighted Haiti. “Those interventions have shaped Haiti,” Smith said. “There’s a chain-link connection.” Long before the litany of recent disasters, he said, “the Duvalier dictatorship [the rule of father and son Francois, or “Papa Doc”, and Jean-Claude, or “Baby Doc”, Duvalier from 1957-1986] destroyed the hopes of a functioning state that serves the nation. That was the product of the mixture of local clashes for power and a context crafted by foreign interventions, particularly the United States.” There is an even deeper history. For generations after independence in 1804, Haiti was saddled with the impact of “reparations” to France - the country that enslaved its people - in some years spending 40% of government revenue on its resulting debts. That burden severely hampered economic growth and the development of robust public services. *** What are the consequences of the power vacuum? In the absence of a functioning state, it is the gangs that have filled the void. They are now arguably more powerful than government forces, with Port-au-Prince the centre of a horrific turf war that has seen prolific kidnappings, many civilian deaths, and gang rape of elderly people and children, a UN report says. “The presence of the gangs is the principle reason for the severity of the crisis,” Smith said. Gangs have a longstanding role in Haitian political life, and have operated in tandem with political actors since the 1950s to intimidate rivals and deliver votes. Versions of those alliances are in some cases alleged to remain today, and there are suggestions of oligarchic figures with ties to the drugs trade pulling the strings – but “many of them are not affiliated to anybody,” Smith said. “The international drug trade is a very important part of it, but that was only the beginning. Now gangs have secured their power locally, it is very hard to see that any more powerful actor can control them. The situation has dissolved into the incomprehensible.” *** What impact are the gangs having?
There are almost 100 gangs in Port-au-Prince, many of them in loose alliances at war with rival groups. Gangs control major roads and draw income from customs, water and electricity distribution, and even bus services. Membership has become so desirable for some young men in the city that some gangs now have waiting lists for new recruits (PDF). The country’s army – disbanded in 1995 after years of military interference in politics – has been reestablished but stands at just 500 soldiers, while police also appear impotent. The ongoing violence has forced the closure of hospitals and has been blamed in part for the re-emergence of cholera, as well as fuel shortages that only worsen the crisis. Last month, the UN’s humanitarian chief Ulrika Richardson said that an estimated 155,000 people have fled their homes – almost one in six of the city’s population. *** Is there a way out of the crisis? Arguably the two most important steps for the restoration of order in Haiti are ending the gangs’ power, and holding meaningful new elections. For now, both seem a distant prospect. One suggestion is the deployment of international forces in Haiti, an idea that has Henry’s support. Joe Biden and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau discussed the prospect of a Canadian-led force at a summit on Tuesday, with the US reluctant to send troops itself. There is some support for such an idea: “I think most Haitian people would tell you they need intervention,” Pierre Espérance, the executive director of the Haitian National Human Rights Defense Network, told the New York Times in November. “They are tired with the government, they are tired with the police, they are tired with the gangs, and they cannot move around the country.” But critics say that such a step could simply escalate the violence. Trudeau appeared cautious about the proposal on Tuesday, although Canada did send armoured vehicles for the police to use. Smith admits that he is deeply torn about the arrival of foreign troops. “For it to work meaningfully, it would have to be working with a very limited, clear definition of security, or it becomes occupation,” he said. “[They] would need to work with civil society groups on the ground before any force arrived.” Meanwhile, as long as Henry’s power remains unchecked, opposition leaders appear uninterested in agreeing a timetable for new elections. With an intransigent leader and foreign intervention such a vexed question, it is hard to see Haiti beginning to emerge from crisis any time soon. “It’s heartbreaking,” said Smith. “It’s really difficult to see a way out right now – that doesn’t mean that one doesn’t exist, but it is hard to see.” What else we’ve been reading

Two paintings in the oldest hospital in Britain are set to be restored as part of a project to conserve and refresh art collections and historic buildings. The paintings by William Hogarth adorn a grand staircase in St Bartholomew’s hospital in London, and depict two biblical stories: The Pool of Bethesda (pictured above) and the Good Samaritan. The National Lottery Heritage fund have granted £4.9m because specialist cleaning and conservation are required to fix structural issues to the works, which date from the 1730s. Will Palin, chief executive of the Barts Heritage charity, described the staircase as a “genuine ‘hidden treasure’”, stressing that it is “just one element of our ambitious project, combining the much-needed restoration of the one of the most important historic hospital buildings in the UK with a pioneering heritage and health programme.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

Oceans at their hottest since records began | First Thing;2023-01-11T12:16:11Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['N/A'];"Good morning. The world’s oceans were the hottest ever recorded in 2022, demonstrating the profound and pervasive changes that human-caused emissions have made to the planet’s climate. More than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed in the oceans. The records, starting in 1958, show an inexorable rise in ocean temperature, with an acceleration in warming after 1990. Sea surface temperatures are a major influence on the world’s weather. Hotter oceans help supercharge extreme weather, leading to more intense hurricanes and typhoons and more moisture in the air, which brings more severe rains and flooding. Warmer water also expands, pushing up sea levels and endangering coastal cities. The temperature of the oceans is far less affected by natural climate variability than the temperature of the atmosphere, making the oceans an undeniable indicator of global heating. What has caused this rise? The international team of scientists that produced the ocean heat analysis concluded: “The Earth’s energy and water cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gases by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system.” Why is this so significant? John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota who was part of the study team, said: “If you want to measure global warming, you want to measure where the warming goes, and over 90% goes into the oceans. Measuring the oceans is the most accurate way of determining how out of balance our planet is.” Lawyers who enabled Trump in election plot face heightened risk of charges
Four lawyers who gave Donald Trump erroneous legal advice that aided his attempts to overturn the 2020 US presidential election now face heightened prospects of criminal charges after a House panel released an exhaustive report on the January 6 insurrection, and referred the lawyers for possible prosecution to the justice department, say former federal prosecutors. John Eastman, Jeff Clark, Rudy Giuliani and Kenneth Chesebro played overlapping roles, allegedly offering Trump bogus legal cover that included promoting a fake electors ploy to replace those Joe Biden won with ones for Trump, in an effort to block Congress from certifying Biden as president on January 6. The lawyers’ actions and schemes were cited in an 845-page report published last month by the House select committee investing the events of January 6 2020, and in the referrals to the Department of Justice, for giving various types of legal support to Trump that enabled parts of his attempted coup. The report accused Trump of criminally engaging in “a multi-part conspiracy”, and cited four criminal offenses: making false statements, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and aiding or comforting insurrection, all of which were referred to the DoJ for prosecution. What are the referrals for? The specific referrals to the DoJ differ somewhat for the four lawyers. All of them were referred for allegedly conspiring to defraud the United States. Except for Giuliani, the other three were referred for allegedly conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, a reference to Congress certifying Biden’s win on January 6. Golden Globes 2023: The Banshees of Inisherin and The Fabelmans win big
A year after going on mute – no red carpet, no stars, no television broadcast in 2022 – the Golden Globes returned to form at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles with the champagne overflowing, a ceremony over-running and overstretching; and gesturing toward improving its longstanding diversity issues while taking shots from the host Jerrod Carmichael. The night’s big winners were The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical family drama that also won best director, and Martin McDonagh’s The Banshees of Inisherin, while the network darling Abbott Elementary, HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon and The White Lotus took home the top TV awards. The 80th annual Golden Globes, an image rehabilitation show of sorts after a February 2021 investigation by the Los Angeles Times found the Hollywood Foreign Press Association had no Black members and numerous ethical lapses, produced a diverse slate of winners, including an absent Zendaya for the second season of Euphoria; Abbott Elementary’s Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams; and the night’s first winner, Ke Huy Quan, who celebrated an emotional return to acting after child stardom in the 80s with Everything Everywhere All At Once. Wakanda Forever’s Angela Bassett became the first person to win a major individual acting award for a Marvel movie. What were the standout moments? “I‘m here because I’m Black,” said incoming MC Jerrod Carmichael, who addressed the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s tarnished reputation head-on in his opening monologue in one of the most memorable moments of the night. Meanwhile, Jennifer Coolidge and Michelle Yeoh gave the best speeches of the evening. Here are the other key moments. Who won the awards? Here’s the full list of winners. In other news …
At least 17 people have been killed in California as a relentless string of storms batter the state, turning rivers into flood zones and forcing thousands of people to evacuate from towns with histories of deadly mudslides. Six people have been injured by a man wielding a knife during rush hour at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, French authorities said. Officers arrested the man at the busy station after they opened fire and wounded him, said a police source, who asked not to be named. The last 10 remaining senators in Haiti’s parliament have officially left office, leaving the country without a single democratically elected government official. Haiti – which is engulfed in gang violence and the worst malnutrition crisis in decades – is now spiralling towards anarchy.

Tom Kobylecy and Yedid Sánchez’s budding romance took place amid the intoxicating odor of woody oak and sawdust of a Chicago-area Home Depot. Her cleaning shift started at 6am, just as his shift restocking store shelves was ending. He would linger to strike up a conversation, but Mexican-born Sánchez spoke little English. The few Spanish words Kobylecy could muster came out in a nasally midwestern accent. Comical misunderstandings and fumbled translations with the aid of a pocket dictionary were a feature of those first weeks together. They soon got past this obstacle and married. But their life together was shrouded in a secret. Sánchez was not living legally in the country. … or this: ‘My first day was a sex scene’– the disturbing history of teen actors and nudity
Spoiler alert: Romeo and Juliet does not have a happy ending. But Franco Zeffirelli’s adaptation of the Shakespeare play did – at least until recently. The 1968 movie was a huge commercial success and became a secondary school fixture. But now it has emerged that the stars Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are suing the studio, Paramount, for $500m over Zeffirelli’s handling of a scene in which both actors, then 16 and 17, briefly appeared partially naked. From Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver to Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon, are films that used teen actors for sexual roles heading for a reckoning? Steve Rose looks at the scenes cinema and TV might want to forget. Last Thing: Grief, the Taliban and the royal ‘todger’ – Prince Harry bares all in Stephen Colbert interview
The studio audience in New York chanted “Harry! Harry!” Monarchists in Britain, however, are likely to regard the bawdy exchange as yet another blow to the dignity of the royal family. Prince Harry took his book tour to American late-night television on Sunday and found himself confronted with questions about a trip to the north pole in which his genitalia suffered frostnip. He appeared unfazed and amused by the interview with the comedian Stephen Colbert, who wondered aloud: “No one in my life when I was a child could ever explain to me that someday the Duke of Sussex was going to say the words ‘cock cushion’ to me and it would all make sense. This is absolutely surreal.” Sign up

‘A big draw for renters is peace of mind’: what does the build-to-rent model offer the UK’s property market?;2023-01-09T10:29:04Z;['Emma Sheppard'];['N/A'];"At the start of 2023, the first residents of Coppermaker Square – a new rental development in Stratford, east London – moved in. Those who live there get to enjoy an on-site gym, a spa with a 25-metre swimming pool and jacuzzi, a co-working space, rooftop garden, concierge services, pet-friendly policies, and more. They can attend events such as gin tastings in the communal lounge, book in a handyman, hire gadgets such as cordless vacuum cleaners, and access an app that makes living there more convenient. And all this by simply renting an apartment. Welcome to Build to Rent (BTR), a fresh, modern take on the rental market. Purpose-built residential buildings designed exclusively for rent rather than sale, these developments are professionally managed, let longer term, and come with a wide range of shared amenities. In many ways, the growing popularity of the BTR sector is not surprising. With the average property price in London hitting £534,000 and mortgage rates climbing, the property ladder is getting increasingly unaffordable for many. At the same time, the private rental sector comes with its own issues, with rising rents, restrictive covenants, the threat of eviction, and landlords who may not carry out repairs as promptly as they should. There’s also a shortage of suitable private rental properties, with more than 150,000 landlords having left the sector in the last financial year, and more than a third of a million landlords estimated to leave in the near future.
Coppermaker Square in Stratford offers ‘exceptional amenities’ compared to traditional rental routes Meanwhile, £30bn has been invested into BTR since the sector took off after the 2012 Montague Review recommended removing the barriers to long-term institutional investment into purpose-designed homes for rent. In 2023, there was a 13% year-on-year increase in the number of BTR homes completed across the UK, according to the British Property Federation, with a growing number of schemes in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh and London. By 2032 about 8% of rental homes built will be BTR. The concept first gained a firm following in the US, where it makes up 12% of the entire real estate market. Simon Bayliss, managing partner of London-based HTA Design and an architect with extensive experience in BTR, recalls travelling to the US in 2007 to learn more about the model. “Visiting places across cities such as Chicago, Boston, Washington DC and New York, you could see the appeal,” he says. “People might rent a flat, but they could do dinner parties for their 20 closest friends in the shared professional kitchen and dining space elsewhere in the building.” The tenures were long – some people stayed for 10 years or more, downsizing to smaller units as their children grew up and moved out. As an architect, it was a real shift in mindset, says Bayliss. “You’re designing for permanence and for clients who will be owning the building for a very long time.” “One of the big draws for renters is those included amenities. But it’s also about peace of mind,” says Theo Plowman, assistant policy director for real estate at the BPF, which recently conducted research into BTR occupancy. “You have maintenance on hand, and that professional management that only really exists in the BTR sector. You’ve got that security of tenure. For a BTR operator, the number one thing is stability. So they’re looking to keep tenants happy, they want them to keep renting as long as possible.” This is a central tenet of the strategy at developer Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW), says Keith Whitmore, its UK head of development, design and construction. A new entrant into the British BTR scene – albeit one with plenty of experience in the property sector, having created the two Westfield shopping centres well-beloved of Londoners – URW has created 3,000 new rental homes across London. The residents-first approach is clear to see at Coppermaker Square, its first development off the block.
“BTR schemes like ours offer a sense of security for occupiers, in addition to professional management with on-demand customer service,” says Whitmore. “However, what makes this development a cut above what might be available through traditional rental routes are the exceptional amenities, which reflect the shift towards making everyday health and wellbeing easy to fit into a busy lifestyle. Understanding our tenants’ requirements has been central to every decision we’ve taken.” To get a better understanding of potential renters’ priorities, URW conducted a series of focus groups, led by Vanessa Luen, head of consumer insights, strategic and development marketing. “The main thing that stood out was they wanted that personal sanctuary – more comfort and more space,” says Luen. “Particularly after [the pandemic], a lot of people are spending more time at home. A gym and pool were highly desirable, as were touches such as wifi and USB sockets, underfloor heating, and high-spec appliances.”
Coppermaker Square residents can book and manage a range of services through an exclusive residents’ app Truly a product of the smartphone age, renting at Coppermaker Square is a modern, digital-first experience, all powered by a residents’ app. “It’s like a one-stop shop – they can book meeting rooms, pay bills or for additional services like dog walking, give feedback, or report a maintenance fault,” Luen says. “And it gives us the analytics to understand their needs and adapt accordingly.” With BTR expected to continue to expand in the years ahead, this revitalised new form of renting is increasingly becoming the smart choice for urban dwellers seeking to have it all.

Five Great Reads: Hong Kong in exile, the year of breakups and the bright night sky;2023-01-06T21:00:09Z;['Imogen Dewey'];['N/A'];"Good morning. So, it’s the first Saturday of 2023. Did you make any resolutions last weekend? Did you break them? Or, like apparently everyone else, did you just … break up? Good for you either way. Incidentally, if one of your 2023 vows was to stay more up-to-date with the news, we’ll be kicking off the Morning Mail and Afternoon Update again from next week – now is as good a time as any to sign up. 1. 2022: the year everyone broke up
… Or at least, the year Moya Lothian-McClean did and a lot of people she knows and a lot of people I know – and perhaps a lot of people you know. Maybe you! (Sorry to hear it, if so.) And maybe Paul Mescal and Phoebe Bridgers (unconfirmed). “For my friends, the rate of big breakups became a running joke,” Lothian-McClean writes. “[But] talking with some of the newly single – and examining my own feelings – I sensed a dramatic change of perspective.” The big question: After decades of academically and culturally reevaluating our ideas around romance and the massive shake-up of pandemic living, Lothian-McClean asks, “Is it any wonder the message that romantic love is not a cure-all may actually be getting some practical application?” How long will it take to read: About two minutes 2. How to move on after a bad decision On a completely unrelated note: are you consumed by regret? Haunted by roads not taken? (Sorry to hear it, if so.) But according to Philip Ball, asking if you could have chosen differently “is not a yes or no question – in fact, it is simply devoid of meaning”. This reads as somewhat … overwhelming. But hear him out. Drawing on the philosopher Daniel Dennett, Ball says the real reason we mull over past actions is not to torment ourselves, but to prepare our brains for future situations. Sounds great! Out: self-flagellation. In: optimism. How long will it take to read: A bit more than two minutes, technically – though honestly, I needed to read this pretty slowly for it to sink in. Why not put your feet up? Give yourself 10! 3. The Salem Satanic Temple fighting the religious right
As Temple cofounder and frontman Lucien Greaves explains to Adam Gabbatt, Satanists don’t believe in Satan in a literal, demonic sense, but rather as a symbol of rebellion and opposition to authoritarianism. This group, recognised as a religion by the US government, uses tactics with “wry and anarchic undertones” to take on issues such as the right to abortion and free speech, and the constitutional separation (or not) of church and state. Why should I care? Recent years have seen a wave of discriminatory, pro-Christian legislation ushered in across the States. Like many, the Satanic Temple views last year’s overturning of Roe v Wade – which, as Gabbatt explains “opened the door for more than half of US states to effectively ban abortion or restrict access to it” – as religiously motivated. So there’s a kind of logic in using religion to fight back. How long will it take to read: A bit under five minutes 4. ‘This place of uneasy refuge’: notes from exile in Taiwan After the introduction of Hong Kong’s draconian national security law in 2020, many fled to Taiwan to start over. Rhoda Kwan’s piece on their “longing and guilt” is wrenching and beautiful. “There is a fervent belief among the new Hong Kong diaspora that the city’s soul can be kept alive beyond its borders,” she writes.
“But holding on to that hope means looking simultaneously to the past and the future while ignoring the life in front of you. It means disengaging with the present to fixate on a ‘one day’. It runs counter to the everyday demands of adjusting to a new place. Because life inexorably continues. It forges forward even as we wish it would go backward, to before.” The scene that stayed wth me: Kwan finds solidarity in her struggles with Mandarin, joking over Christmas dinner with a professor in exile. “He was making light of the heartbreak of starting again in a new place, his brilliance now dampened, his ideas rendered awkward by someone else’s language.” How long will it take to read: Six minutes 5. I wished on them … but they were only satellites A couple of years ago, looking up at the night in a very misty and remote part of the world, I was enchanted to see a string of lights dancing through the sky. “Sprites!” I thought. Fairies! Shockingly enough, it was not fairies, but a line of obnoxiously bright SpaceX satellites, drowning out the light from proximate stars. More than 3,000 of the 5,000 active satellites now orbiting Earth belong to Musk’s company, Tory Shepherd writes – and astronomers are getting more and more worried about how the growing skyglow will interfere with new discoveries. Honestly, who cares about Twitter. Who’s saying what? Noon, a Gamilaraay woman, tells Shepherd that satellites such as Musk’s Starlink fleet don’t just mess with migratory animals’ instincts; by blocking the constellations, they threaten cultural knowledge. “The Milky Way is so many things, it’s sky camp, it talks about Emu, Crocodile, an important creative being for us. It has all these layers. And we can barely access it.” How long will it take to read: A bit over two minutes Sign up Enjoying the Five Great Reads email?
