Morning mail: unboosted aged care residents dominate Covid toll, UK warning to Moscow, and unapproved rapid tests;2022-01-31T19:59:43Z;['Mélissa Godin'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Nearly half of Australia’s aged care facilities are battling Covid outbreaks. The UK warns Moscow that an invasion of Ukraine would be met with “massive consequences for Russia’s interests and economy”. And what’s new to streaming in Australia. Unboosted aged care residents are dominating Australia’s Covid death toll, with almost half of the country’s aged care homes battling outbreaks. It comes as the Morrison government defends missing its own booster rollout deadline. More than a quarter of aged care staff say their workplace is not giving them free rapid antigen tests, with nearly 20% reporting they’ve had to find and buy their own kits before working. Trade unions have lashed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Coalition over the findings of the new survey from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Foundation, saying it was “an indictment on this government” that aged care workers were forced to dip into their own pocket for the tests Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, has said Russian oligarchs and key supporters of Vladimir Putin will be targeted by UK sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. In a statement to MPs on Monday, Truss refused to name any individual Russians at risk of being sanctioned, but insisted the Russian president’s allies would have nowhere to hide their assets if an invasion went ahead. It comes after the United Nations security council met to discuss the Ukraine crisis, with Washington vowing to hold Moscow to account. Fears of an imminent incursion have grown in recent days, despite denials from Moscow and pleas from Ukraine’s president to avoid stirring “panic” over the massive Russian military build-up on the border. The high court should overturn a landmark decision finding Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens because it threatens to confer “political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, the Morrison government has argued. Government lawyers made the claim in an appeal, warning that the Love and Thoms decision barring the deportation of Aboriginal non-citizens threatened the principle that Aboriginal sovereignty did not survive the colonisation of Australia. In submissions lodged on Friday, the commonwealth also argued that Aboriginal people’s spiritual connection to the land does not create a “special relationship” to the commonwealth. Australia
The federal government has quietly agreed to allow the importation of unapproved rapid antigen tests for personal use amid shortages of approved kits. It comes as the Therapeutic Goods Administration reviews the effectiveness of the 23 tests approved for detecting Omicron. Experts have questioned whether a new $500 voucher scheme for NSW parents to access before- and after-school care will be enough to change behaviours altered by the pandemic. People are “sweltering in poorly insulated rentals, getting sick and sometimes even dying”, social services advocate says. No state in Australia mandates that a landlord must provide a sufficiently cool living environment. This is despite extreme heat killing more Australians than any other form of natural disaster.

The world would be better protected against new Covid variants and there would be substantially fewer deaths in low and middle-income countries if rich nations donated half of their vaccine doses, new research suggests. Belgian civil servants will no longer need to answer emails or phone calls out of hours after the country became the latest in Europe to offer workers the right to disconnect. Defying all odds, Portugal’s ruling centre-left Socialists won an outright parliamentary majority in Sunday’s snap general election, securing a strong new mandate for the prime minister, Antonio Costa. Donald Trump was accused of “saying the quiet part loud” on Sunday night, when he protested that Mike Pence, his former vice-president, could have overturned his election defeat by Joe Biden. A British woman accused of fabricating claims of being gang-raped in a holiday resort on Cyprus has had the conviction overturned by the Mediterranean island’s supreme court.

There were two Australian Opens in 2022. One played out at Melbourne airport, in a refugee detention hotel and on the front of activists’ T-shirts.

Monday briefing: Chain of interest rate rises tipped;2022-01-31T06:31:57Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: Hikes expected from Thursday onwards Hello, Warren Murray here bearing tidings of Monday. The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates this Thursday amid growing concern over high inflation and Britain’s cost of living crisis. Economists expect an increase from 0.25% to 0.5%. Official inflation reached 5.4% in December, the highest level since March 1992. The Bank has warned it could peak at close to 6% by April, three times the 2% target rate set by the government. Steffan Ball from Goldman Sachs said the Bank’s monetary policy committee might increase interest rates to as high as 1.25% by November this year. “We now expect the Bank of England to hike in back-to-back meetings through May.” An increase in borrowing costs is likely to complicate businesses’ recovery from Covid. Economic activity has increased in recent weeks as consumers gradually return to socialising and working in town and city centres, and plan B restrictions in England were dropped. There are concerns that young people who lost their jobs during the pandemic in the UK have returned to less secure work, often in gig economy roles. * * * Johnson barrels along – Westminster begins the week awaiting the Sue Gray report on No 10 parties, alongside which police inquiries continue. A beleaguered Boris Johnson will try to regain control of the agenda – today he is due to announce plans for a “Brexit freedoms” bill to make it easier to rip up EU regulations and protections. The prime minister is expected to visit Ukraine with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, early this week, and the levelling-up white paper is scheduled for publication on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said they also expected developments this week on help for families struggling with the cost of energy bills. Dominic Cummings told NYMag on Sunday that it was his “duty to get rid” of Johnson as prime minister, describing it as “sort of like fixing the drains”. * * * Doctor was fatal poisoner, court finds – An NHS doctor killed his partner’s father and almost caused the deaths of her and her mother by giving them coffee containing the heavy metal poison thallium, the family court has ruled. Mr Justice Williams made the finding in a case between the doctor and his now ex-partner over care arrangements for their child. The case is highly unusual legally because the medic has been found to have committed the killing in a civil court, on the balance of probabilities of the evidence, rather than in a criminal court, in which a jury has to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt. The judge ordered the parties’ identities be kept anonymous but said the poisoner was a Bulgarian-born doctor who moved to the UK in the late 2000s. The doctor is not currently working and has not been criminally charged. A statement issued by Delphine Philip Law, his solicitors, said he “vehemently denies” the poisonings and “he stated that the court took inadequate account of the fact that there was no direct evidence to corroborate [his former partner’s] allegations”. * * * Vaccine waiver for NHS staff? – Hospitals in England could continue to employ unvaccinated NHS healthcare workers beyond the April deadline if not doing so risks leaving them dangerously understaffed, the sector regulator, the CQC, has indicated. Sajid Javid is planning to drop the requirement that health and care staff must be vaccinated, the Telegraph has reported. Spotify has said it will direct listeners to accurate Covid-19 information as uproar over the misinformation shared on Joe Rogan’s podcast continued to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music. * * * ‘Rape trials will only get longer’ – The typical delay between a rape offence and the end of the resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021 for the first time, figures show. The data also shows 576 rape cases waiting more than a year to come to court by the end of September 2021, well over double the average of the previous five years. Labour says the situation is getting worse every year. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “Rape trials are only going to get longer unless government puts the resources in place to ensure we have enough prosecutors and defenders to tackle the backlogs.” A spokesperson said the government was “overhauling our entire response to rape”, including boosting funding for support services to £185m, recruiting more police, introducing new justice scorecards and increasing court capacity “so victims get the justice they deserve quicker”. * * * Southgate invests in Thank You Day – Gareth Southgate is hoping to help lead what could be the UK’s biggest ever appreciation party during the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. The England manager – alongside celebrities including Ross Kemp, Gary Lineker and Levi Roots – is aiming to encourage millions of people to take part in neighbourhood parties in June celebrating community spirit and the Queen on what they have dubbed National Thank You Day.
Ten million partygoers marked the Queen’s first 25 years on the throne in 1977 and similar numbers celebrated the marriage of Charles and Diana in 1981. Celebrity backers, also including Prue Leith, Alan Titchmarsh and Lorraine Kelly, will be raising the event’s profile in the run-up to Sunday 5 June, the final day of the Queen’s official jubilee celebrations.

Specsavers launch an exclusive collection with Liberty: consider your new year frames sorted;2022-01-30T22:00:32Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"As designer collaborations go, Specsavers is the ultimate quiet achiever. The optical chain has been making specially crafted collections by international design houses like HUGO, DKNY, and MARC JACOBS available to the masses for decades. Australian designers like Alex Perry and Collette Dinnigan have been Specsavers mainstays, too, beloved by fashion-forward Australians for years. And its newest designer collection is sure to excite: an eyewear collection by iconic British brand Liberty is now available exclusively at Specsavers. A stylish and storied history Even if you don’t know the name, you’ll almost certainly recognise Liberty’s vibrant designs. In fact, given its highly coveted and prolific collaborations, there’s a good chance you have one of them in your closet, on your feet, or – soon – on your face. A landmark on London’s Regent Street since 1875, Liberty’s six floors have teemed with carefully curated ornaments, homewares, clothing, and fabrics for almost 150 years. The visionary store was described by fashion aficionado Oscar Wilde as “the chosen resort of the artistic shopper”; the impact on the zeitgeist is such that the Art Nouveau period in Italy is known colloquially as “Liberty style”.
Liberty first opened its department store in London in 1875 and has been described as “the chosen resort of the artistic shopper” by Oscar Wilde. And the brand still draws lovers of design, fashion, and style from all over the globe today. Cutting-edge design, then, is in Liberty’s DNA: every one of its 45,000-strong print archive is lovingly hand painted and crafted by its in-house design studio, creating a kind of unique visual language that’s revisited and remastered as trends come and go. Over the years, the prints have adorned everything from fine silk scarves to eclectic throw cushions.
In fact, so extensive is its catalogue that Liberty has become something of a collaboration powerhouse itself, lending designs to labels like Supreme, Gucci, and Monolo Blahnik, along with street and activewear brands Puma and Vans over the years. Hermés famously chose to partner with Liberty on a collection of silk scarves in 2009, marking the French fashion house’s first ever collaboration. And now, it’s this history of remastered designs that have inspired the Liberty eyewear collection at Specsavers. An iconic partnership “We are thrilled to be partnering with Specsavers on this exclusive collection that perfectly captures the heritage of Liberty’s, remastered for the now,” says Madeleine Macey, Liberty’s Chief Marketing Officer. “The design focus has combined the rich cultural heritage and vast textile history of Liberty fabrics, creating a modern and relevant interpretation of the Liberty style.”
Liberty’s Bronze metal frames in an art nouveau style updated for the 21st century (LL SUN RX 01 55:15 140 SHY BRZ, $349). Macey adds that the beauty of partnering with Specsavers on the launch of the Liberty eyewear collection is that people all over the world will take home a little slice of Liberty for themselves, including here in Australia. “With Specsavers’ years of experience in bringing affordable style to eyewear and Liberty’s iconic textile and cultural heritage, it is a perfect partnership.” Heritage remastered The Liberty eyewear range features 13 optical and three sunglasses designs, along with four children’s styles, all of which boast remastered print patterns and design details from the brand’s iconic print archive. (More power to the team who narrowed 45,000 choices down to just 13 designs for the eyewear collection.)
Crystal-sage green, round-eye glasses with keyhole bridge by Liberty (LL 09 48:21 140 SHY GRN CRY, $349). Every pair of glasses features the brand’s signature gold floral Iphis at the temple tip and comes with an instantly recognisable Liberty-designed carry case. Macey counts designs LL 10 and LL 07 as her personal favourites, but the range’s variety of high-quality, modern frames means fashion-lovers can easily integrate Liberty’s timeless style into their everyday look.

Morning mail: children head back to school, Nadal breaks grand-slam record, Russia faces ‘mother of all sanctions’;2022-01-30T19:56:36Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Good morning. For many families and teachers in New South Wales and Victoria, this week is off to an anxious start as children return to school amid the ongoing Omicron outbreak, which over the weekend saw NSW recorded its deadliest day, with 52 deaths, and four confirmed cases of the Omicron subvariant “son of Omicron”. There were also plenty of celebrations over the weekend ahead of the luna new year. Rafael Nadal has made history and claimed his record-breaking 21st-grand-slam titles at the Australia Open after an epic five-and-a-half-hour battle against Daniil Medvedev. From two sets down, Nadal somehow recovered to defeat Medvedev 2-6, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. Nadal now takes sole ownership of the all-time record, breaking his tie of 20 with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. “Without a doubt it’s been one of the most emotional moments in my tennis career … One month and a half ago I said maybe there was a chance that’s going to be my last Australian Open ... but now that’s plenty of energy to keep going,” Nadal said post-match. Nadal’s win follows Australian Ash Barty’s historic defeat of Danielle Collins 6-3 7-6 (2) – the first Australian to win an Australian Open singles title since Chris O’Neil in 1978, and her third grand-slam win. Health officials in NSW warned vaccines “may be less effective” against the Omicron variant days before premier Dominic Perrottet announced Covid-19 restrictions would be scrapped. On 15 December, the NSW government pushed ahead with its decision to dropped the mask mandate, density limits, proof of vaccination and QR check-ins five days after NSW Health’s Covid-19 critical intelligence unit published a briefing note warning vaccines could be less effective and there was an increased risk of reinfection with the new variant. A US Senate panel is on the verge of approving “the mother of all sanctions” against Vladimir Putin, warning there would be no appeasement as the Russian president contemplates an invasion of Ukraine. Tensions on the Ukraine border continued to escalate with Reuters reporting the Russian military buildup included supplies of blood in anticipation of casualties. Australia’s finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said Australia “will not hesitate” to ratchet up sanctions against Russia but would not deploy its military if war broke out in the region. Australia

Australia has been urged to dedicate money and resources to Covax – the global vaccination mechanism – so that the world’s least-inoculated countries can access vaccines. Australia has distributed nearly 18m Covid vaccine doses to Pacific and south-east Asian nations, but critics say the “vaccine diplomacy” focus has come at expense of global efforts.

US and Germany step up pipeline warnings to Russia | First Thing;2022-01-28T11:19:04Z;['Clea Skopeliti'];['N/A'];"Good morning. The US and Germany have increased warnings to Russia that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will not open if Moscow invades Ukraine, as efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis continue. The multibillion-dollar pipeline, which would more than double the supply of Russian natural gas to Germany, has been completed but it requires testing and regulatory approval. “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward,” said Victoria Nuland, the US undersecretary of state for political affairs. “I think the statements coming out of Berlin even today are very, very strong.” What is Russia asking for? It denies planning to invade but last month demanded a number of security guarantees. The main one, which was rejected, was that Ukraine be indefinitely barred from joining Nato. What else has the US offered? Joe Biden told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US was considering offering economic support. It has provided $650m in military assistance in the past year. Could Nato troops be involved? Nato has put 8,500 troops on standby. There are more than 100,000 Russian soldiers at its border. Sarah Palin repeatedly dined out after positive Covid test
The former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been spotted dining out on multiple occasions in New York despite testing positive for Covid. The ex-Alaska governor, who is unvaccinated, was seen eating outdoors in the upper east side restaurant Elio’s on Wednesday after a positive test, according to photos published by Mediaite. Palin, who confirmed her positive test on Monday, was also seen dining outdoors on Tuesday night at Campagnola, according to Gothamist. CDC guidelines state that people with Covid-19 should isolate for a minimum of five days to avoid infecting others. What has the reaction been? City officials have said Palin needs to “follow the rules just like everyone else”, saying she has shown “a complete disregard” for the safety of others. Killings in LA highlight crisis of gun violence facing Black women
Three recent killings in Los Angeles have highlighted the way gun violence affects Black women and girls and the lack of coverage their stories receive. On 8 January, officials found the body of Tioni Theus, 16, on the 110 freeway. She had been shot. Two weeks later, on 23 January, sisters Breahna Stines, 20, and Marneysha Hamilton, 25, were among four people shot dead at Stines’ birthday party in Inglewood. Neither case received much attention beyond local media. Authorities this week announced a $110,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Theus’s case, an intervention that her family and Black Los Angeles residents had been calling for weeks. By how much have killings increased over the pandemic? Homicides rose by 30% between 2019 and 2020 in California and across the US, the biggest single-year increase in the 60 years the FBI has been tracking such data. In California, homicides of Black women nearly doubled in 2020. A total of 99 women were killed, compared with 55 in 2019, according to FBI data analyzed for the Guardian. In other news …

What with the pandemic and shipping crisis, many people have become resigned to occasional delays in getting their mail. Few expect to wait 51 years, though, as Genovefa Klonovska, a Lithuanian woman in her 60s, did. The letter, from a penpal in Poland she can no longer remember, was one of several to fall out of a ventilation shaft in an old post office over the summer. “It’s so good that the letter was inconsequential. The loss was not life-changing,” said Klonovska. “What if they delivered a lost letter from a suitor to his love, and their wedding never happened?” Sign up

Full transparency: the call for comparison sites to disclose their commission models;2022-01-28T00:19:23Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"If you’ve ever signed up to an energy or phone plan, or bought insurance, chances are you’ve logged on to a comparison website in an effort to ensure you’re not being taken for a ride when it comes to rates and premiums. It makes sense: no one wants to get to the end of the year and realise they’ve been paying way more than they need to for electricity, gas, or health, car or life insurance. It’s the very reason why, according to research from Roy Morgan, 3 million Australians visit commercial price comparison websites every month. But while these comparison sites claim to help Australians save money and time, many are actually making handsome commissions from the providers they recommend, driving up market rates and leaving the average Aussie no better off in the long run. A broken system Let’s back it up a bit: commercial comparator sites make a commission from the providers they recommend every time someone signs up for a new policy or plan. Because many policyholders review their energy and insurance plans on an annual basis in pursuit of the best available rate, a single comparison site could feasibly make a commission off the same customer every year. This is called “churn”. How much they make varies. Comparator sites aren’t legally required to disclose their commission models to the public, but here are a couple of examples that illustrate just how lucrative it can be: a 2017 review of comparison sites by Choice found one received up to 60% commission every time it sold a new life insurance product, while another pocketed up to 52% of premiums paid over the expected life of a policy. “[Comparison sites] add absolutely no value,” says Trond Smith, founder of the independent group-buying company Kyco. “The system’s broken and the people paying for it are those that don’t switch – those that are loyal [to a provider]. On the other hand, if you do switch, you’re contributing to the problem.” Seeking an alternative You could be forgiven for thinking the energy and insurance providers recommended by comparison sites are flush with cash as a result.
The reality, however, is much murkier: many providers can’t afford to stop participating in the comparison industry, even though they’re copping huge commissions just to get in front of consumers. It’s a vicious cycle. But there is a way out of this mess. “For the consumer to win, we have to be able to make it better for the supplier, too,” Smith says, adding that several providers reached out to them within weeks of Kyco’s launch in November. Rather than charge providers for the privilege of being recommended, Kyco operates on a group-buying model. It negotiates directly with providers based on the number of customers it is sending their way, to maximise discounts and savings across a range of categories, including energy, insurance, phone and internet, and banking. There are no commissions. Instead, Kyco takes a 3% handling fee. “The more people we can take to one supplier, the lower the cost of acquisition for that supplier and the bigger the discount we can pass onto the consumers,” Smith says. Simples! Comparison sites in the crosshairs Kyco isn’t the first to suggest the comparison site industry needs a shake-up. A 2014 investigation into comparator sites by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) expressed concerns about “conduct within the industry that may cause consumer and business harm”. Then, in 2018, an ACCC final report on an inquiry into retail electricity pricing recommended “the Australian Government should prescribe a mandatory code of conduct for third-party intermediaries”.
Comparison sites haven’t evaded legal scrutiny, either. Last year, iSelect was fined $8.5m for “making false and misleading representations”, and the ACCC has requested that comparison site Trivago be fined $90m after being found guilty of misleading consumers about its hotel room rates. Making real change Not content to let the legal system do the heavy lifting, Kyco is lobbying the federal government to regulate the commercial comparison industry. Its aim is to see the ACCC’s 2014 recommendations implemented in the near future. If Kyco is successful, comparison sites would be subject to a mandatory code of conduct and penalties for breaches. They’d also be required to disclose any and all commissions, payments and incentives received for recommending a given provider. In a letter sent last month, Smith implored Treasurer John Frydenberg to “promote the best interests of the community and ensure appropriate disclosure of key information”. While he waits for a reply – and, hopefully, meaningful action – Smith says he’ll keep pursuing a fairer deal for Australian consumers. “At the end of the day, these commissions are paid by you and me and everyone that uses electricity, everyone who’s got insurance. It’s a significant amount of money.” Find out more.";https://www.theguardian.com/kyco-full-transparency/2022/jan/28/full-transparency-the-call-for-comparison-sites-to-disclose-their-commission-models;Category-2: business and economy

Thursday briefing: Work or lose benefits, jobless to be told;2022-01-27T06:46:18Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Top story: Forcing people into jobs flawed – experts Hello, Warren Murray taking you on a quick scroll through the news. Unemployed workers will be forced to take up a job in any sector within four weeks or face losing part of their universal credit, ministers have announced. The Way to Work campaign was flagged up by an embattled Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions, with the opposition calling it out as an attempt to distract from his political woes. It is pitched as an initiative to get 500,000 people into work by June and fill 1.2m job vacancies nationally. Welfare experts said it would be counterproductive, forcing people into worse jobs and damaging careers. “The government is right that people need and deserve good jobs, but these will not be delivered by compelling people to seek any work, and against a context of continuing in-work poverty,” said Ruth Patrick from the University of York. The National Audit Office has found no evidence that benefit sanctions achieve their goal of pushing people into jobs. * * * Numbers build against PM – A new raft of senior Conservative MPs are poised to send letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson when the long-awaited “partygate” report is published. Among those prepared to move against Johnson are more than two dozen out of 70 former ministers, according to Tory rebels’ calculations. There has been no official explanation for why Sue Gray’s report has not yet been sent to Johnson. On Wednesday night the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, indicated on ITV’s Peston that it might not be out until next week. Police will ask aides of Johnson who end up being named in Gray’s report whether they are guilty over the lockdown parties and will accept a fine under regulations passed by the government they work for. * * * Biden to make his mark on court – Joe Biden has been gifted the opportunity to change the political narrative around his administration with a supreme court justice set to retire. The expected departure of Justice Stephen Breyer will allow the president to fulfil his promise to make the first ever appointment of a black woman to the bench. After a year in the White House, Biden has been limping with a stalled legislative agenda, tenacious pandemic and Vladimir Putin threatening Ukraine. Although the ideological balance of the court will not change, Biden could choose a young liberal who will serve for decades. * * * Nuclear option – Ministers have thrown a further £100m behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk. The government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project, and over the site. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final decision on Sizewell, it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. * * * Pipe crimped if Russia invades – The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany will not be switched on if Russia invades Ukraine, the US state department has said. The pipeline bypasses the traditional transit route through Ukraine. It has faced resistance within the EU for its potential to make Europe too directly reliant on Russian gas. In a letter to the Russian regime, the US has repeated its commitment to upholding the “open-door” policy to countries like Ukraine joining Nato, while offering a “principled and pragmatic evaluation” of the Kremlin’s concerns, said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Britain and other Nato allies are considering a request from the US to deploy hundreds more troops to support member countries in eastern Europe in advance of any Russian invasion or attack on Ukraine. * * * Uni diversity – Black and Asian students won places at prestigious UK universities at record levels in 2021, rising by 19% in a year, alongside increasing numbers of students from all backgrounds, and the chief executive of the Ucas admissions service has said there could be 1 million applications for places by 2026. The record numbers of applications and acceptances were driven by the rise in higher A-levels awarded in 2021 after the government’s decision to cancel exams and replace them with teacher-assessed grades. The boost in results and rising numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK population saw more applicants awarded places across the board, with 492,005 students accepted on to a course.

Business Asian shares have plunged today after the US Federal Reserve signalled it is on course to make fighting inflation a priority this year by raising interest rates.

The Duke of York has denied he was a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein and insisted on a jury trial in Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him, his lawyers said in court papers filed on Wednesday.
On that latter story the Mirror says “Andrew: I’ll face a sex trial jury” while the Sun has “Andrew: I’ll go to trial … no sweat”. It’s also on the front of the Mail, which says the duke has issued 41 denials over sex claims, but the paper’s lead is “Tory MPs tell Boris: spike tax hike and we’ll back you”. It’s the other way round in the Express, which has as its lead “Andrew shock: I want jury trial” while Boris Johnson gets a full-width picture and the supportive headline “Party rallies behind Boris” – presumably meaning the Conservative party, not another accidental booze-up or cake ambush. The Express has “Andrew: it’s trial by jury” while the Financial Times leads with “ECB warns Europe’s banks over risks in Russia-Ukraine sanctions”. The Telegraph says “National insurance rise will push up prices, PM warned”. And the front-page lead in the Times is “Shops and trains stick to masks as plan B ends”. Sign up

How to have the best of both worlds in the transition to an electric vehicle;2022-01-26T22:00:13Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"The future of driving is electric. Australian states are attempting to accelerate the move to electric vehicles (EVs), with New South Wales unveiling a strategy, including rebates, that it hopes will increase EV sales to 52% of new vehicles by 2030-31, and Victoria setting a sales target of 50% of new vehicles to be zero emissions by 2030. In New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the ACT, EV owners are already averaging more kilometres on the road than petrol vehicle owners, and over the next 10 years we’re going to see electric vehicle infrastructure ramp up as state and federal governments deliver a big push to make more of our new cars emissions-free. However, if switching to an entirely new way of driving feels a bit confronting, don’t worry – today you can choose a vehicle that allows you to drive in both electric and traditional petrol modes. You can start the transition to electric driving, but still have the safety of fuel in reserve should you need it. What are the advantages of an electric vehicle – and what do you need to look for? We break it down. They’re cheaper to run The most obvious financial benefit of choosing an electric vehicle is that you’ll save on petrol costs. Instead of forking out at the bowser you can simply recharge at home, or for a small fee (about $15), at one of Australia’s many public charging stations. As for exactly how much you can expect to save, AGL did the maths and found that over a year, the average fuel bill for a petrol-driven car was $2,069 (and potentially more for larger cars), while charging an EV would have cost just $723, or even less at off-peak rates. If you’ve got solar panels at home, you can recharge using renewable energy for free.
With the MG HS Plus EV, you can travel up to 63km on electricity – plenty of range to get you to the office, supermarket or football practice day-to-day, without spending on petrol or creating any emissions. EVs offer reduced servicing costs too. Less fuel usage means fewer oil changes, and, thanks to an electric motor’s ability to act as a brake when you step off the accelerator, fewer brake pad replacements. They’re convenient Just like a phone or laptop, electric vehicles simply plug into a wall to charge. Already, there are more than 3,000 public chargers installed across Australia, making it increasingly easy to drive for longer in electric mode. And over the next decade, you can expect that number to jump – the federal government has announced that it will spend $250m to support the installation of more public EV fast chargers across metropolitan and regional areas. Public stations can recharge you in just 15 minutes, and their locations can easily be found using apps such as PlugShare.
While the public charging network grows, a car that offers both electric and petrol modes will enable travel without compromise, no matter the distance. With the MG HS Plus EV you can switch over to petrol mode at any time, giving you the confidence to go wherever you want on long-distance drives. The fuel in reserve is there if you need it, but doesn’t need to be touched if you don’t. It’s a way to get the best of both worlds while Australia makes the transition to EVs. And charging an EV isn’t difficult. You can plug in at home using any power point – though fast chargers will get the job done quicker. Many EV owners also like to install a fast-charging box at home. Just make sure you get a vehicle that’s truly electric If you’re looking to buy, one thing to be aware of is the distinction between hybrid cars and truly electric vehicles. If a vehicle can’t be plugged in and powered, it’s not really an EV. Some cars that are positioned as hybrid vehicles have an electric engine that assists the petrol engine. However, you still fill them up at the bowser to get on the road, meaning that in environmental terms, it’s pretty much the same thing as a regular petrol car. If you can’t plug it in, it’s not really an electric vehicle.

A Day in the Life: Mohammad Haque;2022-01-25T13:36:44Z;['Rasha Ardati'];['N/A'];"Mohammad Haque, an Android engineer, first discovered computers when his father bought their first one in 1995, in Bangladesh. It was a marvel then and he still laughs when he remembers his mother hearing about ‘computer viruses’ for the first time (the room was apparently thoroughly cleaned two to three times a day). When he finally got to use the computer, Mohammad discovered he had a love for building things and writing commands. It started as a hobby but by the time he got to university he was ready to start a degree in Computer Science. He soon followed that up with a masters at the University of Greenwich. What drew you to software development on Android in the first place? I had an interest in small computing devices and that led me to do my masters in mobile computing. After I finished my masters in 2006 I started my career as web developer during which time smartphones started making an appearance. I found them incredibly interesting (just like another computer but on a much smaller scale) which also meant you could still write code for it. I leant more towards Android than iOS because it felt like it was a more open and adventurous landscape. So, in 2010 I got my first job as an Android Developer. How did you end up at the Guardian? I’d been working for a magazine publishing company for a few years and, in that time, I developed a great interest in content based apps. I built my own news aggregator app, specifically for a Bangladeshi audience, which is still popular. In doing this I realised that I had something of a passion for news and wanted to carve out a new path for myself. Coincidentally it was about that time that I was in touch with someone from the Guardian through LinkedIn who was hiring Android Software Engineers. I was already quite aware of the Guardian through my English lessons back home in Bangladesh- many of the courses would use news publications like the Guardian as learning materials all the time. I thought it was a very reputable news organisation so I decided to apply.
What does a typical day look like for you? Well, I became a father three months ago, which is very exciting. Because of that, I decided I needed to spend some more time at home. So now, with the support of my manager, I work compressed hours and get every second Friday off. My working day typically starts at 10am when I check my inbox and complete any urgent tasks. Then I have a morning standup with my team to check in on each other. Usually after that I work on tickets. In my team we follow an agile ‘sprint’ methodology where every two weeks we decide on the goals we need to achieve, work on related tasks and release updates to the app at the end of the sprint. It’s a great way of working because it allows you to make quick changes and deliver a result on a regular basis. We also try to explore different exciting technologies together on a regular basis. Of course I also attend the occasional meeting. One of my favourites is the Product and Engineering ‘All Hands’ which is a fortnightly departmental meeting and an opportunity to share news, celebrate success, learn a little bit more about other parts of the business and – most importantly – meet any new starters. We are also hiring at the moment so I also have quite a few interviews I attend as well. I enjoy being part of the process and getting to meet potential new team members. What do you enjoy the most about working here? My favourite part is feeling like you can affect real change as an individual and that you’re not just another cog in the machine. Our department runs hack days about twice a year and it’s always a great opportunity to be innovative, work on anything that you’re passionate about, and sometimes even see your work go into production. ‘Read it to me’ is one of those examples in the Android Guardian news app where you can choose a list of news articles which the app then will read to you as if it were an audio playlist. That came out of a hack day and it was brilliant to have been a part of that. I’d like to add as well that as an introvert, as well as a practicing Muslim, I can honestly say that the Guardian feels like home. If you’re on the quiet side you are always allowed the space and opportunity to speak. Though I may not speak up often, I do always feel heard. Being a religious man, and knowing how my religion has been often portrayed in the media, I have also never felt discriminated against here. We even have a prayer room in the office which I take full advantage of any time I’m in. There is a great respect and fellowship between colleagues here. You are accepted for who you are and you never feel left out in any way. Development of digital products is central to the Guardian.

Breaking it down: how green is that luxury electric SUV?;2022-01-25T04:23:23Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"In the wake of the Cop26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, many of us are thinking about what we can do to reduce our environmental impact. As individuals, one of the most powerful changes we can make is reducing our transport emissions. That means less travel in fuel-consuming vehicles – such as the car we drive to work every day. The National Transport Commission estimates we could halve the amount of Co2 emissions created by new small cars if consumers bought vehicles with best-in-class emission. The best choice of new car is an electric vehicle (EV), which gets you from A to B without the Co2 emissions. But not all electric vehicles are created equal, and if you’re considering buying an environmentally friendly car, there’s more to consider than simply how it’s powered. What features should you look for in an electric car? To ensure your SUV is as green as can be, here are three important points that need to be on your checklist. Look at how it’s made and what it’s made from It’s not just what a car is emitting that you should consider. For a vehicle to be truly green, the commitment to sustainability has to start long before it gets on the road. Look for a car created using as many recycled materials as possible, to reduce any Co2 emissions created at the start of the production chain. Not every element of a car can be recycled, but some parts, such as those in interiors, can be. Similarly, consider the sort of power used while assembling vehicles. BMW uses 100% green electricity at its plants so that no unnecessary emissions are created during the production phase. There are other ethical considerations, too: such as where raw materials used for battery production come from. Lithium and cobalt are essential for powering EV batteries, and 70% of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where human rights issues have long been documented in mining operations.
Consider whether the raw materials used for battery production like lithium have been ethically sourced. Blacklisting the Congo, though, is not an ethical solution. “[Cobalt mining] cannot simply be shut down … ” says the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank and publisher. “It is a lifeline for millions of Congolese who live in extreme poverty … Instead, companies committed to setting up responsible cobalt sourcing practices need to take responsibility for addressing the human rights violations that taint the DRC’s ASM [artisanal and small-scale mining] sector.” To ensure the elements that power your EV battery have been sourced sustainably, safely and humanely, look for a car company that is transparent about their origin and mining methods. BMW does not source cobalt from the Congo, but operates a cross-sector initiative that aims to improve mining conditions in the African nation so that it can transition to better practices. Consider where the battery goes Like those in laptops and smartphones, the batteries in electric vehicles eventually need to be replaced. This presents an environmental problem: what do you do with the old batteries? BMW has come up with an innovative way to improve the life cycle of a battery cell. Once its electric car batteries no longer meet the requirements for driving – but still have an energy content of 70 to 80% – they are sent to a factory in Hamburg. There, the batteries are given a second life as stationary energy storage devices. If there is too much electricity in a grid due to fluctuations in production or demand, the batteries store the surplus so it doesn’t go to waste. It’s a sustainable power solution that goes beyond just stopping the batteries from ending up in landfill.
When the electricity used to charge electric vehicles comes from renewable sources, running them has almost no impact on the environment. It takes about 10 years to exhaust the energy content in those battery cells during their second-life use. After that, the batteries are recycled – meaning almost no waste is created from their production. In close collaboration with German recycling specialist Duesenfeld, BMW Group has developed a process that can achieve a recycling rate of up to 96% for the high-voltage batteries used in its electrified vehicles. This includes the graphite and electrolytes contained within the batteries. Think about how it will be recharged Electricity production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. That’s why we install solar panels on our roofs, switch to green energy providers and try to cut our household electricity use. The same principles apply to electric cars. To cause the least strain on the planet, they should be able to be recharged sustainably. Renewable charging is possible in Australia, thanks to businesses such as Chargefox, Australia’s largest network of public electric vehicle chargers. All Chargefox’s ultra-rapid chargers are 100% powered by renewable energy. This makes a huge difference. When the electricity used to charge electric vehicles comes from renewable sources, running them has almost no impact on the environment.

Morning mail: inland rail goes off track, Australians told to leave Ukraine, Paul Kelly’s best gig;2022-01-24T20:05:37Z;['Tamara Howie'];['N/A'];"Good morning. It’s been two years today since the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Australia. Since then, there have been more than 2.2m infections and more than 3,000 deaths, with many of those taking place in the current Omicron outbreak. The surge has caused shortages of rapid tests, which are causing stress for vulnerable people and has come at a difficult time for the return to school. In the aged care sector, some facilities are telling essential visitors to find their own rapid tests or be denied entry. Meanwhile, our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, looks at whether Australia debt-fuelled pandemic finance party is finally over. A 1,700km rail route between Melbourne and Brisbane has been promised by the Coalition to deliver an economic boom for Australia’s regions and rural communities. But four years after the project (worth $14.5bn and counting) was announced, just 130km of track has been laid and we are still unsure of where it will exactly start and finish. A major Guardian investigation examines the mega project to find out whether communities along its route will benefit and whether their concerns are being bypassed. Australians in Ukraine are being urged to leave the country immediately as a Russian invasion appears increasingly likely. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday night raised its advice to “Do Not Travel” and urged Australians to leave now by commercial means as flight availability could change or be suspended at short notice. Nato is reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces, and the US is considering the deployment of thousands more troops to the region, as fears grow of a possible “lightning” attack by Russia to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the “deteriorating security situation” had driven the military alliance to bolster its “collective defence”. Dfat’s advice comes as family members of Australian diplomats prepare to depart Kyiv. It follows similar moves by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Aboriginal flag now “belongs to everyone” after the federal government bought the emblem’s copyright in a $20m deal. The deal includes payment to designer Harold Thomas and terminates commercial licences, which had limited the reproduction of the symbol. “In reaching this agreement to resolve the copyright issues, all Australians can freely display and use the flag to celebrate Indigenous culture,” said Ken Wyatt, the federal minister for Indigenous Australians. “Now that the commonwealth holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and no one can take it away.” Australia
Scott Morrison enters a federal election year with his approval languishing at levels not seen since March 2020, and the Coalition’s handling of the Omicron wave may have swayed some voters away, according to the the first Guardian Essential poll of the year. Anthony Albanese will open the election year with a new $440m pitch to help schools manage the challenges of the pandemic, promising new grant funding for better ventilation, building upgrades and mental health services.

The UK prime minister is facing new allegations of another party at No 10 during lockdown, this time for Boris Johnson’s birthday party. Carrie Johnson threw the surprise birthday party during the first lockdown, despite the rules forbidding social gatherings indoors, according to broadcaster ITV. Downing Street has admitted the prime minister attended the gathering in the cabinet room at No 10 with up to 30 people at 2pm on 19 June 2020, but denied reports he held a birthday party later in the Downing Street residence. Social gatherings indoors at the time were banned, with people permitted only to meet outside in groups of up to six people. The revelations about parties at No 10 during lockdown have sparked widespread anger and now threaten the PM’s leadership as a number of Tory MPs plot against him. The former pope Benedict XVI has admitted providing false information to a German inquiry into clerical sexual abuse. The former pontiff blames an editorial “oversight” for a previous statement that he was absent from a 1980 meeting over a suspected paedophile priest. One person was shot dead and three others were injured after a man opened fire in a lecture hall in the German university town of Heidelberg. The gunman, a student carrying several firearms, also died during the attack. Julian Assange will be able to go to the supreme court in the UK to challenge a decision allowing him to be extradited to the US to face espionage charges. But the supreme court will have to decide whether or not it should hear his challenge. Recommended reads
There’s almost always a profound reason someone chooses to take up a combat sport as an adult, Jenny Valentish learns at a women’s Muay Thai retreat in Victoria. “Many of the women here were drawn to Muay Thai for the feeling of confidence that a combat sport can provide, particularly sparring, which Rangkla and La introduce unusually early on, believing that if well supervised it doesn’t have to be daunting.” Paul Kelly barely remembers what he played on stage at his most memorable gig. What he does remember is the goosebumps and the crowd stunned into silence after Archie Roach sang Took the Children Away. “I was watching from the side – I had goosebumps and the hairs went up on the back of my neck as he sang it, to dead silence from the audience. He finished the song and there was still dead silence … I’d never seen it before – people were so stunned at the end of the song that it took them a while just to gather themselves to applaud.” The Red Cross’s Lifeblood program is chalking up a record number of no-shows, with half of the nation’s blood donation appointments going unattended. “We need 140,000 new blood donors in 2022 to meet the needs of patients across Australia, an increase of 45%,” Lifeblood’s executive director of donor services, Cath Stone, said. “Our existing donors can’t do it alone.” It takes only 10 minutes to donate the standard 470ml of blood that can save up to three lives.

Monday briefing: Ghani claims heap more pressure on Johnson;2022-01-24T06:28:43Z;['Martin Farrer'];['N/A'];"Top story: Westminster on edge for Gray report Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you the best stories of the day. Boris Johnson is facing calls to launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party after the former minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. The prime minister was dragged into the controversy as he awaits the findings of a make-or-break investigation into alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. No 10 conceded on Sunday that Ghani had raised her concerns personally with Johnson at a meeting in 2020, and said he had responded by encouraging her to make a formal complaint with the Conservative party. Ghani says that when she was sacked as a junior transport minister in a reshuffle in 2020, Tory whips told her that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. In a sign of the tensions with the party, chief whip Mark Spencer called the claims “completely false”. Ghani, the first female Muslim Tory MP, has described the comment as like being “punched in the stomach”, and has reignited fears about racism in the party. The case added to the febrile atmosphere at Westminster where the findings of Sue Gray’s investigation into alleged parties at Downing Street are expected this week. Doing the rounds of TV stations yesterday, Dominic Raab, deputy PM, refused to say whether the report would be published in full. * * * Ukraine order – The US government has ordered the families of all American personnel at the US embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion. The US also issued a statement last night noting the buildup of Russian troops on the border and that “security conditions are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice”. Anthony Blinken, US secretary of state, said Nato would be united and respond “swiftly” if Russia crossed the border. It came as Ukraine’s government said it was reacting “seriously” to UK allegations that Moscow has plans to invade the country and install a puppet government, adding that Kyiv is resisting Russian efforts to destabilise its government and economy. * * * Long Covid impact – NHS trusts in England lost nearly 2m days in staff absences due to long Covid in the first 18 months of the pandemic, according to an all-party group of MPs. The group’s chair, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, said the government had paid “almost no attention to long Covid and the severe impact it was having on vital public services”. In another study into the impact of Covid, nearly half of those who became ill in the first wave of infections may have long-term and even permanent changes to their sense of smell. * * * Peng ‘capitulation’ – The tennis legend Martina Navratilova has condemned as “pathetic” the Australian Open’s decision to stop fans wearing “Where is Peng Shuai?” T-shirts, accusing Tennis Australia of “capitulating” to China. Late last week spectators at Melbourne Park were asked to remove their T-shirts and security confiscated a banner emblazoned with the same words, on the grounds that TA prohibits “clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political”. * * * Exclusive – A committee of MPs has produced a report which says the gambling watchdog is “too harsh” on the industry and criticises the regulator’s attempts to reduce addiction. The MPs accuse the Gambling Commission of a “bullying attitude that has caused mental harm” within the industry and calls for it to be placed in special measures. The findings by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gaming have been described as “ludicrous” by a campaigner for regulatory reform and met with a frosty reception from the regulator. Several members of the committee have faced criticism for taking thousands of pounds worth of freebies from betting firms. * * * Truss accused – Paul Keating, the outspoken former Australian prime minister, has accused Liz Truss of making “demented” comments about Chinese military aggression and urged the foreign secretary to hurry “back to her collapsing, disreputable government”. Keating also said Britain “suffers delusions of grandeur and relevance deprivation” after Truss visited Australia for meetings with counterparts last week. * * *

Lunchtime read: Jason Bateman on family, partying and Ozark
As the drama series Ozark returns to streaming screens for its fourth and final season, Jason Bateman – AKA Marty Byrde – discusses the ups and downs of his acting career and how fondness for having fun meant he “stayed at the party too long”. Sport Antonio Conte bemoaned the “incredible” decision to disallow Harry Kane’s first-half strike as his unbeaten league start as Tottenham manager came to an end against Chelsea, before admitting his former club are on “another level” to his present squad. A livid Patrick Vieira was unsparing in his criticism of the referee, Kevin Friend, and VAR after his Crystal Palace side were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool. An injury-time strike from Tobin Heath salvaged a point against Manchester City at the Academy Stadium but there was controversy about the opening goal that led the Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall to call for greater support for WSL referees. England won the second T20 international at Kensington Oval after Jason Roy provided the platform to survive a late surge from the West Indies, who finished with the highest-ever ninth-wicket stand. Tennis Australia maintains Peng Shuai’s safety is its “primary concern” despite asking fans at Melbourne Park to remove T-shirts and a banner bearing the words “Where is Peng Shuai?” The Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the championship games after two thrilling NFL clashes on Sunday. On a weekend where complaining golfers were hardly difficult to come by, Thomas Pieters delivered a timely redemption tale with a one-stroke victory at the Abu Dhabi Championship. And Youssef Msakni scored with a long-range shot to hand Covid-hit Tunisia an improbable 1-0 win over 10-man Nigeria in Garoua to advance to the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals. Business Large cities have lost almost a year’s worth of sales during the pandemic thanks to lockdowns, resulting in a “levelling down” of historically more prosperous high street destinations, a study by Centre for Cities says. London lost 47 weeks’ worth of sales between March 2020 and November 2021, while Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff also lost nearly a year’s worth of sales as people stayed away from big cities. The FTSE100 looks like dipping around 0.2% at the opening bell, while the pound is on $1.355 and €1.196. The papers

The Mail reports that “Entire cabinet would back a tax hike delay”. The Mirror focuses on what it calls the “Scandal of cold Britain” with a headline “Freezing” while the Daily Record in Scotland has “Power struggle”. The Times looks further afield with “Fears mount Russia will weaponise gas supplies”, and the FT says “Unilever faces pressure on new front as US activist builds stake”.

Friday briefing: Tory rebels may seek to crack the whips;2022-01-21T06:26:16Z;['Graham Russell'];['N/A'];"Top story: PM says he has seen no evidence of threats Happy Friday morning to you all, Graham Russell here to bring you a selection of today’s news and other treats. The row over allegations that Tory whips threatened rebel MPs to secure their support looks set to continue apace after Labour called for an investigation and a report that some rebels were considering releasing texts or recordings of their conversations. The Guardian has been told of at least five MPs who have expressed concerns about the government threatening funding for their constituency or encouraging damaging stories to be published in newspapers. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the alleged threats to force support for Boris Johnson were “disgusting” and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Johnson was “now in full scorched earth mode”. Johnson has said he had “seen no evidence” of threats, and a No 10 spokesperson said: “If there is any evidence to support these claims, we would look at it very carefully.” Allies of Johnson believe a no-confidence vote after the forthcoming release of Sue Gray’s report on the “partygate” scandal is now almost inevitable, though some are increasingly confident he will survive it. One cabinet minister said: “When you start to put it to people that the prime minister who got us this huge majority might have to go over cheese and wine – well it starts to look ridiculous.” Liz Truss, a potential leadership contender who is in Sydney to promote defence ties, said overnight that Johnson had her “100% support”, though she sidestepped a question about whether she would stand in any leadership contest. Amid the continuing speculation, our political correspondent Peter Walker has put together a handy guide to the competing, but sometimes cooperating, factions inside the Tory party. And sketch writer John Crace homes in on the baby-faced assassin who has Johnson in his sights. * * * Private concern – More than 300 NHS consultants have shares in profit-making joint ventures with private healthcare firms, sparking concern that the financial incentives they create could lead to potential conflicts of interest. The thinktank that gathered the data, the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, found no evidence of wrongdoing but urged regulators to investigate the often opaque arrangements, saying the pandemic has “turbo charged” the share of NHS budgets spent in private clinics. The arrangements have generated more than £1bn in revenues since 2015, it has emerged. * * * Ukraine warning – Liz Truss has invoked the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya to warn Russia that any invasion of Ukraine would only lead to “a terrible quagmire and loss of life”. The foreign secretary urged Vladimir Putin to “desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake”. Her comments come after the US accused Russian intelligence of recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to take over the government and cooperate with a Russian occupying force. * * * ‘Shameful shambles’ – The state pension payment system “is not fit for purpose”, a committee of MPs has said in a scathing report, after it emerged that it had underpaid an estimated 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, a total of more than £1bn. The public accounts committee lambasted the Department for Work and Pensions for its “complacency” and accused it of not having been “sufficiently transparent” to parliament about the problems. In February 2021 the Guardian featured the case of Angela Jenner, now 79, who was getting only 86p a week as her state pension but, after making a claim, saw this increased to £80.45 a week, and also learned she was owed £42,700. * * * ‘I’m gutted’ – Adele has postponed her three-month residency in Las Vegas, which was due to start today, saying the production has been “absolutely destroyed” by Covid-related delays. Clearly upset, she apologised profusely in an Instagram video to fans who had already made the trip to see her. The residency, titled Weekends with Adele, was intended to celebrate her highly lauded album 30, which topped music charts in the UK, Australia and the US. “I’m gutted and I’m sorry it’s so last minute,” Adele said. “We’ve been awake for over 30 hours now and we’ve run out of time.”
* * * Denied a platform – Transport secretary Grant Shapps has called for unnecessary train announcements to be cut as part of a “bonfire of the banalities”. Announcements that could be culled as part of a review include instructions to have your ticket ready when leaving the station, as well as calls to keep the volume down in quiet carriages. Limits for the frequency of announcements will also be set.

But this time, the stakes are higher.
Lunchtime read: India’s ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theory turns lethal Sameer Parishwadi turned over the body of his cousin Arbaaz Aftab Mullah and saw that his hands were tightly bound. “I knew then that this was 100% a murder,” he said. “He had been tortured and then cruelly killed.” Mullah, a Muslim man from the southern Indian state of Karnataka, was allegedly killed for falling in love with a Hindu girl. Interfaith marriages have always carried a social stigma but, in recent years, since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power, such unions have become a dangerous flashpoint due to a discredited but pervasive conspiracy known as “love jihad”.
Sport Liverpool surged into the final of the Carabao Cup and will face Chelsea at Wembley next month after a brace from Diogo Jota put paid to Arsenal. Jürgen Klopp hailed Jota as “world-class” as the club seeks to win the trophy for a record ninth time. The final isn’t for over a month, so here are 10 things to look out for this weekend. Former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka has become the first player through to the last 16 of the Australian Open after despatching 15th seed Elina Svitolina 6-0, 6-2 on Friday, keeping alive her hopes of winning a third title at Melbourne Park. Current No 1 Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka play their third-round matches later, while Rafael Nadal headlines the evening session in the men’s draw. Thursday was a day of disappointment for the UK, with losses for Emma Raducanu and Andy Murray – here’s what they had to say. Tahlia McGrath, the 26-year-old all-rounder who has displaced Ellyse Perry in the Australian lineup, has guided her side to a nine-wicket victory in the opening encounter of the Women’s Ashes. On Thursday she cemented her status as one of the world’s premier all-rounders, with an unbeaten 91 off 49 balls and a return of three for 26 with the ball. “Something just clicked tonight,” she said. In rugby, Henry Slade appears likely to take part in England’s entire Six Nations campaign after he was declared available for Exeter’s trip to Montpellier this weekend. Slade was among England’s best performers in the autumn. There were fears the away matches against Italy and France could prove tricky for Slade, who has previously expressed hesitancy over coronavirus vaccines, but Exeter chief Rob Baxter has hinted the 28-year-old centre is now fully jabbed. Business Britain’s wind and solar farms might pay back almost £800m to consumers by the end of the winter after gas and electricity market prices rocketed above their set subsidy levels. The move could help reduce household power bills by £27 a year, but that could have been a lot more if the renewable energy rollout had taken place sooner, the industry has said. The government is to invest £100m to help Britishvolt build Britain’s first large-scale “gigafactory” in north-east England. The company is hoping to build the plant rapidly with the aim of supplying a large part of the UK car industry’s needs. In China, Evergrande’s finance woes continue, with news that bondholders have hired a law firm and threatened action after receiving “little more than vague assurances of intent” from the property developer. The pound is buying $1.359 and €1.200 at time of writing. The papers The alleged intimidation of some Tory MPs is covered by several of today’s papers. The Guardian says “Tories ‘using dirty tactics to get MPs to back Johnson”, focusing on Christian Wakeford saying he was told he would not get a school for Radcliffe if he “did not vote in one particular way”. The main picture shows a bevy of commuters as the return to the office looms large.
The i says “Tory civil war over future of Johnson” and carries its own polling showing 71% of the public believe the prime minister will not make it to the next election. The Mirror focuses on Wakeford’s claim, alongside the headline “lowest of the low”, while the Metro says “Blackmailed to back Boris”. The Times looks ahead with a report that some Tory rebels are considering publishing exchanges they have had with the whips to back claims of threats. “Tory rebels retaliate in row over ‘blackmail’” is the headline. Also, a very large picture shows the Duchess of Cambridge clearly enjoying holding a cockapoo. Others look to Covid-related stories. The Telegraph says “Schools defy PM over masks in class” alongside an image of a dejected Emma Raducanu after her Australian Open exit. Columnist Fraser Nelson’s view, that “Boris deserves one last chance”, features across the top. The Mail focuses on union anger at Johnson’s efforts to get civil servants back at their desks as an example of the return-to-the-office ethos. The Express reports millions could be in line for help with their fuel bills under a “radical idea” being considered by Rishi Sunak. The FT looks further afield, with the headline: “Biden hardens warning to Russia after Kyiv says no attack is minor”. Sign up

Plug in and play: the ultimate family-friendly sustainable road trip;2022-01-20T22:00:12Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"We all love a family road trip – it’s a chance to unwind, explore and spend some quality time with your crew – but travelling big distances by car often means generating high emissions and waste along the way. Here’s how to make your next family escape as sustainable as possible. Firstly you will need to consider your wheels. It makes a whole lot of sense to hit the road in eco-friendly electric mode, and this is now easier than many people realise. The MG HS Plus EV allows you to drive in electric mode for up to 63km between charges, generating zero emissions along the way. If you need to go further, you can switch to petrol mode at any time – giving you the best of both worlds. Next you’ll want to think about all the other ways you can dial up your eco-cred, from where you stay, to what you eat and how you play. For inspiration on just how easy it is to travel in sustainable style, we’ve compiled two fun family weekend itineraries. Itinerary 1: Sydney to the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury
From the stunning scenery of the Blue Mountains to the charming waterways of the Hawkesbury, Sydney is fringed by incredible natural beauty. And what’s great about exploring this region in a dual-motor car such as the MG is that it’s possible to do this trip almost entirely in electric mode, saving you dollars and sparing the planet the Co2 emissions. To get going, set the coordinates for Katoomba. Depending on where in Sydney you set off from, you may want to stop to plug in and pick up snacks at Westfield Parramatta before heading up to the mountains. You could also stop in at a farmers’ market, such as Springwood Growers Market (fourth Sunday of the month), to pick up some local produce, or just pack your picnic before leaving home, remembering to BYO water bottles and picnic utensils so you can avoid single-use plastics.
Hire a kayak to explore the Hawkesbury region’s beautiful waterways. Image: Destination NSW. Next, pay a visit to the glorious Three Sisters, a trio of sandstone peaks formed more than 200m years ago. Roll out the picnic rug at the nearby Katoomba Falls Reserve for lunch outdoors and then head to Scenic World, where you can enjoy breathtaking views over the Jamison Valley from the exhilarating vantage point of a railway, cableway or skyway – just choose which option appeals most to you (or the kids). There’s also a recharging station here, so you can plug in before heading out again (full details are available on the PlugShare app). Next, head off for a blissful night at Spicers Sangoma Retreat, a beautiful bush stay nestled in the mountains. This tranquil getaway prioritises sustainability and has its own charging station, so you can plug in overnight. The next day, head to the sleepy town of Wisemans Ferry, where you can pick your own nectarines at Canoelands Orchard or hire a kayak to explore the Hawkesbury region’s beautiful waterways. There’s a charging station at the Wisemans Inn Hotel, where you could enjoy a cosy pub meal before getting back in the car. Of course, if you’re not in a rush, the Hawkesbury is an ideal spot to idle away a few days on a houseboat. However long you stay, from here it’s an easy zip back into Sydney. EV mode With EV mode engaged, it’s possible to cover most of this journey with battery power alone, which means lower emissions, lower fuel costs and more money for the fun things.
The MG HS Plus EV allows you to drive in electric mode for up to 63km between charges. Go greener tips Download the PlugShare app, which shows you on a map where Australia’s public charging stations are – there are more than 2,300 of them. You can also use Google Maps to get real-time data about whether a charging station is currently being used by another vehicle. By always looking for eco-friendly accommodation, you’ll get to stay in places that have sustainable practices in place. As a bonus, eco-friendly accommodation might enable you to charge off the grid, further lowering your eco impact. *** Itinerary 2: Melbourne to Castlemaine and Daylesford
Escape to the Lake House in Daylesford. Image: Visit Victoria. You could spend a weekend or a week being charmed by the delights of Castlemaine and Daylesford. And thanks to the region’s many charging stations, much of this route can be done on electric, making your trip easier on the planet and your wallet. Make your first stop in Woodend, a charming rural village less than an hour from central Melbourne. Here, you can picnic at the famous Hanging Rock, the landmark immortalised in Peter Weir’s classic film. You could pack your own lunch or grab a salad or sandwich to go at the Hanging Rock Cafe; just remember to pack your own water bottles and picnic kit so you don’t need to use any disposable cutlery. You can plug in at the charging station at 124 High Street, which is just a hop away from the country bakery of Bourkies Bakehouse, where you could – and absolutely should – linger over an award-winning vanilla slice before you hit the road. Once you’re charged up, head on to the hip streets of Castlemaine, a small town that’s recently been reborn as one of Victoria’s coolest spots. There’s plenty to do here but to get acquainted with the town’s uniquely arty energy, hit The Mill, a hub for food and artisan small businesses. The kids can entertain themselves on the ping-pong and foosball tables while you browse the racks at the giant Vintage Bazaar, for one-of-a-kind, eco-friendly fashion finds.
Enjoy a traditional Viennese coffee at Das Kaffeehaus located inside The Mill. Image: Visit Victoria. Grab a room for the night at Campbell Street Lodge, a hotel set in historic buildings classified by the National Trust, which offers on-site charging facilities. There’s another charging station just up the road at 33 Forest Street. The next day, push on to the relaxation haven of Daylesford, famous for its mineral springs. Hit the spas or go for a stroll around the charming Lake Daylesford. For a meal, you could splash out by visiting Lake House, which uses seasonal produce sourced from local farms, including its own Dairy Flat Farm. You could stay the night here or head across the road to the holiday rentals of King’s Cottage or Bilson’s Landing – all three have their own charging station. When you’re ready to hit the road again be sure to stop off – and step back in time – at the Great Western Hotel in Ballan. This 1970s-styled motel is decorated with wood panelling, retro art and a tiki bar and serves up classics such as prawn cocktails and vol-au-vents. On the way back to Melbourne, treat the kids with a stop-off at McDonald’s Melton South, where you can also plug in and recharge. From here, it’s less than an hour back to Melbourne. EV mode This entire itinerary can be done in electric mode on a fully charged battery, except for the return leg from Daylesford to Melbourne, on which some petrol power will be required. Go greener tips Plan ahead by checking for public charging stations along the way and schedule pit stops so you can travel with zero emissions even on longer legs. Make sure you set off with reusable water bottles, cups and cutlery to minimise the need for disposable plastic on the road. Get the whole family involved in tracking your Co2 emissions and the dollars you’ll save by travelling in electric mode. Talk about how you’ll spend those savings and make it a fun task to keep the kids occupied in the backseat.

Thursday briefing: Johnson vows to battle on after bruising day;2022-01-20T06:30:38Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: Byelection rumblings after Tory MP defects Hello, Warren Murray with you in the name of good morning here is the news. Boris Johnson has faced a defection by a junior MP and a demand to quit from one of the most senior Tories during a dramatic day in Westminster, with even allies of the prime minister warning the current situation cannot go on. David Davis caused shockwaves when he told Johnson in the Commons: “In the name of God, go.” Tory MPs have estimated that as many as 30 letters may have been submitted of the 54 required to bring about a confidence vote, with more expected to come in after Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, delivers her finding on alleged rule-breaking in Downing Street next week.
In Bury South, some constituents want a byelection after Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour because of partygate. In a letter to Johnson, Wakeford said he believed “the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse”. * * * ‘What are Republicans for?’ – Joe Biden has spoken of a “winter of peril and possibility” and blasted US Republicans for “a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn’t get anything done”. In only his second solo White House press conference – lasting nearly two hours – Biden said: “One thing I haven’t been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game at making things better in this country … What are Republicans for, what are they for? Name me one thing they’re for.”
Referring to the leader of the Republicans’ obstructionist Senate minority, the president insisted: “I actually like Mitch McConnell. We like one another. But he has one straightforward objective: make sure that there’s nothing I do that makes me look good, in his mind, with the public at large … I think that the fundamental question is, ‘What’s Mitch for?’” Biden suggested his biggest mistake had been underestimating the radicalisation of the Republican party under Donald Trump. He told the story of five Republican senators who privately told him they agreed with him but told him “Joe, if I do it, I’ll get defeated in a primary.” * * * Student watchdog to police course value – More than 60,000 full-time students in England are doing degrees at institutions that could be punished for low quality and poor value for money. The Office for Students (OfS) has said 80% of students should continue past their first year and 75% complete their degree if universities and colleges want to avoid being sanctioned. Under proposed rules, institutions could also be investigated and penalised by the OfS if fewer than 60% of their graduates go on to work in what it classifies as skilled employment. There are another 150,000 part-time undergraduates at institutions that may not meet its requirements, says the OfS. The rules are being put out for consultation. * * * Alcohol lessons funded by alcohol – Schools are using “misleading and biased” information funded by the alcohol industry to teach pupils as young as nine about drinking, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Academics said the materials “portray alcohol as a normal consumer product to impressionable young minds”. They analysed materials put together by Drinkaware for Education, Smashed, and Talk About Alcohol. Teachers in thousands of UK schools employ their lesson plans, factsheets and films. Drinkaware has removed the materials concerned from its website, saying it was out of date. The Alcohol Education Trust and Diageo, which sponsors Smashed, defended their programmes and said underage drinking in the UK was falling. * * * GM crops ‘have not delivered much’ – Research into the gene editing of plants in the UK will become easier under new rules brought forward by the government. Ministers have repeatedly voiced support for genetic modification as an aid to modernising farming and reducing its environmental impact. Campaigners have expressed concern: Pat Thomas, the director of Beyond GM, said “farmers don’t really want to grow genetically engineered crops and citizens don’t want to eat them … After 35 years of use, genetically engineered crops have not delivered much in terms of real value and they have largely been a distraction from more meaningful discussions about what kind of food system we want and need to transition to.” But Prof Nick Talbot from the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich said it would “produce nutritious crops requiring much lower fertiliser inputs and with greater resilience”. * * * ‘I’ve read every Marvel comic’ – Did Dark Reign foresee Trump? Was Iron Man about US military might? Who was Unbeatable Squirrel Girl – and was her superpower really non-violent conflict resolution? Only one man knows … Douglas Wolk who has read all 27,000 Marvel comics. Here is what he learned.

More than two-thirds of male football fans harbour hostile, sexist or misogynistic attitudes towards women’s sport, a study led by Durham University claims.

Boris Johnson’s tenuous situation warrants another separate round-up of today’s front pages, which we summarise as follows. The Guardian splashes with “‘In the name of God, go’: Tory anger builds as Boris Johnson clings on”. The Mirror too goes with the Davis quote. Johnson “hanging by a thread”, it writes, above the headline “In the name of God, go”. And the Metro’s take is “In the name of God GO!” squeezed between pictures of Davis and Johnson.
The Mail splashes with “Boris and Carrie’s baby hit by Covid”, reporting that six-week-old Romy was badly ill but is now on the mend. Above that a story dismisses the “narcissistic rabble of Tory MPs” trying to topple the PM – and tells Davis “In the name of God, grow up!”. The Express follows a similar sentiment with its lead: “In the name of party unity, go … and back the PM!” The Times has “PM fights on as plotters pull back from the brink” – it says the prime minister has been granted a reprieve by MPs plotting to oust him as concern builds that the Gray inquiry will be more critical of the prime minister than expected. The Telegraph leads with Johnson’s defiance, “Johnson: I won’t quit if rebels force vote”. The Sun plays with the theme of the so-called pork pie plotters, “As our Bojo pork pie chart shows ...” it writes, underneath the headline “Battling PM crust ahead” and a shot of a pie sliced up according to the pressing issues of the day. The FT splashes with “Johnson buys time after defection to Labour rallies restive Tory MPs”. The i paper has a similar feel with “Johnson clings on to power … for now”. Sign up

You cannot take your eyes off Cate Blanchett and Bradley Cooper in Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley;2022-01-20T03:25:09Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"If 2018’s award season belonged to Guillermo del Toro’s magical, cold war thriller, The Shape of Water, then 2022 is shaping up to be an award-collecting encore for the film director and the all-star cast of his latest movie. De Toro’s Nightmare Alley peers into a circus tent in New York in the 1930s; a place where garish contortionists meet sleazy carnies looking to swindle the wealthy. When down-on-his-luck midwesterner, Stanton (played with many, many layers by Oscar-nominated actor Bradley Cooper) joins the carnival, he meets a clairvoyant named Zeena (Toni Collette is magnificent in this role) who teaches him a coded language system that makes it appear she can read minds.
Enthralled by his newfound skill, Stanton convinces his lover and fellow carny Molly (played by Rooney Mara) to leave the circus and join him as an assistant in a two-person psychic act called The Great Stanton in New York’s nightclubs. Two years on, they are making serious bank. But one evening, their mentalist performance is interrupted by psychiatrist Dr Lilith Ritter (played by Academy Award-winning actress Cate Blanchett) who attempts to expose the duo’s secret language. Stanton fires back by humiliating her before the city’s influential social set. Intrigued by his conman ways, Lilith invites Stanton to her fancy office the next day, a sepia-drenched room with marble floors and wooden walls. “You see the office representing the character of Lilith: it’s beautiful but it conceals a lot of things,” del Toro says. “The office is full of secret doors. Behind them, there are recorders, a safe, a secret entrance. “It’s in perfect order. But you feel [like it’s] a little bit menacing … there’s a superiority to it. What I do is create environments that allow the characters to thrive. You can see Lilith moving about the office in an elegant, and yet extremely calculated way.” And thrive Blanchett does. This scene is the first of a series of captivating on-screen moments between Blanchett and Cooper, the type that will hold your attention in the same way Cooper and Lady Gaga’s steamy Oscars performance did in 2019.
“Have you not heard? We’re at war,” Lilith, in her svelte, belted black suit tells Stanton, as she slinks about the office and slams a newspaper on the coffee table before him. “I’m aware,” he answers nervously, clearly wanting to feel superior to Lilith, but knowing that he is inferior in this moment. Lilith’s line has two meanings, del Toro says. “The line is meant to signify that America is at war now,” he says. “But it’s also to signify that ‘we’ – Stan and Lilith – are at war, because he humiliated her horribly in front of everyone. [With these two characters], there’s a constant change of who is dominant … it’s a dance of coming closer and then further apart. “[Stanton] is almost like this young child in awe of this woman.” Stanton and Lilith begin an affair and conspire to manipulate a dangerous tycoon named Kimball (played by Peter MacNeill). Lilith also begins psychiatry sessions with Stanton, which open up his character, in scenes that allow Cooper to, as the New York Times expertly put it, “let you see his character’s internal whirring”. Nightmare Alley is based on William Lindsay Gresham’s novel, published in 1946, a time when psychoanalysis was deemed a little too kooky for Americans. “I play the traditional femme fatale – I draw men to their doom,” Blanchett tells W Magazine. “But I saw my character, Lilith, as a beacon of truth in a perverted way. Someone who was able to excavate the truth from a person who did not want the truth revealed.” The all-star cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins and David Strathairn. Mara has recently been announced as the titular character in the new Audrey Hepburn eight-episode biopic, which will be directed by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Luca Guadagnino. According to Blanchett (whom you may have just seen in climate change allegory movie Don’t Look Up as Leonardo DiCaprio’s news anchor mistress), Nightmare Alley has a larger message, one that is communicated best by her character. “The more one tries to conceal one’s true nature, the more those tendencies will have an impact on your life,” she says. “It’s one thing to lie – it’s another thing to believe your lies (and my character reveals the truth).” Yes, del Toro might take home a golden statue or two this year, but make no mistake, this is Blanchett’s award season, and everybody will be talking about this performance.

Wednesday briefing: ‘Letters are coming from the left and from the right’;2022-01-19T06:29:30Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: Johnson’s No 10 ‘a culture that needs changing’ Good morning from me, Warren Murray. You’ve got mail, and so has the 1922 committee. There is open talk among Conservative MPs of removing Boris Johnson as prime minister after he gave a disastrous interview claiming not to have lied over Downing Street parties. It is thought more likely than not there will be a confidence ballot: “Letters are coming from the left and from the right, from Brexiters and remainers,” said one MP, “because what is slowly dawning on people is that there’s not a policy issue; this is a mindset, a modus operandi and culture that needs changing.” Christian Wakeford, a 2019-intake MP, revealed he had submitted a no confidence letter on Tuesday; a day that gave us the “pork pie putsch” of MPs elected in 2019. They met in the office of Alicia Kearns – whose constituency contains Melton Mowbray – to discuss Johnson’s future as prime minister. Johnson has defended himself against claims from Dominic Cummings, his former aide, that he lied to parliament about believing a garden party in the first lockdown was a work event.
“I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” Johnson told Sky News. Cummings has claimed that two officials warned the prime minister. * * * Plan B easing likely – In a difficult prime minister’s questions today, Boris Johnson is expected to try again to change the national conversation away from his party problems by announcing the end of Plan B Covid measures, instructing millions to return to workplaces across England and dropping the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums. The cabinet will meet this morning on the subject. In Scotland, restrictions brought in before Christmas are to be lifted from next Monday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said. Meanwhile researchers have said more than two-thirds of the common side-effects people experience after a Covid jab can be attributed to the nocebo effect, an opposite version of the placebo effect, rather than the vaccine itself. Stay up to date with our Covid live blog. * * * Midweek catch-up > Boris Johnson’s promise of next-generation fast broadband to most homes by 2025 is under threat as rural areas and remote towns and villages miss out, says parliament’s spending watchdog. It says the pledge relies too heavily on commercial internet providers who prefer to make easy money by servicing urban areas. > The US congressional committee investigating the 6 January 2021 Capitol attack has issued subpoenas to some of Donald Trump’s top lawyers including Rudy Giuliani. Separately, Trump’s second attorney general, William Barr, is to publish his memoirs in March. > California prosecutors have filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver of a Tesla on Autopilot who ran a red light, slammed into another car and killed two people in 2019. > A human rights lawyer has filed a torture complaint against the new president of Interpol, Ahmed Nasser al-Raisi. The Emirati major general is accused by human rights groups of involvement in torture and arbitrary detentions. > More than 100 members of the global super-rich are calling for governments around the world to “tax us now” to help pay for the pandemic response and tackle the gulf between rich and poor. * * * Begg seeks passport back – The former Guantánamo detainee Moazzam Begg is planning legal action against Priti Patel to try to restore his British passport, which was revoked eight years ago after two trips to Syria. A terror prosecution relating to Begg’s time in Syria collapsed in 2014, after which police said they accepted he was innocent. Begg was arrested in February 2002 in Pakistan and ended up in Guantánamo before being released without charge in 2005. He works with the Cage advocacy group which campaigns to help people caught up in the “war on terror”. Begg said his trips to Syria in 2012 and 2013 were part of his campaigning activity, and he was told by MI5 that he was free to travel there, but his passport was taken in December 2013 as he returned to the UK from a trip to South Africa. * * * Meningitis resurgent – Meningitis B cases among students in England are rising sharply to exceed pre-pandemic levels, according to a report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Meningococcal group B bacteria are a serious cause of life-threatening infections including meningitis and sepsis that can cause brain damage, epilepsy, hearing loss, the loss of limbs, and death. Linda Glennie from the Meningitis Research Foundation said: “The data published by UKHSA has highlighted that students, particularly those living on campuses, have a higher risk of meningococcal disease than their peers … Meningitis progresses rapidly, so it’s critical to alert someone if ill, and to seek urgent medical advice.” * * * Straws buried in field forever – A set of ancient gold and silver tubes dating to about 5,500 years ago and unearthed in North Caucasus in Russia could be the world’s oldest surviving drinking straws, experts have claimed. The tubes, each more than a metre in length with a narrow perforated tip, were found in an excavation near Maykop in the summer of 1897.
The relics, now in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, date to the fourth millennium BC, and were made of segments joined together. A team of experts in Russia said they were likely to be straws for drinking beer from a shared pot. Today in Focus podcast: Year of the squeeze Households across the UK will see rising prices and stalling wages strain their budgets in the year ahead, money and consumer editor Hilary Osborne reports.

Sport Thomas Tuchel diagnosed a severe case of fatigue among his suddenly struggling Chelsea players after their 1-1 draw at Brighton on Tuesday night and aims to arrest it by giving them two days off before the weekend. At the Australian Open so far today, Ash Barty has put herself another round deeper into the women’s singles draw with a 6-1, 6-1 demolition of Lucia Bronzetti. Rafael Nadal has just beaten Yannick Hanfmann 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. Plenty more to come from Melbourne, including Naomi Osaka versus Madison Brengle right now, so keep up with it all at our live blog. New Zealand’s limited-overs tour of Australia has been postponed indefinitely due to uncertainty over when the visitors would be able to return home due to Covid-19 protocols. The tour from 24 January to 9 February was to comprise three one-dayers in Perth, Hobart and Sydney and a Twenty20 match in Canberra. The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, has warned there is no guarantee Lewis Hamilton will race in Formula One in 2022 after the seven-time champion controversially lost the 2021 title to Max Verstappen. Competitors at the Beijing Winter Olympics will face an “Orwellian surveillance state” in China and could put themselves in danger if they speak out in support of the Uyghur Muslims, human rights and athlete advocacy groups have said. Business Asian shares have been falling in cautious trading today after stocks on Wall Street sank to a new low for the year. Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul and Sydney were lower while Hong Kong edged higher. Expect the FTSE to open around 30 points lower. A pound brings $1.36 and €1.20 at time of writing. The papers We have another separate report on today’s front pages – the gist of it follows. The Guardian leads with “Clamour to oust Johnson grows as Tory MPs plot confidence vote”. Emma Raducanu’s successful Australian Open debut grabs the picture slot. The Times has “Red wall Tory MPs team up to topple Boris Johnson”. The Mirror’s take is “Porkie pie plot to ditch PM” – the paper quotes one Tory as saying “His time has gone.”
The Mail has “Exposed: The ‘Pork Pie’ plot to topple PM” but seems to offer the PM some support, saying Plan B Covid curbs are being axed and Britain is “basking in a post-Covid jobs miracle” yet “panicking Red Wall MPs are turning on the man who got them elected”. As you might expect the Express is more shrill: “What a sorry state! New MPs plot to oust PM” saying Johnson apologises “TEN times for partygate” but still faces a rebellion. The Telegraph also mentions the axing of Covid restrictions in its lead with “Plan B to be scrapped as PM faces plot from rebel MPs” alongside a picture of a downcast Johnson wearing a mask. The i newspaper plays it straight with “Tory plotters in talks to topple Boris Johnson”. The Metro has simply “Nobody told me”. The Sun is out of step with its peers: “Strictly dancer Nadiya Bychkova has split from her footballer fiance”. Johnson’s troubles find a smaller spot under the headline “Pork Pie plot to oust Bojo”.

‘Just by turning on the TV, you’re going to be educating yourself’: how NITV is changing the narrative around 26 January;2022-01-19T00:38:40Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"“You arrive in the darkness and everyone’s warming up and there’s eucalypt burning for the smoking ceremony,” says John Paul Janke, co-host of NITV’s 26 January Sunrise Ceremony. The Wuthathi and Murray Island man is recalling the atmosphere before the broadcast from North Head in Sydney a couple of years back. “And just the beautiful smell of eucalypt burning in darkness as the sun comes up and dawn breaks over this beautiful continent – it’s a really uplifting sense of spirituality and the identity of this country.” No matter the location, the sense of spirituality and the significance of the moment is not lost on Janke. Last year he co-hosted the Sunrise Ceremony from Burleigh Heads in Queensland. “It was the same feeling, just a different location because it was over the ocean. And it was just stunning. To have that serenity in the morning before the day gets big and involves the rest of Australia. For me it’s a space that we sort of own.” The ceremony is simulcast on Channel 10, with Network 10 presenter and Whadjuk Noongar woman, Narelda Jacobs, co-hosting with Janke (the pair also hosts NITV’s current affairs program, The Point). “It is so moving,” Jacobs says. “I think we kind of cast our mind back to what it must have been like to be those first people to set eyes on white people for the very first time and not knowing exactly what they were.”
Artwork by Gamilaroi and Nagarabal designer, Jeremy Worrall Both Janke and Jacobs say how difficult a day 26 January is for First Nations people and the importance of giving a space to acknowledge these feelings. “More and more people who are on their own reconciliation journey are realising the significance of that day and asking the question, why should we celebrate on that day?” Jacobs says. “The Sunrise Ceremony was designed to give people somewhere to channel their emotions. A lot of us wake up on that day, not knowing what to do. We know that we don’t want to celebrate but where is there a place that we can go? So that’s what the Sunrise Ceremony was designed for, to give people a chance to turn the TV on, listen to conversations and be able to hear the things that are on all of our hearts. And to have the time to be able to go deeply into what we’re all feeling.” At NITV and SBS, the Always Was Always Will Be programming in the lead-up to 26 January allows for an exploration of a divisive national event, with Indigenous voices leading the discussion. “Just by turning on the TV, you’re going to be educating yourself,” Jacobs says. “You know, it’s such an important education, just to be aware of that knowledge and to understand the reasons why there has been generations and generations of disadvantage that has been imposed on us.”
Janke says listening to the Indigenous perspective is important for all Australians. “I really sense there’s a momentum and a shift in people’s thinking about January 26,” he says. “People have a hunger and desire to learn more about the true history of this country, and in some way, the realisation that the history that we’ve been taught has not been the true history of this country. For too long Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and achievement was denied from our historical texts. “And I think for me, hosting a show where people come to find those interesting points of history or discuss issues around Indigenous history, is a very valuable tool in changing people’s mindset and enabling people to have conversations with greater awareness. But also, it’s a great opportunity to maybe shift people’s thinking.”
John-Paul Janke and Narelda Jacobs host The Sunrise Ceremony at 6.30am on 26 January Jacobs says: “For people who don’t know what to do on January 26, this is an option for you to be able to hear intelligent and culturally aware and knowledgeable people have probably one of the most important conversations about our national identity. “We look back at the history. We look at what’s happening now and we look towards the future. And while it is an emotionally charged, fairly sombre, moving morning [during the Sunrise Ceremony], there’s also so much hope in the conversations that we have, because the future is really exciting. What we’re doing is unifying the country, you know, in the conversations that we’re having.” As well as the Sunrise Ceremony (at 6am on 26 January), at 7.30pm that evening NITV is screening a concert – TikTok and NITV Present: First Sounds – that brings together a line-up of emerging and established artists in a first-time collaboration between NITV and TikTok. Janke says: “That’s the very essence of NITV. It’s the ability to bring those Indigenous voices – they can be well-known Australians, or they can be people who have been chipping away at community level for a long time – to the forefront, for the entire Australian nation to hear, listen to, celebrate and acknowledge.” NITV presents a selection of dedicated programming, special events and news highlights with a focus on encouraging greater understanding of Indigenous Australian perspectives on 26 January.

Tuesday briefing: Rebel Tories deploy Operation Rinka;2022-01-18T06:27:17Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: Cummings would ‘swear under oath’ about party Good morning, I’m Warren Murray and this is your briefing – none shall be turned away. Rebel Tories are upping pressure on Boris Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties scandal, with one naming their plan “Operation Rinka” in reference to the dog killed in the Jeremy Thorpe affair in the 1970s. It comes in answer to Downing Street insiders reportedly devising a plan to sack officials and save Johnson, referred to as “Operation Save Big Dog”, and its sibling “Operation Red Meat” to divert pubic attention on to other issues. A senior government source said multiple groups were angry with Johnson: lockdown sceptics, disgruntled ex-ministers, and MPs from former Labour red wall seats. “It only takes a dozen letters from each group to get you close to the 54 you need [to trigger a no-confidence vote in the prime minister].” Outside parliament, 40% of grassroots Tories want Johnson to resign. Dominic Cummings has accused Johnson of lying after No 10 denied the prime minister was warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” party. Cummings said he personally told the principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, who organised it that the invitation broke the rules, and that Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings said in a blogpost: “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” John Griffin, the taxi firm tycoon who has given £4m to the Tories since 2013, has joined calls for Boris Johnson to resign. Peter Hargreaves, the Brexit-backing billionaire who gave £1m to the Tories for the 2019 general elections campaign, said of Johnson: “He doesn’t want to do good – he just wants to be prime minister. That’s his only agenda.” * * * Covid latest – Speaking of Operation Red Meat: No 10 has signalled plans to phase out England’s remaining pandemic restrictions from as early as March. Some scientists have warned against downgrading laws that reduce the spread of Covid, while others have said it is a logical next step. In the US, four jail inmates have filed a lawsuit saying they were unknowingly given ivermectin by a prison doctor as a form of medical experimentation despite US health officials warning it should not be used to treat Covid-19. Australia has reported its highest ever Covid daily death toll – more on this and other developments at our global live blog. * * * Tonga under veil of ash – Some of the first images have emerged from Tonga’s volcano and tsunami-hit islands, after a New Zealand defence force surveillance flight returned from the cut-off country, as two deaths from the disaster on Saturday have been confirmed. Land and trees are shown coated with ash and other damage. The Fua’amotu international airport runway appears inundated.
Other satellite images show that flooding came in several blocks from the coastline. On Tuesday, New Zealand’s ministry of foreign affairs and trade said there had been two confirmed deaths, one of them a British national as previously reported. Australia and New Zealand are sending planes and ships to assist. The islands’ undersea communications cable is believed to be cut about 37km offshore and could take weeks to repair. * * * ‘Heat or eat’ – Energy bills could eat up more than half of some UK households’ incomes, poverty charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) has said. Households across the board faced bill increases of 40% to 47% from April and there would be huge variations in their ability to cope: single-adult households on low incomes could be forced to spend 54% of their income on gas and electricity when the energy price cap changes on 1 April, the JRF found. Martin Lewis from MoneySavingExpert, said the government must provide billions in support to poorer households facing “heat or eat” decisions. A government spokesperson said: We will continue to look closely at the pressures facing people and what further measures might be needed on abating high energy costs.” * * * Lords rebuke – The House of Lords has voted to make misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales – an idea rejected by both Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab – in a night of several defeats for the government in the upper chamber. The vote came during debate over the crime, sentencing and courts bill. The government lost 14 divisions, including plans to make people locking themselves on to objects punishable by up to 51 weeks’ imprisonment, suspicion-less stop-and-search and introduction of “serious disruption prevention orders” against protesters. Peers also voted to block proposals to give police new powers to stop noisy and disruptive protests in England and Wales. Once the Lords have completed their scrutiny, the bill will return to the House of Commons. It needs both houses’ approval. * * * ‘Loud’ lecturer wins sacking case – A senior academic who says she was sacked from her University of Exeter physics post because of her loud voice has been awarded more than £100,000 after winning a claim for unfair dismissal. Dr Annette Plaut told the Guardian she had a “naturally loud voice” that came from her middle European Jewish background and it was the combination of her being “female and loud” that led to her dismissal. Plaut, who worked there for 29 years, said she was taking medication for stress since her sacking. The university argued during a tribunal that she was dismissed over the way she dealt with two PhD students and insists it had nothing to do with her background or her sex. The university has said it will appeal against the tribunal’s decision.

The papers The splash in the Times today is “Cummings: PM lied to parliament about party” while the Mirror calls this a “New bombshell claim” saying Johnson “gave the go-ahead”. Metro’s top story is “I’ll swear PM lied to house”, paraphrasing Cummings – readers might recall that on a previous occasion, when testifying did not suit his ends, the same individual was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear.
The Guardian’s front page leads with “Cummings accuses PM of lying over No 10 party”, and also featured are “UK sending anti-tank weapons to Ukraine”, as well as “Inquiry launched into Mone over ‘VIP lane’ deal”. The i is more general: “Tory angst at Johnson leadership growing”. The Express would prefer we look over there at something else, while still appearing to chastise the PM, telling him to “sort energy bills crisis” . The Financial Times has that one too: “Ministers explore paying energy suppliers to ease household bills”. The Mail says “British troops sent to Ukraine”; the Telegraph leads with “Tougher powers for magistrates to clear trial backlog”; while the Sun has a totally bizarre lead story about Prince Andrew and plush toys.

Monday briefing: PM turns on BBC as ‘Partygate’ pressure mounts;2022-01-17T06:25:21Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Top story: No-confidence letters piling up Good Monday morning to you, Graham Russell here with the latest news to start the week. The prime minister has dealt a serious blow to the BBC’s funding in what critics say is a diversionary tactic to escape accountability for the “Partygate” revelations. With reports that dozens of Tory backbenchers have written letters of no-confidence, Boris Johnson ally Nadine Dorries said the BBC’s licence fee would be abolished in 2027 and the broadcaster’s funding frozen for the next two years, potentially leading to thousands of redundancies. Other measures under what has been called Operation Red Meat are said to involve a renewed drive to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats, measures to tackle the NHS operations backlog, extra investment in skills and the lifting of Covid restrictions on 26 January. Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said: “The prime minister thinks those reporting on his rule-breaking should pay consequences, whilst he gets off free”, while Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, described the announcement as “a last-ditch attempt [by Johnson] to save his failing premiership”. The timing of the announcements is highly convenient, writes Heather Stewart, and gives Tory rightwingers something to cheer as Johnson’s future hangs in the balance. * * * ‘An act of terror’ – Two teenagers have been arrested in Manchester by counter-terror police over the Texas synagogue standoff in which the attacker was named as a British national. The pair are being questioned after suspect Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old who had been a resident of Blackburn in Lancashire, took four people hostage at a synagogue in a Dallas suburb on Saturday. He was pronounced dead after the FBI stormed the building. All four hostages were unharmed after what Joe Biden described as “an act of terror”. * * * ‘It’s excruciating’ – A British woman is feared to have been swept to her death in the tsunami sparked by the eruption at the weekend of an underwater volcano in Tonga. Angela Glover, who runs an animal shelter there, has not been seen since being hit by the wave, which also caught up her husband and the couple’s dogs. “One of the dogs has been found, but Angela hasn’t been found,” said brother Nick Eleini. “It’s excruciating. I can’t even believe the words are coming out of my mouth, to be honest.” Australia and New Zealand have sent planes to assess the damage from the eruption that has blanked the area with ash, contaminating water supplies and cutting off communications.
* * * Pandemic pressures – Eight million people in England are drinking so much wine, beer or spirits that it is harmful to their health, government data shows, with a large increase in the number drinking at dangerous levels. Before the pandemic, the figure stood at about 5 million. The switch to drinking at home was partly to blame, said Prof Julia Sinclair from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with drinking sessions sometimes lasting several hours longer than they would in a pub. “Just even nine months of drinking, as we saw in 2020, was enough to push a whole load of people over the edge.” * * * ‘I thought that was my ambition over’ – Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she considered not running for the leadership amid fears her mental health records would be exposed. Davidson, who was diagnosed with clinical depression while at university, said her fears were prompted by the press accessing the medical records of Gordon Brown’s son, which “felt like a really egregious breach”. Davidson said she hoped being able to open up about mental health issues on her own terms would help others realise it is not career-ending, as she had once feared. * * * Burns after reading – Robert Burns, the revered Scottish bard behind Auld Lang Syne, was advised not to write in Scots because no one in London would understand it, new research has shown. Dr John Moore, a Scottish physician and travel author who was a regular correspondent with the poet, “cautioned Burns that he was limiting his audience” and told him to avoid political subjects too. When Burns sent Moore a long letter detailing his entire childhood, Moore wrote back urging him to divide his letters up next time because he was “obliged to pay six & eightpence for it”. The correspondence will be published as part of a new collected works by the Oxford University Press. * * * Today in Focus podcast: Afghan female MPs fight for their country in exile After a harrowing escape from the Taliban, Afghanistan’s female politicians are regrouping in Greece to fight for their country.

Thinking about buying an electric vehicle in 2022? We tackle your top 5 concerns;2022-01-17T06:04:33Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Buying an electric vehicle (EV) has clear benefits: EVs are better for the environment and have lower lifetime running costs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, and offer some of the best safety ratings and in-car tech on the market. But if you’re still feeling cautious, you’re not alone. We address your top five EV concerns. Myth 1: It will be hard to find a charging station In a 2021 survey by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC), more than half of respondents said they would consider an EV for their next car, and 92% agreed public charging infrastructure was important in encouraging them to make the purchase. Public charging stations are on the rise in Australia, with the EVC reporting a 24% increase in the installation of fast charging facilities and a 23% increase in standard charging facilities over the 12 months to August 2021.
There are currently around 3,000 public charging points across Australia – or one charger for every 7.2 vehicles on the road. “As the demand for EVs continues to rise, we’re seeing our roads and infrastructure evolve to meet the continued growth of the EV market,” says Peter van der Westhuyzen, an executive director in Macquarie’s personal banking business. “There are a growing number of charging facilities at workplaces and shopping centres, some service stations now offer rapid chargers, and you can increasingly find on-street parking charging facilities as well.” How easy it is to find a charger might surprise you. There are about 3,000 public charging points across Australia – or one charger for about every seven EVs on the road. That number is continuing to grow, supported by apps and websites showing where they are located and any associated costs. EVs can also be charged using regular wall sockets, so you may not need a special charger at home. When you consider that the average Australian only drives about 40km a day, charging through a standard wall socket overnight will top up the battery and provide more than adequate range for most drivers. Myth 2: EVs are only good for urban driving It’s important to consider your lifestyle when choosing an EV, so you can ensure you get a model that’s most suited to you and what you will use it for. “EVs are definitely a convenient car option if you live in an urban area,” van der Westhuyzen says. “But they are also a great option outside of city areas – and there are interactive maps that make it easy to find charging infrastructure along your journey.” Van der Westhuyzen says it’s important to do your research, just as you would with petrol stations if you were driving your ICE vehicle long distances or outside a metropolitan area. You may find your battery range will get you to and from your destination without having to charge in between. Just like ICE vehicles, EVs are made with lots of different journeys in mind. Myth 3: My EV won’t perform as well as my current car “More and more of our customers are telling us they love the driving experience,” van der Westhuyzen says. The EVC survey also shows a growing interest in EV performance: three-quarters of people indicated performance would encourage an EV purchase in 2021, compared to only 48% in 2020.
75% of people indicated performance would encourage an EV purchase in 2021, compared to only 48% in 2020 (Electric Vehicle Council). Driving an EV definitely doesn’t mean compromising on performance. Many family EVs available today will provide acceleration that is similar to what you’d experience in much more expensive ICE cars, and there are many other factors that make the driving experience a pleasure. “EVs are quiet to drive, the acceleration is powerful yet smooth and the interiors are spacious,” van der Westhuyzen says. “We’ve heard some drivers tell us they’re worried an EV won’t do what their current car can, but it’s good to understand what is important to you.” If you need towing capacity, increased storage space inside the car or exhilarating performance, there are EVs available today that will provide what you need. In the next two to three years, Australia will welcome more brands and models that offer even more diversity. Myth 4: EVs are expensive, and the financing is too complicated There are various cost considerations to take into account with owning any kind of vehicle, and EVs are no exception. Even though EVs might be slightly more expensive to buy than a comparable ICE car, this cost may be offset by lower running costs and less frequent maintenance, and half of us are prepared to pay more for an EV. “It’s likely purchase prices will also come down as the market becomes more competitive,” says van der Westhuyzen. “It’s also worth considering state-based subsidies and other incentives for EVs which help with affordability.” Van der Westhuyzen says Macquarie is committed to helping Australians reduce their carbon footprints and transition to EVs. Macquarie’s EV specialist car-buying service offers a discounted finance rate only available for new EVs and charges no fees. “Our experts can help you find the right EV, negotiate the price, manage the trade-in of your old car and, if required, organise finance at a competitive rate for any new EV,” van der Westhuyzen says. Depending on where you live, Macquarie may even be able to deliver your new EV to your home, fully charged and ready to go. Myth 5: I can’t take my EV on a road trip This is a very common myth – and easily busted. Many EV makes and models now come with a range of 350-600km on a single charge, or about the same as an ICE passenger vehicle.
Many EV models now come with a range of 350-600kms on a single charge. The ideal road trip might simply mean adjusting your habits. “Like with any extended drive, planning ahead is important – and perhaps more so when driving an EV,” van der Westhuyzen says. “It’s also worth considering that the charge time varies according to which EV model you drive. For some EVs on the market, a 15-minute charge at a public fast charger will give you approximately 300km of driving distance.” Overall, it’s not that different from taking your ICE vehicle on a road trip: check that your EV is fully charged, and research the charging infrastructure available along your holiday route and at your destination. An unexpected bonus of taking your EV on a road trip might be increased internal storage, courtesy of no petrol tank or exhaust system. The environmental benefits, the low ongoing running and maintenance costs, and high performance of EVs make them an attractive proposition for conscious consumers looking for new ways to extend their positive impact.

No wonder deceit is dragging Boris Johnson under – he’s not even a good liar | Simon Jenkins;2022-01-14T12:00:08Z;['Simon Jenkins'];['N/A'];"He lied. He clearly lied. But so what? As Boris Johnson hangs on by his fingertips, we wait to see who will stamp on them. The answer is presumably Sue Gray, to whose final mercies he has desperately handed his fate. Surely nothing she says can rescue him. At question is not his guilt, only his punishment.
Johnson can plead that he was “advised” that office parties were within the rules. He can protest they were “implicitly” work-related, but with even more revelations about Downing Street parties on the front pages today, the edifice of Downing Street concealment and deceit is crumbling before voters’ eyes. In that uniquely British political theatre, the House of Commons, the prime minister was subjected on Wednesday to the nearest democracy gets to medieval trial by ordeal. MPs abandoned all dignity, nuance, sympathy or sense of proportion. They gleefully yelled and jeered and hurled insults until hoarse with rage. When in the mood, parliament does not talk truth to power: it screams in its face. The prime minister’s unhappy relationship with the truth is longstanding and embedded in his character. Veracity is trumped by ego. Most of his recent catalogue of woes – Brexit promises, dodgy peerages, sleazy colleagues, flat decorations, lockdown parties – could have been soothed had Johnson simply come clean early on, appeared frank and apologised. He seems psychologically unable to disentangle falsity from half-truth. A life spent in bland denials and upmarket jokes has lent him a high-risk belief in his invulnerability. From each laughable lie he could, in one bound, leap free. Champions of political mendacity make much of its role in democratic leadership. In his study of political hypocrisy, David Runciman argues that fake sincerity, false promises and the fabrication of evidence are tools that have always lain close to the heart of power. He cites leaders from Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. The last fought the Iraq war on a lie. Peter Oborne’s The Rise of Political Lying has Blair’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell as its virtual hero, with his boss plumbing constant depths of mendacity. Yet Blair won three elections. Party manifestos are dismissed as “books of lies”. Some would argue that Johnson won the Brexit referendum by the “big lie” of its economic gains, which played much to his advantage at the 2019 election. Runciman argues that democracy requires a degree of cynicism to fuel its optimism, its promise of eternal hope, without which no one would ever vote for any politician ever. Politics thus becomes a mutual conspiracy of mendacity. As Orwell wrote, “Political language … is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” Johnson’s problem has not been his lying but his inability to manage it, notably when found out. He has no spin doctor, and on Wednesday had to admit himself to spin A&E. His belief that a winsome and “authentic” personality could make up for a rotten command structure and third-class aides exploded on him. His critics might accept that governing a pandemic would be a titanic test for even the most experienced of leaders, requiring superhuman skills of authority and persuasion, an ability to call on an unprecedented degree of public trust. But that is all the more reason not to imperil that trust. The prime minister has delivered some successes, including vaccination and the current holdout against lockdown. But these successes have been swamped by one fiasco after another, leading to a widespread judgment that he is “not fit for purpose”, not up to the job, a charge never made against Blair. A BBC vox pop on Wednesday night was brutal: “I may like him, but enough is enough.” Johnson has tried to fuse Alexis de Tocqueville’s distinction between Britain’s democracy of the club and America’s democracy of the mob. His appeal to the Tory club has lain exclusively in his popularity with the mob. He won elections as a populist. It is conceivable that a newly chastened and apologetic Johnson might try to charm his way back into favour, in the hope that the 10 percentage points now separating Labour from the Tories in the polls might be reversed. Club members might then hold their noses and give him another chance. As it is, any such poll surge seems most unlikely, which is why Keir Starmer is surely unwise to shout for the prime minister’s resignation. He should pray for him to limp on. For Johnson, an ominous parallel is the Tory party’s ruthless ejection of Thatcher in 1990. It cleansed the Downing Street stables of the poll tax toxin, and went on under John Major to win a fourth election in a row in 1992. If, as seems likely, Johnson’s days as a politician are now numbered, Britain’s brief excursion into populist politics will have ended. The moral of the story will be modest: that journalists, for all their vanity, should not be tempted to give up the day job.

"Morning mail: supply chain crisis; Prince Andrew’s titles stripped; ‘India syndrome’";2022-01-13T19:54:39Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Soaring Covid cases are disrupting goods needed for PCR testing. Nearly a quarter of the world’s population experienced a record hot year. And Novak Djokovic has been included in the Australian Open draw with a decision on his visa still pending. The impact of Covid-19 on supply chains has begun to disrupt goods needed for PCR testing, forcing the closure of clinics in one jurisdiction. The highly contagious Omicron variant has caused widespread staff shortages and a “crisis” in transport and other supply chain businesses, leading to shortages at supermarkets, retailers and other key industries. The supply chain issues are so severe that the Australian Capital Territory on Wednesday announced it was closing three testing clinics – a significant chunk of its testing capacity – until Monday. The federal health department bought $62m worth of rapid antigen tests earlier this week to cope. But small businesses and unions have condemned as inadequate Morrison’s response to a burgeoning staffing crisis caused by the Omicron wave. Meanwhile, business and unions say national cabinet’s response to the Omicron staffing crisis falls short. The Queen has removed a range of military affiliations and royal patronages held by Prince Andrew, Buckingham Palace has said. The move, which includes the prince losing the use of “His Royal Highness”, comes after a United States judge gave the green light for her second son to face a sexual assault civil lawsuit. The move comes hours after more than 150 military veterans wrote to the Queen to ask her to strip Andrew of his honorary military roles amid what they described as their “upset and anger”. The palace had said earlier on Thursday that it had no comment on their open letter. Prince Andrew’s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, is unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement” to end her sexual assault civil lawsuit against the royal, her lawyer has said. Novak Djokovic has been included in the Australian Open draw as the wait to see if his visa will be cancelled for a second time stretches into another day. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested Djokovic will not be allowed to stay in the country and contest the Australian Open unless he can substantiate a medical exemption allowing him to be unvaccinated against Covid. Meanwhile, the Greek tennis player Stefanos Tsitsipas said Djokovic has been “playing by his own rules” and has put his bid for a 21st grand slam title at risk by not following Australia’s Covid-19 vaccination requirements.

After independence in 1960, Senegal cast off western influences and forged a new African style full of triangular forms, rocket-shaped obelisks and rammed earth. Is this spirit now being suffocated? Some travellers who spend longer periods of time in India exhibit a curious condition: a spectrum of behavioral and psychological changes that can be all-consuming. Known as the “India Syndrome”, the condition has cousins around the world: religious tourists to Jerusalem are struck with a spontaneous psychosis upon visiting the city, certain that they are hearing God; visitors to Florence are physically overcome upon viewing the beauty of the city’s art. But is it India that causes these transformations or do people go there determined to be transformed? “What is extraordinary about the last two weeks in Australia is not only the large numbers of people infected with Covid,” writes Brigid Delaney. “But the psychological volte-face required to withstand this new reality.” Listen 2021 was an important year in the fight for gender equality, and the national women’s safety summit in September was a platform for experts and advocates to discuss key issues surrounding gender equality and violence against women and children. But Scott Morrison’s keynote address – and his failure to enact meaningful reform on key issues – left some underwhelmed and others furious. Political editor Katharine Murphy speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates about Australia’s ongoing cultural reckoning for women and how the Morrison government’s response to this was hamstrung by an “empathy gap”.

Thursday briefing: Starmer brands Johnson ‘a man without shame’;2022-01-13T06:30:33Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: Fears PM could veto Sue Gray inquiry conclusions Hello, Warren Murray here, thank you all for coming. I am pretty sure this is a work thing, but in any event I am only staying briefly. Boris Johnson’s prime ministership hangs in the balance with Conservative MPs openly calling for his resignation after he admitted attending a garden party in lockdown, claiming he thought it was a “work event”. Johnson delivered a carefully worded apology about the alcohol-fuelled gathering of up to 40 officials in May 2020, which was described in an email invitation as “socially distanced drinks” in the warm weather. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has called for Johnson to “do the decent thing and resign”, castigating the prime minister as “a man without shame” and someone the British public widely viewed as a liar.
After Johnson’s statement, one of the Conservatives’ most senior backbenchers, William Wragg, and Douglas Ross, the leader of the party in Scotland, publicly called for the PM to resign. Two possible challengers for the prime minister – the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss – held back for much of the day before tweeting their support for the apology. Some MPs said the prime minister appeared less contrite in private conversations than in his apology. One Tory adviser predicted the prime minister had 72 hours to turn things around. The inquiry that is being held into the Downing Street parties should be given greater independence from No 10, former civil servants and a union leader have warned this morning, amid concerns the prime minister could veto the findings of Sue Gray if she recommends he be investigated under the ministerial code. “The prime minister himself gets to decide if he needs to be investigated under the ministerial code,” said Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union for senior civil servants. * * * Djokovic into Australian Open – Novak Djokovic has just now been included in the draw for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday. Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has said this morning that a decision has not been made on whether he will overturn the player’s visa. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, stressed a short time ago that people entering the country must be double vaccinated, and that authorities must implement Covid entry rules – remarks that placed Djokovic’s effort to play in the Australian Open in fresh doubt. * * * Outcry over anti-protest powers – Activist groups are urging Labour to oppose a policing bill they say will undermine the right to protest at a critical moment in the climate crisis. The bill includes powers for the home secretary to ban marches and demonstrations that might be “seriously disruptive” or too noisy; a criminal offence of obstructing infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, oil refineries and printing presses; jail sentences for attaching or locking on to someone or something; bans on named individuals from demonstrating or going on the internet to encourage others; police stop-and-search powers to look for protest-related items; and up to 10 years’ prison for damaging memorials or statues. The bill is going through the Lords this week and next. * * * Prince Andrew faces trial prospect – Prince Andrew is facing a lengthy and embarrassing legal ordeal with the lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in Manhattan likely to go to trial by jury, US legal experts say. It comes after a New York judge refused to throw out a civil case over allegations that Andrew sexually assaulted Giuffre when she was 17 years old. The Duke of York has been forced to scale back his royal duties in the wake of the allegations, which he strenuously denies. * * * Watch out, tyrants told – Human Rights Watch has released its World Report 2022 in which it argues increased repression and violence by autocrats and military regimes are signs of their desperation and weakening grip on power. It says opposition parties are forming alliances to challenge the corrupt or repressive for power. HRW points to the Czech Republic, where the PM, Andrej Babiš, was defeated, and Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu lost the prime ministership after 12 years in power. Electoral alliances are also lining up against Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey. The HRW director, Kenneth Roth, argues that repression and “overt electoral charades” in countries such as Russia and Nicaragua should be seen as a sign of weakness, not strength. “There is a narrative that autocrats are prevailing and democracy is on the decline, yet if you look at the trends in human rights over the last 12 months it doesn’t look so rosy for the autocrats.” * * * Omicron crisis in care staffing – Care homes are missing a third of the staff they need and more than one in four have closed their doors to new admissions in a deepening labour crisis that is “putting safety and dignity at risk”, according to the National Care Forum (NCF). It says Omicron absences are running at 14% on top of an 18% job vacancy rate. Nursing and midwifery leaders have urged Sajid Javid to delay the introduction of compulsory Covid jabs for NHS staff. Health service trusts in England are preparing to start sending out dismissal letters from 3 February to workers who have not had their first dose. A health department spokesperson defended the policy: “This is about patient safety, and ensuring people in hospital or care have as much protection as possible.” * * * ‘Clean rivers with bathing edict’ – Water companies in England should each have to designate a stretch of river as bathing water by 2025 to drive the cleanup of sewage, agricultural waste and plastic pollution, MPs have said. Only one river in the UK – the River Wharfe in Ilkley – currently has an area designated as bathing water, and only 14% of English rivers meet good ecological standards. No river is deemed to be of good chemical status. A bathing designation places a legal obligation on water companies to improve water quality and has triggered huge improvements in coastal water quality. Today in Focus podcast: Is Johnson’s apology enough? Boris Johnson faced anger and derision as he admitted attending a drinks party during the first lockdown but claimed that he believed it to be a work event that did not break the rules.

With Boris Johnson on shakier ground than ever, we have another standalone roundup of the papers – a summary follows. The Mirror’s banner headline is “Disgrace”, set below a picture of Johnson giving his humiliating apology to the Commons. The Guardian’s main headline is “PM’s future on knife-edge after No 10 party apology”. The Times also has a picture of a grim-faced Johnson and the headline “Defiant PM refuses to quit as polls slip further”. The FT has “Johnson faces Tory calls to quit after attending lockdown party” and the i says “Tories call on Boris Johnson to resign”.
The Scotsman focuses on Tory leader Douglas Ross calling for the PM to quit: “Scots Tories lead rebellion despite Johnson’s apology”. The Daily Record’s splash is a bit more direct – “Cock and Bull Tory” – and nor does the National hold back, screaming “Liar”. The Telegraph takes a softer line: “Sunak leaves Johnson in limbo”, focusing on the chancellor’s half-hearted backing for the embattled PM. The Mail and Express have both decided it is time to circle the wagons around the PM. “Operation Save Boris” says the Mail, reporting that “cabinet rallies round” but “ambitious Rishi’s lukewarm support” spells trouble ahead. The Express says “I’m sorry … but now prove you can deliver for Britain”. The Star’s splash headline says “Rules are only for little people!” and the Metro has “Sorry … not sorry”. The Sun leads with the Prince Andrew sexual abuse allegations: “Damned old Duke of York”. Sign up

Boris Johnson is facing intense pressure from senior Conservatives to publicly confess he attended a rule-breaking garden party in Downing Street, with the Scottish Tory leader suggesting the prime minister should resign if he broke Covid rules. They are awaiting his explanation at prime minister’s questions today. Senior Conservatives have said MPs are discussing who would replace Johnson. One said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, could be prime minister within months: “It is no longer a question of if the PM will go, it is when.” It has been claimed that Martin Reynolds – Johnson’s aide who threw out the invitation for about 100 Downing Street staff for the “bring your own booze” party on 20 May 2020 – also attended another alcohol-fuelled gathering for No 10 staff on 18 December, the same night as a controversial press office party. A No 10 spokesperson said of the event allegedly attended by Reynolds: “A number of private office staff worked late into the evening on the Covid response.” If police officers saw laws broken while on guard at Downing Street they would be expected to report it, a former Scotland Yard assistant commissioner says this morning. With the Met under pressure to investigate, Robert Quick, who was once in charge of protection operations for Downing Street, said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” * * * Smart motorways brought to halt – The rollout of smart motorways has been suspended by the government until at least 2025. The motorways, which convert the hard shoulder to a live running lane, have been heavily criticised by safety campaigners and relatives of people who have died in crashes after being left unable to find safe refuge when their vehicles broke down. Schemes to convert stretches of the M3, M25, M62 and M40 will be put on ice until five years’ worth of safety data are available, ministers have said. The government has promised £900m for safety measures on existing smart motorways in the meantime, including more emergency refuge areas. * * * Midweek catch-up > Novak Djokovic has blamed his agent for an “administrative mistake” in declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and apologised for an “error of judgment” in attending an event after testing positive to Covid-19. > The UK government is being sued over its net zero climate strategy, which lawyers argue illegally fails to include the policies needed to deliver the promised cuts in emissions. > YouTube is a major conduit of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide and is not doing enough to tackle the spread of falsehoods on its platform, according to a global coalition of factchecking organisations. > In the US, Joe Biden is pushing hard for the Senate to set aside the “filibuster” rule, which Republicans are using to block the protection of citizens’ voting rights. > UK households have suffered the sharpest fall in the amount of cash they have available to spend for almost eight years, amid a worsening cost of living crisis driven by high inflation and rising energy bills. > Waitrose is to start selling “tearless onions” that are the result of decades of selective cross-breeding. * * * Covid latest – One in seven people who have tested positive for Covid could still be infectious if released from isolation upon receiving a negative lateral flow result after five days, new data suggests. The prime minister has indicated he favours reducing the quarantine time from seven to five days. Britain’s parents are being warned to look out for signs of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), which can leave children struggling to breathe. Covid lockdowns last year meant there were fewer RSV infections than normal, so this year there may be less immunity among children. Keep up with Covid developments at our live blog. * * * Tuition scheme branded failure – Labour says the national tutoring programme (NTP) is failing children and taxpayers, with just 10% of this academic year’s target for children receiving one-to-one or small group tutoring from NTP tuition partners reached so far. Official figures show headteachers in England are favouring their own school-led tuition programmes over the national scheme, which was controversially awarded to the Dutch multinational Randstad. The Department for Education has said pupils in England began just over 300,000 tutoring courses last term and insisted the NTP was on track to deliver its target of 2m courses this academic year. DfE figures also revealed that more children stayed off school last week because of Covid than at the end of last term. * * * Demining rat sniffs his last – A rat that won a British heroism award for finding landmines in Cambodia has died peacefully in retirement. Magawa, a giant African pouched rat originally from Tanzania, helped clear mines from about 225,000 square metres of land – the equivalent of 42 football pitches – over the course of his career after being trained to sniff out explosives. He was retired from the field in June of last year. Landmines and unexploded bombs remain a huge danger in Cambodia, with four reported deaths just in the last few days.

Sport Trevor Bayliss, the World Cup-winning former England head coach, has emerged as the in-house favourite to take charge of the Australian men’s team should Justin Langer’s contract not be renewed after the Ashes. Goals from Jan Bednarek, Armando Broja and Che Adams alongside an own goal from Álvaro Fernández gave Southampton a 4-1 win over Brentford in the Premier League. Newcastle are poised to make Chris Wood their second January signing, with the striker scheduled for a medical after the club agreed to meet the release clause of about £20m in his Burnley contract. The Leicester captain, Ellis Genge, has apologised to his teammates for losing his head at Wasps on Sunday and collecting a yellow card which he believes “potentially cost us the game”. The Yorkshire interim coach Ryan Sidebottom has apologised for using “a poor choice of words” when suggesting in a television interview that the county should “forget” the racism scandal that has engulfed the club. Emma Raducanu, the US Open champion, lost her first match of the year in 55 minutes, falling 6-0, 6-1 to Elena Rybakina in Sydney, while Andy Murray defeated Viktor Durasovic in his first-round match. And Kelechi Iheanacho’s excellent first-half goal handed Nigeria a deserved 1-0 victory over a below-par Egypt in their Africa Cup of Nations Group D clash in Garoua. Business Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said monetary policy would return to normal and interest rates might be raised earlier than planned. Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Oil prices edged higher. Futures trading suggests the FTSE should be half a per cent higher at the open as well.

We have a separate round-up of the major front pages today – a summary follows. The Times’ headline says “Say sorry or doom us all, ministers tell Johnson”. The Telegraph says “Johnson losing Tory support” and the junior minister Michael Ellis is shown bearing the brunt of MPs’ anger in the Commons.
The Guardian captures the Tory anger too and gives prominence to the suggestion of Douglas Ross, the Tory leader in Scotland, that Johnson should resign if he broke Covid rules. The Daily Mail asks: “Is the party over for PM?”, calling it the “gravest crisis of his premiership”. The Mirror is more emphatic, saying “The party’s over, Boris”. In the Metro, “Contempt for the victims” is the headline, alongside Johnson appearing to “smirk” during an interview about the crisis. The Financial Times says “Johnson faces ‘potentially terminal’ showdown over Downing Street parties” with PMQs taking place today and two polls showing majority support for his resignation. The Sun has the strapline “No 10 garden partygate” and reports Johnson “went into hiding” … “It’s my party and I’ll lie low if I want to” is the headline. The i says “PM’s future in jeopardy as Tories rage at lockdown drinks party”. The Express does its thing and claims support within the party is still strong for Johnson after “delivering Brexit and winning the war against Covid” … “Don’t blow it now, PM!” it urges in the headline.

Green jars and the no-plastic challenge: 5 fun ways to live more sustainably as a family;2022-01-11T22:00:29Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"We all want to reduce our carbon footprint. But while it’s one thing to make more eco-friendly choices as an individual, add kids into the equation and things get a little bit more complicated. The good news is that in 2022, it doesn’t have to be difficult to get the whole family on board with a planet-friendly way of life. From fun challenges to smart switches, there’s a bunch of ways to reduce our environmental impact that even the littlest ones will get excited about. Better yet, sustainable choices often come with a whole lot of added benefits – such as a healthier lifestyle and cheaper overheads. So how can you make your whole family more eco-friendly? To get you started, here are five ways to live more sustainably every day – kids and all. Pick a planet-saving SUV There’s a couple of big switches mum and dad can make that will help the whole family reduce its carbon footprint. One is choosing a car that’s better for the Earth. Australia’s National Transport Commission estimates that if consumers bought vehicles with best-in-class emissions, we could halve the amount of Co2 emissions created by new small cars.
The MG HS Plus EV allows you to drive in electric mode for up to 63km between charges. One option is to go for a dual-tech car such as the rechargeable MG HS Plus EV. This five-seat SUV allows you to drive in electric mode for up to 63km between charges, which results in zero tailpipe emissions. However, if you need to head off on a long-distance drive, you can switch to petrol mode at any time, thanks to a high-tech turbocharged petrol engine. Even then, its CO2 emissions are still up to one tonne less per year than from a non-rechargeable hybrid. With an eco-friendly car in the garage, your family can get to football practice and the supermarket without hurting the Earth. Take the no-plastic challenge Australia produces 2.5m tonnes of plastic waste every year, about 84% of which is sent to landfill. Reducing the amount of plastic waste we each create is one of the biggest things individuals can do for the planet. For a fun way to reduce your family’s plastic use, try taking a no-plastic challenge. For one week every month, for instance, get the kids on board and make a game out of avoiding all plastic. Instead of buying groceries wrapped in plastic, go to a co-op store where you fill your own jars with pasta and flour. On takeaway night, look for options that come in cardboard. Help the kids pack a school lunch without any clingwrap. Avoid straws, plastic bags and bottled beverages like they’re lava. Approach it like an exciting challenge and the little ones will love playing along. Create a green jar We’ve all heard of the swear jar. But for a new take on an old concept, why not create a green jar that rewards the kids for being energy conscious? Every time they keep their shower to under five minutes, put something in the recycling, unplug an appliance after they’ve used it, turn off a lightbulb when they leave a room or forego the telly in favour of reading a book, put a dollar in the jar and let the kids spend it on something fun at the end of the month.
Got teenagers? You could pop money in the green jar every time the kids cook a plant-based meal for the family, encouraging them to sharpen their culinary skills and helping the whole family eat less meat. Make the green switch Another one of those big things mum and dad can take care of for the whole family is moving over to green providers. The great thing about making these switches is that you only have to do it once to live more sustainably forever – so make an afternoon of it and reward the family with pizza night when you’re done. In 2018-19, households consumed more than 10% of Australia’s total energy, so reducing your home’s emissions makes a big difference. Start by looking for a carbon-neutral energy provider, so your home energy use will be offset by green initiatives. If you own your home, you could add a solar hot water system and install solar panels on the roof to produce your own renewable power. Then you can move onto green banking, and switch to superannuation funds and banks that don’t invest in the fossil fuel industry. These days, there’s plenty of great ethical options to choose from. Have a no-power hour Another way to reduce your household energy consumption is to implement energy-free time. Pick an hour every day – or maybe one afternoon each weekend – where no power is to be used in the home. Instead of watching TV or playing video games, the kids will have to get outside, enjoy arts and crafts, or bust out a good old-fashioned board game. It’s a win-win: you’ll cut your energy use and encourage your children to get active and creative.

Why did I send emails to my 2-year-old daughter? Memories | Sophie Brickman;2022-01-11T11:17:12Z;['Sophie Brickman'];['N/A'];"Around the holidays last year, when I’d been fielding lots of deep questions at bedtime about sickness and health and Zoom school and “pods,” I wrote my daughter an email, though she could not yet read: Scratching your back just now before bed, you sleepily asked, Mama, do you know anyone in the family who’s bold? I was like yes! You’re bold. And you said I am? And I said yes, you’re brave. And you said no no, like has no HAIR, mama. The first email I sent her, she was two. I’d texted a friend one day that, apropos of nothing, my daughter had started referring to people she loved – her aunt, her grandma, her friend at the playground – as “my little darling.” My friend wrote back, “You gotta find a way to remember that. Email her!” And I thought: Yes, in an age when the prospect of buying a physical scrapbook and getting out the glue stick and photo corners is about as realistic as my making it through the day without crushed Goldfish in my hair, I can send an email. So I opened up a new account and dashed off a note to my pint-sized Holly Golightly. And I keep dashing off notes, because the lift is pretty low; it’s one way to manage the morass of digital ephemera I collect on my children every day; and, like nearly every parent before me, I feel an inexplicable urge to preserve in amber the moments of childhood that are too charming to be forgotten. And it’s an urge that’s been documented for centuries. “The design of this little book is to supply a want, though perhaps an unknown one to many,” begins the preface of Baby’s Record: A Twofold Gift for Mothers and Children, published in 1889. “Most persons regret that the little items of babyhood, so interesting, to the parents at least, pass into oblivion.” What do I not want to pass into oblivion? Here’s a note from me, on the occasion of the morning of my 36th birthday: You tromped in, looked at me v closely, and said, Mama, I know it’s your birthday but you still look like you’re the same height. You still look just like you’re 35. Here’s another from my husband, sent – I realized when looking at the date – just a few hours before I started contractions with her little sister: Your mama told me that after you brushed your teeth this evening, she walked into your bathroom to find you brushing your nose, quite seriously, with an electric toothbrush. She said you shouldn’t brush your nose and you replied “Why not?” And she didn’t have a good answer. “Baby books are full of minutiae, capturing all sorts of stuff that doesn’t get recorded otherwise,” Russell Johnson told me when I reached him on Zoom. “There are gems throughout.” Johnson is a curator at the UCLA Library Special Collections. Through donations, and searching on eBay, he’s built up the university’s baby book collection to its current 1,900 volumes. The collection spans from 1872 – around when infant mortality started improving, but also when people started caring more about babyhood as a life stage – to the mid-twentieth century. So we’re in the 150th year, give or take, of chronicling baby lives in some way. The alleged purpose of these keepsakes has evolved over the years, Johnson explained. Well-to-do families of yore often used their pages to list gifts given to their babies. As scientific medicine grew and pediatrics was formalized as a specialty, mothers were encouraged to document metrics: height, weight, all the things we measure today at doctors’ visits. More recent books, whether those are physical or virtual, allow room for photos of sonograms, or hashtags. But all babybooks remain at heart an in-between document – part biography, part scrapbook; part data, part personal – that often says more about the chronicler than it does the chronicled. Take this mother in 1906, who wrote in one baby book from the archives: Five weeks have passed since I was born, Quite uneventful thus far each morn, But Today I go to Auntie I’s, A trip quite long for a girl my size. If my friend told me she’d been filling out a baby book in rhyming couplets five weeks post-partum, and from the POV of her baby, I’d scurry over with a magnum of wine and the phone number of my therapist. And no one – baby, mother, or century-removed observer – will ever care much about the fact that this baby visited her aunt at five weeks’ old. But the effort it must have taken! The love this mother must have felt, as she memorialized the monotony and wonder of the early days of parenthood – that’s what this entry is about. Only one friend of ours isn’t documenting her kids’ childhoods with emails or digital journal entries or iPhone notes. Her husband is fearful of big tech companies, rightly pointing out that he doesn’t want Google having a record of who his daughter is before she is of an age to understand and consent. I hear that. But I’m not sure raging against the machine in this particular way will protect my children from the ills of big tech, save for keeping secret that my daughter will be advertising target #1 for a new-to-market nose brush. As for how my millennial friends and I are evolving the practice of baby chronicling, my hope is that what the medium lacks in physicality, it makes up for in honesty. Photos are taken and preserved because they project some desirable image of the family. Metrics become irrelevant the moment they’re jotted down. Instead, these letters are time capsules, little intimate tidbits and clues of who my child will become, sent off to that future self, from who I once was. Johnson is often asked why people would ever give their beloved baby books away, such that they find their way to him. “Kids might not be that interested,” he said – underscoring that we parents write for us, even if we think we’re writing for them; that we leave behind a chronicle of our own lives, even as we think we’re leaving behind one of theirs. “I would hope that when you give these emails to your children, one thing they will be fascinated at is how interested you were in them.” My infant son has started to do something at bedtime. Right before I put him down, he’ll gaze up at me and start cooing, like a little dove, his eyes big and round in the dark. He’ll do it for a solid minute or so before exhaustion overpowers him, at which point he’ll stick his second finger in his mouth, turn his head to the side, and fall asleep. Years into the future, will he care that he once did this? Probably not. But I wrote a quick email to him about it this morning. Because yes, I’m interested, interested in every moment.

Tuesday briefing: Pressure on PM over latest No 10 lockdown party;2022-01-11T06:28:56Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: ‘No regard for the rules’ Good morning from me, Warren Murray, and welcome to your daily scene-setter. Boris Johnson has been accused of an “utterly outrageous” breach of lockdown rules after a leaked email showed one of his top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party. The police are investigating. The PM is believed to have attended the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 along with his then fiancee Carrie. At the time, social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place. An email by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, seen by ITV News, encouraged staff to “make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening”. Johnson will now come under huge pressure to explain how he was involved. A spokesperson declined to comment in light of a continuing inquiry into potential breaches of lockdown in Downing Street. No 10 did not deny this weekend that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, whom he married in May 2021, attended the event. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us … At the time this party took place, key workers on the frontline were working round the clock to keep us all safe, people suffered loneliness and loss in unimaginably tough circumstances.” With Conservative MPs again furious, Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, said Johnson “has no moral authority left, and as he won’t go – his Tory MPs have a duty to remove him from power.” * * * Push for five-day isolation – Boris Johnson has ordered officials to examine plans to cut Covid isolation to five days in England. Scientists have urged caution – Prof Peter Openshaw, from the government’s virus advisory group Nervtag, said it was a “reasonable” idea but he had not seen evidence to back such a change. Meanwhile experts have told our science correspondent Linda Geddes that we can’t rely on the popular notion that it’s in Covid-19’s own interests to become more mild over time. Once a virus has spread via a person, it no longer needs that person, and doesn’t care whether they get sick or die afterwards. Even as more and more people gain immunity, Sars-Cov-2 could still evolve again, worsening the situation. The good news is this becomes less likely the more of the world’s population is vaccinated – the fewer infected, the fewer chances for the virus to evolve. * * * Djokovic visa still on the line – The Australian Border Force is investigating whether Novak Djokovic incorrectly declared, in a form completed by an agent on his behalf, he had not travelled and would not do so for two weeks before his flight to Australia, in the latest twist in the tennis star’s visa cancellation saga. Social media posts seemingly show he was in Belgrade on Christmas Day before flying to Australia from Spain on 4 January. Despite winning back his visa in court, Djokovic’s fate may be determined by Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who has the power to cancel it again. That would likely be met with a fresh legal challenge from Djokovic, who is trying to remain in Melbourne long enough to play in the Australian Open where he is chasing a male record 21st grand slam singles title. * * * Lords watchdog receives Mone complaint – The House of Lords commissioners for standards are considering a complaint against the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, relating to the PPE business awarded £203m government contracts after she referred it to the Cabinet Office in May 2020. It comes after the Guardian reported that leaked files appear to suggest Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company, PPE Medpro.
After the company was awarded contracts in May and June 2020, Mone and Barrowman have consistently denied any “role or function” in PPE Medpro. Lawyers for Mone, who ran the lingerie company Ultimo before David Cameron made her a peer in 2015, have said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. Mone’s representatives declined to comment on the complaint. Mone’s lawyers have said the Guardian’s reporting is “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”. * * * Star jumps and porridge – Britain’s third-biggest energy supplier has apologised and said it was “embarrassed” after it advised customers to keep their heatings bills low by “having a cuddle with your pets”, eating “hearty bowls of porridge” and “doing a few star jumps”. MPs called the guidance from SSE Energy Services, part of Ovo, “insulting” and “offensive”. Millions of UK households are facing a “cost of living catastrophe” in the spring, including a rise in energy bills to as much as £2,000 a year on 1 April for an average household on a direct debit tariff. Labour will hope to pile pressure on Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson today with a binding vote in parliament on cutting VAT on home energy bills. Sunak, the chancellor, will attempt to quell Tory unrest over the cost of living as delegations of MPs press him to cancel a planned tax rise and ditch the VAT on energy bills in exchange for savings on tackling the pandemic. * * * Dying man gets pig heart – Doctors in the US have transplanted a genetically modified pig’s heart into a patient who did not qualify for a human donor heart. David Bennett, 57, was on Monday breathing on his own while still connected to a heart-lung machine to help his new heart. Surgeons used a heart from a pig that had undergone gene-editing to lessen the chance of organ rejection. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before the surgery at the University of Maryland medical centre in Baltimore. * * * Roman ruins on HS2 route – A wealthy Roman trading town has been discovered half a metre below the surface of a remote field in Northamptonshire. A 10-metre-wide Roman road, domestic and industrial buildings, more than 300 coins and at least four wells have been unearthed at the site, where 80 archaeologists have been working for the past 12 months.
The field is on the route of the HS2 rail network and one of the associated archaeological effort’s most significant findings to date. It is known as Blackgrounds after the dense black soil that has helped preserve the Roman remains, and was used for pasture until the archaeological dig began. An iron age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, stood on the site at the time of the Roman invasion in 43BC. It expanded during the period of the Roman occupation which lasted until AD410. Today in Focus podcast: Guantánamo, the endless prison The US jail in Cuba has been beset by allegations of torture since it was set up 20 years ago. But despite all the promises to close it down, it remains operational with no end in sight, says Julian Borger.
Lunchtime read: ‘Don’t plan it, just go’ The pandemic has left our best-laid plans in disarray, but we can still have spur-of-the-moment adventures, writes Amy Fleming.
Sport Steven Gerrard refused to blame a lengthy VAR call that led to an Aston Villa equaliser being ruled out for offside for his team’s elimination from the FA Cup by Manchester United last night, with the manager instead urging his team to “flip” the result when hosting them in the Premier League on Saturday. Villa lost the third-round tie at Old Trafford 1-0 having conceded Scott McTominay’s early header but then dominated throughout. United also rode their luck as Villa had two goals ruled out in the second half. Sam Billings, fresh from the Big Bash League, has answered a call-up to England’s Ashes squad for Friday’s fifth Test in Hobart, 90 minutes before his intended flight for the T20 team’s upcoming Caribbean tour. Fresh doubt has been cast on European fixtures involving English rugby clubs playing in France this week amid fears strict travel rules could wreak more havoc on the Champions and Challenge Cups. Newcastle are due to play in France on Friday, as are Bath and Sale at the weekend, and while the organisers, European Professional Club Rugby, said last week that all fixtures will go ahead as planned, the key stumbling block is that clubs must isolate for 48 hours upon arrival before their matches, according to current travel rules. Business Stocks across Asia have carried on the downward trajectory set by Europe and Wall Street yesterday as concerns about rate increases by the US Federal Reserve weighed on the minds of investors. The FTSE100 looks like opening up around 0.3%, however, with the pound on $1.359 and €1.198. The papers
A full roundup of today’s front pages can be found here – our usual summary follows. The normally pro-Boris Johnson Express blasts a full-throated warning in its splash headline: “Enough Boris! You MUST end ‘partygate’ farce now”. The Mail takes a similar line and says “Boris rocked by new party revelations”. Others are more scathing with the i picking up on a particularly galling line from the leaked email invitation to the gathering on 20 May. “‘Bring your own booze’”. Our Guardian front page uses the same line: “Fury as email reveals No 10 ‘bring your own booze’ lockdown party”.
The Mirror describes the email as “Invite to do what you like”, while the Metro goes with a play on words – “Downing it Street” – alongside a picture of Johnson quaffing a pint of beer. The coverage contrasts with that of the Times and Telegraph, neither of which choose to lead with the party revelations. The Times does have the story on its front page – “No10 celebrated ‘lovely weather’ with lockdown drinks party” – but leads on limits to sporting fixtures being eased. Ditto the Telegraph, which says “Johnson received invite to lockdown party” but leads on cabinet anger over misleading isolation guidance. Sign up

Novak Djokovic has become the whipping boy for Australia’s Covid fear and frustration | Natasha Cica;2022-01-11T01:11:38Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"The controversy surrounding the entry to Australia of Novak Djokovic for the Australian Open has been strange and wild. Since the Covid pandemic landed, Australia has positioned itself most extremely as a global outlier on border control. This has taken us to stranger legal places than most; stranger even than the migration law mashups that Tampa and 9/11 delivered some 20 years ago. What kind of democracy bans its own citizens from departing without specific approval by border control bureaucrats, never mind returning?
One human cost has been families, lovers and friends split across internal borders that nobody had much considered since we became a federation, instead of a cluster of British colonies, well over a century ago. And Australians have become strangely hardened to stories about so many people across our diaspora similarly forbidden to reunite, stranded everywhere from Bangladesh to Brussels and Beijing. I thought we’d hit a new nadir in October when a Covid-positive man from New South Wales escaped quarantine detention in then Covid-zero Tasmania. Most of my home state was sent into snap lockdown, and a song went viral on social media calling for the offender’s lynching and anal rape. Many perversely enjoyed that spectacle – and political leaders didn’t hose down the hysteria. The Djokovic case ratcheted these unhealthy dynamics to the next level. The Belgrade factor didn’t help – my inbox filled with hate speech I haven’t seen directed against any people from the former Yugoslavia since the 1990s Balkan wars. Should I spell out that Djokovic is as beloved to most Serbs as Ash Barty is to most Australians – connected with pride in celebrating the best side of our complex national identity and healing some painful history? No point, I pressed delete. Waves of anti-Novak abuse stormed ahead, including smart-arse memes that made our Tassie jingle look gentle. All clearly fuelled by Australian frustrations caused by almost two years of on/off/on again lockdowns, terrible anxiety about the current Covid spread and lack of testing access, and no real idea about what will happen next for health support, food supplies and income security. Because Djokovic – like no small number of elite athletes internationally – refuses to consent to vaccination against Covid, he fast became the whipping boy for all of it.
My love of tennis is only eclipsed by my fandom for the rule of law. Which doesn’t mean flinging around slogans like “rules are rules” then doing whatever plays to people’s basest instincts, politically and polemically. Within our nation and distinctive federation, the rule of law has been one of Australia’s better cultural assets, which is why so many people have emigrated here. I’m profoundly opposed to the way Australian governments since Tampa and 9/11 have demonised people legitimately seeking asylum, and locked them up in inhumane conditions – including the Park hotel in Melbourne, where Djokovic was detained, along with the Czech tennis player Renata Voracova, whose visa was also cancelled after the fact, and who left Australia on Saturday. I had quiet if anxious hopes that the federal court would step up in this profoundly important test case, which engages much bigger questions for Australians – including around the power dynamics between our executive and the judiciary – than anything about Djokovic and his plight. I wasn’t disappointed, despite the unforeseen difficulty of accessing the court’s livestreamed proceedings – mainly now available on YouTube, and way more interesting than Netflix. The mix of migration and administrative law in question – plus the “wriggly fish” of estoppel – is exceedingly complex, in a way few laypeople will appreciate, and that even most lawyers will struggle to understand.
The unsensational and impressive spectacle of Judge Anthony Kelly in dialogue with counsel was calm, clear and mutually respectful. I certainly welcomed the judge’s release order, which was based on the legally “unreasonable” treatment of Djokovic by Australian Border Force officials in the early hours of Serbian Christmas Eve, last Thursday. The power ball has now passed to Australia’s immigration minister, who lawfully can cancel Djokovic’s legitimatised visa. If he does – in the lead-up to a pivotal Australian election, where spin doctors may have assumed that playing an anti-Serb, anti-elite and aggressively denialist card amid this government’s failures to contain Covid would be an easy point to score – Djokovic will be best out of Australia.

Morning mail: Djokovic speaks out, US-Russia talks over Ukraine, decluttering made easy;2022-01-10T19:59:04Z;['Tamara Howie'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Novak Djokovic’s visa cancellation saga continues despite his return to centre court ahead of the Australian Open next week. But he’s not the only tennis star in doubt for the grand slam – Nick Kyrgios has tested positive for Covid. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine persist, but security talks between the Kremlin and the US are under way this week. Novak Djokovic has thanked Judge Anthony Kelly for overturning his visa cancellation, but still faces potential deportations from Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke. Hawke confirmed that he is considering the use of discretionary powers to deport Djokovic, which comes with a hefty three-year ban from re-entering Australia. His decision is expected this week. Meanwhile Djokovic’s family have criticised the Australian government and his mother said he was “subjected to torture and harassment” while in detention. But the family abruptly ended a press conference when questioned about why Djokovic, who is not vaccinated, was photographed in public last month without a mask after testing positive for Covid. The federal government was warned in November that widespread rapid antigen testing was needed to protect vulnerable people in aged care. There are currently Covid outbreaks in almost 500 aged care homes nationally, with 1,400 residents and 2,000 staff infected. Paul Sadler, chief executive of the peak body Aged & Community Services Australia, said that he believed the numbers were under-reported, and that providers were “running real risks” without the assistance of a testing regime. He said if they had rapid antigen tests available it would “make a significant impact in reducing the spread within the aged care homes and keeping people safe.” US and Russian diplomats have recently emerged from a day of negotiations in Geneva over the fate of Ukraine, describing the talks as “useful” and “very professional”, but stressing they had not made progress towards resolving fundamental disagreements. The two sides largely spent the day’s talks presenting their points of view on the situation in Ukraine, currently hemmed in by 100,000 Russian troops, and on European security in general, and deferred further debate to a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday between Russia and all Nato members. Australia
Leading Australian academics have criticised the federal government for the “political and shortsighted” decision to reject the Australian Research Council’s recommendations to fund six projects. An open letter and petition are calling on acting education minister, Stuart Robert, to reverse the decision. Labor has preselected Catherine Renshaw, a human rights lawyer, to run against Liberal moderate Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. The seat is currently held by Zimmerman by a margin of 9.3%, making it one of the Liberals’ safest. Australia food producers are pleading for more government help to cope with Covid disruptions as farm workers are hit by the virus. But rule changes this week will offer some relief with asymptomatic and Covid-negative staff cleared to return to work in Victoria. The world The EU’s police agency, Europol, will be forced to delete a vast store of personal data that it has been found to have amassed unlawfully by the bloc’s data protection watchdog. One of Boris Johnson’s top officials invited staff to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” during May of the first lockdown, a leaked email shows. The last seven years were the world’s hottest on record, with the first analysis of global temperature in 2021 showing it was 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. Fears are growing among experts about the rise of rightwing extremism in the US military and the potential threat it could pose to American democracy. Recommended reads
Our brains really like order, but often our pantries and fridges are a chaos of old herbs and expired condiments. Decluttering can reduce stress, and it need only be done one shelf at a time. “Just do one shelf in the fridge, then throw things out, clean it, put things back,” says Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond Business School. “And then once you have done the whole fridge, or the whole pantry, then you can say, OK, well, maybe I’ll reorganise what shelf everything goes on now that I’ve got more room.” “The Drones’ worst show ever was in York in England on 24 April 2007,” says founding member Gareth Liddiard. “All our equipment broke down. The gig ended with just me, playing through my amp which had somehow survived. I wrapped it up, went off and we went out the back to where the van was, and every window in the van had been smashed. Everything had been stolen. So we were like, for fuck’s sake! How much worse can it get?!” Hate doing the laundry? A few changes in what you wear, when you wear it and what you do once you’ve worn something can help reduce your time spent toiling over dirty clothes. “Thinking in terms of prevention is a good strategy,” says Kate Fletcher, professor at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion. She advises always wearing an apron while cooking; tucking trouser legs into socks to keep hems free from mud when you’re out walking; and wearing a singlet or undershirt beneath shirts and blouses so you only need to wash the bottom layer, not the outer garment.

De Rozario speaks to reporter Kieran Pender about her sometimes bumpy rise to wheelchair-racing fame and the power of the Paralympics as a vehicle for change.

 Novak Djokovic wins appeal in Australian visa row | First Thing;2022-01-10T11:05:05Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['N/A'];"Good morning. The world No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic will be immediately released from immigration detention in Australia, after the federal circuit court quashed a decision to cancel his visa. Alex Hawke, the Australian immigration minister, has said he is considering whether to use his power to cancel Djokovic’s visa. The decision now under consideration to would result in Djokovic being excluded from Australia for three years – significantly upping the stakes in a bizarre border row that threatens his quest to win the most grand slam singles titles of all time. Can Australia’s immigration minister really cancel his visa? Immigration law professor Mary Crock told Guardian Australia the Migration Act gave the minister “godlike powers” to cancel visas and if “they really decide to … the power is there”. But what about the judge’s decision? That doesn’t matter, as Crock explains: “Everything that has gone before can be disregarded – it is set up precisely for this situation, to come in and cancel a visa anyway.” Fire in Bronx building leaves 19 people dead, including nine children
Nineteen people including nine children were killed in an apartment fire in the Bronx in New York yesterday, one of the worst fire disasters in the city in 30 years. Thirteen people remained hospitalised in critical condition, authorities said late on Sunday afternoon. In all, more than five dozen were hurt. Eric Adams, the mayor who is in his first days in the job, said: “The numbers are horrific. This is a horrific, painful moment for the city of New York. The impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of pain and despair in our city. “This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times.” More than 200 firefighters fought the blaze, at a 120-unit, 19-storey building on East 181st Street known as Twin Parks. What caused the fire? Authorities said the fire was caused by a space heater in a duplex apartment. The fire commissioner, Dan Nigro, said the fire started shortly before 11am in a duplex on the second and third floors and spewed smoke through the building because a door was left open. Trump not immune from criminal referral for Capitol attack, lawmakers insist
Donald Trump cannot hide behind immunity from criminal prosecution and faces the possibility of being debarred from running for public office over his role in the Capitol attack, several members of Congress said yesterday. Days after the anniversary of the 6 January insurrection that left five people dead and scores injured after Trump supporters attempted to scupper the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, the threat of possible criminal proceedings looms large over the former president. Lawmakers from both main parties, including moderate Republicans, said yesterday that Trump would not be spared criminal liability should evidence emerge that he actively coordinated the attack. Republican senator Mike Rounds from South Dakota spoke on the topic. What did he say? He told ABC’s This Week that any immunity from prosecution that Trump enjoyed while in the White House evaporated on 20 January 2021, when he left office, saying the “shield of the presidency does not exist for someone who was a former president”. Golden Globes: The Power of the Dog and Succession triumph
The Power of the Dog and Succession were the big winners at an unusual, stripped-back Golden Globes. Traditionally, the ceremony is a glitzy telecast with A-listers in attendance but after a year of controversies surrounding diversity and amoral practices, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association lost its footing in the industry, with publicity firms, studios and celebrities choosing to distance themselves. Nevertheless, the awards were still handed out. The acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog was named best motion picture – drama, while Jane Campion became the third woman to win best director. Kodi Smit-McPhee won best supporting actor for his performance in the film. On the television side, HBO’s hit drama Succession picked up awards for best drama, best actor for Jeremy Strong and best supporting actress for Sarah Snook. Who attended the ceremony? Sunday night’s event took place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, with no stars or audience, and just select members and grantees. Results were announced via social media. In other news …

Don’t miss this: Bernie Sanders says Democrats are failing
Senator Bernie Sanders has called on Democrats to make “a major course correction” that focuses on fighting for America’s working class and standing up to powerful corporate interests because the Democrats’ legislative agenda is stalled and their party faces tough prospects in this November’s elections.

Planet-heating emissions roared back in the United States in 2021, dashing hopes that the pandemic would prove a watershed moment in greening American society to address the climate crisis, new figures have shown. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions, spurring predictions that a newly shaped American economy would emerge to help banish the era of fossil fuels. These forecasts may well have been baseless, however, with the new research showing that US emissions rose by 6.2% last year, compared with 2020.

Monday briefing: Novak Djokovic in visa court victory;2022-01-10T06:33:25Z;['Martin Farrer'];['N/A'];"Top story: what more could he have done, asks judge Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Novak Djokovic has just won his legal battle to enter Australia and defend his Open tennis title after a judge quashed the government’s decision to cancel the player’s visa when he arrived in the country last week. After a dramatic day of legal argument in the federal circuit court in Melbourne, Judge Anthony Kelly also ordered the government to pay the player’s costs, and for Djokovic to be released from the detention hotel where he has languished since last Wednesday. You can read the latest reaction and how the day unfolded at our live blog. The world No 1 men’s player was denied entry to Australia last week amid confusion over the validity of a Covid vaccine exemption granted by Tennis Australia. After hearing arguments from the player’s lawyers earlier today, Kelly queried “what more” the player could have done to prove his medical exemption given that it was provided by a qualified physician and backed up by an independent Victorian government panel. Kelly also criticised the Australian government for reneging on a deal to give Djokovic more time to defend his visa from cancellation. The judge’s ruling means Djokovic will meet tomorrow’s deadline to enter the tournament he has already won nine times. * * * Cladding call – Michael Gove must spend billions more on fireproofing homes across England, campaigners will say today, as they warn that his £4bn move to replace all Grenfell-style cladding does not address other risks facing leaseholders in tower blocks. People living in unsafe properties have been landed with bills of up to £200,000, and campaigners say residents may still have to stump up to fix defective fire doors, flammable balconies and missing firebreaks. Under Gove’s plan, which aims to force developers to pay the £4bn bill but could require funds to be diverted from existing government budgets, only cladding remediation costs will be covered. Campaigners want a change to the law to protect them from all costs caused by fire safety defects that were not their fault. It comes as 19 people died in a fire in a tower in New York in one of the city’s worst fire disasters in recent times. * * * Vaccine push – The UK government is urging all pregnant women to get vaccinated with their first, second or third shots as it highlights the Covid-19 risks to mothers and babies. One study showed that 96.3% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptoms between May and October were unvaccinated. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, called for the UK to show the rest of the world how to move from pandemic to endemic Covid, and suggested it would be helpful to cut the isolation period to five days to ease workforce shortages. But there are still deep divisions in the scientific community about what “living with Covid” could entail. * * * Power play – Ed Miliband says it “beggars belief” that the government is opposing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies on the grounds that they are struggling, after Labour proposed a £1.2bn levy on producers to help households and businesses with soaring bills. As the political battle builds around cost-of-living issues, the shadow climate secretary said ministers’ rejection of the idea showed they were “weak and incompetent”. With more dependency on renewable power, the UK will need more storage solutions – here are four new technologies that could help pave the way. * * *
Dog day – The Power of the Dog and Succession were the big winners at the Golden Globes, which went ahead in Los Angeles overnight with no stars or audience after years of controversy over diversity led to a boycott by celebrities. The acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog was named best picture in the drama category, while Jane Campion became the third woman to win best director. Will Smith was named best actor in a drama for King Richard, while Nicole Kidman won best actress in a drama for Being the Ricardos. Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story dominated the musical/comedy categories, while on the television side, HBO’s Succession won best drama, best actor for Jeremy Strong and best supporting actress for Sarah Snook. * * * Here be dragons – A gigantic prehistoric “sea dragon” discovered in the Midlands has been described as one of the Britain’s greatest ever fossil finds. The ichthyosaur, which is about 180m years old and around 10 metres long, is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind ever found in the UK. The skeleton was found during a routine draining of a lagoon island at the Rutland Water reservoir in February 2021. Today in Focus podcast Damien Gayle talks about what the case of the Colston Four means for future protests and one of the defendants, Sage Willoughby, describes the jubilant moment the verdict arrived.

Meet the gender equality advocate engineering change with an MBA;2022-01-10T03:42:42Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Jessica Kahl has championed gender equality since she was an undergraduate. Studying for an MBA gave her the tools and knowledge to build a brighter future for women in her field. Jessica Kahl has been finding solutions to complex problems for as long as she can remember. But she didn’t realise her childhood interests held clues to her future path. Kahl is a chartered engineer turned corporate strategist, and the founder of Dream Big Australia, a not-for-profit that champions gender equality in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM). But when she was growing up in Rockhampton, in regional Queensland, an engineering career felt like a distant prospect. “I was always entrepreneurial as a kid, making things and tinkering,” she says. “But there was no engagement, no aspiration about what women should do. I was in maths class and had just finished an equation and one of my friends said: ‘Why don’t you do engineering?’ “Looking back now, it feels unreal that as a young girl, you would not know what engineering is. I didn’t do maths, physics or graphics, which are the recommended subjects. There were a lot of barriers that deter people before you even step into a career.”
When Kahl enrolled to study civil engineering she was enthralled. However, as a woman from regional Queensland, the only female graduate in her university cohort, and a practitioner in the civil engineering industry, Kahl experienced the barriers faced by women in significantly male-dominated industries. The impact of dealing with inappropriate behaviour helped her understand that the opportunities for women to speak out were limited, and importantly how this undermined educational and professional success. Kahl started visiting schools in her first year at university to showcase projects in which she was involved. Fuelled by a passion to make engineering appealing to ambitious young women like herself, in 2015 she founded Dream Big Australia. She believes the acronym STEM, which has been in use since the 1990s, can foster a masculine culture. It also fails to make space for essential attributes such as imaginative thinking and the ability to connect with other people. At Dream Big, she added an ‘A’ for arts. The power of this move came to light at Australia’s first STEAM Day, in 2019, and attracted an audience that was 100% female. “By putting the ‘A’ into STEM and calling it STEAM, we made it more inclusive,” she says. “We found that women who are attracted to the fields need permission to express their creativity.” Kahl says STEAM is also about equipping the next generation of engineers with skills for the future. “[The future] will be all about digitisation, automation, predictive maintenance,” she says. “But the one thing you can’t replace is empathy, which is highly correlated to the arts, hence adding the A.” At Dream Big, which has hosted more than 25 events across regional centres such as Gladstone, Bundaberg and Mackay, preparing for the future isn’t just about changing the language. It’s also about cultivating confidence in young women by pairing them with industry mentors and experts through programs aimed at female university students, such as STEAM Ahead.
“STEAM Ahead provides value, not just to women and their development but to the industry – it’s also about [building] a sustainable talent pipeline,” Kahl says. “We want organisations to come on this journey with us.” For Kahl, who in July started in a new role as a corporate strategy manager at Thames Water in London, after working for as a project manager and strategy lead at the Queensland government-owned water service provider, Sunwater, the art of dreaming big is also about gaining the knowledge and insights to live her values. In 2020, she took a pivotal step in this direction when she won a responsible leadership scholarship to undertake a master of business administration (MBA) at Griffith University. According to the 2022 Global International Student Survey, 56% of students say quality teaching is one of the most important factors they consider when choosing where to study. Kahl appreciates not only Griffith’s high-quality teaching, but the range of perspectives to which she’s been exposed, thanks to an intellectual diversity that fosters innovation and creative spark. “The people in the MBA that you connect with, it’s like being at the United Nations,” she says. “There are so many wonderful thoughts and ideas and engaging conversations that inspire you to step up.” It’s also helped her look beyond conventional business wisdom, thanks to a community-based leadership lens that has been foundational to her work. “[We learn] how to create circular and ecocentric economies,” she says. “A lot of organisations talk about playing to win – but is this the same as making an impact? [If you’re playing to win], you can end up doing things that don’t progress the organisation in the right direction.” Ultimately, she says, her MBA is giving her the knowledge to realise her purpose, which is shaped by a deep commitment to making engineering more equitable and attracting talented women who will go on to enrich the field. “The Griffith MBA has been rewarding and tangibly practical,” says Kahl, who expanded Dream Big Australia nationally in 2022, and was nominated for the 2021 Young Australian of the Year award. “One of my proudest moments is seeing women who had been through the STEAM Ahead program – a number of them were interviewed by industry partners and two of them got hired. It is living our vision, creating stepping stones. The MBA is real life. It is backed up by theory. You execute it and you get results.” Learn more about an MBA at Griffith University and live your values.";https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-university-good-business/2022/jan/10/meet-the-gender-equality-advocate-engineering-change-with-an-mba;Category-2: business and economy

"Morning mail: Djokovic’s day in court; Queensland floods; tutu debate";2022-01-09T19:59:56Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Good morning. A bid to delay Novak Djokovic’s visa hearing has been rejected. Federal and state governments scramble as Covid cases spike. A momentous week of diplomacy gets under way in Europe as Ukraine’s fate hangs in the balance. A bid by the Morrison government to delay Novak Djokovic’s visa hearing by two days has been rejected by the federal circuit court. In an order, published on Sunday, judge Anthony Kelly rejected the move which would have delayed the hearing until Wednesday – after Tennis Australia’s stated deadline to include the world No 1 in the Australian Open draw. But legal experts have warned even with the hearing proceeding on Monday, there is no guarantee Djokovic could secure a court order restoring his visa in time to play. The Serbian star could also face his visa being revoked again on fresh grounds. Omicron cases are spiking across Australia. On Sunday, New South Wales reported its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic with 16 deaths in the preceding 24 hours – eclipsing the highest daily totals of the Delta wave. Eight men and eight women in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s died. Federal and state governments are taking dramatic measures to cope. In both Queensland and NSW, new rules allow people with Covid-19 to leave isolation to work if their job is critical for food supply or emergency services. In Queensland, the start of the school year has been delayed by two weeks, the state government has announced. Meanwhile, federal health officials revealed isolation rules may soon change nationwide due to case numbers spiking. A momentous week of diplomacy is about to get under way in Europe, with the fate of Ukraine, hemmed in by 100,000 Russian troops, hanging in the balance. Senior diplomats from the United States and Russia will meet in Geneva to discuss Moscow’s demands, set out last month in two draft treaties, one with the US and one with Nato. Much of their content is unacceptable to Washington and the alliance, most importantly a pledge that Ukraine will never be a Nato member. Australia

Biden denounces Trump a year on from Capitol attack | First Thing;2022-01-07T10:50:55Z;['Clea Skopeliti'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Joe Biden marked the anniversary of the Capitol attack with his strongest denunciation yet of his predecessor, accusing Donald Trump and his allies of placing a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”. Condemning Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election as a “failed” pursuit, Biden underlined that the insurrection continues to endanger American democracy as the lies that led to the violence persist. In a show of just how divided Washington remains, there were only two Republicans on the floor of the House of Representatives when the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, presided over a moment of silence: the former vice-president Dick Cheney and his daughter, the congresswoman Liz Cheney. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who was in Georgia for the funeral of a former colleague, issued a statement calling the attack “antithetical to the rule of law”. The potential for a future stolen election is higher than ever, Sam Levine warns in his analysis of the continuing machinations. Since the insurrection, Republicans have powered ahead with efforts to undermine the processes of election administration and vote counting. The forceful denunciation “cannot have been easy” for Biden, who favours bipartisanship and ran on a platform of national unity, writes David Smith in his analysis. It shows that Biden understands the “threat must be looked squarely in the eye”. What did Trump say? He had planned to hold a news conference from Mar-a-Lago, but canceled under pressure from conservative allies. Nevertheless, he issued a series of statements maintaining the “big lie”. Real number of Covid deaths US likely undercounted
The true number of people lost to Covid in the US is likely to be higher than the official figure, experts have said, owing to the virus’s long-term effects and other fatal complications that have risen since the pandemic began. Since February 2020, there have been an estimated 942,431 excess deaths in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with Hispanic, Black and Native American and Alaska Native populations disproportionately affected. But the CEO of insurance company OneAmerica, J Scott Davison, said the real death toll was likely to be higher, as the deaths that happen months after infection are not included in the figure. He said death rates among working-age people were up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic. What else has contributed to climbing death rates? Drug overdoses and homicides have also risen during the pandemic. Why are long Covid deaths difficult to tally? In some patients, the virus weakens organs or leads to new ailments – but may no longer be present at the time of death. Thousands detained in Kazakhstan as president says order mostly restored
Order has mostly been restored in Kazakhstan, president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has claimed following days of protest during which more than 3,000 people have been detained and 26 killed, according to interior ministry figures. In an address on Friday morning, he said he had personally given orders to open fire with lethal force against protesters he called “bandits and terrorists”. The apparent end to the unrest comes a day after Russia sent “peacekeeping forces” numbering about 2,500 into Kazakhstan. Witnesses in the country’s largest city, Almaty, described chaotic scenes on Thursday, with government buildings stormed and torched. However, many said the protests – triggered by a spike in fuel prices as well as longstanding political and economic dissatisfaction – had started peacefully earlier in the week, before tipping into violence following the government’s crackdown. Why did Russia intervene? The Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) deployed troops within hours of Tokayev’s appeal. The move has been divisive, with some in Russia praising the action while other have compared it to the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact interventions. In other news …

Friday briefing: PM faces fresh corruption claim;2022-01-07T06:31:41Z;['Warren Murray'];['N/A'];"Top story: ‘Get Lulu to call me and we’ll get it sorted ASAP!’ Hello, Warren Murray returning to you with Friday’s briefing. Other briefings may be available – but why take the risk? Boris Johnson has been accused of potential corruption by Labour as it emerged he sought funds for his flat refurbishment from a Conservative donor while promising to consider plans for a “great exhibition”. WhatsApp messages with the Tory peer David Brownlow show Johnson called parts of his Downing Street residence a “tip” and asked for “approvals” so his decor designer, Lulu Lytle, could “get on with it” in November 2020. He signed off the message by saying: “Ps am on the great exhibition plan Will revert.” Lord Brownlow replied: “Of course, get Lulu to call me and we’ll get it sorted ASAP! Thanks for thinking about GE2.” Plans for a “Great Exhibition 2.0” were discussed by Brownlow and the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, weeks after the WhatsApp exchanges, official records show. On Thursday, Johnson was forced to make a “humble and sincere” apology for the texts not being given to his independent ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, during an initial inquiry last spring. Johnson said he had not remembered them and did not have access to his phone due to “security issues” – thought to relate to when his mobile number was discovered online. In thinly veiled frustration, Geidt said the saga “shook my confidence” and added that if he had seen the evidence when writing his first report, he may not have ruled that Johnson tried to make the correct declaration and seek advice at the first opportunity. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said it appeared Brownlow had access to Johnson and Dowden “because he was paying” for the refurbishments. She said if true, it would constitute “corruption, plain and simple … No one should be able to buy access or exchange wallpaper for festivals”. The WhatsApp messages were published as part of letters exchanged by Johnson and Geidt. For a second time, Geidt found the prime minister did not break the ministerial code over payments for the Downing Street flat refurbishment, but Johnson was criticised for acting “unwisely”. No 10 denied there was anything untoward about Brownlow’s meeting with Dowden and stressed the peer had acted with integrity since first being approached to chair the Downing Street trust. Brownlow was contacted for comment. * * * Kazakhstan roils – Dozens of protesters and at least 12 police have died in the violence in Kazakhstan, authorities have said, as demonstrators said peaceful protests over fuel price rises had turned violent after a heavy-handed government response. “Peacekeepers” led by Russia have arrived in the country at the request of president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who declared a state of emergency and accepted the resignation of the government. Ahead of a national address today, Tokayev is claiming this morning that constitutional order has largely been restored.
Witnesses in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, described scenes of chaos on Thursday, with government buildings being stormed or set on fire and widespread looting. The interior ministry said 2,298 people had been arrested during the unrest, while the police spokesperson Saltanat Azirbek told the state news channel Khabar-24 that “dozens of attackers were liquidated”. Video footage showed violent clashes between protesters and authorities in a number of cities. * * * ‘The lies have not abated’ – One year after the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, Joe Biden has denounced Donald Trump for spreading a “web of lies” about the legitimacy of the 2020 election and holding a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”. Biden called Trump a “defeated former president” whose “bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or constitution … For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. But they failed.” Biden asked Americans to recommit to the protection of the nation’s 200-year-old system of government. “The lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.”
The Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called the attack “antithetical to the rule of law” and said he supported efforts to hold perpetrators accountable. But he did not denounce Trump, as he and many Republicans did in the aftermath of the attack. Presiding over the House floor on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that democracy had prevailed when members returned to the Capitol after the riot to ratify Biden’s electoral victory. “The Congress, because of the courage of all of you, rose to honour our oath and protect our democracy,” she said, before leading members – all of them Democrats, with the exception of congresswoman Liz Cheney – in a moment of silence. * * * School scramble for fill-in staff – Schools in England are “teetering on the edge” with more than a third (36%) struggling with staff absence rates in excess of 10%, according to a snap poll by a headteachers’ union. Some heads had more than 20% of their teaching staff absent on the first day of term for Covid-related reasons. In some schools, heads have had to send classes or year groups home for online learning, or combine classes or year groups. More than a third (37%) needing supply teachers were unable to obtain them. Elsewhere, there have been reports of resistance among some pupils to masks and lateral flow testing. More Covid news from home and abroad at our live blog. * * * Final shutdown – The Hunterston B nuclear power station in Scotland will shut down for ever at noon today after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing. It lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date. About 20% of Britain’s supply comes from 15 reactors, and almost half of this capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. EDF is due to finish its new 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C by 2027, with the first of its two reactors coming online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association estimates the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. * * * Don’t choke on your cereal – The bosses of Britain’s biggest companies will have made more money in 2022 by breakfast time today than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else.

Thursday briefing: Djokovic told ‘rules are rules’ in vaccine row;2022-01-06T06:26:21Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Top story: Anger in Serbia at ‘harassment’ of player Good morning, I’m Virginia Harrison and here are our top stories this Thursday. An extraordinary battle has broken out at the Australian border after tennis star Novak Djokovic was denied entry to the country for failing to meet strict Covid vaccination rules. The world No 1, who was due to play in the Australian Open, has launched a court battle amid a spiralling outcry over a controversial “medical exemption” agreed by the tournament’s organisers. The Serbian player is awaiting his fate in a Melbourne quarantine hotel as he mounts a legal challenge against Australia’s decision to cancel his visa. The move has sparked diplomatic fallout, with Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vučić accusing Australia of “maltreatment”. “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately,” he said in a statement. The star’s father, Srdjan, had strong words for the world, telling Russian media: “Tonight they can throw him in a dungeon, tomorrow they can put him in chains. The truth is he is like water and water paves its own path. Novak is the Spartacus of the new world which won’t tolerate injustice, colonialism and hypocrisy.” The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed pleas to reconsider the move, saying “rules are rules, and there are no special cases.” He added: “People are welcome in Australia, but if they’re not double vaccinated and not an Australian resident, you can’t come.” Djokovic, who is no stranger to controversy and bad behaviour, has become something of a flashpoint among the Australian public over the sense that different sets of rules apply to powerful or famous people. You can read our explainer on how the Djokovic drama unfolded here. * * * Covid staffing crisis – Millions of patients will suffer worsening quality of care unless ministers take immediate action to alleviate the staffing crisis engulfing the NHS, health chiefs have warned. The NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, has called for a range of new measures to be implemented in the NHS in England to help overstretched hospitals and struggling ambulance, mental health, community, GP and social care services cope with “widespread” shortages of medics and health workers. The measures include deploying tens of thousands of medical students on to wards and other healthcare settings, priority access for NHS and social care staff to lateral flow and PCR tests and a review of self-isolation periods to see if it can be slashed from 10 days to five. The warning is the latest in a deepening staffing crisis across the healthcare system driven by the Omicron wave. You can read all our coronavirus coverage here or listen to this podcast on why so many people are getting reinfected with Covid. * * * Colston Four – Anti-racism campaigners have hailed a jury’s decision to clear protesters responsible for toppling a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston as a huge step in getting the UK to face up to its colonial past. As Rajeev Syal writes, the acquittal of the Colston Four will prompt close scrutiny of the actions of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who became personally involved in ensuring that they were pursued through the criminal justice system. Hours after the statue of the slave trader was toppled on 7 June 2020, Patel appeared on Sky News to demand that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”. Two days later, it emerged that she had also called Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, to demand an explanation. Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for north-west England, told the Guardian: “We have a tripartite regime for a reason and that is so that politicians do not get involved in the operational decisions taken by the police. It may be that she has overstepped the boundaries of that arrangement.” As of Wednesday night, Patel had not released a statement commenting on the trial verdict. The acquittal is the latest in a series of cases in which juries have cleared protesters despite there being no question of their having carried out the actions for which they were tried. Here are some other recent examples. * * * Cost of living - Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Rishi Sunak to reconsider impending tax rises as the chancellor and the prime minister came under sustained fire from Conservative MPs to tackle rising costs of living. Ministers are examining further targeted measures to mitigate soaring energy costs for vulnerable households including potentially extending the warm homes discount – but are set to reject a VAT cut. During a cabinet debate on Wednesday, Rees-Mogg is understood to have suggested the chancellor ditch the impending 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance to ease the squeeze. * * * ‘No more talk’ – One of the only black female QCs in England and Wales has said the time has come for action on tackling race inequality in the legal profession. Barbara Mills, who is co-chair of the Bar Council’s race working group, said the next 12 months would be “critical” to tackling systemic obstacles at the bar. A landmark Race at the Bar report found there were just five black female QCs – senior barristers, also known as silks – in England and Wales (another two were announced last month). Another stark statistic: a black female junior barrister with the same level of experience as a white male junior billed £18,700 a year less on average, and an Asian woman £16,400 less. Mills said: “… [what] our brown and black colleagues are expecting is a sense, a feeling of visibility, that it’s changing – no more talk, just change it.” * * * ‘I kept saying – don’t worry Luma, we see you’ – Oscar-winning director Andrea Arnold has revealed what four years spent filming a cow taught her about life. Her new documentary, Cow, explores warmth, joy and anger through the eyes of a farmyard animal, and consists of 94 minutes of moos, with the odd off-camera interjection from farmhands.

Ambulance staff are used to being treated as Uber drivers but it’s never been this absurd | Sydney paramedic;2022-01-05T16:30:38Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"When Omicron crept in paramedics shrugged off reports it was a mild strain. We knew chaos was coming. New South Wales stats have confirmed our entrenched pessimism; the past four weeks have been the busiest in the 126-year history of the NSW Ambulance service. The health minister and premier have issued pleas to the public to stop making unnecessary calls. NSW Ambulance is about to launch a “save 000 for emergencies campaign” to help battle the 50% increase in callouts.
Inspector Kay Armstrong addressed the record-breaking increase in demand by warning “we have a lot of exhausted paramedics out there” due to time-wasting calls. In the last four days I’ve been called out to countless people asking for rapid tests, or wanting our opinion on the best testing sites. One man who couldn’t find a test said he was feeling too sick to line up for five hours. He requested we take him to hospital as he’d heard they routinely test all presentations. Once tested he planned to leave hospital and get a lift home with his son, who’d follow in the car behind. I politely informed him he was abusing an already overburdened system. We’re used to people using us as Uber drivers but it’s never been this absurd. The testing bungle, and the refusal by the Morrison government to subsidise rapid antigen tests, means people are turning from anxious to desperate to know if they’re positive – even if it doesn’t change their isolation requirements. Sometimes our patients greet us with complaints about wait times followed by a look of surprise and fear when we tell them they’re not sick enough to transport to hospital. I never imagined when I joined this job that I’d be telling people who genuinely believe they are dying that they are perfectly fine to look after themselves at home.
Moreover, every patient we leave at home puts us at risk of personal liability as paramedics are now registered with AHPRA – the national health regulator – but it’s a risk we shoulder to reduce pressure on a health system on the brink of collapse. While it’s great to inform the public about saving 000 for emergencies, simply calling it “time wasting” does not adequately represent the toll taken on us. Every callout requires a thorough assessment and extensive, detailed paperwork. You can’t just type “time waster” on your paperwork and move on. Our energy and empathy are being exhausted; we’re suffering compassion fatigue. You may get a grumpy ambo at your door who has nothing left to give but don’t take it personally – that’s how we turn up at our own doorsteps. Just ask our families. Last outbreak the biggest gripe was this excruciating but necessary PPE. This time around our concerns are far more insidious. Calling it burnout would be putting it mildly, this now feels like a slow roasting. We didn’t join the job for fame or fortune but the fact that we had to fight the NSW government’s proposed pay freeze while fronting a pandemic only added to the feeling our personal sacrifice isn’t understood or appreciated. No other industry would expect their workers to accept a doubling of their workload on top of a massive broadening of scope, responsibility and risk without appropriate remuneration. Paramedics are compliant, we keep our heads down and silently get on with the job, because we know speaking out could cost us our job. If frontline health staff spoke out it would fill the void of misinformation created when government messaging contradicts health advice. We’re the ones caught in the middle, we’re living this. We are the everyday experts who are resigned to fate, now too busy looking for an escape to care too much about anything else. I don’t know one person at work who isn’t formulating some sort of exit plan by leaving Sydney, leaving their role or leaving the job altogether.
This is true of brand-new trainees right through to management. We’re all re-evaluating. Talking to colleagues in the hospital, the same can be said for doctors, nurses, clerical and cleaning staff. Hardly a system coping, Mr Perrottet. My annual leave has been postponed twice, I need a break. The fulfilment and pride I used to feel simply by making someone feel better is fading. I still do my best to show warmth and compassion but while I smile with my eyes, under the mask I’m limp. I’m torn between the job I love and the overwhelming urge to make a hasty exit. We are standing at the precipice of a mass exodus of paramedics who are willing to turn their backs on their calling. The loss of the most impressive, highly skilled and pre-eminent bunch of people I’ve ever met would take a toll on this state which no announcement about boosting paramedic numbers could ever replace; the human toll.

Wednesday briefing: care homes declare staffing red alerts;2022-01-05T06:22:05Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Top story: PM admits parts of NHS may be overwhelmed Good morning, I’m Virginia Harrison and here is what’s making news this Wednesday morning. Care operators are facing acute staffing shortages caused by the Omicron variant with more than 90 declaring a “red alert”, meaning staffing ratios have been breached. More than 11,000 care home workers are off for Covid reasons, according to internal health system staffing data seen by the Guardian. Government data shows that 9.4% of care home staff are off work across England, with close to 3% absent because of Covid. The figures, which may be an underestimate because of the festive break, are drawn from submissions by thousands of care providers. The worst-affected areas appear to be in the north-east, north-west and parts of London. As Robert Booth reports, many care operators say delays in getting PCR test results back were a key frustration, meaning workers who may not be infected were isolating longer than necessary. The extent of the strain in care homes comes as Boris Johnson admitted for the first time that parts of the NHS may be overwhelmed in the coming weeks and insisted England can “ride out” its biggest ever Covid wave “without shutting down our country once again”. With frontline worker absences fuelled by a record 218,000 new confirmed UK cases of Covid on Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical adviser, said the NHS faced “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” – though there was not yet a “surge in mortality” seen with other waves by this stage. You can find all our coronavirus coverage here or follow live updates here. * * * No 10 party pooper – The new head of an investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties has not “started from scratch” and is unlikely to re-interview all government staff who have already been spoken to about their knowledge of the gatherings, the Guardian has been told. Sources said that Sue Gray, who took over the probe after cabinet secretary Simon Case recused himself when a Christmas event in his own office was revealed, would more likely “pick up” the existing work and look for “holes” in the testimony provided so far. Gray’s attention will also have to turn to more gatherings that have come to light since the initial probe led by Case began, including an event revealed by the Guardian attended by Johnson, his wife and 17 others. Gray’s inquiry is expected to take several more weeks and will be made public. Here’s Aubrey Allegretti’s full report. * * * Mail to pay Meghan £1 – The Mail on Sunday will pay the Duchess of Sussex just £1 in damages for invading her privacy by publishing a private letter she had sent to her father. The nominal sum is set out in court documents that also formally confirm that the newspaper – and its sister website MailOnline – has accepted defeat and will not be taking the long-running case to a supreme court appeal. The outlet will also pay an unspecified sum for the separate case of infringing Meghan’s copyright by publishing large chunks of the letter. The duchess had always said that her three-year legal battle against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, was more about principles than money. * * * Early cancer detection hopes – Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue. If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation.

Dr Kirsty Squires, of Staffordshire University, will head a first attempt to tell the stories of some of the 163 children whose remains lie within the corridors and crypts of the famous underground tomb. The catacombs contain 1,284 mummified and skeletonised bodies, the largest collection of mummies in Europe. While many of the children contained there are now skeletal, others have been described as appearing as if they are sleeping. The two-year investigation will focus on the children who died between 1787 and 1880 and, initially, on 41 bodies residing within a bespoke “child chapel”. * * * Today in Focus podcast: Can the UK cope with the Omicron surge?

Thomas Tuchel will fine Romelu Lukaku despite accepting the striker’s apology for a controversial interview and has said he faced no opposition from Chelsea’s board after dropping the club’s record signing against Liverpool. There was a fierce backlash to the news World No 1 Novak Djokovic has been granted a medical exemption to compete in the Australian Open without being vaccinated against Covid-19. All Australian Open participants must either be fully vaccinated or apply for and secure an exemption in order to enter Victoria without undertaking the mandatory 14-day quarantine. Public reaction to the news of Djokovic’s exemption was overwhelmingly hostile. Among those speaking out was Stephen Parnis, a former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, who described the decision as appalling. “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in,” Parnis tweeted.

Morning mail: Djokovic’s Australian Open exemption, NSW hospital staff struggling, marine heatwave;2022-01-04T19:47:51Z;['Tamara Howie'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Weeks of speculation about Novak Djokovic’s involvement in the Australia Open have come to an end after the world No 1 last night revealed he has a medical exemption to get around Melbourne’s strict quarantine rules. Meanwhile, more hospital staff in NSW speak out about the pressure of staff shortages and record Covid infections. Djokovic is on his way to Melbourne to defend his Australian Open title after he refused to divulge his Covid vaccination status. Australian Open organisers confirmed he had received a medical exemption and said two panels of experts had reviewed the case. The Australian Technical Advisory Group allows exemptions for reasons including acute major medical conditions to any serious adverse effect from previous doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The reason for Djokovic’s exemption is unclear and has garnered mixed responses from his peers. Hospitals workers in NSW have vented their anger at being left on the frontline with seriously depleted levels of staffing amid a major surge in Covid cases. “The light at the end of a tunnel is a fricking train at the moment,” said Gil Wilson, a senior nurse at the Lismore Base hospital. “We can’t see an end to this.” NSW set another record of new infections, with 23,131 cases reported yesterday and a 28% positivity rate. Scott Morrison continues to face criticism for a decision not to provide free rapid antigen tests, so what are other countries doing? Many have free and widely available tests and price caps for private sales in other countries – very different approaches to Australia’s policy of leaving the tests to the “private market”. Prince Andrew’s lawyers have fought to dismiss Virginia Giuffre’s civil lawsuit against the royal a day after the unsealing of a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, questioned lawyers for Andrew closely over their claim that the settlement means Giuffre’s lawsuit should be dismissed. He also promised “a decision pretty soon”. Australia

Angus and Julia Stone came on to the Australian music scene as a duo in 2006 and, while they still make music together, they have both forged solo music careers. Angus makes blissed-out rock as Dope Lemon and releases his third album this week, titled Rose Pink Cadillac. Essential to every record Angus makes is a particular guitar: a 1960s Telecaster given to him by his father. Stone tells us about that “holy grail” instrument, as well as the story of what he would save from a fire and the item he regrets losing most. Over the past two years something shifted in many Australian families. For some the upheaval meant not just stress but slowing down, getting closer and becoming more adaptable. “The pandemic reset the importance of just being able to spend time with your children,” says Nick Tebbey, national executive officer of Relationships Australia. “People drew real strength from that, and were almost surprised by how much they enjoyed their time together.” On the evening of Sunday 5 January 1975, the bulk carrier Lake Illawarra travelled down the Derwent River in Hobart and missed the main navigation challenge under the Tasman Bridge. It brought down two piers and caused more than 100 metres of road to collapse 45 metres into the river below, along with four cars that drove over the gap. Twelve people died, and casualties would have been much higher had it not been a quiet Sunday evening in the new year holiday period.

Tuesday briefing: Giuffre-Epstein settlement released;2022-01-04T06:33:00Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Top story: Prince Andrew civil case hearing looms Hello, I’m Virginia Harrison and here is your first morning briefing for 2022. A 2009 legal settlement between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender whom she accused of sexual abuse, has been released. The settlement was made public on Monday as part of Giuffre’s 2021 civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, whom she accuses of sexually abusing her two decades ago when she was 17. Lawyers for the prince contend that a release clause in the settlement restricts her ability to sue others connected to Epstein. The documents also showed she would be paid $500,000 as part of the settlement of her case against Epstein. The prince – who vehemently denies the allegations made by Giuffre and is not mentioned in the 2009 settlement – has said that the deal shields him from any liability. Lawyers for the prince contend the settlement contains provisions that bar Giuffre from taking legal action against many Epstein associates. Giuffre has long accused Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell – now a convicted sex trafficker – of forcing her into sex with the royal when she was 17. It now falls to US district judge Lewis Kaplan in New York to determine whether the clause in the 2009 agreement blocks Giuffre’s lawsuit against Andrew. The litigation is in its early stages, and Kaplan has said it could go to trial between September and December of 2022 if no settlement is reached. A hearing over Andrew’s motion to dismiss the civil lawsuit is scheduled for Tuesday. * * * Theranos verdict – Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud after a jury delivered a partial verdict following a dramatic day in which jurors said they remained deadlocked on three counts. The decision followed a high-profile, 15-week trial that chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup. As the verdict was read, Holmes bowed her head, remained seated and expressed no visible emotion. She faces 20 years in prison. The 37-year-old pleaded not guilty and is expected to appeal. As Kari Paul writes, the verdict marks a milestone for Silicon Valley and its pervasive culture of “fake it ‘til you make it”. Read the full analysis here. * * * ‘A state of crisis’ – Multiple NHS trusts across England have declared “critical incidents” amid soaring staff absences caused by Covid-19, with health leaders saying many parts of the service are now “in a state of crisis”. Boris Johnson has ruled out the introduction of new curbs “for now”, but on Monday said he recognised that the pressure on the NHS and its hospitals was “going to be considerable in the course of the next couple of weeks, and maybe more”. As so many deal with the impact of Covid, GP Gavin Francis writes on the overlooked art of recovery. Whether it’s our knees or skulls that need to heal from an injury, our lungs from a viral infection such as Covid-19 or our minds from a crisis of depression or anxiety, he writes that patients often need reminding that it’s worth giving adequate time, energy and respect to the process of healing. * * * Truss and the £3,000 lunch – Labour has called on the government to explain why it claimed Liz Truss hosted a £3,000 lunch at a private members’ club because it was available at short notice, when leaked correspondence later showed that she had insisted on the venue. In a letter to the international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Labour also asked why Truss, Trevelyan’s predecessor in the role, had overruled civil servants’ concerns about the cost of the members’ club, owned by a Tory donor. The correspondence, disclosed by the Sunday Times, showed that Truss, now the foreign secretary and a favourite to succeed Johnson, “refused to consider anywhere else” and asked that public funds should pay for the event with Joe Biden’s trade representative. The venue later agreed to reduce the bill to ￡1,400. Department for International Trade officials argue that the booking was made at short notice, just a day before the event, and that alternative venues might not have been cheaper. * * * Eating disorders – A leading psychiatrist has warned the NHS can no longer treat every child with an eating disorder, as “worrying” figures reveal hospital admissions have risen 41% in a year. The dramatic surge in cases of people aged 17 and under during the pandemic has left already struggling community services overstretched with many unable to care for everyone who requires help, experts said. Dr Agnes Ayton, the chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “We are at the point where we cannot afford to let this go on any longer.” * * * ‘Don’t surrender the BBC’ – The government’s politically motivated attacks on the BBC are part of a general abasement of British institutions in recent years, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg has warned, as he called for the corporation to be protected. In an interview with the Radio Times, Bragg accused ministers of failing to recognise the value of the institution, which he said has earned the country’s support. His comments follow what some see as a sustained campaign by government ministers intent on waging a culture war, with the BBC as a key front. “Recently, it has sometimes seemed that, sadly, we are becoming a lesser country by the year,” Bragg said. “I hope the BBC is not allowed to become part of this surrender to a creeping deterioration. Indeed, I believe it could lead by example if we want to escape a situation where our great institutions are increasingly damaged for political purposes.” * * * Today in Focus podcast: How to manage your time in 2022 We only have about 4,000 weeks of life on average, says the writer Oliver Burkeman, so make sure you are prioritising what really matters.

Five people, who lived to tell the tale, explain. Sport Romelu Lukaku is in line to return to Chelsea’s squad after holding productive talks with Thomas Tuchel over the striker’s controversial interview. Tuchel is expected to restore Lukaku to his side when Chelsea host Tottenham in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday after the £97.5m forward expressed regret over going public with his unhappiness about life at Stamford Bridge. It comes as Tuchel’s team look vulnerable and the squad appears fragile.

Once again the Ashes circus arrives in Sydney as players and broadcasters desperately try to inject a little jeopardy into this long-moribund series.

The Times has “We’re on the right path to tackle virus, says PM”, alongside a picture of a masked Boris Johnson, while the Daily Mail leads with “Covid chaos fear as million isolate”. The i has “NHS leaders warn PM over growing Covid staffing crisis” and the Telegraph warns “We can’t jab the whole planet every six months”. The broadsheet also carries the Prince Andrew story and the now recognisable shot of the Duke of York with a young Giuffre. The Mirror’s take on the story is “Secret deal to silence Andrew accuser”.

Morning mail: Covid-positive nurses in hospitals, no free RATs, apocalyptic cinema;2022-01-03T19:54:56Z;['N/A'];['N/A'];"Good morning. Covid-positive nurses are being recalled to work in NSW hospitals. Scott Morrison is resisting calls to make rapid antigen tests free. And Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre’s legal deal with Jeffrey Epstein has been released. Covid-positive nurses are being ordered to work in breach of NSW health protocols as hospital managers resort to desperate measures to staff their facilities that are buckling under the Omicron outbreak. As 2,500 health workers are in isolation across the state, Guardian Australia has been contacted by multiple nurses working across several hospitals who are alarmed at finding themselves working alongside Covid-positive colleagues. All of the nurses say they had received unofficial, verbal advice from their hospitals that Covid-positive nurses could leave their mandated isolation to work, provided they were asymptomatic and wore personal protective equipment. A near-dozen-year-old legal settlement between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein has been released. Giuffre has long accused Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell – now a convicted sex trafficker – of forcing her into sex with the royal when she was 17. Court papers reveal Giuffre received $500,000 in her lawsuit against Epstein. The unsealing stemmed from Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew, which she filed on 9 August in Manhattan federal court. Andrew filed Giuffre’s settlement with Epstein as part of his attempt to dismiss her case, arguing that it shields him. He vehemently maintains his innocence. Scott Morrison has resisted calls to make rapid antigen tests free across the country as he insists the health system can manage the “very different virus” of the Omicron variant. Despite growing pressure to provide free tests more widely – including to vulnerable and low-income groups – the prime minister said subsidised tests would remain limited to people who were close contacts with symptoms.

Australians in regional areas with severe mental health problems will go without help after “devastating” changes to the telehealth system, psychiatrists warn. Federal government reforms removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning some types of consultations providers will no longer be able to bulk bill. Disability groups say the proposed religious discrimination bill will erode the rights of people with a disability and allow for legally protected “hurt and humiliation”. A positive Covid case has been recorded at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney, where 19 people died during an outbreak in 2020, putting families of residents on edge amid growing concern at the strain on the sector’s workforce as case numbers explode around the country. People in NSW are struggling to be counted as a Covid case as the state falls behind in its reporting. Here is one person’s testimony. While 5 million Australians go hungry each year, an estimated 7.3m tonnes of food is wasted and up to 25% of all vegetables produced never leave the farm, often because they are too oddly shaped for the grocery store. But new subscription services across the country are addressing this problem. The world

Films about the end of the world are on the rise. It’s no longer the preserve of megabudget disaster movies or bleak survivalist thrillers. The mainstream movie industry has now made sure that even the most casual filmgoer will be well used to witnessing humanity’s spectacular destruction. Unprecedented change has overwhelmed 2020 to 2021. Enduring the Covid pandemic has meant living through drastic adjustments to social and professional environments, an intense restriction of movement and choice, and prolonged bouts of social distancing and isolation. Now, almost two years on, many are rethinking what they want out of life and considering changes, from mental health to reshaping their identities.

Morning mail: Covid positive test rate hits new high, Canada’s mystery neurological illness, 2022 films;2022-01-02T19:55:43Z;['Tamara Howie'];['N/A'];"Good morning and happy new year! It’s nice to be back in your inbox and we hope you stayed safe and had a lovely festive season. The year is off to a tumultuous start with many states reporting record Covid infections and growing hospitalisations, compounded by concerns about the availability of tests. But there is some hope, with new studies indicating the Omicron variant currently spreading around the world is less severe than its predecessors. Australia recorded 32,000 new Covid cases on Sunday, and the positivity rate reached 20.3%, meaning one in five people tested had Covid. The figure is well above the 5% the WHO says is needed to keep the spread of Covid under control. So what does a 20% rate mean for Australia? Here’s our explainer. There were 1,066 people in hospital with Covid on Sunday – an 18% increase a day after the number had already doubled between Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve. The number of PCR tests in NSW dropped by almost 30,000 in 24 hours after the government encouraged people not to line up unless they had symptoms or were a close contact. Victoria’s health minister is expected to make an announcement in the coming days on widening access to rapid antigen tests after extreme heat caused the closure of eight of the state’s testing sites on Saturday, blowing out queues and test result wait times. In some much-needed positive Covid news – there’s more research suggesting the Omicron variant is less severe than other variants. New studies suggest the variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Some research has suggested that lateral flow tests detect Omicron better when the throat is swabbed rather than the nose. US politician Liz Cheney, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol, says her party must choose between Donald Trump and the truth. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation.

The last couple of years have surely reminded us that nobody can predict the future and nobody knows what’s coming around the corner. We can safely assume, however, that whatever troubles befall us, artists will struggle on, fighting the good fight, telling stories and taking us to places of imagination and illumination. As always, the new year offers a range of Australian films to look forward to. Hugo Weaving, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron star in some of 2022’s big movie releases, with directors George Miller, Ivan Sen, Baz Luhrmann and Gracie Otto at the helm. For Benjamin Giles, running 2,000km in 2021 was the first resolution he’d kept longer than two weeks. But it wasn’t easy – it took an app, a long lockdown and pushing through injury to reach his self-imposed target. But most of all, it took obsession. “I was way behind the schedule. But I was also obsessed, and it was mathematically possible that by running 11km a day for six weeks, with one rest day a week, I could reach my target on Christmas Eve.” Pruning is usually a technique applied to roses in winter, but more recently the gardening term has been cropping up whenever sociologists talk about our social lives. People have been pruning friends amid Covid – becoming “more insular and bonding-oriented”, and now many aren’t sure how to start rebuilding their social lives. Listen One of our best Full Story episodes from 2021 was this Guardian investigation into a scheme allowing foreign nationals to purchase citizenship in Vanuatu, or “golden passports” – and with it, visa-free access to the EU and UK.
