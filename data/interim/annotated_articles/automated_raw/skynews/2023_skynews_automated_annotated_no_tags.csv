Putin 'hides behind you and burns your country', Zelenskyy tells Russians as powerful blasts rock Ukraine;Saturday 31 December 2022 19:11, UK;[];[];"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denounced strikes on Ukraine and accused Vladimir Putin of hiding, as explosions rocked locations across the country on the final day of the year.

People throughout Ukraine were urged to take cover on New Year's Eve amid what Ukrainian officials said was a barrage of Russian missiles.

One person has been killed and 20 wounded in explosions in Kyiv, according to mayor Vitali Klitschko.

In a video message on Telegram, President Zelenskyy vowed that Russia would lose and the ""terrorist state"" would not be forgiven.

He added: ""Thank you to everyone who protects Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who is now on the front line!""

He also praised energy workers who have been repairing damage to Ukraine's power networks after waves of Russian strikes.

Switching to Russian, he appeared to address ordinary citizens across the border, saying Vladimir Putin ""hides behind the military"" and ""burns"" their country's future.

Strikes were also reported in the Zaporizhzhia and Khmelnytskyi regions of Ukraine.

Mr Klitschko earlier said via his Telegram account: ""The buildings of two schools in the Solomyansk district of the capital, one in Pechersk, suffered varying degrees of damage. There is one kindergarten in the Solomyan district. There are no casualties at these facilities.

""As a result of the Russian attack on civilian objects in the capital, one person died, 20 were injured. 14 victims were hospitalised, six were treated by medics on the spot.""

More explosions were heard in the capital city and surrounding region following the first wave of Russia's missile attack, Reuters reported.

The reports come after a series of Russian missile strikes in recent days, with the most intense aerial bombardments of the war to date on Thursday, according to Ukrainian officials.

A presidential aide, in the capital, said a hotel was among buildings to have been damaged in the barrage.

The governor of the surrounding Kyiv region had warned shortly beforehand of a possible incoming missile attack, and that air defences in the region were engaging targets.

Putin moves to justify the war to Russians

The latest violence took place as Vladimir Putin used a New Year broadcast to Russians to reiterate that their country was fighting in Ukraine to protect its ""motherland"" and to secure ""true independence"" for its people.

In a nine-minute message - the longest New Year's address of his two-decade rule - the Russian president accused the West of lying and of provoking Moscow to launch what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

""For years, Western elites hypocritically assured us of their peaceful intentions,"" he said.

""In fact, in every possible way they were encouraging neo-Nazis who conducted open terrorism against civilians in the Donbas"".

He added: ""The West lied about peace. It was preparing for aggression... and now they are cynically using Ukraine and its people to weaken and split Russia.

""We have never allowed this, and will never allow anybody to do this to us,"" state-run news agencies quoted Mr Putin as saying.

Nearly 100,000 catalytic converters stolen in three years, data reveals;Saturday 31 December 2022 17:29, UK;[];[];"Almost 100,000 thefts of catalytic converters have been recorded in three years, with criminals across the UK stealing 75 per day in 2022, new data obtained by Sky News reveals.

The emissions devices, which often contain valuable precious metals, are worth up to £600 on the black market. It is why in the 12 months from December 2021, criminals stole 28,000 catalytic converters.

CCTV shared with Sky News from police forces and victims of this crime shows how quick and brazen thieves are, stealing catalytic converters wherever they can find them at whatever time of day.

The knock-on effects and wide-ranging impact can be devastating.

Margaret Wright from Wigan has not just had it happen to her once, but three times in two years.

The Motability vehicle she shares with her husband was left unusable for weeks when the catalytic converter was stolen in September 2022.

She told Sky News: ""It sounds really extreme to say I was on the edge the last time it happened, but I really was because we don't earn a lot of money, we don't have a great deal of things so for somebody to come along and in a matter of minutes do that, it changes your life. It impacts so hard and mentally it's very hard to take.""

With a disabled husband and a 50-mile round trip to work, the impact of what seems like a minor crime has been immense.

""I feel so awful for my husband more than myself because it's his lifeline,"" Mrs Wright said. ""I've got the ability to get buses and trains but for him, he can't get out during the day. It's very disabling for something that was there to help his mobility, that person is now again disabled.""

Image: Margaret Wright from Wigan has had catalytic converters stolen three times in two years

Some 97,023 catalytic converters were stolen from the beginning of 2020 to 30 November 2022, according to OPAL, the National Intelligence Unit for Serious Organised Acquisitive Crime and a Sky News Freedom of Information request.

The worst affected area is London, but positive police action has seen thefts drop slightly in the capital since 2020.

Police watchdog condemns low burglary and theft clear-up rates

The data alone may be alarming, but it has to be taken into account that this is a crime hugely underreported and in reality there are many more catalytic converters stolen than on record - meaning many more lives deeply impacted.

But the theft is only one element of a chain of crimes involving these devices which are so sought after.

James Kelly, head of the British Metal Recycling Association, told Sky News: ""Inside catalytic converters there are this set of platinum metals: rhodium, palladium and platinum and they are extremely valuable.

""They can be up to £4,000 a troy ounce which is equivalent to about 31 grams and that could equate to about six or seven catalytic converters.""

Image: James Kelly, head of the British Metal Recycling Association

Because of their value they have become an attractive target for criminals and organised crime, it is why police forces are using covert operations to try to clamp down on the buying, selling and stealing of this car part.

Supt Mark Cleland is the UK police's metal crime lead. He told Sky News: ""Last year, in the first two weeks of an operation we reduced crime by 50% nationally. But still 30,000 offences over the last 12 months, and we need as much information about who is involved. Either the public have an idea or the waste industry has an idea.

""That information is absolutely critical to help us catch and lock up people. In another operation we recovered over 2,000 stolen catalytic converters, so we're doing the work, we just need that critical intelligence and information to help do our jobs even better.""

Image: Supt Mark Cleland is the UK police's metal crime lead

Despite police efforts, the majority of catalytic converter thefts go unsolved and whilst it may be a lucrative crime for those involved, for a single mum of three whose car was targeted, the financial repercussions are crippling.

Claire Gregan had her catalytic converter stolen whilst her car was parked at university in Lancashire in November 2022.

She told Sky News: ""They may as well have come in and ransacked the house because that car was my lifeline. It was a BMW 1 Series, it was 14 years old, it was worth £1,200. I don't have much, I'm on my own with three children, putting myself through university to better our lives. And then you're given a bill of nearly £1,000. Every way I looked for a solution, I was faced with more of a challenge financially.""

With the risk of a higher insurance premium and the chance of thieves targeting her car again, Ms Gregan scrapped the BMW and was forced to take a £4,000 loan to buy a new car.

She added: ""They couldn't have done anything worse. What they did in those few minutes, I'm probably not going to get back level with finances until summer 2023. It completely destroyed me and has left me in such a mess.""

Image: Claire Gregan

As the crime has risen, so too has the price to replace catalytic converters. It is something the AA has noticed as callouts for this problem are increasingly common.

Patroller Sean Sidley said: ""It has a huge impact on people because these catalytic converters aren't cheap to buy from the manufacturers.

""Some customers can fork out as much as £1,500 just to get their car back on the road. I've seen some dealerships that are taking quite a while to get them in stock. Getting them across to the UK from Asia has been quite difficult.""

Image: Sean Sidley, AA patroller

On the face of it, it may look like just a small offence, but these thefts are being carried out on a large scale. At every juncture of this crime, it is clear the criminals are not letting up - leaving victims helpless, vulnerable and with consequences often irreversible.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000651/http://news.sky.com/story/nearly-100-000-catalytic-converters-stolen-in-three-years-data-reveals-12777355;Category-2: business and economy
Third person arrested over Christmas Eve killing of Elle Edwards released on bail;Saturday 31 December 2022 16:50, UK;[];[];"The third person arrested in connection with the death of Elle Edwards, who was shot dead at a pub in Merseyside on Christmas Eve, has been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

The 31-year-old man from Tranmere had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

Two other people who had been arrested in connection with the shooting were earlier released from custody.

Elle Edwards died after she was shot in the head at the Lighthouse Inn in Wallasey village in the Wirral shortly before midnight on Christmas Eve.

Detectives say the beautician was not believed to have been the intended target of the shooting.

Her family have described her as the ""most beautiful and bright star"" who would ""light up a room as she walked in"".

In a statement released by Merseyside Police, her loved ones said: ""Her laugh was infectious, anyone who was around her had a good time, she loved life and had so many amazing plans for the future. She was only just getting started.""

Four men were injured in the shooting, including one who was left in a critical condition.

On Thursday, police released footage of one of the arrests.

2022 in review: Three prime ministers, the death of a monarch and a war in Europe;Saturday 31 December 2022 20:48, UK;['lara keay', '@larakeay'];[];"For most of us, 2022 has felt like more than just a year.

In the space of 12 months, the UK has had three prime ministers and two monarchs.

Russia went to war with Ukraine, causing a global financial and energy crisis, and after dominating our lives for more than two years, the coronavirus pandemic finally took more of a back seat.

So grab a cuppa, or mulled beverage, depending on the time of day, and let's look back at what made the headlines this year.

The UK began 2022 still in the midst of the first Omicron coronavirus wave, with many having had what they hoped would be their first COVID-free Christmas in two years scuppered by cases.

But despite infections still being high, ministers reduced the legal isolation period from seven days to five on 17 January - and three days later removed the legal requirement to wear a face mask on public transport and guidance to work from home where possible.

Also in January, a Chinese Communist Party agent was revealed to have interfered in UK politics by making large donations to the Labour MP Barry Gardiner. Chinese officials denied Christine Lee was involved in any interference.

Down Under there was outrage after tennis world champion Novak Djokovic was given a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open - despite not meeting COVID vaccine requirements. He was eventually deported, missing the whole tournament.

Back home, the investigation into lockdown-breaking parties in Westminster carried out by senior civil servant Sue Gray was delayed by the Met Police's own investigation.

An initial excerpt was published on 31 January, which forced then-prime minister Boris Johnson to apologise for breaking his own rules.

One you might have missed: A 24-year-old man, Jonathan Chew, from Essex, was jailed for eight weeks for harassing England's chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty in St James's Park in London the previous summer.

At the start of February, West Ham footballer Kurt Zouma caused outrage when he was filmed kicking and slapping his pet cat.

He was later prosecuted under the Animal Welfare Act and sentenced to 140 hours of community service.

The same month, Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her as a teenager, made the surprise decision to drop her US civil case against him and settle out of court.

The Duke of York, who had already had his military titles and patronages stripped, donated to her victims' charity on top of his undisclosed settlement - reported to be up to £12m.

Image: Virginia Giuffre outside court

Days later, the Queen tested positive for coronavirus, with Buckingham Palace saying she suffered ""mild cold-like symptoms"".

In a video call to COVID bereaved families later in the year, she admitted it ""leaves one very tired and exhausted"".

On 24 February, Boris Johnson removed all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England, declaring it was time to start ""living with COVID"".

It meant people were no longer legally required to isolate after contracting the virus and the end to universal free testing.

Image: Ukrainian soldiers in Kyiv on 25 February

On the same day, Vladimir Putin's troops crossed the border from Belarus into Ukraine as part of what he called a ""special military operation"".

The UK, US, EU and others condemned the war, quickly imposing sanctions and offering military support.

Elsewhere, the showbiz world was shocked by the death of YouTuber and SBTV founder Jamal Edwards at the age of 31.

Edwards, who the likes of Skepta and Ed Sheeran thanked for their careers, had a heart attack after taking cocaine, a coroner later concluded.

One you might have missed: A mum called Jane went viral after she spotted radio DJ Greg James on a train from Edinburgh - but was too shy to approach him so texted her daughter to check it was him. Jane's daughter tweeted him, James spotted the tweet, and quickly surprised her by asking: ""Are you Jane?""

The Kremlin's hopes of storming Kyiv and claiming a swift victory were dashed as Ukrainian troops held firm.

Despite suffering horrendous losses, citizens remained defiant, with many women and children trying to flee to other countries.

In the UK, economic sanctions were imposed on all Russian assets, including Chelsea Football Club - owned by oligarch and close friend of Mr Putin, Roman Abramovich.

Fans were dismayed as it left the club unable to sell any new match tickets, merchandise, or buy players.

On 17 March, after six years in a Tehran prison, Iranian-British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returned home to the UK.

She was accompanied by fellow detainee Anoosheh Ashoori, who had been held since 2017.

Emotional pictures of her being reunited with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella were followed by claims she was made to sign a false confession in the presence of British government officials.

The last day of March saw the internet's mouth drop when actor Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars for making a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith.

Later described as ""the slap heard around the world"", it saw Smith banned from Oscars ceremonies for the next 10 years.

Back in the UK, Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie and then-chancellor Rishi Sunak were all handed fixed penalty notices for breaking lockdown rules.

This made Mr Johnson the first prime minister to be reprimanded by the police in office.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also fell foul of COVID rules, albeit to a much lesser extent, as she was spoken to by police for not adhering to face mask rules.

And 26-year-old Ali Harbi Ali was sentenced to a whole-life prison sentence for stabbing Southend MP Sir David Amess to death in his Leigh-on-Sea constituency in October 2021.

On 9 May, the Queen missed the state opening of parliament for only the third time during her reign.

She didn't do it 1959 and 1963 on the advice of her doctors as she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Edward.

Prince Charles took her place due to the mobility problems she had been experiencing since the autumn.

The next day, the long-awaited Wagatha Christie trial began at the High Court in London.

It was given that name after Coleen Rooney claimed in 2019 to have carried out her own sting operation into who was leaking stories about her to the press.

After declaring it was fellow footballer's wife Rebekah Vardy, Vardy sued her for libel, alleging her claims had damaged her reputation. After six weeks, the judge sided with Rooney.

On 24 May, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos shot his grandmother before storming Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killing 21 people.

Ramos was shot dead and the police were later criticised for waiting more than an hour before engaging him, triggering a wider discussion about US gun laws.

Back in the UK, the long-waited Sue Gray report into lockdown gatherings in Downing Street was finally published in full.

Britons got a long Bank Holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.

The Queen played herself in a skit with Paddington Bear in which she admitted to hiding marmalade sandwiches in her handbag - to the nation's delight.

Concerns for her health were fuelled after she had to pull out of the Buckingham Palace pop concert and other events because of her mobility issues.

Prince Louis stole the show on the palace balcony with his visible dislike of the noisy flypast.

July began, however, with a political crisis.

On 3 July, two further allegations of sexual assault emerged against Conservative deputy chief whip Chris Pincher.

When it transpired concerns about his behaviour had been reported to Downing Street before and seemingly ignored, it triggered a huge backlash within the Tory Party.

Already furious over his involvement in lockdown parties, momentum against Boris Johnson finally grew to the point of no return.

And on 7 July he appeared outside Number 10 to announce his resignation.

Conceding that ""them's the brakes"", he also suggested he might return to frontbench politics with a reference to Roman leader Cincinnatus.

Earlier in the month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his deputy Angela Rayner were cleared over the beergate scandal.

They offered to resign if police found they had broken lockdown rules by accompanying a campaign meeting in Durham with a beer and curry, but were cleared on 8 July.

September was arguably the biggest month in news the UK has seen in decades.

It started with Liz Truss beating Rishi Sunak to become prime minister and Conservative leader on 5 September.

Mr Sunak kept a low profile after his defeat - 43% to Ms Truss's 57% - only to replace her as leader seven weeks later.

Ms Truss travelled to Balmoral to be formally appointed leader by the Queen - as opposed to Buckingham Palace - as is tradition.

The pair were pictured together in Scotland, with many commenting on Her Majesty's frail appearance.

Three days later on 8 September, business in the Commons was interrupted by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle announcing the Queen's doctors were ""concerned for her health"" and she was ""under medical supervision"" at Balmoral.

Party leaders swiftly left the chamber and after hours of speculation, at around 6.30pm it was announced the Queen had died.

Flags dropped to half mast, not just in the UK, but around the world, and a period of national mourning was declared as King Charles's reign began.

People queued throughout the day and night to observe Her Majesty's coffin, with one man arrested for a public order offence for trying to grab it.

TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield faced a fierce backlash over allegations they were able to skip the long wait - in a row that became known as queuegate.

The funeral took place on 20 September, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex returning from their new lives in the US to pay tribute.

As day-to-day life returned to normal, just three days later the new PM Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng revealed their ""plan for growth"".

The mini-budget, as it became known, included a new price cap on energy, and huge tax cuts, but didn't include a forecast of how the £45bn would be funded from the Office for Budget Responsibility.

The Bank of England had to make an unprecedented intervention after it sent the pound and pension markets plummeting - and mortgage rates soaring.

One you may have missed: A 48-year-old man from Norfolk was jailed for life for murdering his neighbour over a row about noise from his motorbike. He told police: ""Killing people isn't always a bad thing.""

The mini-budget triggered a general lack of economic confidence in October, exacerbating the cost of living crisis that began earlier in the year and sending inflation to a record high of 11.1%.

Mortgage rates became almost unaffordable and house sales and purchases fell through.

On 3 October, the chancellor U-turned on one of his most controversial mini budget measures - a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.

Five days later, Liz Truss appeared outside Downing Street to resign - making her the shortest-serving PM in history.

After another five days, her former leadership rival Rishi Sunak replaced her.

And at the end of October, more than 150 people died in a crush at a Halloween event in Seoul, South Korea, and Twitter was bought by Elon Musk - beginning what has already been a chaotic new era at the social media company.

Inflation, gas prices, cost of living crisis and a plummeting pound - a look back at a tough 2022;Thursday 29 December 2022 00:37, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"When looking back at the year gone by, it is rather hard to know where to start.

The death of a monarch, war in mainland Europe, the shortest running prime minister of all time. It has been an extraordinary 12 months of news, especially for the economy. Rather than running through the whole thing in narrative form, here are four of the biggest stories - along with the charts that help tell them.

1. The return of inflation

That 2022 was going to be a year with high inflation was hardly a surprise. It was clear from the middle of last year that prices were on the rise, and by the time the Bank of England began raising interest rates in December 2021, it already looked slightly behind the curve.

All the same, the leap in prices in 2022 was both dramatic and historic. You can see it for yourself in the chart of the period. By October, the consumer price index (CPI) was telling us that prices were rising at an annual rate of 11.1 per cent - the highest rate since 1981.

The striking thing about high inflation is how quickly it feeds into one's way of life. There is the big picture: the fact that we're all worse off, because our earnings aren't rising at the same rate. There's the impact it has on businesses, who are seeing their margins compressed and having to wrestle with how much of their cost increases to pass onto customers. And then there are the knock on consequences we're still living through.

One of those consequences is a sharp increase in industrial action. The funny thing, when you look at the shape of that CPI chart, is how similar those lines are to another data series - the one showing the frequency of industrial action in this country. The UK lost well over a million working days to strikes towards the end of 2022 (the final figure will be considerably higher, when it eventually gets published).

But when you overlay those two data series, you can see that given where CPI rose to and given the relationship between these two lines in the past, the number of strikes seems likely to head far higher.

The good news is that as the year ended, inflation seemed to have peaked. The question is what happens to energy bills and wider household costs in the coming months.

2. Gas prices

Speaking of energy bills, it's worth dwelling for a moment on the extraordinary increase in gas prices in 2022. We have simply never seen these prices rise this high - ever.

One thing worth noting is that the increases, from a relatively low and stable level back before 2020, long preceded the war in Ukraine. There is no doubt that the Russian invasion caused a sharp spike in prices, but this was far from the only thing pushing up these prices.

But we have all suffered the consequences. Not just in our energy bills - though that's the most obvious and painful impact - but everywhere else too. One thing we've all had to go back to basics and try to understand this year is the extent to which so many parts of our lives, so many products we all use, are made in part with gas, from the tomatoes you buy in the supermarket to the technology products you have in your pocket. Even a new car relies on gas to dry the paint being applied to it. For the time being, we still live in a fossil fuelled world, so for the time being, charts like this will have an enormous impact on our lives.

3. Real household disposable income

The upshot of those higher prices, however, is a severe hit to our living standards. Perhaps the clearest way to see this is to calculate the disposable income we all have after you've subtracted inflation and essential items from our income.

And on this front the news is not good. This chart, originally produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility first in March and then again in November, shows you how that real household disposable income has changed - and is forecast to change. And due in large part to the cost of living crisis, this measure of our living standards is due to shrink this year and next at the fastest rate ever. It's a chilling calculation, underlining something quite important.

While we have lived through more recessions in recent years than anyone cares to remember, this particular recession may prove more painful, and is likely to be felt more intimately in our pockets, than any of those preceding slumps. Such things matter.

4. The pound hits a record low

Finally, it would be remiss to offer an account of the year without referring to the drama of September and October, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng presided over a fiscal statement that precipitated an astounding collapse in the value of the pound.

In the days after the statement, sterling dropped sharply in value, eventually hitting a low of just above $1.03 vs the US dollar. This was the lowest level on record, lower even than the levels in 1985 which marked the previous nadir. In that case, the story was primarily about the dollar's strength - a phenomenon which so worried the US authorities that they staged a summit, the Plaza Accord, in an effort to bring it down against other leading currencies.

This time around, the story was slightly different. The dollar was undoubtedly strong in the preceding weeks, with economists expecting big increases in the main US interest rate, but the real story was about UK weakness. With consternation among UK investors about the course of policy under Truss and Kwarteng, the pound dropped not just against the dollar but against other currencies too. And after Truss was replaced with Rishi Sunak, it began to bounce back.

These are just small data-driven windows into an extraordinary year. But they raise a question: when we come to look at the defining charts of 2023, will they be quite as dramatic as these ones?";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000651/http://news.sky.com/story/inflation-gas-prices-cost-of-living-crisis-and-a-plummeting-pound-a-look-back-at-a-tough-2022-12772123;Category-2: business and economy

The development of life-changing vaccines

From COVID-19 to the groundbreaking malaria vaccine - these discoveries not only saved millions of people's lives but also changed the way we live.

Based on findings from The Lancet, it is estimated that vaccinations prevented 14.4 million deaths from COVID-19.

With major pharmaceuticals coming forward, the Pfizer vaccine became the first to receive emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine was created in under a year.

The success of the malaria vaccine gave hope to many and became a ""historic moment"".

Malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260 000 African children under the age of five die from malaria annually. WHO Director-General said: ""Using this vaccine on top of existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year"".

The vaccine could reduce deaths from malaria by 70% by 2030, according to British scientists who developed it.

This transport link has been named after the late Queen and its opening was a rather momentous occasion.

The late monarch was joined by her youngest son the Earl of Wessex during their official visit, in what Buckingham Palace described as a ""happy development"".

After construction difficulties and delays, the shiny new line on the London Underground has been one that commuters have been loving this year, with the line slashing many journey times in the city.

The four-day workweek

Although the trial has now come to an end, some firms have made it permanent.

The trial involved 70 UK companies and kicked off on 6 June - it is thought to be the world's biggest pilot scheme into the working pattern.

The experiment ended on 6 December and results will be shared next year.

Period Products Act comes to force

Thor the walrus pops up for New Year appearance in Scarborough;Saturday 31 December 2022 14:52, UK;[];[];"A wandering Walrus, which has popped up in several North Sea and Atlantic coastal harbours in recent months, has appeared in Scarborough just in time for 2023.

Thor, as the mammal has become known, surfaced in the Yorkshire seaside town on Friday night and has drawn huge crowds to the area.

The Arctic walrus was last spotted on the Hampshire coastline earlier this month.

Image: Thor has a rest on the pebbles of the Hampshire coast earlier this month after weeks of travelling across Europe

It was first sighted in the Netherlands on 6 November and had been travelling along the coast of France, as far as Brittany, in recent weeks.

Experts have been unable, so far, to determine whether Thor is male or female.

Local wildlife experts have asked people not to disturb the creature, saying he appears to be ""taking a break"" in Scarborough and will move on in a few days once he is rested enough to continue his journey north.

Cordons have been put in place.

Scarborough resident Richard Coulson said: ""I live just round the corner from where it actually is and the traffic up and down our road - it's just like a summer's day, it really is absolutely teeming with cars and people.

""It's amazing how much attention it's brought.""

He added: ""We see seals quite regularly round Scarborough coastline but something of that size, it's enormous.

""You respect nature when you see something of that size. Its tusks are bigger than my arms.""

The Sea Life Scarborough aquarium said its animal care team was monitoring the walrus's situation, along with the RSPCA and British Divers Marine Life Rescue.

They wrote on social media: ""Please do not worry - he appears well and is just taking a well deserved rest after his long adventure!

""Please be respectful of his rest and try not to disturb him. While it is a very exciting opportunity for us, naturally they do not like lots of noise and are not familiar with domestic animals so please keep pets on leads and remain a safe distance for your own welfare and his.

Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler faces historic child sex assault claim;Saturday 31 December 2022 15:22, UK;[];[];"A woman who has previously said she had a relationship with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler when she was 16, is now suing him for alleged child sexual assault.

Julia Misley, who is 65, filed the lawsuit under a 2019 California law that gave adult victims of childhood sexual assault three years - until Saturday - to bring cases for historic instances of abuse.

The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of financial compensation, does not refer to the singer by name.

However, Tyler was identified as the subject of the claim in a statement via her lawyers.

Ms Misley said she wanted to seize ""a new opportunity to take legal action against those that abused me in my youth"".

Representatives of Steven Tyler were yet to respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

Ms Misley has recounted her experiences with Tyler in prior interviews while he has discussed a relationship with a teenage girl in two books, published in 2011 and 1997.

The acknowledgements section of his memoir Does The Noise In My Head Bother You? thanks a ""Julia Halcomb"", which Ms Misley has said is a reference to her because it was the name under which she was previously known.

The legal age of consent in California is 18.

The lawsuit alleges Tyler ""used his role, status, and power as a well-known musician and rock star to gain access to, groom, manipulate, exploit, sexually assault"" Ms Misley over a period of three years after meeting him at one of his shows in Oregon in 1973.

He would have been aged in his mid-twenties at the time of the alleged activity.

""While many will remember the summer's extreme heat, what has been noteworthy this year has been the relatively consistent heat through the year, with every month except December being warmer than average.

""The warm year is in line with the genuine impacts we expect as a result of human-induced climate change. Although it doesn't mean every year will be the warmest on record, climate change continues to increase the chances of increasingly warm years over the coming decades.""

Dr McCarthy also said the record-breaking temperatures in July boosted the overall temperature values for the year but this isn't the ""fully story"".

He continued: ""Temperatures have been above the 1991 to 2020 long term average for a large proportion of the year, and this is something that we can anticipate as we become increasingly affected by climate change.

""Met Office science has shown that the temperatures witnessed in mid-July would have been extremely unlikely in the pre-industrial period - the era before humanity started emitting lots of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.""

Dr McCarthy added that December's weather shows the UK's climate is still ""subject to notable cold spells during the winter season"".

He added: ""Our observational data show these have generally become less frequent and less severe as our climate warms.""

A sequence of heatwaves starting in June led to the UK experiencing its fourth warmest summer on record, while temperatures broke the 40C (104F) mark for the first time.

The hot spell in July saw the Met Office issue its first ever red warning for extreme heat.

A major incident was declared by the London Fire Brigade after a ""huge surge"" in blazes across the capital in July.

In the village of Wennington, on the outskirts of east London, several houses were destroyed and others severely damaged after grass fires broke out, engulfing properties, as black smoke billowed into the air.

Wales also recorded a new daily maximum temperature record of 37.1C (98.8F), while Scotland saw a new record of 34.8C (94.6F).

A 'stark illustration' of the difficulties facing UK species

The National Trust has warned this year's ""litany"" of weather extremes, including storms, drought and record-breaking heat is set to become the new norm.

In its annual review of the year, the conservation charity said 2022's weather had been challenging for nature, from habitats scorched by wildfire, to natterjack toads, butterflies, birds and bats hit by drought.

The trust said 2022 has been a ""stark illustration"" of the difficulties many of the UK's species could face without more action to tackle climate change and help nature cope - with extremes likely to worsen as temperatures rise.

Rare lizards and natterjack toads badly affected by heat and drought

Wildfires on National Trust land in areas such as Cornwall, Bolberry Down in south Devon, and Studland in Dorset, destroyed homes of rare land lizards.

Meanwhile, shallow ponds used by natterjack toads for breeding dried up and bats had to be rescued in the heatwave.

Flying insects including many butterfly species and bumblebees had a poor year as flowering plants withered and died in the dry heat.

The National Trust said the lack of insects had knock-on impacts on birds such as swifts which rely on them to feed their young.

Image: Bats, pictured here in Somerset, had to be rescued due to the heat

Spring months helped insects produce a mass of seeds

Trees planted last winter, to store carbon and boost woodland habitat, were hit by the drought and extreme heat, with 50% of saplings lost on estates such as Wimpole in Cambridgeshire and Buscot and Coleshill in Oxfordshire.

On a more positive note the National Trust said trees and shrubs did have a ""mast year"" in many areas where they produced an abundance of seeds and nuts.

Warm spring months also meant lots of insects pollinated blossom before the stress of the summer heat and drought encouraged them to produce a mass of seeds to help their genes survive

10 most costly climate change-related disasters in 2022 revealed;Friday 30 December 2022 09:02, UK;[];[];"Droughts, floods, storms and hurricanes were among the most costly climate change-related disasters during 2022, according to a new report.

The report by Christian Aid found that the 10 most expensive events in terms of insured losses ranged in cost from $3bn to $100bn, although the figures are only estimates, so the true expense could be much higher.

Here are the 10 most costly disasters of the year:

Image: Hurricane Ian in Cuba

Hurricane Ian - $100bn

Ian was a Category 4 hurricane that caused widespread damage across western Cuba and the southeast of the US. Over seven days in late September, it killed at least 150 people and made 40,000 homeless.

Image: A dried up branch of the Loire River in France

European drought - $20bn

The drought in the summer of 2022 was widely acknowledged to be the continent's worst in 500 years, affecting food and energy production, water availability and wildlife. It also fuelled wildfires, crop losses and caused more than 20,000 excess deaths.

Image: Flooding in Hunan province, China

Flooding in China - $12.3bn

In June, southern China saw its heaviest rainfall since 1961, bringing floods and landslides and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.

Drought in China - $8.4bn

Late in August, China experienced its hottest and driest summer since records began in 1961, with more than 70 days of extreme temperatures and low rainfall badly affecting the basin of the Yangtze river, which supports more than 450 million people and a third of the country's crops.

Image: Flooding in New South Wales in Australia

Flooding in eastern Australia - $7.5bn

From late February through March, eastern Australian states experienced flooding that killed 27 people and displaced 60,000. Several towns in northern New South Wales, for example, had a month's worth of rain in just six hours - and this happened while they were still struggling to recover from record flooding the month before.

Image: Sindh province, Pakistan. Pic: AP

Pakistan floods - $5.6bn

From mid-June into September, flooding killed more than 1,700 people and displaced seven million in Pakistan. The flooding was worse because it came after a summer of record-breaking heat - meaning the ground was to dry to absorb the water.

Image: Storm Eunice in Godalming, England. Pic: AP

Storm Eunice - $4.3bn

Over five days in February, Storm Eunice caused devastation across Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Seven people were killed.

In the UK gusts of 122mph were recorded - the strongest winds in more than 30 years.

Image: Lagoa da Francesa in Brazil

Drought in Brazil - $4bn

Brazil has been in drought for most of the year - a drought that is thought to be the worst in decades. The low level of the Amazon River is a particular concern.

Image: Hurricane Fiona in Newfoundland, Canada

Hurricane Fiona - $3bn

Hurricane Fiona hit the Caribbean and Canada in the later part of September, killing more than 25 people and making 13,000 homeless.

At least four international airports were shut down, roads were closed and a number of communities were cut off.

Image: Flooding in Umlazi near Durban, South Africa

KwaZulu Natal and Eastern Cape floods, South Africa - $3.0bn

Over a week in April, 459 people were killed and more than 40,000 had to leave their homes. Water services were shut down and Durban, one of South Africa's busiest ports, was disrupted.

The report will reignite the debate about who should pay for a 'climate catastrophe', with many of the disasters happening in parts of the world that are the least to blame for climate change.

There was some progress on this issue at global climate negotiations at COP27 in Egypt in November, where countries landed a historic pact to set up a fund for climate damages.

But the details of where the money comes from and who gets it are still to be agreed.

Christian Aid's chief executive Patrick Watt said the figures in the report point to ""the financial cost of inaction on the climate crisis"".

The human cost of the spiralling crisis ""is seen in the homes washed away by floods, loved ones killed by storms and livelihoods destroyed by drought"", he added.

Bah, humbug! How insects could become the backbone of your Christmas dinner;Sunday 25 December 2022 03:40, UK;[];[];"Whether a traditional turkey or a meat-free nut roast, there's plenty that goes into making a good Christmas dinner.

But while competition at the supermarket or your local butcher is always high ahead of the festive season, this year winds down against the backdrop of warnings of an impending UK food supply crisis.

A shortage of eggs, farmers say, could be just the start - so while your highly anticipated Christmas dinner may be spared from what's to come, Easter lunch may not be so lucky.

Thankfully, there is a potential solution all around us - some of them are crawling beneath our feet, others buzzing around above our heads.

And before you say ""bah, humbug"", I'm not about to suggest you replace your lovingly prepared roast with insects.

Better Origin, based in Cambridge, wants to make food waste part of the supply chain. Given the United Nations estimates 17% of global food production is thrown away, there's plenty to go round.

Here is where insects come in: feeding them that waste can transform them into a nutritious alternative to the carbon-intensive soya and grains commonly used to feed livestock.

""The way to view this is insect protein,"" says Fotis Fotiadis, Better Origin's chief executive.

""The reason it's great and nutritious is their amino acid profile is very similar to meat. That could replace any form of animal protein in other parts of the food supply chain.""

How does this new supply chain work?

The ethos of the supply chain is using technology to mimic nature, converting waste back into food.

While you would likely not dream of eating a rotten apple, in nature it could re-enter the food chain - either by being consumed as is, or decomposed by bacteria and built back up.

""The system is not sustainable or secure - as proven by the pandemic and Russia's invasion,"" says Mr Fotiadis.

""We need to […] shift from linear to circular. If waste becomes part of the input, you become more independent.""

Image: The insects replace soya and grains in the hens' diet

Better Origin has developed what it describes as an ""automated factory in a shipping container"", with waste and insects stored in one end for them to consume. Once built up, they can be fed to animals.

There is already a real world example, as Morrisons launched a line of ""carbon-neutral eggs"" by feeding hens on its farms with black soldier fly larvae that have been fed with waste.

""It's a win-win for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Mr Fotiadis, with AI-driven algorithms used to completely automate the feeding process inside the containers.

Morrisons has been provided with 10 of the ""insect mini-farms"", saving an estimated 3,000 tonnes of food waste and 2,810 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.

How will it go beyond eggs?

Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your insect-powered Christmas dinner (unless you do just eat bugs instead of your roast, I guess).

Better Origin is working with regulators to expand the amount of food types they can feed to insects, beyond the existing fruit, vegetables, and bakery waste.

The ambition is to repeat the ""insect protein"" feeding strategy for other animals, and the company's plan has the backing of the University of Cambridge.

Adam Boulton: The glimmers of hope and reasons to be cheerful as 2022 ends;Monday 26 December 2022 08:38, UK;['adam boulton', '@adamboultontabb'];[];"2022 has been a tough year, in which the UK has often been hit harder than its peer countries in the G7 – the club of the world's wealthiest democracies.

Russia's bloody attack on Ukraine led to dramatic spikes in energy costs.

A global cost of living crisis has been driven by soaring inflation and interest rates.

In the UK, hard-pressed workers across the public sector are striking.

Unprecedented political instability in the governing Conservative Party means there have been three different prime ministers in the same year.

Meanwhile, billions of us are grappling with digital technology and connectivity. Some fear social media is rendering traditional representative democracy impossible while handing power to autocrats and unaccountable corporations. Online communication has certainly made us angrier and less tolerant of others.

The world's population passed eight billion people this year, further increasing the existential pressure humanity is placing on the planet. Extreme weather events attributed to global warming are more frequent than ever.

Globally, the COVID pandemic has claimed more than six million lives, and it is not over either, with a million more deaths predicted in China as the Communist Party reverses its zero-COVID policy.

Taken together, these problems paint a dark picture of life in 2022, yet as we try to cope with them there are glimmers of hope. As we head into the New Year, I want to lift the gloom and rustle up some reasons to be cheerful.

Hope and unity emerge from war in Ukraine

Image: Ukrainians celebrate Russia's withdrawal from Kherson in November

No one should minimise the horror of the war in Ukraine, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides and is still enduring the deliberate destruction by an aggressor of a modern European state. Russia's superiority in size may still mean that Ukraine never gets back all its territory.

Still, the course of the war so far has confounded all President Vladimir Putin's calculations and shattered the dreams of dictatorial regimes elsewhere. Russia did not conquer in a few days.

The Western democracies did not prove weak and venal. NATO is not ""brain-dead"", as President Emmanuel Macron sneered a few years ago. It is stronger, with Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance.

Led by the US, UK and Poland, Western nations have given billions of dollars in military assistance while accommodating refugees. Just as importantly, the thirst of the Ukrainian people and their leaders for liberty, peace and democracy, stressed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his impassioned address to the joint session of the US Congress, reminded us all of the values which should unite us and which are worth fighting for.

For all their faults, Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss gave Ukraine solid support, even though it cut across their key post-Brexit foreign policy of turning away from Europe. British governments from now on are likely to grasp the importance of good relations with the UK's closest and largest trading bloc, based on practical co-operation rather than ideology.

A healthy democracy

There is no going back on leaving the EU. But the UK has the chance to enter a new phase without obsessing over the question of Europe, which has dogged the Tory party at least since the 1990s, bedevilling the nation in the process.

Conservative governments no longer have an excuse to be distracted from dealing directly with more important questions such as growth, productivity, and fairness.

If the ruling party does not adapt and address these issues, opinion polls and recent local and by-elections suggest that the electorate may be ready to make a change.

Whatever the outcome at the next election, this is the sign of healthy democracy. Something the increasingly restless people of Russia, China and Iran, for example, are not able to enjoy.

In elections in the West this year, the tide appeared to be turning against populist leaders with links to Russia.

Candidates most associated with Donald Trump, who called Putin a ""genius"", fared badly in November's midterm elections. The Democrats kept control of the Senate. In France, President Macron was re-elected in April, defeating a challenge from Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally.

Game-changing future technology

Image: US scientists carried out the first ever nuclear fusion experiment to achieve a net energy gain

In an era of modern communications, the world should not and cannot de-globalise. The knock from the loss of Russian energy has led, however, to increased emphasis on the importance of producing our own green energy and trading with friendly and stable partners.

2022 will be a record year for commissioning renewable energy programmes, a trend which was already accelerating before the Ukraine invasion.

Other scientific breakthroughs this year point to game-changing future technologies. In the US, experimenters have for the first time achieved atomic fusion, producing more energy than was used to trigger it.

Chinese scientists claim to have found a way to produce hydrogen by electrolysing salt water. Applied on an industrial scale, this would dramatically increase the supply and cheapness of a potentially ""green"" fuel.

A test case in the Amazon

Image: A climate activist protests at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt

There were two important world meetings on the environment this year - COP27 in Egypt on climate change and COP15 in Canada on biodiversity.

Neither was dramatic, but both re-affirmed commitments already moving in the right direction. Crucially, at both summits, richer nations agreed to remove one of the biggest obstacles to moving faster.

They agreed, though so far more in principle than practice, to pay poorer nations for loss and damage caused by Western industrialisation and to protect vital ecosystems. Both are battles against time and the pace of degradation.

Brazil will be a test case. Deforestation in the Amazon increased catastrophically under encouragement from outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula da Silva, who takes office in January, campaigned successfully on a commitment of zero deforestation in the rain forests, wetlands, and savannah. He has re-appointed a highly committed environment minister,

Marina Silva, and upped the budget to combat destruction.

We're living longer and healthier

68.7% of the world population have now had at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. A total of thirteen billion doses have been dispensed. The capacity of the disease to kill is receding.

An anti-malaria vaccine also became a live possibility this year. Global life expectancy went up to 73 years in 2022, albeit by 0.24%. A woman born in Britain this year can expect to live to 83 - that's 21 years progress on the average female life span in 1926, the year Queen Elizabeth II was born.

Life expectancy increases are plateauing in the UK and US. The most dramatic advances are in poorer countries. Today, 9.2% of the world population live in what is defined as extreme poverty, compared to 36% in 1990. That is still more than a billion people. In the same period, deaths of children five and under has fallen from 34,200 each day to 14,200.

Pioneers believe that mankind is on the brink of a much greater transformation in both preventative and therapeutic medicine - thanks to the use of AI technology in mapping the human genome and proteins, and the possibilities of so-called CRISPR gene editing.

A better tech universe

We are not in control of the ways online technology is changing almost every aspect of our lives. Authoritarian regimes use it to control information and their own citizens. In free societies, trolls and conspiracy theorists send untruths around the world, aided by bots from hostile nations.

Ordinary people go on social media to vilify others and to ""cancel"" them. The furore on both sides over Jeremy Clarkson's casually vicious comments on Meghan Markle are just the latest example.

Meanwhile, tech companies and entrepreneurs have become absurdly wealthy.

'Guilt free' transatlantic flight is on the horizon, government says;Friday 16 December 2022 05:41, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];[];"Guilt free flying is one step closer to reality, the government has said, as it awarded Virgin Atlantic up to £1m to test the first transatlantic commercial flight powered by green fuel.

A normal Boeing 787 passenger plane will next year jet from London to New York in a bid to prove long haul flights can be fuelled using only sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Environmentalists question the green credentials of SAF and argue the only guaranteed way to shrink the impact of flying is simply by doing it less.

But the government says this test flight will show ""guilt-free flying"" is on the horizon, as it plans for an increase in passengers.

""That will be the longest time that sustainable aviation fuels have been flown, and it will be... absolutely key in showing other airlines, the rest of the world what can be done,"" Aviation Minister Baroness Vere told Sky News.

Current rules only allow a maximum of 50% SAF blended with normal jet fuel, kerosene, to be used in commercial aircraft engines.

Virgin will be leading a consortium including Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Imperial College London.

They say the plane is sure to make it across the Atlantic safely because they have run test flights, though could not disclose the distances.

""The beauty about sustainable aviation fuel is it's a drop in fuel, which actually means it smells and looks exactly like jet fuel,"" Virgin CEO Shai Weiss said.

Speaking at Heathrow Terminal 3, Baroness Vere said the flight will ""absolutely"" be good for the environment because it will take the UK closer to net zero aviation, one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.

How sustainable is sustainable aviation fuel?

The government expects this test flight to be fuelled ""primarily"" by waste oils and fats.

This would cut emissions by 70% compared with kerosene, because they are waste products and do not need extracting.

Virgin said the remaining 30% will effectively be removed using biochar, a material that can trap and store the equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere.

But the government's own climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have warned against over reliance on SAF.

The CCC's head of net zero, David Joffe said: ""It's easy to get carried away in the same way that people are getting carried away with the [nuclear] fusion announcement... and say, 'oh it's about to break through, therefore we don't need to do anything [to reduce demand]'"".

""But our analysis suggests that even by 2050, there just won't be enough SAF to do everything.""

Baroness Vere said: ""I am confident the sustainable aviation fuels are sustainable, but... we need to look very carefully [at] the feedstocks.""

She added: ""That's why we need to invest now to bring forward the R&D; [research and development] that will make those pathways happen.""

'Really worrying' the government won't cut demand

The government is banking on SAF to help offset its planned 70% boom in passengers. The expansion flies in the face of warnings from the CCC that an increase of no more than 25% is possible while still meeting climate goals.

The minister shot down calls for a levy on frequent fliers, which would allow everyone to take one or two trips a year and then tax each flight incrementally after that.

""This government is anti-aviation emissions, not anti-flying,"" she said. ""We can continue to fly because it's good for our economy, it's good for our friendships and seeing our family.""

Alethea Warrington from climate charity Possible called it ""really worrying that the government is refusing to put in place any measures to limit demand for flights"".

There is going to be ""a huge increase in emissions that most people in the UK are not going to benefit from"", she added.

In the UK, 70% of flights are made by 15% of the population, with 52% not flying abroad at all.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel can be made from waste products like cooking oil or black binbag rubbish. That means lifecycle emissions are 70% lower because they don't need extracting from the ground, like normal jet fuel.

But emissions when they are burned in a jet engine are the same, and there are concerns that there is not an endless supply of waste.

SAF can also be made from plants. This form too causes the same emissions as kerosene when burned, but these in theory can be sucked up again by the new plants when they grow.

This form of SAF is particularly contentious because of concerns about monocultures being bad for life-sustaining ecosystems, and because of the land it would need. It is also hard to guarantee the new crops will absorb the equivalent emissions.

A third form involves creating hydrogen from renewable energy and combining it with carbon dioxide captured from the air, but it is very energy intensive.

Putin 'hides behind you and burns your country', Zelenskyy tells Russians as powerful blasts rock Ukraine;Saturday 31 December 2022 18:21, UK;[];[];"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denounced strikes on Ukraine and accused Vladimir Putin of hiding, as explosions rocked locations across the country on the final day of the year.

People throughout Ukraine were urged to take cover on New Year's Eve amid what Ukrainian officials said was a barrage of Russian missiles.

One person has been killed and 20 wounded in explosions in Kyiv, according to mayor Vitali Klitschko.

In a video message on Telegram, President Zelenskyy vowed that Russia would lose and the ""terrorist state"" would not be forgiven.

He added: ""Thank you to everyone who protects Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who is now on the front line!""

He also praised energy workers who have been repairing damage to Ukraine's power networks after waves of Russian strikes.

Switching to Russian, he appeared to address ordinary citizens across the border, saying Vladimir Putin ""hides behind the military"" and ""burns"" their country's future.

At least 10 blasts were reported in the capital Kyiv alone, with Mr Klitschko saying at least one person had been killed and 20 wounded.

He said via his Telegram account: ""The buildings of two schools in the Solomyansk district of the capital, one in Pechersk, suffered varying degrees of damage. There is one kindergarten in the Solomyan district. There are no casualties at these facilities.

""As a result of the Russian attack on civilian objects in the capital, one person died, 20 were injured. 14 victims were hospitalised, six were treated by medics on the spot.""

More explosions were heard in the capital city and surrounding region following the first wave of Russia's missile attack, Reuters reported.

The reports come after a series of Russian missile strikes in recent days, with the most intense aerial bombardments of the war to date on Thursday, according to Ukrainian officials.

A presidential aide, in the capital, said a hotel was among buildings to have been damaged in the barrage.

The governor of the surrounding Kyiv region had warned shortly beforehand of a possible incoming missile attack, and that air defences in the region were engaging targets.

Putin moves to justify the war to Russians

The latest violence took place as Vladimir Putin used a New Year broadcast to Russians to reiterate that their country was fighting in Ukraine to protect its ""motherland"" and to secure ""true independence"" for its people.

Image: 'The West lied about peace,' Vladimir Putin claimed in his New Year message

In a nine-minute message - the longest New Year's address of his two-decade rule - the Russian president accused the West of lying and of provoking Moscow to launch what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

""For years, Western elites hypocritically assured us of their peaceful intentions,"" he said.

New Year Honours list: Lionesses and Queen's Brian May among those recognised by King Charles;Saturday 31 December 2022 14:38, UK;[];[];"Four Lionesses have been recognised in the New Year Honours list, which also sees Queen guitarist Brian May and artist Grayson Perry knighted.

The gongs are the first to be issued by King Charles, with a range of politicians and charity workers also honoured.

Lionesses make the list - but not all of them

Captain Leah Williamson is among four of England's Euro 2022-winning side to be named in the list, being made an OBE while her teammates Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead and Ellen White are all made MBEs.

The decision to only include a handful of the squad was questioned after previous lists honoured all members of triumphant national teams.

In 2003, all 31 England players used in the Rugby World Cup were included on that year's New Year Honours list, while the 2005 Ashes-winning England cricket team were also universally recognised. However, in 2011 only three cricketers who played key roles in the Ashes-winning side made the cut.

Asked why not all the Lionesses were included, Sir Hugh Robertson, chairman of the honours sports committee, told a press conference: ""What we've tried to do is stick to the principle of the honours system which is to recognise excellence and to recognise extraordinary contributions.""

Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham criticised the decision to only honour four of the players.

Mr Burnham tweeted: ""Why only four? They were a TEAM. It should be all or none and I say ALL.""

Ms Powell said: ""Congrats to those Lionesses who have been given honours, but to not recognise the entire team is not only against expectations but out of sync with previous sporting victories and another example of the lack of respect and profile given to the women's game.""

Queen guitarist knighted for services to music and charity

Musician and animal welfare campaigner Brian May has been appointed a Knight Bachelor.

The guitarist famously played God Save The Queen on the roof of Buckingham Palace during the Golden Jubilee, before performing again at the Platinum Jubilee two decades later.

He told Sky News he's ""pretty happy"" his royal journey will ""end up with a sword on my shoulder"".

He described the knighthood as a ""kind of challenge"", saying: ""I think that's the way I regard it, to do good in the world and do better than I've done before.""

Sir Brian co-founded the Save Me animal welfare organisation, and said of all his achievements, he was ""probably most proud of the tiny things that we have achieved for animals. It's an ongoing thing, and I'm hoping the knighthood will help"".

Dame Mary Quant made a Companion of Honour

Fashion designer Dame Mary Quant, who is widely credited with popularising the mini skirt, has been appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

The 92-year-old was granted the special award which is given to those who have made a major contribution to the arts, science, medicine or government.

Dame Mary joins an illustrious list of recipients including broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, actress Dame Judi Dench, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney and singer-songwriter Sir Elton John.

In 2014, she was made a dame for services to British fashion in the Queen's New Year Honours list and she was made an OBE in 1966.

Grayson Perry knighted for services to arts

Turner Prize-winning artist and TV presenter Grayson Perry has been knighted for services to the arts.

One of the UK's most renowned artists, the 62-year-old has turned his hand to pottery, sculptures, tapestries as well as writing and documentary presenting, and is known for cross-dressing and his commentary on gender and society.

After his knighthood was announced, Grayson tweeted a photo of himself dressed in armour, writing: ""It seems the news is out and I'm not quite ready.""

Countdown star Rachel Riley made an MBE for Holocaust campaign work

TV presenter and mathematician Rachel Riley has been recognised for her efforts to raise awareness of the Holocaust and combat antisemitism.

The 36-year-old Oxford University graduate was a vocal critic of Labour's handling of alleged antisemitism within the party and Jeremy Corbyn's conduct while leader.

In January 2019, she made a speech at a Westminster reception for the Holocaust Educational Trust addressing the abuse she received on social media as a public figure. She has also worked with the Centre for Countering Digital Hate to combat online abuse.

Frank Skinner thought honour may have been 'administrative error'

Broadcaster and comedian, Frank Skinner, whose real name is Christopher Graham Collins, has been recognised for his services to entertainment.

The 65-year-old said he had not yet told those closest to him that he has been made an MBE because he thought it may have been ""some sort of administrative error"".

He said: ""I deal mainly in laughs and applause and they disappear into the air quite quickly.

""So getting a proper medal that you can hold on to and polish regularly feels (it) has given my career a sense of permanence that I like.""

Actor David Harewood made OBE after raising awareness of mental health

Actor and broadcaster David Harewood, who found widespread fame playing CIA director David Estes in the US drama series Homeland, has been honoured for his services to drama and charity.

In 2019, Harewood created a one-off BBC documentary titled Psychosis And Me, which saw him retrace his steps and delve into his breakdown after being sectioned aged 23.

He has spoken about experiencing racism as a child and the subsequent intrusive feelings that followed him into adulthood.

This is England star Stephen Graham made OBE for services to drama

Stephen Graham has been honoured for services to drama across a three-decade career, that saw him win plaudits playing Irish, English and American criminals and police officers in various blockbuster Hollywood films and hit TV dramas.

Benedict Cumberbatch: Barbados may hit star's family with reparation claim over historical links to slave trade;Saturday 31 December 2022 12:29, UK;[];[];"The family of Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch is reportedly facing the prospect of legal action over its historical links to the slave trade in Barbados.

A top official on the Caribbean island, who has a leading role on its national commission for reparations, has told the Daily Telegraph it is in the ""earliest stages"" of efforts to seek damages from ancestors of the Cumberbatch estate.

The paper described how Joshua Cumberbatch, the seventh great-grandfather of Benedict Cumberbatch, bought the Cleland plantation in the north of the island in 1728.

It was home to 250 slaves until the abolition of slavery more than 100 years later.

The decision resulted in the family, and other slave-owning operations across the British Empire, being compensated by the UK government.

Slavery has been at the forefront of debate across many Caribbean communities in recent years, largely prompted by the build-up to the decision of Barbados to become a republic in 2021.

Image: Barbados became a republic in November 2021

Campaigners in Barbados are urging Tory MP Richard Drax, who inherited a sugar plantation on the island that was established with slave labour in the 1620s, to hand it back.

He could face an application for compensation if he refuses.

Even the Royal Family faces the prospect of a claim, according to officials, though they have stressed there is no sense of blame to be attached to living relatives for the actions of their ancestors.

David Comissiong, deputy chairman of the national commission on reparations, told the Daily Telegraph he would want to see ancestors of slave-owning families pay damages.

When asked directly if that would include the Cumberbatch clan, he responded: ""This is at the earliest stages. We are just beginning. A lot of this history is only really now coming to light.""

Benedict Cumberbatch himself has expressed contrition for his own family's links to slavery, suggesting it was the reason why he took the role of William Pitt the Younger in the film Amazing Grace which focused on the abolition of the trade.

Sky News editors give their verdicts on 2022 - and what might happen next;Saturday 31 December 2022 09:05, UK;[];[];"It's been a year of tumultuous change in politics, global relations, science, economics and, of course, the Royal family.

But what stood out, and what could happen next?

Sky News editors give their verdicts.

Beth Rigby, political editor

I've been political editor at Sky News since May 2019, and when I took the job I thought, if I am lucky, I might see the handover of power once or twice. I didn't expect to see three prime ministers through the door at Number 10 in four months. That gives you a perspective about the turmoil.

The Collins Dictionary revealed the word of 2022 to be permacrisis. That basically means the feeling of living through a period of war, inflation, and political turmoil, which encapsulates 2022.

The past 12 months have been insane politically. I have never known anything like it. But you have to set the political crisis in the context of external global events.

First it was COVID, then it was war in Ukraine, and what you can't predict is what might happen beyond domestic politics that somehow define the era that we are living in.

So, from my perspective, I don't think we're going to have the political chaos in 2023 that we had in 2022. But you can't discount anything in this game any more. And let's see what happens in those May local elections as well.

It was a bad year for the climate. Temperatures topped 40C in the UK, Atlantic hurricanes, catastrophic floods in Pakistan, and a global energy crisis that failed to galvanise a global climate deal in Egypt.

The UK even managed to destroy its international green reputation by approving a new coal mine - our first in 30 years.

In Silicon Valley, 2021's much-hyped visions of the metaverse were found almost universally underwhelming.

As cryptocurrencies spectacularly unravelled, so did confidence in Elon Musk as a reputable new owner of Twitter.

But major advances in artificial intelligence like OpenAI's GPT3 and DeepMind's AlphaFold reminded us tech still owns the future.

And as COVID retreated, 2022 confirmed the power of vaccines. The year's greatest vaccine breakthrough was the emergence of one that's up to 80% effective against malaria, a colossal advance in global health.

But outbreaks of mpox, ebola and avian flu challenge any suggestion that we can drop our guard against future pandemics.

2022 was the year when everything changed.

It was not just the war in Ukraine. NATO is effectively fighting Russia with everything but its own troops. That has huge implications however the war ends.

What is happening in China could be even more consequential. Xi Jinping is now emperor in all but name, entrenched in power indefinitely. A man with a sense of destiny. He wants the world order remade in China's image, replacing the liberal world order that has prevailed under American hegemony since the end of the Cold War.

Battle lines are drawn between East and West, fought with arms in Ukraine, diplomatically so far between the US and China, but with fears it could escalate over Taiwan. The most diplomacy is required to manage this state of affairs.

A titanic struggle is underway now in earnest; democracy vs autocracy and freedom vs dictatorship. Waged by diplomats and thinkers, but on the streets too across Iran and for a brief eruption in China.

Its outcome will define the world we live in.

It's been an extraordinary year - in a lot of short-term and long-term ways.

Whether it was what happened with Liz Truss, what happened in Ukraine, what's happening more broadly with questions over whether globalisation is as we know it, how China will proceed with zero COVID, and of course with energy.

But looking to 2023, I think things will get better in as much as we've already - possibly - passed the peak for inflation. And we've probably passed the peak of the Bank of England's rate at which they're increasing interest rates. The recession might not necessarily be all that deep.

The concern, though, is how it's being felt in particular households' pockets - especially in terms of the energy squeeze. And I don't know how that gets resolved now.

But it's not grim forever. There is an enormous opportunity here where the world is going to be potentially building all these new technologies. We have recently heard about nuclear fusion. We've heard about all of these different ways that we are making the world a better, cleaner, faster place.

But that takes some work. And so it takes a lot of building, and it takes a lot of kind of mining to get there.

Rhiannon Mills, royal correspondent

Looking back at the last three years, they have been quite extraordinary: the death of Prince Philip, everything that's happened with the Sussexes, and stories around Prince Andrew. It's been a rollercoaster.

And this was meant to be a year where things were got back to normal as COVID restrictions were relaxed, allowing the royals to be back out and about again doing tours. But the stories and events that unfolded, many of us just could not predict.

I've spoken to people within the palace and there's a sense of weariness, a sense of sadness and probably a sense of anger as well that Prince Harry and Meghan did their Netflix series.

Efforts were made to make them feel included around the Queen's death. King Charles, in his address to the nation, talked about the Queen's unerring ability to see the good in everyone.

And that week around her death, it felt like they were saying, ""Look, we're going to put everything to one side… we're all going to form a united front as a family."" And then Harry and Meghan have done this.

Someone at the palace said to me the other day, in some ways, the family are now being guided by a mantra that the Queen was always guided by, which was: ""Don't look at your feet… look to the horizon.""

Bus fares to be capped at £2 on thousands of routes in England - but only until end of March;Sunday 1 January 2023 00:37, UK;[];[];"Bus fares will be capped at £2 on more than 4,600 routes in England - but only until the end of March.

More than 130 operators outside London will charge no more than £2 for a single ticket from today, the Department for Transport said.

The move is being paid for by £60m in government funding.

Some of the biggest savings will be on routes between Leeds and Scarborough, where the usual price is around £13; Lancaster and Kendal, where it's £12.50; and Plymouth and Exeter - £9.20.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: ""By helping passengers outside London save almost a third off the average single bus ticket and taking two million cars off the road, the £2 bus fare cap is a fantastic way to start the new year.

""Buses are a key part of our vision for a clean, efficient and modern transport network that is affordable for everyone.

""That's why we're investing £60m to encourage everyone to hop on the bus and 'Get Around for £2'.""

Back in July, the Campaign For Better Transport published a report showing how funding pressures had led to more than a quarter of English bus services being axed in the past 10 years.

'Injecting new life into dwindling bus services'

Commenting on the new £2 fare cap, the organisation's director of external affairs and former Lib Dem transport minister Norman Baker said: ""Affordable bus travel really is a win-win.

""Capping bus fares in this way will help struggling households, cut traffic congestion and carbon emissions, and inject new life into dwindling bus services.

""We think the £2 cap should be extended indefinitely.""

New technology to catch train fare dodgers in 'known hotspots' across Northern network

Buses minister Richard Holden said it is hoped the cap would boost passenger numbers - paid-for fares are up around 80-85% of pre-pandemic levels, while concessionary travel is about two-thirds.

The DfT made more than £2bn available to bus operators to keep services in England running during the coronavirus pandemic.

'Just the fuel we need for economic growth'

But Mr Holden said: ""What I really want to do is try and move away from a situation where we're constantly having to put more money in to subsidise routes, and instead get people back on buses so that they can be more self-sustaining for the long term.""

Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""More than a third of small firms consider public transport important to their business.

""It is, therefore, encouraging to see support on bus fares as we battle tough economic conditions.

""This move will likely encourage shoppers to go to towns and cities - just the fuel we need for economic growth.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101015113/http://news.sky.com/story/bus-fares-to-be-capped-at-2-on-thousands-of-routes-in-england-but-only-until-end-of-march-12777646;Category-2: business and economy
World politics and power - the dates and trends that will help shape 2023 | Adam Boulton;Sunday 1 January 2023 03:17, UK;['adam boulton', '@adamboultontabb'];[];"The major events which come define a year, or even a decade, are seldom predicted.

Nobody foresaw the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001 which then swamped the leaderships of Tony Blair and George W Bush.

This time a year ago most experts doubted that Russia would go ahead with the vicious attack on Ukraine, which it then launched on 24 February.

Nor did finance ministers and the markets anticipate the cost of living crisis which the attack would precipitate and which would affect us all.

That does not mean it is a waste of time to look forward into 2023.

It is possible to identify dates and trends that will help shape the next 12 months.

Given that their economies are all enduring high prices, inflation and interest rates, it will be a relief to the political leaders of the G7 that no major, potentially government-ending, elections are due in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, the US or the UK in 2023.

The next reckoning with the voters in the US and the UK is set for 2024.

Next year the governing parties and their main opposition will be occupied trying to position themselves in the best possible position for victory.

Image: Donald Trump

January 2024 will see the formal start of the long race for the White House.

That means that 2023 will determine who the nominees are likely to be and whether Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be the contenders, in a rerun of 2020.

Both men have indicated that they intend to stand, even though Mr Trump would be 82 at the end of a second term and Mr Biden 86.

Mr Biden's candidacy needs Mr Trump to be in the race.

In surveys he is the best placed Democrat to defeat Mr Trump, again, but he would lose to almost any other Republican.

But Mr Trump's legal troubles are mounting.

Criminal charges over the 6 January 2021 insurrection could yet be added to the fraud prosecutions of his businesses in New York City, and the FBI investigation into the illegal removal of documents from the White House.

As Mr Trump's hopes of re-election wane, the Republicans seem to be moving towards an open selection process - with Ron DeSantis, Mike Pompeo, Nikki Haley and Mike Pence among those expected to make their ambitions clear in the coming months.

Mr Biden would then come under intense pressure from Democrats to stand down, in the hope that a new candidate, who looks like a potential winner, can emerge.

Narrowly in control of the new 118th Congress, Republicans plan to launch investigations into the president and, especially, his errant son Hunter Biden.

But either or both the Republicans and Democrats could be ripped apart by bitter internal divisions.

In the UK, after three Conservative prime ministers in a single year, Rishi Sunak ought to feel secure in his job until the election, but that is not the way the Conservative Party has done things recently.

The Conservatives begin the year trailing Labour by an astounding 25 points in opinion polls.

If the Tories do badly in the local elections on 4 May, a move to unseat the prime minister is a live possibility.

In the equivalent contests four years ago a swing against the Tories, putting them even with Labour in national equivalent vote share, was the beginning of the end for Theresa May, forced out a matter of months later.

Now, as in 2019, Boris Johnson is signalling his availability to take over from the wings.

Elections for councils in Northern Ireland have been moved two weeks later, otherwise exhaustive vote counting would be taking place on Coronation Day.

Image: Stormont

There may well have been a fresh set of elections to the gridlocked assembly at Stormont.

The Westminster government has set 19 January as the deadline for cross community power-sharing to resume.

There is no sign that it will because the DUP is demanding the abandonment of the agreement with the EU concerning post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.

In the run up to the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement in April there will be an intense international focus on how Mr Sunak's government handles this difficult stand-off between the UK and the EU.

President Biden likes to celebrate his Irish roots and recently appointed Joseph Kennedy III as a special envoy to Northern Ireland.

He has feted President Emmanuel Macron of France on a state visit while Prime Minister Sunak has yet to visit the White House.

European Union solidarity will also be celebrated on 22 January when France and Germany mark the 60th anniversary of their Elysee treaty, which formally welded the axis which has driven the EU ever since.

The European project will deepen further at the start of the year when recent EU joiner Croatia becomes part of the eurozone currency and the Schengen freedom of movement area.

Elsewhere in the Balkans, tensions are mounting again between Kosovo and Serbia.

Elections are due in both Turkey and Greece this summer.

The increasingly autocratic Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is fighting to extend his 20 years in office, against a resurgent opposition.

Meanwhile Kyriakos Mitsotakis is on course to stay in power, but with diminished control in parliament.

He could yet dramatically boost his popularity by securing the return to Athens of the Elgin Marbles, now more properly referred to as the Parthenon Statues.

Under the chairmanship of George Osborne the British Museum is warming on a deal. That in turn would leave Mr Sunak with a headache since full restitution would require an act of parliament.

On 1 January, Lula da Silva will be inaugurated as Brazil's new president. The left-winger has pledged to reverse his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's environmentally destructive policies.

Presidents and prime ministers come and go, but the UK has not had a change in head of state, or a coronation, for over 70 years.

There will be a double bank holiday around the crowning on 6 May.

Lionesses, Emma Raducanu and the Premier League: Who and what to look out for in 2023;Sunday 1 January 2023 04:11, UK;['nick powell', '@nicksky'];[];"What chance the Lionesses dominating the sporting reviews this time next year, as they have been in the last week or so?

Every chance.

Transformational coach Sarina Wiegman has persuaded the FA to fly her Euros winners business class to the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand - and they have the ability, and crucially the mentality, to do the business again - even though the USA, above all, will strengthen the opposition.

Image: The Lionesses celebrating their victory in London

Backheel goalscoring Euros heroine Alessia Russo could be part of another double - at club level. Both the men and women of Manchester United have that deliver-on-the-day quality that can win an FA Cup.

Forgive a boring notion, but Manchester City's men and Chelsea's women remain the likeliest league champions, despite strengthening challenges.

In the Scottish Premiership, Celtic's nine-point league is too great for new Rangers coach Michael Beale to bridge.

And in Europe? Will goal machine Erling Haaland deliver a long-awaited first Champions League for Manchester City. With a problem or two dogging most of their strongest rivals, this is surely the time for boss Pep Guardiola.

In the year's first big global event, Novak Djokovic is rightly hot favourite to win the Australian Open tennis and equal Rafael Nadal's record 22 Grand Slam wins.

British fans have reason to hope Emma Raducanu starts a sharp climb from 80th in the world rankings, if she hits it off with new coach Sebastian Sachs and - importantly - fitness guru Jez Green.

The Six Nations kicks off the international rugby union year - France's men and England's women to win - but the autumn men's World Cup will dominate.

New coaches for Wales and England add to the fascination, but if Ireland are ever going to win it, this is the year.

Also going for World Cup glory are England's male and female cricketers in the 50-over and 20-over versions respectively. The men can retain the trophy they won dramatically in 2019; the women may find Australia too strong.

In this summer's Ashes, will Australia provide a rude awakening for Ben Stokes's new-look all-conquering swashbuckling England? Instinct says the Stokes bandwagon will roll on for a bit yet.

There are British world championship gold medals in prospect in athletics (Jake Wightman and Keely Hodgkinson on the up), gymnastics (likewise the Gadirova twins, Jessica and Jennifer) and swimming (Adam Peaty against the rest again, but can he still do it at 27? Maybe just.)

In F1, as ever, so much depends on the cars and the rules, but Mercedes British pair Lewis Hamilton and rising star George Russell may find World Champion Max Verstappen still too tough a nut to crack, though they should get closer than in 2022.

And two individuals to finish with - 6ft 9 Tyson Fury and 5ft 9 Rory McIlroy.

Ukrainian heavyweight Oleksandr Usyk will be a tougher test than anyone Fury boxed in 2022, but the ""Gypsy King"" hits as hard as he talks and should prevail again.

Anita Pointer: Singer from the Pointer Sisters dies aged 74;Sunday 1 January 2023 08:23, UK;[];[];"Anita Pointer, a member of Grammy-winning group the Pointer Sisters - whose hits included I'm So Excited and Jump (For My Love) - has died of cancer aged 74.

Her publicist Roger Neal said she died surrounded by her family at her Beverly Hills home on Saturday.

The Pointer Sisters - at different times including Bonnie, Anita and their siblings June and Ruth - formed in Oakland, California, and first found success in the 1970s.

The group won three Grammy awards and were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994.

Ruth is the only surviving sister.

June died in 2006, while Bonnie - who left the group in 1977 and pursued a solo career - died in 2020 aged 69.

Anita's daughter Jada died in 2003, when the singer took over raising her granddaughter, Roxie McKain Pointer.

The family said in a statement: ""While we are deeply saddened by the loss of Anita, we are comforted in knowing she is now with her daughter Jada and her sisters June & Bonnie and at peace.

""She was the one that kept all of us close and together for so long. Her love of our family will live on in each of us.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101084743/http://news.sky.com/story/anita-pointer-singer-from-the-pointer-sisters-dies-aged-74-12777689;Category-5: entertainment and culture

Strikes and flood damage to bring more rail disruption this week;Monday 2 January 2023 01:19, UK;[];[];"The first week of 2023 will bring more disruption for rail passengers, with strikes and flood damage likely to affect travel.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union at Network Rail and 14 train operators will take part in two 48-hour strikes - affecting journeys on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

Members of Aslef, the union representing train drivers, will also strike on Thursday.

There is further disruption for passengers travelling between Carlisle and Glasgow, with the West Coast Main Line out of action until 6 January due to damage from flooding late last month.

An embankment under the railway needs ""extensive work to stabilise and repair the foundations of the tracks to allow the railway to safely reopen"", Network Rail has said.

Engineers are working to remove landslip material on a 40m-long section of the line and reinforcing it with more than 200 tonnes of new stone.

The strikes by the RMT union and Aslef will see tens of thousands of rail employees stop work, and passengers have been warned of ""significant disruption"" to services.

On RMT strike days, around half of the network will be closed, with about 20% of services running.

Those that are running will start later and finish earlier than usual, with passengers told they should not travel unless absolutely necessary.

'We are exhausted and deflated' - nurses' stories from picket lines

Problems are likely to extend into Sunday 8 January as striking workers return to duty.

The strike by Aslef will affect 15 operators and will also see a ""very significantly reduced"" timetable.

Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We keep coming to the table but the table is bare.

""Six months after we asked for a pay rise for train drivers who have, now, not had one for nearly four years, we have still not had an offer from the train companies which employ us.

""The ball is in their court. The companies, or this Tory government which stands behind them, could end this dispute now by making a serious and sensible pay offer. It is up to them.""

Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT said the government had blocked a deal to end the dispute, adding that he is willing to negotiate but first needs an offer on pay, jobs and conditions that members can vote on.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The government has demonstrated it is being reasonable and stands ready to facilitate a resolution to rail disputes. It's time the unions came to the table and played their part as well.

""Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term - worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.

""Unions should step back from this strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute.""

The rail dispute is one of many threatening to deliver a winter of discontent as unions seek pay rises in line with the rate of inflation to help shield their members from the cost of living crisis.

Nurses, ambulance workers, Border Force, Royal Mail employees, and highways workers are also among those who have been striking in recent months.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230102024805/http://news.sky.com/story/strikes-and-flood-damage-to-bring-more-rail-disruption-this-week-12778191;Category-3: environment
British yoga teacher says it's a 'miracle' she's alive after boat propeller left her seriously injured;Monday 2 January 2023 04:34, UK;[];[];"A British yoga instructor says it is a ""miracle"" she is alive after being seriously injured by a boat propeller while snorkelling in Mexico.

Amor Armitage, 37, was snorkelling and free-diving off the Caribbean island of Cozumel on 17 December with her husband Chase and others when she was struck.

At some point, she left the group in the water to return to the boat but, as she went to climb up the ladder, there was music playing and the captain did not see her.

She said: ""I suddenly realise the boat has started moving and I'm unable to say anything.

""Words just didn't come out, as fear froze me.

""Everything seems to slow down as I feel the boat's propeller hitting my abdomen, genitals and legs.

""My body feels heavy and I see the boat moving away from me.

""Out of my gut comes a visceral scream, asking for help.""

Image: Amor Armitage's main injuries were to her legs and her abdomen

She said her leg felt ""broken"", her body felt ""mutilated"" and she felt ""pain that is out of this world"" but she managed to pull herself up into the boat.

Then her husband, stuntman Chase, arrived on the scene and she said it was his words and love that kept her alive on the journey to hospital.

""He did his best to keep me with him and I truly feel that if it wasn't for my angel Chase, I would not be here today,"" she added.

But as well as her husband, Ms Armitage could have a blood clot to thank - she said doctors told her afterwards that a two-inch blood clot in her artery had prevented her from bleeding to death.

Ms Armitage has had three major surgeries and a number of blood transfusions since her arrival in hospital, where she will remain for the foreseeable future.

Her main injuries were to her abdomen and her legs - she described part of her inner thigh as ""completely scrambled"" and her quads, tendons and tibial bone as ""sliced"".

""I am stable yet still considered high risk.

""I experience pain daily and my left leg still doesn't move or respond fully.

""My toes have gained a little bit more responsiveness and this makes me extremely happy,"" she said.

The couple's holiday was not covered by insurance and family and friends are trying to raise money for Ms Armitage's transport back to the UK and for her recovery.

It is thought she may not be able to work for at least six months, and her husband will also need to take time off work to help her recover.

She said the hospital bills are ""huge... and the costs seem to increase by day"".

Millions of Britons would find it hard or impossible to cover an extra £20 in monthly expenditure;Monday 2 January 2023 03:38, UK;[];[];"More than a third of adults in the UK would find it difficult or impossible to cover a £20 increase in their monthly expenditure, according to new research.

Citizens Advice commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults between 5 and 9 December and found that one in four would find it somewhat difficult to cover the increase, 7% would find it very difficult and 4% would find it impossible.

Also among those who would find the extra cost difficult or impossible were 58% of those on benefits, 57% of those using pre-payment meters for their energy supply, and 47% of people of colour.

Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said: ""Millions of households are at financial breaking point: running down savings, going without bare essentials and turning to food banks to get by.

""We're already seeing record numbers of people coming to us for crisis support and this research shows people simply cannot cut back any further.

""Current government support is a sticking plaster which is quickly being exhausted due to the increased pressures people are facing.

""Without further targeted intervention, we risk another year of despair for millions of people.""

The survey also found that a third of people have had to dip into their savings in the last three months to get by, and more than half of them had either run out of savings or expect to do so in the next three months.

10 predictions about the future that turned out to be very wrong;Monday 2 January 2023 05:14, UK;[];[];"Jump in your hovercraft and nip to the airport for your holiday on the moon - don't worry about breakfast, there's a pill for that. But don't think about checking your flight times online - the internet will never catch on.

The past is a curious place - and the future imagined there is curiouser still. Here are 10 of the predictions that didn't quite meet the mark.

IT'LL NEVER CATCH ON - EXCEPT IT DID

The internet is just a fad

In the early days of the internet, a number of people saw it as a flash-in-the-pan idea. In 1995, Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, said: ""I predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.""

Mr Metcalfe proceeded to eat his words - literally - during his keynote speech at the 1999 International World Wide Web Conference, where he blended up a copy of his printed column with some liquid and drank it.

Viewers will tire of TV

Hollywood film producer Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century Fox was sure the appeal of TV would be short-lived. In 1946, he said: ""Television won't be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.""

According to Ofcom, UK adults spent nearly a third of their waking hours watching TV and online video content in 2020.

Online shopping will flop

The same article forecast ""remote shopping, while entirely feasible, will flop because women like to get out of the house, like to handle merchandise, like to be able to change their minds"".

While internet sales have dipped since their pandemic peak, in October 2022 they made up 26% of total retail sales in the UK.

Time was more accurate when it came to supermarket shopping, saying ""the housewife should be able to switch on to the local supermarket on the video phone, examine grapefruit and price them, all without stirring from her living room"".

Its take on the future of domestic gendered roles was a little off the mark, however.

NOT YET - BUT MAYBE SOON

The robot worker

The obsession with technology taking over human jobs is a tale as old as the industrial revolution, stoked in recent years by the acceleration of AI.

In 1982, writers in the Omni Future Almanac predicted workers including dry cleaners, farm workers and shop cashiers would be replaced by robots. While the robot job apocalypse isn't quite on our doorstep, automation means things such as supermarket checkouts and lifts no longer need a dedicated operator, and industries including the car industry have increasingly expanded their robot workforce.

A life of leisure

In 1966, Time magazine predicted that computers would be filling the roles of all but high-level executives, leaving 90% of the population to live a state-subsidised life of leisure.

""With government benefits, even non-working families will have, by one estimate, an annual income of $30,000 to $40,000,"" the article said.

GIVE SCIENCE A BIT MORE TIME

Fly me to the moon

Predictions of holidays in space aren't just the preserve of 60s sci-fi films. In 2010, Eric Anderson of Space Adventures told Space.com: ""By 2020 you'll have seen private citizens circumnavigate the moon.""

Elon Musk went further, saying: ""I'm going to go out on a limb and say that by 2020 there will be serious plans to go to Mars with people.""

Common cold cured

Sniffles and sneezes would be ""only a memory"" by 2000, Arkansas physician Dr Lowry McDaniel predicted in 1955. But scientists continue to be stymied by the fact there are at least 160 strains of rhinovirus, the pathogens that cause colds.

Humans will live to 150

California biologist Bernard Strehler sounded a warning in 1974: humans would soon live to 150, and society needed to prepare for it. The record for the oldest person is held by Jeanne Louise Calment, who died aged 122 in 1997.

IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT

The death of the letters C, X and Q

In a piece for the Ladies' Home Journal in 1900, John Elfreth Watkins, the curator of mechanical technology at the Smithsonian Institution, looked forward one hundred years and predicted the demise of the letters C, X and Q.

""They will be abandoned because unnecessary,"" he wrote - predicting newspapers would have spearheaded a move to phonetic spelling and Russian would be the world's second language.

No square meals

Like Violet Beauregarde chomping on her three-course chewing gum in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, people have been preoccupied for decades with a replacement for preparing and cooking food.

In 1966, California's Long beach Press-Telegram predicted future pantries would be stocked with freeze-dried meat, eggs and pre-sliced apples, ready to be rehydrated into meals in a flash.

New York Times science editor Waldemar Kaempffert foresaw a world where all food ""even soup and milk"" would be delivered to people's homes in frozen bricks, and chemical factories would convert ""rayon underwear"" into sweets.

While there's a market for dehydrated meals, they are mostly the preserve of astronauts and outdoor adventurers - and lockdown spurred a return to home cooking and whole foods.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230102054731/http://news.sky.com/story/10-predictions-about-the-future-that-turned-out-to-be-very-wrong-12763530;Category-6: science and technology

English football chiefs to gather for summit on ‘new deal’ for finances;Monday 2 January 2023 18:09, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"The six most powerful figures in English football administration will meet this week to hammer out plans for a 'new deal' for the sport's finances.

Sky News has learnt that the chairs and chief executives of the Football Association (FA), Premier League and English Football League (EFL) are to meet collectively for the first time on Friday as they seek to establish common ground ahead of the establishment of an independent regulator.

Football insiders said this week's talks were expected to cover a broad array of issues, including the FA handing over responsibility for negotiating its broadcast rights deals to the Premier League.

This could entail the commercial team at English football's top flight taking over the sale of television and digital distribution rights to the world's oldest club football competition for the first time, as well as those for the England men's and women's teams.

One source said that in return, the FA could absorb the grassroots and community projects currently undertaken by the Premier League.

Another area for discussion would be the English football calendar, with the date of the FA Community Shield - the traditional annual curtain-raiser - potentially being shifted.

Friday's meeting will be the first significant engagement for Alison Brittain, the former Whitbread chief executive, who takes over as Premier League chairman this week.

Also present will be Richard Masters, the Premier League chief executive; Debbie Hewitt and Mark Bullingham, respectively the FA chair and CEO; and Rick Parry and Trevor Birch, their counterparts at the EFL.

While the three organisations have already engaged extensively on future reforms to the game's governance and finances, several insiders said it would be the first time that the six chairs and CEOs had gathered for talks.

The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that Rishi Sunak had given the green light to a new independent football regulator, with details to be outlined in a white paper likely to be published shortly.

Commuters hit with five days of rail strikes, amid fears millions of Britons may ditch trains for good;Tuesday 3 January 2023 02:10, UK;['connor sephton', '@connorsephton'];[];"Strikes by rail and road staff are set to cause extensive disruption to commuters returning to work after the Christmas break - amid fears that continued walkouts could cause a years-long slump in demand for train travel.

About 40,000 members of the RMT union from Network Rail and 14 train operators are taking industrial action today, tomorrow, Friday and Saturday - meaning most services nationwide will not run.

Train drivers are also set to stage a one-day walkout on Thursday, meaning the UK's rail network will be crippled throughout the first working week of 2023. Passengers have been urged to only travel if necessary.

In other developments, more than 100 road traffic officers and control room operators working for National Highways in England are launching their own 48-hour strike today.

While this walkout is expected to have little impact on the network, roads are expected to be busy on both days as commuters ditch the train and head to the office in their cars.

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has warned that strikes on the railways will continue until the government stops ""blocking"" a deal to resolve the bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

The union claims that - despite its best efforts over the festive period - rail employers have not arranged any formal negotiations.

Mr Lynch also alleges that an ""unprecedented level of ministerial interference"" is preventing progress from being made, and he said RMT representatives are ""available around the clock for talks"".

RMT strike days will see approximately half of the network shut down, with just 20% of normal services expected to run. These trains will also start later and finish much earlier than usual, with journeys only possible between 7.30am and 6.30pm.

According to The Times, ministers fear that millions of passengers will give up on train travel altogether as a result of the worst week of rail disruption in 30 years.

A government source told the newspaper: ""This is an act of self-harm - a generation of passengers will just write off the railways. We're talking about permanent scarring. The longer the strikes continue, the greater the risk.""

But Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan, who represents train drivers, said workers have been left with little choice but to strike because they haven't had a pay rise since April 2019 - with high levels of inflation resulting in a real-terms pay cut.

Stressing that his union is always happy to negotiate with train operators, he added: ""The ball is in their court. The companies, or this Tory government which stands behind them, could end this dispute now by making a serious and sensible pay offer. It is up to them.""

The Department for Transport has warned that passengers have ""rightly had enough of rail strikes"" - and called on unions to stop taking industrial action.

A spokesperson said: ""The government has demonstrated it is being reasonable and stands ready to facilitate a resolution to rail disputes. It's time the unions came to the table and played their part as well.

""Inflation-matching pay increases for all public-sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term - worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.""

The winter storm had left thousands of homes without power, and hundreds of roads closed across northern California and parts of neighbouring Nevada.

These 10 words have been 'banished' for 2023 - and there are some you use;Tuesday 3 January 2023 05:52, UK;[];[];"Moving forward, irregardless of how you may feel about it, a university in the US has added a number of words and phrases to a ""banished"" list.

Every year since 1976, Lake Superior State University has its compilation of choices that are to be banned for the entire incoming year.

More than 1,000 everyday terms have made it onto the roll of shame - some more than once.

And this year, sees GOAT (the acronym for Greatest Of All Time), top the poll.

Also included were...

Inflection point

Gaslighting

Quiet quitting

Moving forward

Amazing

Absolutely

Does that make sense?

Irregardless

It is what it is

For its 2023 list, Lake Superior State University judges reviewed more than 1,500 submissions before coming up with their top ten.

A university spokesperson said, of the number one nominee, GOAT: ""The many nominators didn't have to be physicists or grammarians to determine the literal impossibility and technical vagueness of this wannabe superlative.

""Yet it's bestowed on everyone from Olympic gold medallists to Jeopardy champions.""

Words and terms banned in 2022 included ""no worries"", ""you're on mute,"" and ""wait, what?""

Others over the years have included ""vis-a-vis"", ""information superhighway"", ""I'm like,"" and, for a nation some might say not as 'skilled' at football punditry as the UK, bizarrely also outlawed was ""giving 110 percent"".

Perhaps less surprising in 1983, one of the forbidden words was ""Reaganomics"" - the much overused term at the time, for the economic policies promoted by US President Ronald Reagan.

Image: President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky

Also predictable, was the ban on ""Y2K"" in 1999, followed hot-on-the-heels by ""millennium"" in 2000.

And almost certainly to the relief of one William Jefferson Clinton, in 1999 ""Monica Lewinsky"" was added to the don't-say list.

The university has even copyrighted the concept of its Banished Words List to ""uphold, protect, and support excellence in language by encouraging avoidance of words and terms that are overworked, redundant, oxymoronic, clichéd, illogical, nonsensical-and otherwise ineffective, baffling, or irritating"".

Five more asylum seekers have been diagnosed with diphtheria, the UK Health Security Agency has revealed.

This means a total of 67 people have been found to have the condition this year.

The UKHSA says the new cases were recorded between 12 and 18 December.

In the seven-day period before, five cases were added.

Fifty of the cases were recorded in the South East, six were in London, and there were fewer than five in each of the following areas: East of England, West Midlands, South West, North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, the latest report said.

Last month, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said that asylum seekers with diphtheria symptoms would be put into isolation.

Earth, Wind & Fire drummer Fred White dies aged 67;Tuesday 3 January 2023 09:37, UK;[];[];"Tributes are being paid to former Earth, Wind & Fire drummer Fred White following his death at the age of 67.

Earth, Wind & Fire were founded in the late 1960s by White's brother Maurice, who died aged 74 in 2016. The band featured a range of different musicians throughout the years and spanned genres from R'n'B and soul to pop and disco.

Fred White was among the early members of the US group and played on many of their hit albums and songs, including September, Boogie Wonderland, Saturday Nite and Shining Star.

His death was announced by his brother Verdine, who was also a member of the band. He paid tribute to ""an amazing and talented family member"" in a statement shared on Instagram.

""Dearest family, friends and fans, our family is saddened today with the loss of an amazing and talented family member, our beloved brother Frederick Eugene 'Freddie' White,"" he wrote. ""He joins our brothers Maurice, Monte and Ronald in heaven and is now drumming with the angels!

""Child protege, member of the EWF ORIGINAL 9, with gold records at the young age of 16 years old! He was brother number four in the family line-up.

""But more than that at home and beyond he was the wonderful bro that was always entertaining and delightfully mischievous!

""And we could always count on him to make a seemingly bad situation more light-hearted! He will live in our hearts forever, rest in power beloved Freddie!!

""We thank you all for your love, blessings and support at this time. Soar high baby bro, we love you to the shining and back!""

White began drumming professionally as a teenager and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 alongside fellow members of Earth, Wind & Fire.

He also featured on tracks by American singers Donny Hathaway and Jennifer Holliday.

In his memory, Earth, Wind & Fire's official Instagram page shared a video of White solo drumming.

The post was captioned: ""In memoriam: Fred White, 1955-2022. Seen here soloing during our performance of Runnin', during our Tour of the World in 1979, at Rockpalast in Essen, Germany. Rest in love.""

American singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz was among those paying tribute, remembering the drummer as a ""true king"".

Commenting on Verdine White's Instagram post, Kravitz wrote: ""Sending my love and deepest condolences to you and the family.

""I was blessed to have been in his presence and blessed to have been influenced by him. A true king. Rest in power.""

Ski resorts forced to shut as Europe starts new year with record-breaking temperatures;Tuesday 3 January 2023 12:18, UK;[];[];"Unseasonably warm conditions and sparse snowfall has forced some low-level ski resorts to shut in recent days - as Europe started the new year with record-breaking temperatures.

Bare mountainsides and slushy runs have reignited fears over the effect of climate change on many mountain towns that rely on winter tourism.

Temperatures in France at the end of the year were the warmest for 25 years, according to national forecaster Meteo France.

It was a similar picture in Switzerland, where a weather station in the Jura range saw a record daily average of 18.1C on New Year's Day.

The start of 2023 saw January temperature records broken in a number of European countries, with one meteorologist calling it ""hard to comprehend"".

The northern Alps and French Pyrenees are particularly struggling for snow and some resorts, after barely being open a month, have had to close until the situation improves.

One of the latest to shut was Ax 3 Domaines, near France's border with Andorra, which closed on Saturday after only a few weeks.

Le Gets and Morzine, part of the popular Portes de Soleil area, each currently have only two runs open.

""There was a good start to the season with a cold wave in mid-December, which provided some white to pretty much everyone,"" said Laurent Reynaud of the Domaines Skiables de France, which represents resorts and lift operators.

Switzerland's Adelboden, which on Saturday hosts World Cup skiing, is having to run the race on 100% artificial snow this year.

The Swiss resort of Splugen-Tambo also said on Monday that it was closing ""until further notice"".

""Unfortunately, due to the lack of snow, the heavy rainfall and high temperatures, we have to close our ski resort from January 2, 2023, until further notice,"" it said in a statement.

There is still some decent snow available - the southern Alps and slopes over 2,200m have close to normal snowfall - but skiers and snowboarders will have to head high.

Many lower altitude towns stand to lose out however, and are increasingly planning for a future that focusses more on year-round activities such as hiking.

'Truly unprecedented'

Germany, Poland and Czech Republic are among other countries that have already broken temperature records this year, with conditions more reminiscent of spring.

Warsaw recorded 18.9C on 1 January - shattering the previous record by over 5C, Ohlsbach in southwest Germany had 19.4C, and Bilbao in northern Spain recorded 25.1C.

Prague also had its warmest New Year's Eve in 247 years of records, with temperatures reaching 17.7C.

London-based meteorologist Scott Duncan tweeted on New Year's Day: ""We just observed the warmest January day on record for many countries in Europe. Truly unprecedented in modern records.""

Wim Thiery, climate science professor at the University of Brussels, said the jet stream bringing warm air from subtropical areas into Europe had helped generate the warm temperatures.

But he warned the effect of climate change would radically change winter tourism in Europe.

Ken Block: Rally driver and YouTube star dies in snowmobile accident;Tuesday 3 January 2023 09:44, UK;[];[];"Pro rally driver Ken Block, who later became an internet sensation with his daring stunts behind the wheel, died after a snowmobile accident, his team Hoonigan Racing said on Monday.

""It's with our deepest regrets that we can confirm that Ken Block passed away in a snowmobile accident today,"" Hoonigan said in a statement on Instagram.

""Ken was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband. He will be incredibly missed.""

He was 55-years-old.

The accident happened in Utah's Wasatch County and the Sheriff's Office said that Block was riding on a steep slope when the snowmobile upended and landed on top of him.

""He was pronounced deceased at the scene from injuries sustained in the accident,"" they said in a statement, adding that he was riding in a group but was alone when the accident occurred.

Having begun his rallying career in 2005, Block was named Rookie of the Year in the Rally America Championship. He competed in the World Rally Championship and won several rallycross medals at the X Games.

He also appeared on two episodes of Top Gear in 2016.

The American co-founded sportswear company DC Shoes and produced the Gymkhana video series, which featured him driving on dangerous tracks and obstacle courses. The series racked up millions of views on YouTube.

His last YouTube video posted two weeks ago explored behind the scenes of the 2022 American Rally Association season and was titled ""Go fast risk every thang"".

The video description explained the title: ""This is the mantra that we often have to use when racing rally. Sometimes it leads to champagne ceremonies, sometimes to crashed cars.""

In recent posts on Instagram, he shared photos of snowmobiles blanketed in snow.

Block said in the caption: ""This is how some mornings at my ranch in Utah look this time of year - freshly coated with snow!""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103123202/http://news.sky.com/story/ken-block-rally-driver-and-youtube-star-dies-in-snowmobile-accident-12778868;Category-4: sports
UK airlines more likely to have delays than their rivals in Europe and around the world;Tuesday 3 January 2023 12:16, UK;[];[];"UK airlines are more likely to have delays compared to their rivals in Europe and around the world, figures for the past year show.

A British operator didn't make any of the leaderboards when the aviation analytics company Cirium put together the top 10 airlines and airports for avoiding delays in 2022.

Cirium put together separate leaderboards for airlines in Europe and around the world, and a single leaderboard for airports across the globe.

The company has not yet released the full rankings below the top 10 but figures show that at least 25% of flights from UK airlines were delayed, since the 10th ranked airline in Europe had a 75% punctuality rating.

The global leader for timeliness is Azul Brazilian Airlines, with 88.93% of arrivals being on time, followed by two Japanese operators, All Nippon Airways with 88.61% and Japan Airlines at 88%.

Haneda Airport, also in Japan, was ranked the most reliable airport for punctuality, with 90.33% of departures taking off on time.

Kempegowda International Airport in India came second with 84.08% of departures being on time.

On the European leaderboard, Spanish airlines claimed the top four spots, with Iberia ranked first place for 85.87% of its flights arriving on time.

Air Europa came second, with 84.1% of planes touching down on time, followed by Iberia Express at 83.8%, and Vueling with 82.04%.

Austrian Airlines were ranked the fifth most reliable in Europe with 82% punctuality, followed by Norwegian Air Shuttle at 81.29%.

An airline's flight is classed as on time if it arrives no later than 15 minutes after it is expected, and for an airport if it departs within 15 minutes of the scheduled time.

NHS hospital staff told to return Christmas bonuses after being paid them by mistake;Tuesday 3 January 2023 14:29, UK;[];[];"NHS hospital staff have been told to return their Christmas bonuses after it was paid to them by mistake.

A number of employees at the Milton Keynes University Hospital in Buckinghamshire were told the day before Christmas Eve that the money would have to be repaid as they were not eligible for the payment.

The hospital had operated a scheme between July and December last year where staff would receive either a £150 payment or a £300 payment in their December wages if they worked an additional five to 10 shifts over those months.

However, some staff who had not worked the extra shifts were paid the money anyway in error.

A hospital spokesperson told Sky News it was not clear how many staff had incorrectly received the payment but it was believed to be a ""handful"".

They added those who received the payment were informed as soon as the problem was identified and were told the money would need to be repaid.

Staff can pay back the money through an ""affordable repayment programme"", the spokesperson said.

Joe Harrison, the chief executive of Milton Keynes University Hospital, and Kate Jarman, director of corporate affairs, have apologised on Twitter.

Mr Harrison wrote: ""Really sorry we have got this wrong. We will make sure we minimise the financial impact for those affected and will change this scheme to make it easier to use and administrate in future.""

Ms Jarman said on Twitter: ""We've made a bit of a mess of an additional shift payment that's affected a small number of people's pay @MKHospital - if you're affected you'll already know.

""So, so sorry this has happened. We are unpicking exactly how it did but it's really upset and angered those affected completely understandably.

""Again, I am really sorry. It shouldn't have happened. There's a little bit more info in today's weekly message but we are still trying to understand what happened and why. More info to come but just wanted to acknowledge it and apologise.""

How an airline passenger tracked the 'wild ride' of her lost luggage;Tuesday 3 January 2023 14:49, UK;[];[];"The chance of your luggage going missing is among the most anxiety-inducing facets of any flight, especially one taken amid the holiday rush.

Unfortunately for Valerie Szybala, that's precisely the scenario that she began 2023 contending with after a domestic US journey from Chicago back to her home in Washington.

In a viral Twitter thread beginning with a post that's amassed more than 20 million views since New Year's Day, she documented the ""wild ride"" her bag took on its eventual return to her - all thanks to an Apple AirTag.

While the small, disc-shaped devices have come under fire over fears that people can use them for criminal or malicious purposes, they are designed to be attached to keys, wallets, and other belongings to help find lost items.

Informed by airline United that her bag had not made it on to the flight to Washington, and safe in the knowledge an AirTag was attached, Ms Szybala took up the offer of having it delivered by courier.

Its apparent journey from that point on was one she could scarcely believe.

The apartment complex

Concerned about the whereabouts of her luggage, Ms Szybala investigated an apartment complex the AirTag suggested was housing her belongings.

On 1 January, three days after the bag was said to have departed the airport, she tweeted it had been ""sitting in a residential complex for over a day"".

""Out back by the dumpsters, I have found other emptied United Airlines bags,"" she added.

Twitter Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this. Open Privacy Options

Ms Szybala shared screenshots of a conversation she had with a support representative from the airline, who had assured her the bag was still on course for delivery.

""I am sorry, I don't know why it is showing there,"" they said of the AirTag's assertion that it was elsewhere, even suggesting that Ms Szybala ""calm down"".

HOW DO AIRTAGS WORK? AirTags are loaded with what Apple calls its U1 chip, which is essentially able to ""ping"" any other Apple device out in the wild to triangulate the precise location of the AirTag itself. Because there are so many iPhones out there, this chip means the AirTag doesn't rely on more familiar location tech like GPS. To see where an AirTag is, users open the Find My app on an iPhone - and newer handsets can get precise on-screen, SatNav-style directions. Misplaced AirTags can be put into a ""lost mode"", which allows users to enter a custom message that displays on someone's phone when they hold it near the lost AirTag - like contact details, for example. It all sounds pretty convenient, and when used as intended as in the case of missing luggage, it can prove excellent value. But some have expressed concern about the gadget's potential to track people rather than items, with criminals or stalkers theoretically capable of slipping one into someone's bag or even on their car. Apple insists it has made AirTags ""stalkerproof"", because the Find My app will alert people if one of the gadgets that does not belong to them, and is assigned to someone else, is detected for an extended period of time. But the company is the focus of a class-action lawsuit in San Francisco, brought by two women alleging the devices made it easier for ex-partners to track them down.

A trip to McDonald's

Later that day came a ""major update"" regarding Ms Szybala's luggage.

Sharing a picture of her bag's position on a map, she said: ""For the first time since Friday my AirTag (and hopefully luggage) appears to be on the move… it's at a McDonalds?

""The plot thickens.""

The McDonald's in question appeared to be on Rhode Island Avenue, near a shopping centre bearing its name.

It eventually left the fast food restaurant, returning to the apartment complex.

On the road again

The second day of the new year brought hope that the luggage would find its way to Ms Szybala's home.

""My AirTag is on the move! It's about 16 miles outside of the city in the suburbs,"" she tweeted.

""Hopefully this means it is on a delivery run?""

Unfortunately, her hopeful fingers crossed emoji was misplaced, as the bag ended up going back to the flats.

The reunion

Following the bag's latest return to the flats, Ms Szybala enlisted a ""little posse"" - including local news crews - to go with her to the building.

A text message purporting to be the courier followed, telling her that the bag would be delivered on the day and encouraging her to ""call me or text me if any questions"".

""It's sketchy, and it doesn't really match with what my AirTag tracking said, but I immediately called the number,"" revealed Ms Szybala.

""The dude who picked up was around the corner, so he drove back to meet me near the building.

""He looked a little surprised to have two news crews filming. He asked if he was in trouble or something, but at that moment I was too happy to have my bag back to ask more questions.""

Ms Szybala encouraged her followers, who were left on tenterhooks by her day-to-day sleuthing, to use tracking devices on their luggage in case a similar situation befalls them.

Woman who made Asian grooming gang claims convicted of perverting the course of justice;Tuesday 3 January 2023 15:01, UK;[];[];"A woman who claimed she had been the victim of an Asian grooming gang has been convicted of perverting the course of justice.

Eleanor Williams, 22, put pictures on Facebook and claimed she had been groomed, trafficked and beaten - but prosecutors said her injuries were self-inflicted with a hammer.

Her post was shared more than 100,000 times and led to demonstrations in her home town and a visit by former English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson to ""investigate"".

A jury at Preston Crown Court today found her guilty of eight counts of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice.

Her trial heard how she had accused multiple men of rape going back to 2017, as well as claiming an Asian gang abused her.

Williams, from Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, published the pictures in May 2020 but the prosecution said the injuries had been self-inflicted with a blood-stained hammer found at her home.

Jonathan Sandiford KC said it was the ""finale"" to a string of lies by Williams.

""The defendant goes online to her social media contacts and effectively finds random names on the internet she presents as being victims of trafficking or perpetrators,"" he told the jury.

It was alleged she sent some social media messages to herself, making them appear as if they were from traffickers or other victims.

'Everything possible' is being done by ministers to increase hospital bed capacity amid growing NHS pressures, No 10 says;Tuesday 3 January 2023 14:56, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];[];"The government is doing ""everything possible"" to increase the number of hospital beds available, Downing Street has said, as winter pressures continue to bite.

Concerns are mounting about the current state of public healthcare, with well over a dozen NHS trusts and ambulance services having declared critical incidents over the festive period.

While the British Medical Association (BMA) has accused the government's ""political choices"" of leading to patients ""dying unnecessarily"".

Transport secretary tells striking workers to get off the picket line - politics latest

Issuing a stark warning, Professor Phil Banfield, chairman of the BMA council, said in a statement: ""The current situation in the NHS is intolerable and unsustainable, both for our patients and the hard-working staff desperately trying to keep up with incredibly high levels of demand.

""The BMA has repeatedly invited the government to sit down and talk about the pressures on our health service, but their silence is deafening.

""It is disingenuous for the prime minister to talk about 'backing the NHS' in his New Year message, when his own health secretary is failing to discuss how this crisis can be fixed.""

Professor Banfield also called on the government to ""step up and take immediate action"" to solve the crisis.

""The government should deliver on its obligations to the public. It is just not true that the cost of resolving this mess cannot be afforded by this country,"" he said.

""This is a political choice and patients are dying unnecessarily because of that choice.""

But the PM's official spokesman said on Tuesday that ministers had been ""up front"" with the public about the pressures the NHS would face this winter, partly due to the backlog created by the pandemic.

He also acknowledged that the current pressure on the health service was an ""unprecedented challenge"".

The spokesman told reporters: ""I think we have been up front with the public long in advance of this winter that because of the pandemic and the pressures it's placed in the backlog of cases that this would be an extremely challenging winter, and that is what we are seeing.""

He continued: ""The NHS is already maximising its number of beds, so the equivalent of 7,000 additional beds, plus funding for discharges and increasing virtual wards. That's all to free up capacity.

""Again, that's all thanks to the extra funding, the billions of extra pounds we've put in.

""We are doing everything possible to increase the number of beds.""

Opposition parties have criticised the government for inaction over recent days, with the Liberal Democrats calling for parliament to be recalled to discuss the situation.

Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Conservatives of ""mismanagement"" of the NHS.

Speaking yesterday, Mr Streeting said it was ""inexplicable"" that neither Rishi Sunak nor any of his ministers had offered solutions to the pressures hospitals are facing.

Meanwhile, continuing to be probed on the NHS, Mr Sunak's spokesperson said the PM's own healthcare arrangements are not in the public interest.

Troubled Cineworld denies talks with Odeon owner and says it will focus on group sale;Tuesday 3 January 2023 15:10, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Crisis-hit Cineworld has denied claims by the owner of rival Odeon that they have held talks over the sale of cinemas, saying it intends to sell the group as a whole and is yet to begin the process.

AMC Entertainment said last month that it had backed out of negotiations with Cineworld on the purchase of some sites in Europe and the US.

But Cineworld, which filed for US bankruptcy protection in September to try to restructure its debt and strengthen its balance sheet, said on Tuesday that no such talks had taken place.

The group said it was going ahead with a marketing process to sell its assets and expected to begin contacting potential buyers later this month.

It forms part of its plans to restructure the group and emerge from bankruptcy in the first three months of this year, in an attempt to maximise value for ""moviegoers and all other stakeholders"".

The chain and the wider industry has been plagued with a slow recovery in audience numbers since pandemic lockdowns shuttered cinemas.

Cineworld, however, was also the architect of an own goal.

Aggressive expansion ahead of the public health emergency - including a $3.6bn deal to buy Regal in 2017 - meant it became the world's second-biggest chain.

However, the buying spree combined with the COVID revenue hit to batter its finances.

The group said on Tuesday there was ""no guarantee of any recovery"" for shareholders if it does agree to a sale.

""As previously announced, it is expected that any restructuring or sale transaction agreed with stakeholders will result in a very significant dilution of existing equity interests in Cineworld,"" it said in the statement.

Shares, down 80% over the past six months, fell a further 20% shortly after the open but later recovered the ground lost earlier in the day.

Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said of the latest update: ""Shareholders have been told on numerous occasions that their investment could be significantly diluted... so the situation is more about getting back pennies in the pound rather than waiting for a big payday.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103151709/http://news.sky.com/story/troubled-cineworld-to-focus-on-group-sale-denies-talks-with-odeon-owner-12779126;Category-2: business and economy

Police appeal directly to teen arsonist Johnny Brady on run for fourth day after escaping mental health facility;Tuesday 3 January 2023 20:41, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"Police officers have appealed directly to a teenage arsonist who went missing from a mental health hospital on New Year's Eve to make contact and return to the facility.

The public have been warned not to approach Johnny Brady ""under any circumstances"" after he escaped St Andrew's Healthcare facility in Northampton on Saturday afternoon.

The 19-year-old was serving a hospital order for serious assault and arson.

He is described as white, 5ft 9 and slim and was last seen wearing black Adidas tracksuit bottoms, a black hoodie and black trainers.

Northamptonshire Police say he may be linked to three separate fires which occurred overnight near the hospital grounds after he went missing.

The force have issued several photos of the 19-year-old and asked for help finding him.

Detective Sergeant Torie Harrison said: ""Johnny - if you're reading this, we are getting really concerned for your welfare.

""We know how cold it is outside, especially at night, and we want to do all we can to return you to hospital to focus on your treatment needs. This is not about 'punishing' you for absconding, but about protecting you from harm.

""We know you have previously absconded and returned so please reach out by giving us a call on 999 or letting support network know where you are.""

Another patient also escaped from the hospital in recent days, though it is not thought to have been related to Brady's.

Eleanor Williams: How woman's lies and self-inflicted injuries unleashed hatred and death threats against Asian family;Tuesday 3 January 2023 20:08, UK;['jason farrell', '@jasonfarrellsky'];[];"Anyone who walked into court and saw her in the witness box, pale-faced, long hair scraped back, white blouse under a drab black cardigan, would have assumed Eleanor Williams was the victim.

If you were a student of law and you'd just gone into the public gallery, as some did that day, and you were listening to her describe in detail the sexual abuse, the shocking violence, the coercive control - you'd find yourself looking to the dock for who had allegedly done this.

On 6 December, in court 10 at Preston Crown Court, there was no one in the dock. It was an empty glass box.

The accused in this case was the woman giving evidence, 22-year-old Williams, and the Crown's case against her was that everything she was saying was a lie.

Not just that the abuse never happened and that the account she was giving was make-believe, but that the evidence police had found, such as threatening text messages from the men - she'd written herself.

It was alleged she'd created fake social media accounts to make it look like she was being intimidated and that the multiple times she'd turned up at work or home with bruises and black eyes, she'd done this to herself.

Even the knife marks on her breasts, and that someone had carved the word ""RAT"" into the skin of her stomach after she spoke to the police - that someone was Williams.

And the details of grooming, and the back rooms and the sex parties that she described to the jury over several days in the witness box - they were all in her head.

What is more, with her lies she had stirred up hatred against a group of men - causing windows to be smashed and livelihoods destroyed, and wasted weeks of police time.

And so she faced eight counts of perverting the course of justice, to which she pleaded not guilty.

Her defence was that her testimony was true - that there was a gang of men in the seaside town of Barrow-In-Furness who'd been trafficking and raping young girls over a number of years.

Court finds story was made up

Today the jury concluded Williams's story was indeed fabricated. She was found guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice.

Williams's allegations had triggered protests, attended by some on the far right, in the town of Barrow-in-Furness and in other towns across the north of England.

Although four of the men she'd accused were white, her central allegation was against a local restaurant owner called Mohammed Ramzan, and several other Asian men. Mr Ramzan told the jury it led to him receiving more than 500 death threats.

Mr Ramzan denied knowing Williams apart from a single passing encounter at a family party. But he told Sky News that as a result of her allegations, his whole family were threatened.

""We had messages like people are going to rape my wife in front of me. From Islamophobia, to racism, to just general hate - people wishing me dead,"" he said.

""My children had fire extinguishers, baseball bats next to their beds for their safety because we had threats. People were going to burn the shops down, burn us down.

""We had rental properties in town - smashed in. Is that the type of persecution that goes on today in a town where there's only a handful of Asians, and everybody knows these Asians?

""They've all dealt with me. I've fed them all because I've been in the food industry. I've fed them all, from the children to the adults to the grandparents... and they turned on me.""

Reported missing 32 times

There's no doubt that Williams was a troubled teenager.

In her late teens she became withdrawn and in early 2019, aged 18, she suddenly left home, moving to a block of flats in Barrow-in-Furness. Over seven months, her mother, Allison Johnston, said she reported her daughter missing 32 times.

Mrs Johnston told Sky News: ""She was going missing for days on end. I was driving around where she lived and I noticed that a light was on in her flat so I went and knocked on the door and she opened the door and her face was, she had two black eyes, it was so swollen I hardly recognised her and she had a cut across her neck. She was just black and blue all over.""

Mrs Johnston said over the course of several months her daughter would often appear with injuries.

She said: ""She's still got a scar on her throat. Her ear's been cut, her finger's been cut. She's got 'rat' carved across her stomach. She's got marks around her ankles.""

Boss thought Williams was being bullied

Staff at the pub where Williams worked also noticed the injuries.

Brian Smith, the manager, said: ""Her basic excuse at the time was that she just kept bumping into things, and she was very clumsy, which didn't ring true to me with the type of injuries that she had.""

He thought she was being bullied: ""One day she came in with a particularly bad set of black eyes... So she was by the lockers out the back after we finished shift one day and she was a bit upset. And I said to her 'look, just tell me what's going on. I'll be able to help you, they're only kids.'

""She didn't say anything for about two minutes. And then she said that it wouldn't stop and they weren't children. They were grown men. And it wouldn't stop because they were using her to get profit.""

Huge rallies after Williams puts injury images online

Police in Barrow began an investigation. They found evidence on her phone that suggested Williams was being sexually exploited and trafficked by a group of men. But months later Cumbria Police would change their tack and arrest Williams for lying - fabricating the evidence that she was a victim.

Then one evening in May 2020, while on bail, Williams went missing again. She was found by police bloodied in a field near her family home.

At this point she made the decision to go public with her allegations and posted them on Facebook, including pictures of her injuries. She was rearrested within minutes of putting it up, but the reaction to the post was explosive.

Dan Taylor, chief reporter at The Mail in Barrow, said: ""It was a shockwave really, it was just right through the town.

""There were these huge rallies, which loads of people attended. People beeping horns and things like that.

""People thought, how can this have happened and I think not too long after that, it was police outside takeaways, it was smashed windows, it was people being abused on social media.""

Prosecution argued Williams was a fantasist

At Preston Crown Court, evidence emerged Williams appeared to have faked messages and letters to herself from Mr Ramzan and others. The prosecution argued that she was a fantasist.

Evidence showed she was staying in a hotel she'd booked herself, at a time when she said she was being raped by men in Blackpool. She later admitted she had made this up, but claimed the men had forced her to tell the story to discredit her.

The prosecution also provided evidence to contradict claims that she had been trafficked to Ibiza and Amsterdam.

More than 20 women whom Williams listed as present at sex parties all denied being there. The prosecution claimed Williams had either known the girls from school or found their details online.

The jury was told that Williams went to great lengths to convince people she was a victim, including buying a hammer from Tesco and causing injuries to herself. In court Williams said: ""I didn't buy a hammer to hurt myself - I'm not a psychopath.""

But a Home Office pathologist said the wounds on one occasion showed signs of being self-inflicted. The defence would later argue that this pathologist report only referred to one set of injuries when there had been many others.

'I think she is a psychopath'

Mr Ramzan told Sky News: ""If you look at the pathologist reports, what they're saying and the way the injuries are happening, it's all consistent to a person doing them to themselves, and it's with a hammer, you know, a 10-ounce hammer, I'm sure we would break a bone. And that's quite funny that not a single bone was broken or fractured… I think she is a psychopath.""

Williams' mother still does not believe her daughter inflicted the injuries upon herself.

""Who would cut their own throat?"" she said.

""I work with people that self-harm. I work with people with mental health issues. The thing that really always gets me is, if you were harming yourself to that degree, you would have some kind of significant mental health issues. And Ellie was not displaying any of those. She was getting up and going to work.""

Williams' sentencing has been adjourned until 13 and 14 March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103210246/http://news.sky.com/story/eleanor-williams-how-womans-lies-and-self-inflicted-injuries-unleashed-hatred-and-death-threats-against-asian-family-12779252;Category-5: entertainment and culture
After 'utter misery' in 'chaotic' hospital, patient questions whether his cancer fight is worth it;Tuesday 3 January 2023 21:43, UK;['katerina vittozzi', '@kvittozzi'];[];"Even when there's an entire healthcare system under pressure, individual stories can still shock.

Edward Denmark, 62, has blood cancer.

As you'd expect, his care has been stressful, challenging and, at times, extremely painful.

But he said ""nothing has been worse"" than an emergency visit to his local hospital last week.

""As well as being ill, it was complete and utter misery,"" he said. ""I don't know what's happening but it's like things have imploded.""

Over Christmas, Mr Denmark, who is from the Wirral, had a chest infection that wasn't getting better.

His cancer treatment makes him extremely vulnerable to infections and sepsis, so his GP referred him to his local hospital walk-in clinic the day before New Year's Eve.

He went there with his wife, Trish. They both say it was ""chaos"".

""It was very packed as it always is,"" he said, ""and I can't sit on the chairs with all those people.""

'I couldn't even get a blanket'

Mr Denmark said staff have previously had to put him ""in a store cupboard"" to keep him isolated from other patients but that ""on this occasion the store cupboard was locked or something"".

Eventually, Mr Denmark and his wife were given a space to wait in an empty corridor, ""but my wife had to find me a chair to sit on"".

""Staff were passing by and would say they would come back but never did. I was hot and a bit delirious and I didn't really know what was happening, it was difficult to get a glass of water - we couldn't even get a blanket.""

Mrs Denmark said hospital paperwork showed there were concerns that her husband was developing sepsis.

But it took nearly seven hours before he was given a bed on a ward and received intravenous antibiotics.

She said: ""I was afraid to leave him, if I'm honest, because I thought he might die in that room and no one would even notice.""

After his initial treatment, Mr Denmark hoped to be transferred to a specialist oncology ward, but was told there were no beds available.

Instead, he said, ""I had to be in a room, on a ward where I felt I wasn't with staff who knew how to deal with a cancer patient, or the risks of that"".

""There was no private bathroom and I was scared to use the communal one because of the infection risk. So I was sweating with a fever in a bed for two days and wasn't able to have a wash, or use a toilet.""

The Wirral University Teaching Hospital Trust that treated Mr Denmark told Sky News that, as across the health service, it is witnessing unprecedented demand for emergency care.

It added that staff are doing all they can to see the sickest patients first.

But the experience has left the Denmark family shaken.

""When I feel unwell now, I think - what do I have to go through, to get the antibiotics in me?"" Mr Denmark said.

Romeo and Juliet stars sue over 1968 film's teen nude scene;Wednesday 4 January 2023 03:14, UK;[];[];"The two stars of a 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet are suing for more than $500m (£417m) over a nude scene in the film that was recorded when they were teenagers.

British actress Olivia Hussey, then 15 and now 71, and Leonard Whiting, then 16 now 72, filed the suit against Paramount Pictures - alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud.

Director Franco Zeffirelli, who died in 2019, initially told the two they would wear flesh-coloured underwear in the bedroom scene that was shot on the final days of filming, the suit alleges.

But on the morning of the shoot, Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup, while still assuring them the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity, according to the suit.

Yet they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge, in violation of California and federal laws against indecency and the exploitation of children, their action claims.

Image: Franco Zeffirelli pictured in 2004

Zeffirelli told them they must act in the nude ""or the picture would fail"" and their careers would be hurt, the suit said.

The actors ""believed they had no choice but to act in the nude in body makeup as demanded"".

Whiting's bare buttocks and Hussey's bare breasts are briefly shown during the scene.

The film, and its theme song, were major hits at the time, and has been shown to generations of students studying the Shakespeare play since.

The court filing says Hussey and Whiting have suffered emotional damage and mental anguish for decades, and that each had careers that did not reflect the success of the movie.

It says given that suffering and the revenue brought in by the film since its release, the actors are entitled to damages of more than $500m ($417m).

Paramount Pictures is yet to respond to news of the lawsuit.

It was filed under a California law temporarily suspending the statute of limitations for child sex abuse, which has led to a host of new lawsuits and the revival of many others that were previously dismissed.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104031710/http://news.sky.com/story/romeo-and-juliet-stars-sue-over-1968-films-teen-nude-scene-12779455;Category-5: entertainment and culture

Food inflation 'hit record high' ahead of Christmas led by fresh produce;Wednesday 4 January 2023 05:15, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Food inflation hit a record annual rate in December as cash-strapped households prepared for Christmas, according to a retail sector report.

The latest British Retail Consortium-NielsenIQ shop price index showed typical food grocery costs up 13.3% last month compared with December 2021.

The rate had stood at 12.4% in November.

The data showed fresh food costs contributed most to the rise, through a 15% hike on an annual basis.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:08 Grocer on 'colossal' price rises

Even so-called ambient food - such as pasta and tinned goods - were up 11% by the same measure.

However, the report noted that away from food there were some savings to be had for shoppers, as the overall shop price inflation rate eased slightly to 7.3% for the month.

This was mostly a consequence of some discounting among non-food retailers in the run-up to Christmas, according to the BRC.

Its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the festive season had clearly been ""challenging"" for families given the scale of the cost of living crisis.

""Not only did the cold snap force people to spend more on their energy bills, but the prices of many essential foods also rose as reverberations from the war in Ukraine continued to keep high the cost of animal feed, fertiliser and energy,"" she said.

""Non-food price rises eased as some retailers used discounting to shed excess stock built up during the disruptions to supply chains, meaning some customers were able to bag bargain gifts.

""The combined impact was that price increases overall plateaued, with the reduction in non-food inflation offsetting the higher food prices.""

The New Year is not set to deliver any major turnaround in economic fortunes, with demand held back by high inflation and rising interest rates to help tackle the pace of price rises.

It is hoped that the rate of consumer price inflation has peaked - for the foreseeable future at least - but it is expected to remain stubbornly high throughout the winter.

While supermarkets are thought to have benefited from more people eating at home, hospitality and retail store jobs are seen as being at risk in the months ahead as belts are tightened.

Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said: ""Consumer demand is likely to be weak in Q1 due to the impact of energy price increases and for many, Christmas spending bills starting to arrive.

""So the increase in food inflation is going to put further pressure on household budgets and it's unlikely that there will be any improvement in the consumer mind-set around personal finances in the near term.

""With shoppers having less money to spend on discretionary retail, having paid for their essential groceries, there will be little to stimulate demand across the non-food channels.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104054807/http://news.sky.com/story/food-inflation-hit-record-high-ahead-of-christmas-led-by-fresh-produce-12779188;Category-2: business and economy
Walter Cunningham: Last surviving astronaut from Apollo 7 mission dies;Wednesday 4 January 2023 07:21, UK;[];[];"Walter Cunningham, the last surviving astronaut from the first successful crewed space mission in NASA's Apollo program, has died aged 90.

Cunningham joined crewmates Walter Schirra and Donn Eisele for the 11-day Apollo 7 mission in 1968, which was conducted in low-Earth orbit.

Their mission was the first human test flight of the new Apollo spacecraft, which would see a dozen astronauts land on the lunar surface from 1969 and 1972.

Cunningham was the flight's lunar module pilot, even though Apollo 7 did not carry the moon landing craft, and he was responsible for all spacecraft systems except launch and navigation.

He was the last surviving member of the crew after mission commander Walter Schirra and command module pilot Donn Eisele died in 2007 and 1987 respectively.

Cunningham's family said he died in hospital ""from complications of a fall, after a full and complete life"".

Blasting off on 11 October 1968, Apollo 7 marked the resumption of NASA's lunar spaceflight program 21 months after the fire that killed all three members of the Apollo 1 crew - Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee - during a ground-based launch rehearsal in late January 1967.

Prior to his assignment to Apollo 7, Cunningham had been the backup lunar module pilot for the ill-fated Apollo 1 mission, and was on the prime crew for Apollo 2 until it was cancelled.

Image: From left: Donn Eisele, Walter Schirra, and Walter Cunningham speak to President Lyndon Johnson after the Apollo 7 spacecraft splashed down into the Atlantic Ocean

Apollo 7 provided the first live TV transmission of onboard crew activities, and was noted for testy exchanges between ground control and the astronauts, who developed head colds during the flight and openly voiced annoyance with mission directors at times.

Due in part to those tensions, none of the three astronauts went to space again.

The mission was considered a technical success for proving the capabilities of systems that would carry Apollo 11 to the lunar surface in July 1969.

Cunningham, who served in the US Navy and Marine Corps, flying 54 missions as a fighter pilot before retiring with the

rank of colonel, was selected as an astronaut in 1963 as part of NASA's third astronaut class.

Between his military service and NASA tenure, Cunningham spent three years as a scientist working on classified defence studies and problems related to the Earth's magnetic field.

""Walt Cunningham was a fighter pilot, physicist and an entrepreneur - but, above all, he was an explorer,"" NASA

administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement announcing his death.

Following Apollo 7, Cunningham was assigned to lead the Skylab branch - an early space station program - under NASA's flight crew directorate, and he retired from the space agency in 1971.

He went on to a post-NASA career as an investor and executive in several business ventures, becoming a frequent

keynote speaker and radio talk show host.

Gordon, of Cofton Park Drive, Birmingham, and Carpenter, of no fixed address, today appeared at Birmingham Crown Court.

Judge Paul Farrer KC ordered a trial in the case to start on 3 July.

He also fixed a plea and trial preparation hearing for 17 March.

Gordon and Carpenter were both remanded in custody.

Mr Fisher was stabbed to death on the dancefloor of the Crane nightclub in Digbeth shortly before 11.45pm on Boxing Day.

The 23-year-old, who played for Stratford Town FC, was approached by a group of people and stabbed while on a night out with friends.

The nightclub had its licence suspended for 28 days on Friday following accusations from West Midlands Police that there had been ""serious management failings"" at the venue on the night Mr Fisher died.

Birmingham city councillors said they will consider whether to close the club permanently at a full review hearing in the future.

Man and woman charged with offences relating to illegally aborting a baby;Wednesday 4 January 2023 10:27, UK;[];[];"A man and a woman have been charged with procuring a poison to cause a miscarriage, concealing the birth of a child, and disposing of the baby's body.

Elliot Benham and Sophie Harvey, both 23, have been accused of illegally aborting a baby following an investigation by Gloucestershire Constabulary's Major Crime Investigation Team.

Harvey, of St Mary's Road, Cirencester, Gloucestershire, has also been charged with procuring her own miscarriage by poison or use of an instrument.

Abortions are legal in England up to 24 weeks' gestation if carried out by a registered medical practitioner, and can be carried out beyond 24 weeks in very limited circumstances.

Throat lozenges, cough mixtures and some pain killers are among the over-the-counter medicines in short supply, according to the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies.

The industry group warned of supply issues of both branded and unbranded medicines to treat seasonal illnesses.

It comes after the UK Health Security Agency warned that winter illnesses including flu and COVID-19 continue to circulate at ""high levels"".

Officials have urged unwell adults to wear face masks to stem the spread of infections, while parents have been urged to keep children with a fever off school.

""This isn't just the branded medicines, it is also simple things like throat lozenges, cough mixtures or pain killers - particularly the ones that are soluble.

Easy as one, two, pee, U-Scan hooks on to the side of a toilet bowl, and uses an onboard replaceable cartridge to analyse urine for things like detecting a menstrual cycle or giving dietary feedback. It will start at €500 (£440).

Mask up!

As Britons are advised to once again mask up as cases of scarlet fever and COVID circulate, this rather bulky battery-powered accessory from Airxom has made a well-timed return to CES.

First shown off last year, the mask is essentially a wearable air purifier that claims to filter out and destroy airborne particles - including viruses.

British darts player Michael Smith becomes world champion after gripping nine-dart finish;Wednesday 4 January 2023 13:30, UK;[];[];"British world darts champion Michael Smith said he wants to use his victory to teach his children never to give up - after defeating Michael van Gerwen in arguably the greatest final ever.

The 32-year-old, who also became world number one after his triumph, beat Dutch rival van Gerwen 7-4 after a stunning nine-dart finish on Tuesday.

Van Gerwen was also on course for a nine-dart finish but missed double 12 with his final throw.

Smith got his hands on the Sid Waddell Trophy at the third time of asking, having previously lost to van Gerwen in 2019 and then Peter Wright 12 months ago.

That contributed to a run of eight successive major final defeats before he stopped the rot in November by winning the Grand Slam of Darts and following it up with the big one at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday night.

Smith said after becoming PDC world champion: ""For me it's more about when I look at my kids and I say to them, 'If you're going to quit just don't bother'.

""You have to keep going, you have to keep persisting with it, the amount of heartache you might get. I lost eight in a row and then I have won my ninth and 10th.

""That was what was most important to me, teaching them a lesson and now I get to be selfish now, that trophy is mine.""

PDC Darts, which organised the world championship contest, described Smith and Van Gerwen's pursuit of nine-darters ""the best leg of all time"", adding: ""One of the greatest things you'll ever see in sport.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104141811/http://news.sky.com/story/british-darts-player-michael-smith-becomes-world-champion-after-gripping-nine-dart-finish-12779693;Category-4: sports
Pharmacy bosses warn over shortage of cough and cold medicines amid 'high level' of winter illnesses;Wednesday 4 January 2023 13:18, UK;[];[];"Pharmacy bosses have warned about a shortage of cough and cold medicines, with some pharmacists ""struggling to obtain the very basic"" supplies.

Throat lozenges, cough mixtures and some pain killers are among the over-the-counter medicines in short supply, according to the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies.

The industry group warned of supply issues of both branded and unbranded medicines to treat seasonal illnesses.

It comes after the UK Health Security Agency warned that winter illnesses, including flu and COVID-19, continue to circulate at ""high levels"".

Officials have urged unwell adults to wear face masks to stem the spread of infections, while parents have been urged to keep children with a fever off school.

Chief executive Leyla Hannbeck told the PA news agency that pharmacists were ""struggling to obtain the very basic, most common cold and flu medicine.""

She said: ""This isn't just the branded medicines, it is also simple things like throat lozenges, cough mixtures or pain killers - particularly the ones that are soluble.

""The demand has been high because this season we've seen higher cases of colds and flu and people are obviously trying very hard to look after themselves and making sure that they use the relevant products to manage the symptoms.

""And that has led to a shortage of these products in terms of us not being able to obtain them.

""On the front line it is very difficult because we're seeing these shortages but those people who are in charge of supporting us with it are denying it.""

High street chain Superdrug said that it had seen a huge demand for cough and cold medicines.

Ms Hannbeck, whose group represents community-based pharmacy businesses with multiple stores, warned that a shortage of self-care products in pharmacies could lead to more pressure for the NHS.

""What we are seeing, which is concerning, when people go to pharmacies and try and get hold of the products over the counter, particularly for small children, then people start to stress and panic and what we don't want to happen is for more people to go to their GP or A&E; when the NHS is already under a lot of strain,"" Ms Hannbeck added.

Despite the warning of shortages, Ms Hannbeck urged people ""not to panic"".

""As pharmacists, we do everything we can to ensure we support patients in every way possible and try and sort alternatives, or give advice on how to manage cold and flu symptoms,"" she added.

It comes after Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), on Tuesday warned adults to stay at home when feeling unwell or wear face coverings when going outside in order to minimise the spread of illness.

She added that adults should not ""visit vulnerable people unless urgent"" when feeling unwell.

The advice comes as part of the UKHSA's ""simple steps"" to help protect children and vulnerable individuals as pupils return to schools and universities after the Christmas break.

Prof Hopkins added that it is ""important to minimise the spread of infection in schools and other education and childcare settings"", and recommended that children with a fever or feeling unwell should also stay home from school or nursery in order to help stop illness spreading.

The UKHSA warned that both flu and COVID-19 are currently ""circulating at high levels"", which is likely to continue to increase in coming weeks.

Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and founder of the COVID Zoe app, also highlighted an Omicron variant after a scientist said cases had more than doubled in America in a week.

High numbers of scarlet fever, which is caused by group A Streptococcus (Strep A), also continue to be reported in the UK.

'Surprising variation' in how plant-eating dinosaurs ate their food;Wednesday 4 January 2023 16:13, UK;[];[];"Plant-eating dinosaurs had a ""surprising variation"" in how they ate their food despite having a similar diet, research suggests.

By analysing skull specimens of herbivores such as the Jurassic-era Heterodontosaurus and Leothosaurus, British scientists determined that their eating styles changed based on their jaw muscles and biting actions.

It represents another sign of ""how innovative and unpredictable evolution can be"", scientists said, as all plant-eating dinosaurs were already thought to have descended from a single carnivorous ancestor.

Senior study author Professor Paul Barret, a Natural History Museum palaeontologist, said: ""If you want to understand how dinosaurs diversified into so many different types so effectively, it's critical to learn how they evolved to feed on such a wide variety of vegetation in so many different ways.

""This diversity in feeding mechanisms set them up to dominate life on land for millions of years to come.""

The Heterodontosaurus and Leothosaurus skulls were studied alongside those of Scelidosaurus, Hypsilophodon, and Psittacosaurus - all of which belonged to a group of herbivorous creatures known as Ornithischia.

Researchers were then able to reconstruct the jaw muscles of the five dinosaur species and simulate their biting action, which suggested they had a different way of eating plants.

While Heterodontosaurus's large jaw muscles relative to its skull size saw it produce a high bite force ideal for consuming tough vegetation, the Hypsilophodon had smaller muscles and rearranged them to bite more efficiently.

Lead author Dr David Button said: ""When we compared the functional performance of the skull and teeth of these plant-eating dinosaurs, we found significant differences in the relative sizes of the jaw muscles, bite forces and jaw strength between them.

""This showed that these dinosaurs, although looking somewhat similar, had evolved in very different ways to tackle a diet of plants.""

The findings were published in the journal Current Biology.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104161709/http://news.sky.com/story/surprising-variation-in-how-plant-eating-dinosaurs-ate-their-food-12779731;Category-6: science and technology
Ukraine war: Teachers, plumbers and builders among volunteer soldiers preparing for the worst on Belarus border;Wednesday 4 January 2023 16:40, UK;[];[];"In the forest and snowed-over swamps of Ukraine's 621-mile border with Belarus is a territorial defence unit gearing up for the worst.

The 100th Brigade is mostly made up of volunteers - some teachers, plumbers, builders - who have enlisted to fortify the edges of the Volynska region and prepare against another Russian invasion from the north.

The 124-mile stretch of land protected by the 100th Brigade is now littered with anti-tank mines and marked by watch posts.

""This is the height,"" says Captain Vasyl Sydorchuk, a deputy commander of the unit, from the top of his newly built hill fortress covered in snow.

""Everything is well observed from here: the crossroads. You can work with grenade launchers, machine guns - you can use everything.""

Not far from Captain Sydorchuk's hill is a village where northern Ukrainians have been living for generations.

They have been shaken by reports of a looming invasion from the border straddling their homes. Some of them have family members living only 12 miles away on the other side.

""We lived all together. Half of our people lived in Belarus. I used to live and work there. I have relatives there and we visited them often,"" says resident Oksana Trufanova.

""I'm not leaving and I don't want to leave and flee from my land. Where to? I am 75 and those beasts want to force us to leave our land,"" she says.

""Let them die themselves or let the God destroy them.""

Her daughter has deep concerns after seeing the atrocities committed in other parts of Ukraine.

""After Bucha - after what those monsters have done there, I thought a number of times that it would be better if a missile hit me here than to experience what they do to Ukrainian people,"" says Svetlana.

A little way down the road cutting through their village is a lake that sprawls across the border. On one side, the last Ukrainian outpost. On the other, a green Belarusian watch tower.

Last month, Russian President Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko held a mass combined training operation after announcing a joint regional military unit in October.

Russia invaded Ukraine from the Belarusian border back in February and top Ukrainian defence officials have been sounding the alarm on another incursion from the north.

This time the Ukrainians insist that they are well prepared.

Explosions can be heard from Captain Sydorchuk's hill fortress.

""Don't worry,"" he says. ""That is from our guys.""

The blasts are coming from a spot a few kilometres down the road. They are part of a simulation exercise that the 100th Brigade is conducting daily in preparation for a potential new front on their doorstep.

Politics latest: Rishi Sunak accused of being 'detached from reality' on NHS after setting out agenda in major speech;;[];[];"Sunak's speech was wide-ranging and full of big political promises

For a prime minister who came to power in such chaotic circumstances - soundly defeated in a bitterly divisive leadership campaign, only to be anointed leader after the collapse of the winner - this speech was an opportunity for Rishi Sunak to set out his own stall to the country, and attempt to draw a line under the turmoil of the past year.

Speaking for nearly half an hour, and unhurriedly taking questions from journalists afterwards, Mr Sunak largely projected an image of calm confidence.

He is not a prime minister with a mandate for major new policy directions, but it was still a wide-ranging speech full of big political promises - to halve inflation within a year and grow the economy, as well as reducing the national debt, NHS waiting lists and illegal migration.

There were few policy details as to how exactly these pledges would be achieved.

Hitching his political future to such tangible promises seems quite a gamble at first glance - but if the Conservatives are unable able to deliver improvements in those key areas after 12 years in government, the chances of clinging to power after the next general election are vanishingly small anyway.

Mr Sunak talked about the ""courage"" needed to drive change and ""strive for excellence"" - but there were no great flights of rhetoric.

It seemed quite a personal speech - dwelling on his passion for education, his gratitude for the benefits of his own public school experience, and his love for his wife and children.

He also described the NHS in striking terms as his ""family’s life calling"" due to his dad's job as a doctor and his mum's as a pharmacist.

But on the key issues seen by many as bringing the country to its knees - NHS waiting lists and striking public sector workers - he was on the defensive.

He told those watching he had increased health funding, recruited more staff and upgraded hospitals, while blaming the current situation largely on COVID.

For many health workers - angry at Downing Street's refusal to accept the system is in crisis or to acknowledge the need for more funding - this will be infuriating.

He had little to offer striking workers across the public sector - repeating the refrain that ministers' doors are open for talks and arguing about the importance of pay agreements being ""right and affordable"" for the country as a whole.

Anti-strike legislation is still on the cards, and it sounds like more details will be published in the coming days.

Mr Sunak says he is proud of his record as chancellor supporting the country during COVID - and is attempting to present himself to the public as someone who has delivered on his promises in the past and will do so again.

His opponents will be watching keenly to call out the first signs of failure.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104180228/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-rishi-sunak-accused-of-being-detached-from-reality-on-nhs-after-setting-out-agenda-in-major-speech-12593360;Category-1: politics

Amazon UK workers set to strike for first time in pay dispute;Wednesday 4 January 2023 17:27, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Amazon is set to endure a strike by workers in the UK for the first time.

Members of the GMB union at the US tech company's Coventry warehouse are due to walk out on 25 January as part of a fight for better pay.

""GMB urges Amazon UK bosses to give workers a proper pay rise and avoid industrial action altogether,"" the union's senior organiser Amanda Gearing said.

""They've shown they're willing to put themselves on the line to fighting for what's right.

'Evil' child rapist jailed for life after being unmasked by technology that unpixelated image of him;Wednesday 4 January 2023 18:24, UK;[];[];"A prolific and ""evil"" child rapist has been jailed for life after he was unmasked by technology which unpixellated an image of his face discovered in photos he took of himself abusing his victims.

Martyn Armstrong, from Pembrokeshire, documented himself committing ""depraved"" acts against three children, including a victim as young as one, and posted the pictures to the dark web.

The 50-year-old was arrested in July last year after officers developed the never before used tool.

Armstrong pleaded guilty to a total of 41 counts of rape of a child under the age of 13 and sexual assault related to two victims, and to making, distributing and possessing indecent images of children in relation to them both and a third victim.

Sentencing the defendant to a life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years, Recorder of Cardiff, Tracey Lloyd-Clarke, said the ""nature and depravity of your offending is shocking"".

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths told Cardiff Crown Court that Armstrong had taken the images of him abusing children between 2005 and 2007, and between 16 December 2009 and 6 February 2011, and had admitted to taking photos of a third child on a beach in 2010.

He had posted online a series of 200 extremely graphic images and a video under the file name 'Father Jones' which shows him repeatedly raping his youngest victim.

The series has been known to crime agencies across the world since 2013 due to the file being shared and downloaded across 18 countries. The folder was still being shared in the UK in early 2022 across six websites.

Rapist used photoshop to distort himself

Mr Griffiths said Armstrong used photoshop to place a zig-zag distortion across his image, but did not disguise the identities of his victims.

Due to his face being blurred, investigators were unable to identify the paedophile for almost a decade, despite attempts by law enforcement partners from Australia, Italy and France.

Mr Griffiths said one image featured the offender's face with a zig zag distortion and as a result in July last year, National Crime Agency (NCA) officers were able to unpixelate the image of the defendant in that series using their new tool.

The software was developed by NCA officers in the UK and is the first of its kind to be developed in the world.

Tech expected to help identify future perpetrators

From the undistorted image, the officers were able to identify Armstrong's Facebook profile leading to his arrest.

It is expected the programme will help future perpetrators to be identified.

Martin Ludlow from the NCA said: ""I don't believe he [Armstrong] thought he would ever be caught and that the distortion techniques he used would protect him.

""However, the NCA and our international partners were determined to ensure his evil actions did not go unpunished.

""Our commitment to identifying him was unwavering and ultimately, NCA officers developed a completely new programme which led to his unmasking.""

Armstrong admitted to distributing photos and to naming the Father Jones series.

Adam Sharp, defending, said: ""Mr Armstrong does not want me to try to mitigate the depravity of his actions or the impact they had on his victims.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104202443/https://news.sky.com/story/evil-child-rapist-jailed-for-life-after-being-unmasked-by-technology-that-unpixelated-image-of-him-12779904;Category-6: science and technology
Two suspects wanted over Mark Cavendish knifepoint robbery 'not apprehended', court told;Wednesday 4 January 2023 19:45, UK;[];[];"Detectives have been unable to find two suspects who are wanted over a knifepoint robbery at the home of Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish, a court has heard.

Officers said the pair had not been ""apprehended by police"" and that investigations to find them were ""sensitive"".

Masked intruders armed with knives broke into Mr Cavendish's home in the early hours of 27 November 2021 as he was asleep with his wife Peta and their three-year-old child, prosecutor Edward Renvoize told jurors.

Two men deny two counts of robbery over the raid in the Ongar area of Essex and are on trial at Chelmsford Crown Court.

A third man admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing and will be sentenced, but officers have been unable to locate a fourth and fifth man, who have been named as suspects.

Detective Constable Brian Eagling, the officer in the case, said it had not been possible to locate suspects Jo Jobson and George Goddard, adding that investigations to find them were ""sensitive"".

He told jurors: ""Although they haven't been apprehended by police, the prosecution say it's quite clear from the evidence that they were involved, but of course you are not being asked to return verdicts upon them.""

Suspects identified from communications data

Mr Renvoize said that 28-year-old Ali Sesay, of Holding Street, Rainham, east London, who pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing, ""managed to leave his DNA on the phone of Peta Cavendish"".

""Police began examining communications made by Mr Sesay's telephone and from that, the prosecution say, it was possible to identify individuals who had been in touch with Mr Sesay,"" he said.

""And by further investigation, where those phones attributed to other individuals had been, where they had travelled to and where they had come back to.""

DNA swab returned 'mixed profile'

Detective Constable Eagling agreed with Mr Renvoize that suspects Jobson and Goddard were identified from communications data.

Mr Renvoize said a DNA swab was taken from Mr Cavendish's arm, where it was held by one of the assailants, and it had returned a ""mixed profile"".

The prosecutor added that the ""overwhelming inference"" of the findings was that ""George Goddard was one of the people who went into the property and touched Mark Cavendish"".

Earlier in the trial, the court heard that robbers ""jumped on"" Mr Cavendish and one ""threatened to stab him in front of his children"".

The couple were woken up by a noise in the early hours of the morning, jurors heard.

Robbers left with two Richard Mille watches

Mr Renvoize said the robbers left with two Richard Mille watches, valued at £400,000 and £300,000 respectively.

Romario Henry, 31, of Bell Green, Lewisham, south-east London, and 28-year-old Oludewa Okorosobo, of Flaxman Road, Camberwell, south London, both deny two counts of robbery and are on trial.

They are accused of robbing Cavendish of a watch, phone and safe, and to robbing the athlete's wife of a watch, phone and suitcase.

Mr Renvoize said Okorosobo told police he ""had no knowledge of the robbery, he said he had never been to the location, he said he wouldn't be capable of committing the offence because of a leg injury he had sustained"".

""He said he hadn't had his phone and he had to pay to get it back,"" Mr Renvoize said.

""He didn't expand upon the information he provided by way of a written statement.""

Henry was arrested on 18 December 2021 and declined to answer questions from police, the barrister said.

Archangelo Power, for Henry, said that his client accepts that the phone number attributed to him by investigators was his.

Mr Power said Henry also accepts being in one of the vehicles and being at Mr Cavendish's address, ""but not inside the property"".

Louisiana cracks down on porn by making websites ask users for ID to verify age;Wednesday 4 January 2023 19:46, UK;[];[];"People who want to visit pornographic websites in the US state of Louisiana must now provide legal proof they are over 18.

Any porn sites that do not check users are adults can now be sued in the state.

The legislation, which has been criticised by internet privacy campaigners, came into force this week after being introduced last year by Republican Laurie Schlegel.

""Online pornography is extreme and graphic and only one click away from our children,"" she said on Twitter.

""This is not your daddy's Playboy.

""And if pornography companies refuse to be responsible, then we must hold them accountable.""

The legislation has pushed major pornography websites to adopt Louisiana's LA Wallet system, which allows the state's residents to hold a digital driving licence or ID card.

It includes a mandate that user information is not retained in an attempt to alleviate privacy concerns.

The Louisiana bill may offer a hint towards how the UK's long-awaited Online Safety Bill will attempt to protect children from adult content.

The proposed law - which aims to regulate online content to help keep users safe, especially children, and to make companies responsible for the material - will make companies use age-checking measures to protect under-18s from accessing pornographic content.

Online Safety Bill might not be too little, but it's certainly too late

Law 'must consider right to privacy'

The NSPCC told Sky News that communications regulator Ofcom should be given the power to enforce minimum standards for age assurance, balancing the protection of children with an adult's right to privacy.

""Watching pornography at a young age can have a detrimental impact on a children's understanding of sex, consent and healthy relationships,"" they said.

""That's why it's so important that we have an Online Safety Bill which compels online pornography sites to roll out effective age assurance measures that provide the highest level of confidence about a user's age whilst also taking into consideration adults' right to privacy.""

Critics have cast doubt on the practicalities of age verification on adult websites.

Richard De Vere, an online security expert, told Sky News it was the result of politicians seeking ""simple solutions to quite complex problems"".

""We've not really tackled the core issue here, which is proper authentication,"" he said.

""Even if we trusted that the data would be looked after, how can we trust that it's being used by myself and not my daughter or someone like that?

""The government would need to go house to house, taking people's irises and fingerprints.""

He added: ""To go forward we have to go back to some old-fashioned values - good guidance, counsel for your kids, moral training and ethics. The internet's a horrible place with some terrible things, but with good education you can navigate it safely.""

Homemade porn an 'additional challenge'

Charlotte Aynsley, safeguarding lead for school safety software firm Impero, told Sky News that age verification on adult websites was a long time coming, but that more needed to be done.

""It has been discussed since 2017, when it was first introduced by David Cameron - in fact, it was supposed to be included in the Digital Economy Act 2017, but it was never enforced,"" she said.

""However, there is an additional challenge around self-generated porn content, as a lot of content does not only sit on commercial porn sites.

""The majority of porn online is user-generated, can be viewed on sites like Twitter and TikTok, or is shared on a personal basis between individuals, and so it will still be accessible even with age verification.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104202443/https://news.sky.com/story/louisiana-cracks-down-on-porn-by-making-websites-ask-users-for-id-to-verify-age-12779918;Category-6: science and technology
Teen arsonist Johnny Brady located after escaping mental health facility and spending four days on run;Wednesday 4 January 2023 18:57, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A serial arsonist who went missing from a mental health hospital has been located after he spent four days on the run.

The public had been warned not to approach Johnny Brady ""under any circumstances"" after he absconded from St Andrew's Healthcare facility in Northampton on New Year's Eve.

The 19-year-old was serving a hospital order for serious assault and arson.

But Northamptonshire Police said Brady was found ""safe and well"" around 9.30am on Wednesday morning.

The force said: ""The force's control room received a call from a member of the public reporting that they had seen Brady in the Crestwood Road area of Northampton.

""Officers were immediately deployed to the area where Brady was found. He is now being taken back to his place of care.""

Detective Sergeant Torie Harrison, said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public for all their help over the past four days in sharing our media appeals and calling us with information.

""It has been invaluable and the reason why we have been able to find Brady safe and well.

""He will now be returned to St Andrew's Hospital where his treatment needs can be met.""

Police had issued an urgent appeal to trace Brady and said on New Year's Day he may be linked to three separate overnight fires involving bags of rubbish which occurred near the hospital grounds.

John Jessop jailed for murder of ex and mother of three Clair Ablewhite in Nottinghamshire;Wednesday 4 January 2023 20:46, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A man who stabbed a mother of three to death in her home less than a week after their relationship ended has been jailed for life.

John Jessop, 26, cycled 17 miles from his home in Newark, Nottinghamshire, to the home of Clair Ablewhite, 47, and attacked her last February.

He was caught on CCTV before Ms Ablewhite was killed in the village of Colston Bassett.

Jessop pleaded guilty to murder at a previous hearing and was sentenced today at Nottingham Crown Court.

He will serve a minimum of 17 years and eight months.

Jessop attacked Ms Ablewhite on 25 February, punching her repeatedly before stabbing her in the neck and chest before cycling home.

Her body was discovered by her father after a friend had raised concerns about her welfare, Nottinghamshire Police said after the hearing.

Ms Ablewhite's neighbour provided the CCTV footage that allowed Jessop to be identified as a suspect.

Detective Inspector Mel Crutchley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""One of my lines of inquiry was to task officers to obtain witness accounts from Clair's family and friends.

""This allowed the team to understand the relationships she had, any known issues that could have contributed to her death and her known movements prior to the murder.""

Officers said Ms Ablewhite had been using a dating website and had communicated with Jessop via social media and WhatsApp.

'A timely reminder for people to think about who they interact with online'

Det Insp Crutchley said that Jessop ""was identified as being known to Clair via social media and had been in an intimate relationship with her from September 2021 which had ended on February 19 2022.

""The contact ceased mainly due to concern over the age difference, and it was evident from the communication that he had been at her Colston Bassett address during the six weeks she had resided there.

""The neighbour played a major part in helping with our investigation by providing that first CCTV image of the killer and I would like to thank him personally for travelling home from France to help us bring Clair's killer to justice.

""It is also a timely reminder for people to think about who they interact with online and to ensure their safety is protected from violent and predatory people like Jessop.""

'No remorse'

He added: ""Throughout this investigation, Jessop has shown no remorse for what he did to Clair. He has consistently provided 'no comment' in interview and offered up no apology.

""The attack he inflicted on Clair was brutal and relentless, causing catastrophic injuries which finally led to her death.

""At the same time that Clair's dad discovers his daughter's body and tries to provide CPR - Jessop is enjoying his first pint in a pub in Newark with mates.

""He has taken away a loving, caring, and outgoing mum, daughter, sister, and friend to many.

""Today's sentence will never bring back Clair, but it does mean that Jessop will spend a considerable part of his life behind prison bars, and I hope this gives her family some comfort.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104204756/http://news.sky.com/story/john-jessop-jailed-for-murder-of-ex-and-mother-of-three-clair-ablewhite-in-nottinghamshire-12779992;Category-7: health

US House of Representatives in chaos after failing six times to vote in nominee Kevin McCarthy as new speaker;Wednesday 4 January 2023 22:29, UK;[];[];"The US House of Representatives has adjourned after six votes over two days failed to produce a new speaker.

The lower house must elect a new leader after the Republicans took control of it in the midterm elections in November, securing a slim 222-212 majority.

In a second day of voting on Wednesday, representatives refused to back Republican Kevin McCarthy as Democrat Nancy Pelosi's replacement.

Despite a call for unity from former president Donald Trump, about 20 Republicans on the party's right refused to back Mr McCarthy for ideological reasons.

Despite being the top Republican in the House since 2019, he secured only 201 votes of the 218 needed, while 20 Republicans voted for Byron Donalds, who was first elected in 2020.

""Well, it's Groundhog Day,"" Representative Kat Cammack said as she nominated Mr McCarthy on the sixth ballot.

""To all Americans watching right now, we hear you. And we will get through this - no matter how messy,"" she added.

Rick Singer: Mastermind behind US college admissions scandal jailed for three-and-a-half years;Wednesday 4 January 2023 22:30, UK;['olive enokido-lineham', '@olivelineham'];[];"The mastermind behind the US college admissions scandal which saw celebrities and prominent figures use their wealth and privilege to buy their children places in top universities has been jailed.

Rick Singer, 62, was sentenced to three and a half years behind bars, marking the longest term handed down in the bribery scheme which landed a number of celebrities and athletic coaches in prison.

The scandal exposed the secretive admissions system and saw stars like Desperate Housewives' Felicity Huffman and Full House actor Lori Loughlin sent to jail for participating in it.

Assistant US Attorney Stephen Frank told the judge on Wednesday: ""It was a scheme that was breath-taking in its scale and its audacity. It has literally become the stuff of books and made-for-TV movies.""

Mr Frank said Singer, a former college admissions consultant, took in more than $25m from his clients and paid bribes totalling more than $7m.

""This defendant was responsible for the most massive fraud ever perpetuated on the higher education system in the United States,"" he added.

For years, Singer paid off entrance exam administrators or proctors to inflate students' test scores and bribed coaches to designate applicants as recruits in order to boost their chances of getting into the university.

Coaches from Yale and Stanford accepted bribes

Singer told the judge: ""I lost my ethical values and have so much regret.

""To be frank, I am ashamed of myself.""

Coaches from some of the top US universities including Yale, Stanford, Georgetown and the University of California, Los Angeles, admitted to accepting bribes.

Sports coaches took bribes to pretend to recruit students as athletes with fake sports profiles made to make students look like stars in sports they sometimes didn't even play.

The bribes were typically funnelled through Singer's sham charity, allowing some parents to disguise the payments as charitable donations and deduct the payments from their federal income taxes.

Singer pleaded guilty same day case went public

More than 50 people were convicted in the bribery scheme.

Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli paid $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as rowers - even though neither of them did the sport.

They helped create fake athletic profiles for their daughters by sending Singer photos of the teens posing on rowing machines.

Huffman also pleaded guilty and paid $15,000 to boost her older daughter's SAT scores.

Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 - on the same day the massive case became public - to charges including racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.

Prosecutors had sought a six-year-sentence, noting Singer's extensive cooperation that helped authorities unravel the entire scheme.

In 2018, he began secretly working with investigators and recorded hundreds of phone calls and meetings that helped authorities build the case against dozens of those involved who were arrested in March 2019.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104224739/http://news.sky.com/story/rick-singer-mastermind-behind-us-college-admissions-scandal-jailed-for-three-and-a-half-years-12780042;Category-2: business and economy

Five days in, chief execs at UK's biggest firms have earned as much as typical worker will in 2023;Thursday 5 January 2023 04:55, UK;[];[];"Chief executives of the UK's biggest companies have already earned as much as the average worker will during the whole of 2023, research has found.

By 2pm on Thursday, bosses of FTSE 100 companies will have banked an average of £33,000 since New Year's Day, according to data from the High Pay Centre.

That amount is the same as the median salary for a UK worker during 2022, based on analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics and the financial reports of publicly listed companies.

The ratio has taken on extra significance given the current cost of living crisis.

During 2021, chief executive pay rose by 39%, the High Pay Centre found previously.

Average workers' salaries have increased by a much smaller amount.

""In the worst economic circumstances that most people can remember, it is difficult to believe that a handful of top earners are still raking in such extraordinary amounts of money,"" High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said.

""The UK economy really cannot afford for such a big share of the wealth that is created by all workers to be captured by such a tiny number of people at the top.""

The new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said workers should have ""seats on executive pay committees to bring some common sense to top pay"".

He added: ""Everyone deserves a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. But while working people are told not to ask for more, top pay is soaring.

New car sales hit lowest level since 1992 but supply woes 'beginning to ease';Thursday 5 January 2023 05:43, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The number of new cars sold in the UK last year tumbled to its lowest level since 1992 but the sector says supply shortages, which have held sales back, are ""beginning to ease"".

Preliminary data for 2022 released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed around 1.61 million new cars were registered.

The figure is 2% down on the previous 12 months and 25% down on pre-pandemic levels.

However, sales improved as the year progressed.

The market recorded its fifth consecutive month of growth in December.

The industry body said the annual decline was due to manufacturers being unable to meet demand for new cars due to global supply chain issues, such as semiconductor shortages, which have been exacerbated by COVID restrictions in China.

The squeeze has meant that factories worldwide have been unable to produce the volume of vehicles they would wish.

Carmakers have strong order books, despite the cost of living crisis putting huge pressure on household budgets, with some waiting lists extending beyond 12 months.

More details are set to be revealed after 9am on Thursday but the early data showed that demand was shifting away from traditionally-powered petrol and diesel models.

As the clock ticks down to the 2030 ban on the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, battery electric took a market share of around 17% in 2022.

That meant it surpassed diesel for the first time to become the second most popular powertrain after petrol.

Image: Parts shortages have been a thorn in carmakers' tyres globally since the start of the COVID pandemic

Some 23% of all new cars registered were plug-in vehicles, which includes pure electrics and plug-in hybrids.

The SMMT forecast that new car registrations would rise by around 15% this year - reflecting the pent-up demand and easing of global supply chain difficulties which include the end of punitive COVID restrictions in China.

Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, said 2022 was ""a very difficult year"".

""Manufacturers have really struggled to be able to make the vehicles in sufficient quantities, primarily due to semiconductor shortages but there are other parts shortages behind that as well.

""Lockdowns in China have not helped, high logistics costs, more pressure on raw materials.

""The complexities of global manufacturing have really been brought to bear heavily on the industry this past year.""

He added: ""The automotive market remains adrift of its pre-pandemic performance but could well buck wider economic trends by delivering significant growth in 2023.

""To secure that growth - which is increasingly zero emission growth - government must help all drivers go electric and compel others to invest more rapidly in nationwide charging infrastructure.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105061755/http://news.sky.com/story/new-car-sales-hit-lowest-level-since-1992-but-supply-woes-beginning-to-ease-12779810;Category-2: business and economy
Iron Maiden stamps: Royal Mail immortalises 'bona fide rock legends' in post - along with mascot Eddie;Thursday 5 January 2023 05:03, UK;[];[];"They're one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, with more than 100 million albums sold and 2,500 live shows across 64 countries under their belts.

Twelve Iron Maiden stamps have been created, with eight featuring all current members of the band.

Guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, Janick Gers and lead singer Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain and bassist Steve Harris all appear in the commemorative project.

Four stamps also pay homage to the band's mascot Eddie, including him as a samurai warrior from their 17th album, Senjutsu, which charted at number two in the UK in 2021.

Harris said he and his bandmates are ""very proud"" to be honoured by the Royal Mail.

""We were all absolutely astounded - in a good way - when we heard first about the commemorative project, and equally pretty much speechless when we saw the stamps for the very first time,"" he said.

""They look superb and I think they really capture the essence and energy of Maiden.""

Formed by Harris in London in 1975, Iron Maiden have had 35 songs in the top 40, according to Official Charts Company - including one number one, the 1988 single Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter.

They have also had five number-one albums including Fear Of The Dark, The Book Of Souls, The Final Frontier, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and The Number Of The Beast.

Rod Smallwood, the band's manager, said: ""As a band who have never played by anyone else's rules for over 40 years, it's very gratifying to see them honoured in their home country in this way.

""We're proud to show how these six band members are still appealing to more and more fans every year with their music and their legendary shows - which I think these stamps really capture well.""

The stamps also feature the Queen's silhouette, having been created before the move to feature the King.

""It's also fantastic that Eddie has been honoured too - it's incredible to think that Her Majesty, may she rest in peace, saw these and lent her iconic silhouette to them too,"" Smallwood added.

David Gold, director of external public affairs and policy at Royal Mail, said: ""Few bands in the history of rock music can be called bona fide rock legends - but Iron Maiden are just that - and more.""

The Royal Mail stamps are available to order from Thursday 5 January and are on sale from 12 January.

EU 'strongly encourages' members to impose COVID testing on passengers from China - in move likely to anger Beijing;Thursday 5 January 2023 11:43, UK;[];[];"The EU has ""strongly encouraged"" member states to impose pre-departure COVID testing on passengers from China in a move which will likely anger Beijing.

The global airline industry has criticised the ""knee-jerk"" reinstatement of measures by some EU countries, saying they have ""proven ineffective over the past three years"".

It comes after the EU stopped short of agreeing all 27 member states must impose pre-departure testing on visitors from China following a week of talks.

However, members including Italy, France and Spain have already implemented the measure at a national level.

Outside of the EU, people arriving in England from mainland China have to provide a negative COVID test before flying.

The US had previously announced similar rules.

China had earlier warned of ""countermeasures"" if such policies were to be imposed across the European Union.

Earlier on Wednesday, EU Commission spokesman Tim McPhie had said that the ""overwhelming majority of countries are in favour"" of imposing testing of passengers from China prior to departure.

But the EU apparently could not find agreement to bind them all.

The EU presidency said in a statement that the member states ""agreed on a coordinated precautionary approach"" but fell short of full agreement.

In the most crucial part of the statement, it said that ""member states are strongly encouraged to introduce, for all passengers departing from China to member states, the requirement for a negative COVID-19 test"".

On other issues, the EU said there was full agreement to have passengers wear masks when travelling to and from China and to offer advice on personal hygiene and health issues.

The Chinese government and European health experts have said there is no pressing need for any blanket restrictions on travel, since the coronavirus variants emerging from China are already prevalent in Europe.

On Wednesday the International Air Transport Association, which represents some 300 airlines worldwide, lent its powerful voice to the protests.

""It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years,"" said director general Willie Walsh.

""Research undertaken around the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days,"" Mr Walsh said.

However, World Health Organisation head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday he understood why numerous countries have recently taken measures against travellers coming from China, given the lack of outbreak data from the Chinese government.

The EU also said its approach was partly based on the need for ""sufficient, reliable data"" from China.

The bloc said it will reassess the situation by the middle of the month, one week after China's easing of travel restrictions on its citizens becomes official on 8 January.

A day after threatening countermeasures, Chinese government spokesperson Mao Ning said on Wednesday that ""we sincerely hope that all parties will focus on fighting the epidemic itself, avoid the politicisation of COVID"".

Still, the EU sought to take some sort of joint action to ensure incoming passengers from China do not transmit any potential new variants to the continent.

SafetyNet Credit parent close to collapse after FCA crackdown;Thursday 5 January 2023 11:30, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"A provider of high-cost credit to hundreds of thousands of Britons is on the brink of collapse following a crackdown on the industry by the City regulator.

Sky News has learnt that Indigo Michael, the parent company of loan providers SafetyNet Credit and Tappily, filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators shortly before Christmas.

The company could formally fall into insolvency proceedings within days, according to credit industry executives.

Indigo Michael employs roughly 250 people and has about 150,000 active customers.

One source suggested that it had secured agreement from the Financial Conduct Authority to continue new lending and loan recoveries during any administration process.

Last year, it was reported that the FCA had placed restrictions on SafetyNet Credit's operations amid concerns about the company's lending activities.

Both SafetyNet Credit and Tappily, its sister brand, provide revolving credit, meaning customers do not need to apply for additional borrowing once they have repaid outstanding debts.

The FCA has made tackling high-cost credit provisions one of its priorities in recent years, with dozens of so-called payday lenders disappearing from the market.

AlixPartners, the professional services firm, has been lined up to handle Indigo Michael's insolvency.

Christmas shoppers shrugged off rail strikes but business hurt by Royal Mail disruption, reports show;Thursday 5 January 2023 13:45, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"UK high streets do not appear to have suffered a major hit from rail strikes in the run-up to Christmas but business has been hurt by industrial action at Royal Mail, according to separate reports.

Figures from retail consultants Springboard showed a 12.7% leap in visits to high streets during December compared to the same month in 2021.

Springboard said shopper footfall across all retail destinations was almost 10% higher on a year ago, despite a 20% drop in the penultimate week before Christmas that saw disruption from four days of railway strikes.

The data offers hope that Christmas shoppers provided retail and hospitality with a crucial boost despite the disruption to travel and cost of living crisis.

There was strong evidence to back that up in trading updates from Next, Greggs and B&M; on Thursday, which all saw an expansion in their share prices as sales beat expectations.

Thursday also brought data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that supported complaints from businesses about the impact of strikes at Royal Mail.

It reported that in November - a crucial month for Christmas readiness - that 16% of UK firms had been affected by the action.

More than a quarter (28%) of those businesses reported they were unable to obtain necessary goods.

Royal Mail's 115,000 frontline staff walked out that month on days deliberately timed to disrupt Black Friday and Cyber Monday online shopping deliveries.

The dispute, over pay and working terms, also saw strikes wipe out six days in December including Christmas Eve leading to massive backlogs.

There is no end in sight to the dispute, led by the Communication Workers Union.

It has become increasingly personal and entrenched, though no new strike dates have been announced pending further talks between Royal Mail and union bosses.

The separate rail disputes, involving the RMT and Aslef unions, also appear to be no closer to a solution.

Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said: ""There is no doubt that rail strikes impact retail and hospitality at the time they occur.

""However, the longer-term impact of the strikes on December's footfall appeared to be negligible.""

She added: ""While many employees worked from home in December due to the strikes, consumers were not deterred from visiting bricks-and-mortar stores and shifted some of their trips away from high streets to shopping centres and retail parks which can be more easily reached by car.""

Ms Wehrle also pointed out that if the strain on household budgets from the higher cost of living was not evident ahead of Christmas, then the risk would be that retail, leisure and hospitality destinations could suffer ahead.

""We should expect footfall in January to be circa 20% lower than in December, which is the magnitude of decline that has occurred in January in every year since Springboard started publishing its footfall data in 2009.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105154703/http://news.sky.com/story/christmas-shoppers-shrugged-off-rail-strikes-but-business-hurt-by-royal-mail-disruption-12780462;Category-2: business and economy
Damar Hamlin: Buffalo Bills player shows 'remarkable improvement' and 'appears to be neurologically intact';Thursday 5 January 2023 16:19, UK;[];[];"The NFL player who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game ""has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours"", Buffalo Bills have said.

In a statement, they said Damar Hamlin, 24, was still ""critically ill"" but ""has demonstrated that he appears to be neurologically intact"".

""Per the physicians caring for Damar Hamlin at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Damar has shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours,"" they said.

""His lungs continue to heal, and he is making steady progress.""

He has been in a critical condition in hospital since Monday evening when he collapsed on the field in Cincinnati.

A further update was given by teammate Kaiir Elam, who tweeted: ""Our boy is doing better, awake and showing more signs of improvement. Thank you God. Keep the prayers coming please. All love 3!""

The defensive back collapsed on the field and was given CPR for about 10 minutes after he was injured when making a tackle during a match against the Cincinnati Bengals.

He collided with Bengals' wide receiver Tee Higgins in the incident on Monday night.

He then managed to get to his feet and appeared to adjust his helmet before tumbling backwards and lying motionless.

The Bills said his heart stopped before his heartbeat was then ""restored"" on the pitch by medical staff.

His football shirt was cut off, and he was reportedly given oxygen.

Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Hamlin's uncle Dorrian Glenn said: ""His heart had went out, so they had to resuscitate him twice.

""They resuscitated him on the field before they brought him to the hospital, and then they resuscitated him a second time when they got him to the hospital.

""I'm not a crier, but I've never cried so hard in my life. Just to know, like, my nephew basically died on the field, and they brought him back to life.""

Barber shop owner who sent COVID grants money to Islamic State fighters jailed;Thursday 5 January 2023 14:20, UK;[];[];"A barber shop owner who sent thousands of pounds to Islamic State (IS) fighters in Syria after claiming COVID grant payments has been jailed for 12 years.

Tarek Namouz, 43, from Hammersmith in west London, had received the bounce back loans to help his business, Boss Crew Barbers, during the pandemic.

He had been earlier found guilty at Kingston Crown Court of eight counts of funding terrorism and two counts of possessing information likely to be useful for terrorism.

After Judge Peter Lodder KC handed down the sentence on Thursday, also at Kingston Crown Court, which included a further year on extended licence, Namouz expressed his thanks to the judge but shouted ""May Allah destroy you"" at officers.

He had been accused of sending money - intended to fund a militia in Syria - on dates between November 2020 and April 2021, the court heard.

Officers identified seven transfers with a total of about £11,280.

While on remand, he was recorded telling someone visiting him in prison he had sent around £25,000, the court was told.

When police raided the barber's shop in Blythe Road, Olympia, prosecutors say they found cash and a hidden mobile phone containing messages to a contact in Syria, an IS bomb-making video and a video showing how to kill with a knife.

Namouz lived in a third-floor flat above the shop.

Commander Richard Smith, who leads the Met's counter terrorism command, said: ""Terrorist groups rely on funding to carry out their activities and to continue to operate.

""People like Namouz who provide money to terrorist groups - both in the UK and overseas - are enabling others to go and commit serious and deadly attacks, and we will always pursue and investigate those people and seek to bring them to justice.""

Image: Namouz lived in a third-floor flat above his business in Hammersmith

Judge Peter Lodder KC said Namouz had demonstrated a ""commitment to terrorism"" and planned to ""re-establish a state run in accordance with extreme Islamic principles"".

""In 2020 and 2021 you ran a barber's shop in Hammersmith,"" he said. ""You were entitled to Covid bounce back loans which were paid to you by the local council.

""You sent that money, and other money, through a west London transfer and currency exchange, to terrorists in Syria.""

Namouz denied knowing the money would be used for terrorism, telling police he sent the funds to ""help... the poor and needy in Syria"".

But analysis of one of Namouz's phones showed they were in regular WhatsApp contact and talked about buying a building for ""storing weapons"", such as Kalashnikovs, heavy machine guns and explosives, and occupying it with ""IS fighters"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105173243/http://news.sky.com/story/barber-shop-owner-who-sent-covid-grants-money-to-islamic-state-fighters-jailed-12779705;Category-7: health

Six women arrested after suspicious death of one-year-old boy at nursery;Thursday 5 January 2023 20:14, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"Six women have been arrested in connection with the suspicious death of a one-year-old boy at a nursery.

West Midlands Police said a criminal investigation was launched after the toddler died at Fairytales Day Nursery, in Bourne Street, Dudley, on 9 December last year.

The nursery was closed by Ofsted along with other linked premises on 14 December after the watchdog said ""children may be at risk of harm"" and suspended its registration.

The force said three women aged 20, 23 and 50 were arrested on 16 December on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and later bailed.

Three more women aged 51, 53 and 37 were detained on Wednesday - two on suspicion of corporate manslaughter and one on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.

In a statement, police said: ""We are treating the death of a one-year-old boy on December 9, at a Dudley nursery as suspicious and an investigation is under way.""

The force added: ""The boy's family is being supported by specially trained officers.

""A post-mortem has taken place but further tests will be conducted to establish the exact cause of death.""

Two ambulances, trauma doctor and air ambulance sent to scene

West Midlands Ambulance Service said medics were called to premises in Bourne Street at 3.19pm and two ambulances, a trauma doctor and an air ambulance were sent to the scene.

""On arrival crews found a child in a critical condition,"" the ambulance service said. ""Medics commenced advanced life support which continued en route to Russells Hall Hospital (Dudley) by ambulance.""

However, the youngster died despite the efforts of medical personnel.

'We believe children may be at risk of harm'

An Ofsted report published in February last year found provision at the multi-award-winning nursery to be good overall.

However, inspectors returned on 15 December last year after Fairytales' management told the watchdog of ""a serious incident involving a child in their care"" at the Bourne Street site on 9 December.

The provider, which runs two nursery sites, is legally obliged to tell Ofsted if there has been a ""serious accident, illness or injury to, or death of, any child while in their care"".

In a report published on 22 December, the watchdog said it had suspended the nursery's registration on 14 December having ""received concerns that the provider was not meeting some of the safeguarding and welfare requirements"".

""We suspended the provider's registration because we believe children may be at risk of harm,"" the report said.

During a visit on 15 December, inspectors found the nursery had failed to tell authorities about a change of manager, ""which is an offence"", and uncovered welfare shortcomings, particularly in the care of babies in the sleeping room.

Ofsted report highlights 'risks in the baby room'

Setting out what actions which, by law, needed to be taken at the site by 13 January, Ofsted directed the nursery to ""ensure at least half the staff who care for babies have received training that specifically addresses the care of babies"".

It must also ""demonstrate how you will ensure sleeping babies are frequently checked to ensure that they are safe"", as well as ""review and implement sleeping arrangements to ensure children are placed down to sleep safely in line with latest government safety guidance"".

Ofsted said all staff must have the correct ""qualifications, training, skills, knowledge, and a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities with regards to sleeping children"" and the nursery must ""take all reasonable steps to ensure children in your care are not exposed to risks, paying particular attention to risks in the baby room"".

It said the provider must also ""ensure risk assessment is effective and identify aspects of the environment that need to be checked on a regular basis... and how the risk will be removed or minimised"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105204755/http://news.sky.com/story/six-women-arrested-after-suspicious-death-of-one-year-old-boy-at-nursery-12780716;Category-7: health
Protesters occupy German village Luetzerath earmarked for demolition to make way for coal mine;Thursday 5 January 2023 20:09, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];[];"Environmental activists occupying a German village due to be swallowed up by a coal mine have vowed to fight on as police gear up to evict them.

The village of Luetzerath in western Germany has gradually been abandoned by its original inhabitants, as it is set to be demolished to make way for an extension to the Garzweiler II lignite mine.

The village stands just a few hundred meters from a vast pit where German utility giant RWE extracts lignite coal to burn in nearby power plants.

The fate of the village embodies the broader debate over Germany's efforts to wean itself off coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, by 2030, amid the gas crisis.

Environmentalists, who warn the coal would release millions of tonnes of climate-heating carbon dioxide and harmful air pollution, moved into the abandoned homes of former residents two years ago.

The group LuetziBleibt - which translates as Luetzi is Staying - claimed ""around a couple of hundred people"" were currently hunkered down in the village and expects more to join at the weekend.

""We want the coal to stay in the ground because it threatens the basis of human civilisation,"" said Johanna Inkermann, a spokesperson for Luetzi is Staying.

""With climate catastrophe already being here, already harshly affecting people in the Global South, who have not caused [it], we are demanding a change in our current economic system,"" she told Sky News over the phone from the camp.

But the Heinsberg county administration has given the police the go-ahead to evict the occupiers from Tuesday 10 January. The activists expect police to start by fencing off the village to prevent more people from joining.

""We will definitely not be moved,"" vowed Ms Inkermann.

""We will keep standing in the way of the destruction that is happening here... we will defend this village and we will defend climate justice.""

Last summer the German government said it was forced to fire up additional coal power, in a ""bitter but necessary"" move to fill the gap left by Russian gas cut off by President Vladimir Putin.

Ministers have been exploring how to boost clean power, aiming to source 80% of the country's electricity from renewables by 2030.

The ministry for economic affairs and climate action and the mine operator, RWE, were not immediately available to comment, but last year said the war in Ukraine had amplified the importance of a secure supply of lignite coal for power plants.

One study by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) claims the lignite coal below Luetzerath was not needed to secure German power supply, even in the absence of Russian gas.

The protesters believe Germany can find ways to manage without the coal.

""It's about getting the grid more flexible and building up possibilities to store energy,"" as well as building further renewable power, said Ms Inkermann.

She said it was not the group's responsibility to come up with alternatives, but to stop the expansion of the mine to protect people from climate change.

""After all,"" she added, the ""climate catastrophe doesn't wait for this problem to be solved. And we don't have time anymore to to burn more coal... we have to manage multiple crises at the same time. And it's entirely possible"".

A glitch and new red tape leave UK exporters facing EU border disruption;Thursday 5 January 2023 21:10, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Hauliers exporting goods to the European Union have faced fresh disruption since the turn of the year as a glitch in the UK's digital customs system and new demands from French authorities threaten delays.

Drivers heading to ports in the first few days of January found they were unable to enter details of shipments in the government's Goods Vehicle Management System (GVMS) because it did not recognise the change in year to '2023'.

Hauliers exporting canned foods to the EU via France meanwhile face new demands that paperwork be presented only translated into French, leading to dismay among trade groups at the lack of certainty around border controls two years after Brexit.

The GVMS was introduced in 2020 to coordinate post-Brexit exports to the EU by linking vehicles to customs declarations required since the UK left the EU.

The system requires each shipment to enter a unique Movement Reference Number, which begins with a prefix code containing the year and the country of origin.

Exporters, hauliers and customs agents trying to ship goods on routes between the UK and Holland in the first two days of the year found the system would not accept the new prefix '23GB'.

Instead of a smooth automated process through the border, they were required to drive to inland border facilities to get oral confirmation from Border Force officials, and have documentation hand-stamped.

HM Revenue and Customs, which manages GVMS, confirmed there had been a problem with the system but said disruption was ""minimal"".

An HMRC spokesperson said: ""We experienced technical difficulties with the GVMS for a short period on Monday and it is now fixed.

""A few traders were sent to our Inland Border Facilities, where we worked closely with them to ensure they reached their destination as quickly as possible. We apologise for any disruption caused.""

In a separate challenge for British exporters, the French authorities have begun demanding that some paperwork for food exports, known as attestations, be provided only in French and threatening to refuse goods that do not comply.

Image: French authorities are making new demands of some UK exporters

The new rules, unilaterally announced with just three days' notice on 28th December ahead of planned introduction on 1 January, require paperwork for ""shelf-stable composite goods"" - tinned goods, sweets and similar - to be provided in French only.

In communication sent to the UK authorities the French Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection Service (SIVEP) said: ""As English is not the official language of SIVEP border control posts, this leads to difficulties in understanding and may lead to errors of assessment of the validity of the documents presented.

""Therefore, in order to facilitate the control of the attestations by SIVEP agents, you will have to provide a private attestation in French as from the 1st of January 2023.

""Otherwise, all shipments accompanied by a private attestation written in a foreign language after this date will be blocked at the border control post.""

Following a negotiation with the French, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has negotiated a delay to the new rules until 15 January, but they cannot be prevented as they are an interpretation of rules covered by the Brexit deal.

Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, told Sky News the changes to rules will undermine exporter confidence.

""Two years past Brexit and we now live with the reality that the way the rules are interpreted can change from one day to the next.

""It leaves us with an ongoing unease that undermines confidence and prevents businesses from seeking out new customers, making investments, or settling into new long term business structures.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105223242/http://news.sky.com/story/a-glitch-and-red-tape-leave-uk-exporters-facing-eu-border-disruption-12780652;Category-2: business and economy
Backstage with... Christian Bale and The Pale Blue Eye cast on humanising Edgar Allen Poe;Friday 6 January 2023 05:29, UK;[];[];"He's known as a master of macabre, for pioneering the short story in the US and is credited with inventing the detective fiction genre.

But perhaps far less is known about the gothic writer Edgar Allan Poe as a person.

Now, a new film about the poet is looking to change that. The Pale Blue Eye - based on the book of the same name - explores the period of Poe's life when he found himself at the US Military Academy. The movie imagines the young writer teaming up with a detective to investigate a series of murders.

While Poe is played by Harry Potter star Harry Melling, Christian Bale plays the lead veteran detective Augustus Landor, and the starry ensemble cast also includes Gillian Anderson, Timothy Spall and Lucy Boynton.

But as filming started in November 2021, Bale told Sky News' Backstage Podcast that, despite being part of a big cast, he largely spent his time off-camera on his own.

""It was still right in the middle of COVID,"" he explained.

""I think they were being really draconian with me - like they wouldn't let me see anybody, because everybody was getting ill at some point, but they were like, 'man, if you get ill the whole production has to stop'.""

""So they were like 'get back to your room and stay in your room' - and I did!""

The film is a murder mystery, so only when it's over does the viewer realise the breadcrumbs that have been left for them along the way in terms of figuring out whodunnit.

Bale, who is also one of the movie's producers, says, as an actor, it makes for an interesting challenge.

""I would give Scott [Cooper - the film's director] some variation, some choices he could have in the edit room,"" Bale said.

""Scott is always very meticulous and really very precise in what he wants and he tends to be exactly right, so he doesn't experiment too much.

""But, with this, because it was such a particular balancing act, I tried to give him a few variations and I think he really nailed it.""

Poe isn't the main character, but the film explores the literary trailblazer in a setting most people aren't aware he was ever in.

Gillian Anderson told Sky News' Backstage Podcast that's one of the things that made the film attractive to her.

""It was interesting to dive into something that had such a strong element of gothic thriller-esque, but at the same time, an origin story about somebody who wouldn't normally be in that kind of circumstance.

""The fact that he was at West Point [the military academy] for a period of time - what does a person who is an artist, who is so different from what you might normally find at West Point and the rigidity of West Point, what do they do under those circumstances?

""I think that that threw into light a whole other side of Poe that I hadn't really even thought about before, which I found fascinating,"" she told the podcast.

The actress plays Mrs Marquis, the wife of the doctor who performs an autopsy on one of the murder victims. The character is a real oddball and Anderson admits that it's good fun to play someone so strange.

""It's very freeing - I remember feeling that a few years ago I did Blanche in [A Streetcar Named Desire at the National Theatre] and there's something about Blanche that you just feel like you could do almost anything. It just feels that you can give all of those bits that you've restrained in yourself to another character.

""It was similar with Mrs Marquis, I think, because she's so unpredictable, and what we see in the film is real eccentricity and quirkiness.

""To be able to push that to varying levels on a day is enjoyable.""

Poe also comes across as odd at times.

Melling, who plays him, says that while preparing for the role he found himself engaged in some curious behaviour himself - rehearsing lines in his local cemetery.

""Very respectfully, I should add,"" he told Backstage.

Image: Harry Melling (R) told Sky News' Backstage podcast about why he decided to learn his lines in a graveyard... Credit: Scott Garfield/Netflix

""But yeah early on, I was reading a lot about Edgar being obsessed with the dead with death and the occult, and I thought, you know, I'm just going to head to the graveyard with my book and see what comes to me.

""And it slowly became a routine of going to the cemetery, and reading a bit, and just going through some of the things he says, and just slowly building up that world for him and how he thought. It was just a very early sort-of building block phase to getting to Edgar.""

Melling says he also set off on a deep dive in terms of researching the writer.

""What I found really useful was his early life - losing both his parents, being adopted, moving to London, then moving back to Virginia,"" he said.

""All of that stuff about being a bit of a nomad early on explained a lot in terms of what Scott Cooper's script was doing with this character, who was constantly trying to invent himself a persona as the young poet.

""But there's only so much you can take research I think… and also people have such a fixed idea of who Edgar is. It was very interesting to go back and work out, 'okay, who is this person before we get to this idea of this icon, this American writer of the macabre and the dark?', and that was a really interesting exercise for me.""

Melling's co-star Lucy Boynton agreed the script certainly sheds new light on Poe.

""[The film is] exploring the person behind the reputation and facade that we're aware of,"" she told Sky News.

""I think I've realised I hadn't really questioned what he, what the person behind all of that work and kind of gothic forefront, would be, so it was really beautiful to see Harry's interpretation of that but also just the exploration of this script of the sensitivity behind the strength of that work.""

The Pale Blue Eye is streaming on Netflix.

Former Chelsea player and manager Gianluca Vialli dies aged 58;Friday 6 January 2023 10:09, UK;[];[];"Former Chelsea player and manager Gianluca Vialli has died aged 58 after a battle with cancer.

The Italian, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer five years ago, played for and managed the London club scoring 40 goals in 88 games between 1996 and 1999.

As a manager, he won three major trophies during his time at Stamford Bridge, after he took over as a player-manager in 1998 winning the League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup in his first few months in charge.

He eventually added the FA Cup to the trophy cabinet in 2000.

Before joining Chelsea, Vialli won every trophy possible in Italian club football during stints at both Sampdoria and Juventus, as well as breaking the world record transfer fee at the time when he moved from the former to the latter for £12.5 million.

On the international stage, he won 59 caps for Italy, scoring 16 goals and appearing in both the 1986 and 1990 World Cups.

More recently, he joined Roberto Mancini's coaching staff with the national team, helping them to victory in the European Championships having been given the all clear from cancer in 2020.

Junior doctors set to go on three-day strike in March if industrial action approved;Friday 6 January 2023 10:02, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];[];"Junior doctors will go on strike for the second time ever in March - if they vote for industrial action in a ballot beginning next week.

The British Medical Association (BMA) has today set the potential strike action for March ahead of a ballot starting on Monday.

Junior doctors - any doctor below consultant level - in England will walk out for 72 hours and will not provide emergency care during the strike, the BMA said.

It is not yet clear whether the strike is likely to go ahead, but it is understood the threshold of 50% of those balloted to strike is likely to be met.

If the strike goes ahead, it will be the second time junior doctors have walked out over pay and conditions.

The first ever strikes happened in 2016, when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was health secretary.

Junior doctors are calling for better pay after they were excluded from an NHS pay rise this year because their contract is subject to a multi-year pay deal that gives them a 2% rise for 2022/2023.

They have also said junior doctors in England have seen a real-terms pay cut over the past 15 years, which amounts to a 26.1% decline in pay since 2008/9.

And the BMA says the risk to patients caused by the low pay means it has been left with no option but to ballot junior doctors for strike action.

The BMA has urged Health Secretary Steve Barclay to sit down with doctors to negotiate to avoid industrial action.

Both Rishi Sunak and Mr Barclay have said their doors are open for unions to talk with them.

But the BMA says Mr Barclay is ""the first health secretary for over 50 years to continue to ignore all invitations"" to meet with doctors.

Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMS junior doctors committee said: ""When we are faced with such resolute ongoing silence, and there is no agreed settlement on the table, then we are left with no choice but to act.

""Junior doctors are not worth a quarter less than they were 15 years ago nor do they deserve to be valued so little by their own government.

""Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly.

""The government's refusal to address 15 years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action.

""If the government won't fight for our health service, then we will.""

Ambulance workers, auxiliary NHS staff and nurses all went on strike in December over pay and conditions.

Nurses are set to go on strike again on 18 and 19 January, but that could be avoided after the Royal College of Nursing indicated on Thursday it would accept a pay rise of around 10%, instead of 19%, to end its ongoing dispute.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230106101712/http://news.sky.com/story/junior-doctors-set-to-go-on-three-day-strike-in-march-if-industrial-action-approved-12780979;Category-7: health

Date confirmed for first orbital launch from UK soil;Friday 6 January 2023 10:48, UK;[];[];"A historic rocket launch that will blast satellites into space from the UK's southwest coast will take place on Monday.

Should bad weather or other problems present themselves between now and the launch window, backup dates have been earmarked for later in the week.

Melissa Thorpe, head of Spaceport Cornwall, described the launch date as a ""phenomenal moment"" that would ""transform access to space across the world"".

Preparation for the launch began to ramp up at the end of last year, with the Civil Aviation Authority granting the UK's first ever spaceport licence in November.

Virgin Orbit, the launch operator, was awarded its own licences the following month.

This week, licences were granted to each of the satellites being carried, among them the so-called Dover Pathfinder, designed in the UK by engineering company RHEATECH.

Pathfinder is the first step towards the creation of a constellation of satellites to safeguard the country's defence and critical national infrastructure, including power grids and communications networks, from hostile threats.

How to watch the UK's historic rocket launch

Everything you need to know about UK rocket launch

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 44:40 Why are we still racing to space?

How will the launch work?

This will be a horizontal launch rather than a NASA-style vertical one.

Given Cosmic Girl is an old Boeing 747, the view from Spaceport Cornwall will not look dissimilar to any other plane taking off when it takes to the sky under the cover of night.

Under its left wing is LauncherOne, which will be released at 35,000ft over the Atlantic Ocean before accelerating to 8,000mph on its mission to deploy seven satellites into orbit.

Will you be able to see it?

You most likely will - in fact, it will be visible across the UK, Ireland, and parts of France, Portugal, and Spain.

Maps released by Virgin Orbit, the launch operator, show when and where eagle-eyed space enthusiasts in each country can expect to see it in the sky.

The path of the 21m (69ft) rocket - which was designed by Virgin Orbit in California - is shown in blue, with the circles depicting its approximate location at each minute along the way.

Image: This map shows when the rocket will be visible to parts of the UK and Europe

Virgin Orbit says people in the UK and Ireland should be able to see LauncherOne within 60 seconds of ignition, while coastal regions in France, Portugal, and Spain will get a good view within two to three minutes.

The entire launch phase is estimated to last approximately 10 minutes.

Image: The rocket will be visible to most of the UK within moments of ignition

Image: The French, Spanish and Portuguese coasts will be able to see the rocket

What makes the mission so significant?

The UK has only ever completed one orbital launch, the Black Arrow in 1971, and that actually took off in Australia.

The Cornwall launch forms part of the government's National Space Strategy, and should pave the way for more.

Hoping to follow Start Me Up are launches from Scotland, specifically Sutherland and Shetland - and these will be vertical launches, again carrying satellites.

Ian Annett, deputy chief executive at the UK Space Agency, said the Cornwall launch marked the beginning of a ""new era for space in the UK"".

He said: ""This will lead to new careers, improved productivity and inspire the next generation of space professionals, and this is just the beginning.

""I look forward to seeing more launches from other UK spaceports over the next year, putting us firmly on the map as Europe's leading destination for commercial small satellite launch.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230106124711/http://news.sky.com/story/date-confirmed-for-first-orbital-launch-from-uk-soil-12780960;Category-6: science and technology

Gianluca Vialli: Italy says farewell to a footballing genius who gave us tears, screams, laughter and delight;Friday 6 January 2023 13:14, UK;[];[];"Italy knew that Gianluca Vialli was dying, but still his loss has shaken this country profoundly.

He was more than just a footballer - he was a cultural figure whose passion for his sport, his country and the sanctity of life came before him.

""Gone too soon,"" bemoaned the sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, which described him as ""our fragile friend"" whose ""elegance has always been his hallmark"".

His was not the story of the poor boy made good. Vialli was the son of a self-made millionaire who grew up in a mansion in Lombardy.

But money could not buy his natural skill as a footballer.

He shone for his local team Cremonese, then for Sampdoria, where his ability drew the attention of the world, and then at Juventus, the giants of Turin, who made him into the world's most expensive footballer and reaped the benefits.

From there, he went on to Chelsea and an enduring love affair with life in London.

But he was never anything other than a proud Italian who worked alongside his dear friend Roberto Mancini in managing the national team.

Their hug, in the wake of victory in the final of the 2020 European Championship, was an image that Italy cherished, and was posted by Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, in the minutes after Vialli's death was announced.

Because, for all his absolute genius as a player (and really, he was exceptional, breaking the mould of forward play), I suspect Italy's sadness is about something else.

Image: Vialli celebrates after scoring for Juventus. Pic: AP

Vialli was passionate, joyful and open with his emotions.

He gave us tears, screams, laughter and exasperation, but always delight.

And he was, by the way, famously stylish - dedicated to the crisp shirt and V-neck jumper look in a way familiar to anyone who has spent time in this country.

He wrote a book about the difference between football in Italy and England and gave the proceeds to charity.

Image: Vialli, in blue, playing for Italy against West Germany in 1988

He lived with cancer and suffered its cruel swings between fear, pain, optimism and then, sadly, the disease's final victory over him.

And he did so with a blend of openness and fortitude that we could all hope to emulate.

He worked with the national team until just before Christmas before deciding that he needed to stop.

The sort of person you cannot fail to like.

The kind of footballer who is admired by the players and fans of the opposition. And he is gone at the age of 58.

For Italy - and for all of us - it is a sad day.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230106133216/http://news.sky.com/story/gianluca-vialli-italy-says-farewell-to-a-footballing-genius-who-gave-us-tears-screams-laughter-and-delight-12781043;Category-4: sports
Glyndebourne cancels annual opera tour after Arts Council England cuts funding by half;Friday 6 January 2023 13:19, UK;['bethany minelle', '@bethanyminelle'];[];"Glyndebourne says it will no longer tour in 2023 following ""devastating"" funding cuts announced by Arts Council England (ACE) late last year.

While the world-famous opera house was successful in its application to become be one of ACE's 2023 - 2026 National Portfolio Organisations (NPO), they saw their annual funding slashed by half.

Glyndebourne said the cuts will affect its learning and engagement work, directly impacting community work with children and the elderly.

The company, who have been awarded £800,000 in annual funding, in comparison with £1.6m a year in the previous NPO funding period (2018-2022), said it had been exploring alternative ways to make touring financially viable, without success.

It has previously absorbed losses from the autumn tour - which takes their operas to audiences around the country - with the help of profit from the annual Glyndebourne Festival, which receives no public subsidy.

Launched in 1968, the tour has been responsible for launching the careers of numerous UK and international artists.

The festival, which is held at the Glyndebourne manor house in East Sussex and has taken place since 1936, will continue to take place ever summer. Autumn performances at Glyndebourne will also continue.

Calling the funding cuts ""devastating,"" the managing director of Glyndebourne, Richard Davidson-Houston, said the significant reduction in support ""risks undermining the delicate ecosystem in which we operate"".

Hitting out at ACE, he went on: ""These cuts have been justified in part by the need to redirect public funding to support culture in the regions. In this context, the decision to reduce Glyndebourne's funding by 50% appears contradictory because it has the direct, inevitable and foreseeable consequence of rendering our tour financially unsustainable.""

He said the decision would also impact freelancers working for the company, as well as ""worsen cultural provision for audiences around the country"".

Artistic director of Glyndebourne, Stephen Langridge, called the tour cancellation ""a huge blow"".

Cities including Canterbury, Norwich and Milton Keynes will miss out on the planned main stage performances, and community projects including children singing with the Glyndebourne Chorus, workshops in care homes and chamber music recitals in universities have also been axed.

ACE announced its new funding programme in November, revealing the museums, libraries and art organisations which will receive money between 2023 and 2026.

They said a total of 990 institutions will share £446m each year, up from 714 organisations previously.

As part of proposed plans, ACE said £43.5m would go to organisations outside London, contributing to levelling up for the next three years.

The Native American heroine, who was turned into a Disney cartoon character in the 1995 film, was the 53-year-old actor's 12th great-grandmother.

Norton, who was born in Boston and raised in Columbia, Maryland, said he grew up believing it was just a ""family legend"", but was proven wrong on a recent episode of ancestry show Finding Your Roots on US network PBS.

The programme's host, Henry Louis Gates Jr, said that Pocahontas became Norton's distant relative after marrying colonist John Rolfe.

""You have a direct paper trail. No doubt about it,"" Gates told him.

The pair wed in April 1614 in Jamestown, Virginia, though Pocahontas died just three years later in March 1617 in Gravesend, England, of unknown causes.

Pocahontas had one son, Thomas Rolfe.

Norton said the family discovery ""makes you realise what a small piece of the whole human story you are"".

Gates also revealed that Norton's ancestors had owned slaves, which the actor described as ""uncomfortable"" to hear.

Harry's comments are propaganda and recruitment godsend Dominic Waghorn International Affairs Editor @DominicWaghorn ""Sharing"" may seem a good idea to whatever therapists Harry has been seeing but not in the minds of his former military mates and commanders. There are very good reasons his friends and other veterans have expressed disappointment and concern and urged him to stop. Not least because the revelations about the number of Taliban fighters he has killed will make life potentially more dangerous for his family and other British veterans. Harry was the grandson of Britain's head of state, the Queen, when he served in her armed forces and killed what he says were 25 Taliban fighters. The fact that he has described doing so, so dispassionately is a propaganda and recruitment godsend to the country's enemies, something borne out by the reaction on Taliban and other extremist social media. Whether he likes it or not, as a member of the Royal Family Harry's role is political and has geopolitical and diplomatic consequences. He does not seem to have thought that through. He certainly did not seek authorisation from His Majesty's Government before publication for details that could have a direct consequence on British subjects and interests.

PM to hold 'NHS recovery forum' as pressure builds on health service;Friday 6 January 2023 22:41, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];[];"Ministers, health leaders and clinical experts will meet in Downing Street on Saturday in an attempt to solve the short and long-term issues facing the health service.

Rishi Sunak will host the NHS recovery forum in Number 10 as the winter crisis rolls on, with discussions focusing on social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care.

The prime minister's spokesman said the aim was to ""share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges"" in both health and social care.

But the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, Matthew Taylor, said the meeting would not be able to fix the crisis that ""has been a decade or more in the making"", adding: ""The reality is that there are no silver bullets here.""

The meeting comes amid warnings from senior doctors of the ""intolerable and unbearable"" state of the NHS this winter, with ambulances queuing for hours outside hospitals, several trusts announcing critical incidents, and rising cases of flu and COVID impacting the service.

It also comes as the government remains at loggerheads with nursing and ambulance unions over pay and working conditions, with both professions set to take further strike action later this month.

Junior doctors could join them on the pickets in March if a ballot is approved by union members.

The chief of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Pat Cullen, said on Thursday that she would be willing to ""meet the government halfway"" over its pay demands, with Sky News understanding an increase of 10% could be accepted by her members.

But, while the government has invited unions for further talks next week and health secretary Steve Barclay has said he is ""keen to have a dialogue"", ministers are sticking to their position of following recommendations from the independent pay review body of a rise nearer to 4%.

Saturday's forum will run for the majority of the day, with attendees including chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country, clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services.

Mr Barclay will also attend, alongside Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden, and the chief executive Officer of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard.

But the RCN has not been invited.

Pointing to Mr Sunak's first big speech of the year, where he listed the NHS as one of his priorities in office, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""As the prime minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises.

""That's why we're bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care.

""We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.""

But Labour said patients ""deserve more than a talking shop"".

Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: ""After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started.

""Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?

""After five Conservative prime ministers and seven health secretaries, it's clear that the longer the Conservatives are in power, the longer patients will wait.""

The Liberal Democrats also called the forum ""too little, too late"", with deputy leader Daisy Cooper saying: ""Sunak needs to stop operating at a snail's pace, and start acting with the speed and urgency this unprecedented NHS crisis deserves.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230106231744/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-hold-nhs-recovery-forum-as-pressure-builds-on-health-service-12781174;Category-7: health
Call for three days' paid leave from work for parents grieving after a miscarriage;Saturday 7 January 2023 01:22, UK;[];[];"A campaign is under way to introduce paid leave for parents who suffer a miscarriage.

SNP MP Angela Crawley is introducing a private member's bill that seeks to grant three days of statutory paid leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.

And she has called on fellow MPs to back her.

An estimated one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, but paid bereavement leave is only provided following stillbirth after 24 weeks.

The bill unanimously passed its first Westminster reading in July, but Lanark and Hamilton East MP Ms Crawley said it was talked out by Conservative MPs before its second reading.

A petition was signed by 40,000 people in support of the bill and Ms Crawley said it has received backing from all parties.

Image: Angela Crawley

The Scottish government provides paid leave for public sector workers who have experienced miscarriage.

Ms Crawley said: ""My bill has support from every party in the House of Commons, the only thing it needs now is the support of the UK government.""

Grieving parents 'deserve support'

She said she was urging Tory ministers ""to do the right thing"".

""Parents who experience a miscarriage or stillbirth at any stage of their pregnancy deserve to be properly supported and given the time they may need to grieve and process their loss, without worrying about a hit to finances or taking annual leave.

""The SNP Scottish government has already done this where they have the power. It offers three days' paid leave for parents working in the public sector who suffer miscarriage before 24 weeks.

""However, as employment law remains reserved to Westminster, it can't be implemented across the board without UK legislation.

""People working in the private sector in Scotland shouldn't have to wait for Westminster to act. It must back my bill or devolve the powers to Scotland, so we can make that positive change.""

Miscarriage is 'a very personal experience'

A UK government spokesperson said: ""The government recognises that losing a child at any stage is incredibly difficult and we expect employers to respond with compassion and understanding.

""Miscarriage is a very personal experience and some of those affected may want to stay at home, whilst others may prefer to continue to work or alternatively may need time off later.

""The government believes that individuals are best placed to understand their own specific needs, and good employers will respond to requests made by their employees in a sensitive way.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230107020229/http://news.sky.com/story/call-for-three-days-paid-leave-from-work-for-parents-grieving-after-a-miscarriage-12781462;Category-7: health

Kevin McCarthy finally wins US Speaker vote after tensions boil over in chaotic Congress scenes;Saturday 7 January 2023 06:14, UK;[];[];"Republican Kevin McCarthy has been elected as the new US Speaker after winning the 15th vote following chaotic scenes in Congress.

Mr McCarthy's party had taken control of the House – the US lower chamber – following the midterm elections in the autumn, with a slim 222-212 majority.

Usually, election of the Speaker follows seamlessly, as a formality, with the leader of the largest party a shoo-in for the job.

However, recent splits in the Republican party meant that did not happen until the 15th round of voting.

In the 14th ballot, Mr McCarthy received 216 votes - one shy of the number needed for a victory - as a small faction of right-wing hardliners held out.

He won at last on a margin of 216-211.

He was elected with the votes of fewer than half the House members only because five in his own party withheld their votes – not backing Mr McCarthy as leader, but also not voting for another contender.

US President Joe Biden congratulated him on his success and said he is ""prepared to work with Republicans"" when he can.

'Stay civil'

After the 14th round, a tense exchange ensued, with Mr McCarthy seen walking to the back of the chamber to confront Rep. Matt Gaetz, who did not vote for him.

Mr Gaetz was one of the six remaining Republican holdouts, and voted ""present"" in the 14th and 15th round.

This essentially meant he registered that he was in the House for the vote, but did not back anyone as the next speaker.

A hostile back and forth took place after Mr McCarthy approached him, while a number of Republican lawmakers began to crowd them.

Rep. Mike Rogers, who did back Mr McCarthy in the vote, appeared to lunge in the direction of where Mr Gaetz was sitting, but was held back by other members.

""Stay civil,"" someone was heard shouting.

Rep. Richard Hudson - another Mr McCarthy supporter - was also seen grabbing Mr Rogers around the mouth, but it was unclear what the argument was about.

McCarthy's extensive concessions

A handful of far-right Republicans had felt Mr McCarthy was not conservative enough for the job, despite him agreeing to many of the detractors' demands.

One of the most difficult requests that Mr McCarthy has agreed to is the reinstatement of a longstanding House rule that would allow any single member to call a vote to oust him from office.

That will sharply cut the power he will hold when trying to pass legislation on critical issues including funding the government, addressing the nation's looming debt ceiling and other crises that may arise.

The Speaker is one of the most powerful positions in US politics, and this week's failed votes marked the highest number of ballots for the speakership since 1859.

Sessions to decide on the person for the job had rumbled on for hours in the chamber this week – one even topping eight hours.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230107063214/http://news.sky.com/story/kevin-mccarthy-finally-wins-us-speaker-vote-after-tensions-boil-over-in-chaotic-congress-scenes-12781497;Category-1: politics
Confrontation, anger and Donald Trump - an extraordinary night as US finally gets a new Speaker;Saturday 7 January 2023 09:21, UK;['mark stone', '@stone_skynews'];[];"What an extraordinary night. A Republican politician restraining another. The would-be speaker confronting the man who'd just blocked him.

And a former president calling into the chamber. All of it caught by the cameras inside House of Representatives.

Last-minute deals, angry faces, gatherings of rebels, all captured like modern-day Old Masters.

It all unfolded as the politicians gathered for their 14th vote in four days to elect a speaker - the second in line to the US presidency.

Republican leader Kevin McCarthy thought he had it in the bag this time.

He'd offered so many concessions to the small cohort of ultra-conservative Republicans who'd blocked him for days.

He'd promised them plum, hugely influential committee positions, and promised to change the rules governing his stability. That, he hoped had would get their vote.

His concessions pulled most of these Trumpian disrupters in.

But then a shock. Matt Gaetz, the maverick, controversial conservative wasn't playing ball.

Despite enthusiastically referring to Mr McCarthy as ""speaker-elect"" on Fox News hours earlier, and saying he was ""running out of things to ask McCarthy for"", Mr Gaetz didn't vote for him. Ever-eager for the limelight?

Mr McCarthy lost. He marched to confront Mr Gaetz. They looked angry. Then from behind, another congressman approached. Republican Mike Rogers, with a few words of his own for Mr Gaetz before being restrained by another.

The cameras captured it all.

This is today's Republican Party. And on January 6th it turns out, the anniversary of an insurrection which was fostered by some of these people.

A few yards away, another politician - conspiracy theorist, QAnon supporter and congresswomen Marjorie Taylor Green, controversial even within her own party, was holding her phone out, a call active. On the screen, the initials DT.

Donald Trump - still pulling the strings, or doing his very best to. His team say he was on the phone to several politicians in the chamber, including Mr Gaetz.

His divisive politics enabled this fringe group of ultra-conservatives, who are now disrupting on their own.

For four days Mr McCarthy had capitulated to their fringe demands. They get to call the shots because the Republican majority is so tiny.

It looked like it was all over for Mr McCarthy, for the week at least.

Image: Kevin McCarthy smiles after winning the 15th vote in the House chamber. Pic: AP

But then the man who had voted ""no"" moments earlier had suddenly changed his mind.

Mr Gaetz and Mr McCarthy shook hands. Deals done, a democratic compromise? Or desperate Republican infighting which will put Mr McCarthy as Speaker in a straight jacket, the least powerful speaker in years, unable to govern, beholden to his own far right.

It's said that Kevin McCarthy had always wanted this job.

His fans say he's a true conservative. Not hardline but robust and fair. His detractors say he's always put power and politics ahead of democracy and the American people.

The truth, maybe, is that he will be what those who got him over the line want him to be. He's their man now.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230107100214/http://news.sky.com/story/confrontation-anger-and-donald-trump-an-extraordinary-night-as-us-finally-gets-a-new-speaker-12781551;Category-1: politics

Hamlin's heart had to be re-started twice after he suddenly fell to the ground and went into cardiac arrest during a game last Monday night against the Cincinnati Bengals.

After being described as ""critical"" for days in hospital, he began communicating by writing, then slowly started to speak.

Fans have gathered outside the medical centre in Cincinnati and thousands of messages of support were sent from both the NFL playing community and the wider world.

Lidl claims cost of living boost as Christmas sales rise by a quarter;Monday 9 January 2023 08:22, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Lidl says a rise of almost 25% in UK sales during the key festive season reflected a surge in new shoppers switching from rivals because of the cost of living crisis.

The discount chain said it benefited from 1.3 million more customers in the week ahead of Christmas compared with the previous year.

Shoppers switched nearly £63m in spending from other supermarkets during December, it said, almost triple that of Christmas 2021.

It said the sales performance culminated in its busiest ever trading day on Friday 23 December.

The surge was likely driven by a number of factors, including the stampede for cheaper groceries witnessed over the past year as the cost of living crisis has intensified.

These include the impact of inflation on many products - and new store openings - flattering the data.

Lidl does not provide comparable same-store sales figures.

However, industry figures have consistently shown market share growth for Lidl and its greatest discount rival Aldi - with the latter leading the way.

The latest Kantar Worldpanel report showed Lidl's market share last month at 7.2% compared with 6.3% 12 months previously.

Aldi's rose from 7.7% to 9.1%.

Market leader Tesco - along with its biggest rival Sainsbury's - will update the City on their respective performances later this week.

Data would suggest that the major chains have also done well over the festive season due to more people staying in because of the squeeze on budgets from energy-led inflation.

Ryan McDonnell, chief executive of Lidl GB, said: ""Every week of the year we are seeing more customers coming through our doors, switching spend to Lidl from the traditional supermarkets.""

He added: ""Our strategy - great quality products at low prices - has remained the same since we first opened our doors over 28 years ago. That is only because it's as relevant now as it ever has been.

""It is working because we are seeing big switching gains, with over £63m of spend moving to us in the four weeks to the 25th of December.

""We only see this momentum continuing in 2023.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109090256/http://news.sky.com/story/lidl-claims-cost-of-living-boost-as-christmas-sales-rise-by-a-quarter-12782902;Category-2: business and economy
Energy bill support for businesses to be cut back from April through discount;Monday 9 January 2023 07:14, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"All businesses are set to secure further taxpayer support for their energy bills when the current scheme ends in March but at a reduced cost to the taxpayer.

The government is set to confirm later on Monday that it has decided on applying a discount to wholesale prices, for up to a year, following talks involving business leaders last week.

It would replace the fixed price on wholesale energy costs which the Treasury has estimated would cost £18bn over the six-month lifetime of the outgoing Energy Bill Relief Scheme.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had labelled that cost as ""unsustainably expensive"".

However, it is understood that the details to be revealed in the Commons later on Monday will include a higher level of discount for energy intensive businesses, such as steelmakers, from April.

The announcement will be made against a backdrop of discontent among businesses over the length of time it has taken for ministers to agree the extent of the new taxpayer support.

The hospitality sector, for example, has further warned that too large a cut in the level of support available for businesses would result in a string of firms going bust.

There is no word yet on what the level of discount will be.

A glimmer of hope for struggling firms can, however, be seen in current wholesale prices.

Despite the continuing war in Ukraine, gas costs have come down markedly from their recent peaks thanks, in part, to the largely mild winter experienced across Europe so far.

UK day ahead gas costs, which were at 570p per therm last August, stood at 158p last Friday.

Contracts for the coming months were only just ahead of that price which is a pre-Russia invasion level - a 15-month low.

Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at energy market intelligence firm ICIS, said: ""Concerns that there may not be enough gas available for this winter to cover demand have started to evaporate.

""But this does not mean we are out of the woods yet.

""Storages have to be refilled again through the upcoming summer, so they are ready again for next winter. And refilling those storage sites is going to be much harder than last year, given there will be noticeably less Russian gas available.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109093210/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-bill-support-for-businesses-to-be-cut-back-from-april-through-discount-12782859;Category-2: business and economy
Downing Street 'considering one-off payment for nurses' to end strikes after previously rejecting idea;Monday 9 January 2023 09:55, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];[];"Downing Street is believed to be considering a one-off payment for nurses after rejecting the idea before Christmas.

About six weeks ago Steve Barclay, the health secretary, floated the idea of giving nurses a single payment to cover the increased cost of living this financial year, ending in April, but Downing Street and the Treasury rejected it, Sky News understands.

It is understood No 10 is now warming to the idea as nurses prepare for strike action on 18 and 19 January after walking out for the first time before Christmas.

The Royal College of Nursing has said it would accept a pay rise of about 10% - down from its initial demand of 19% - if the government could meet them half way.

The union said it would call off strike action if the government discussed pay for this financial year, but ministers have said that was all decided long ago and they only want to talk about next year's pay.

RCN England director Patricia Marquis told Sky News: ""We'll be interested, of course, to hear what Steve Barclay's got to say.

""But unless we're able to have some conversation about this year's pay award, then sadly this isn't going to resolve the dispute that we currently have with the government.""

Health union bosses are meeting the health secretary today for talks on pay and conditions in a major break-through for workers after the government initially said it was for the independent pay review bodies to negotiate pay, not ministers.

The government is also meeting train and teachers' union leaders ahead of further strikes by those industries.

A deal is not expected to be agreed upon today for any of the unions, but the fact they are meeting is an important step forward.

Junior doctors - any doctor below consultant level - have started voting today on whether to carry out a ""full walkout"" in March, with a result expected by the end of February.

About 45,000 British Medical Association (BMA) members are being balloted as they call for better pay, having been excluded from an NHS pay rise this year because their contract is subject to a multi-pay deal, agreed in 2019 and ending in March, that gave them a 2% rise for 2022/2023.

The BMA said junior doctors in England have seen a real-term pay cut over the past 15 years, which amounts to a 26.1% decline in pay since 2008/9.

The union confirmed it has not been invited to today's pay talks with ministers, who it says have recommended they again get a 2% pay rise next year.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109094730/http://news.sky.com/story/downing-street-considering-one-off-payment-for-nurses-after-rejecting-idea-before-christmas-12782963;Category-1: politics

Ukraine grain ship runs aground in Suez Canal;Monday 9 January 2023 09:50, UK;[];[];"A container ship loaded with more than 65,000 tonnes of corn from Ukraine has been refloated after running aground in the Suez Canal.

The M/V Glory was 24 miles (38km) into its southward journey through the Egyptian waterway, near the city of Qantara, when it suffered a technical fault, according to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).

The breakdown was expected to only cause minor delays and regular passage through the canal was expected to resume at 11am local time after tug boats moved it to a repair area.

The ship left Chornomorsk port in southwest Ukraine on Christmas Day and was heading to China with 65,970 metric tonnes of corn, according to the Joint Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the grain exports.

The centre said the ship had been cleared to continue its journey after an inspection in Istanbul on 3 January.

In March 2021, the Suez Canal - which provides the shortest route between Europe and Asia - was blocked for six days after another ship, the Ever Given, got wedged horizontally in high winds.

The blockage backed up ships and temporarily stalled global trade in a variety of goods.

The Ever Given was held by the SCA for more than 100 days as it sought hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation from its Japanese owners.

Egyptian authorities began widening and deepening the southern part of the canal after the incident to try to prevent a repeat.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars reveals record annual sales and strong order book;Monday 9 January 2023 09:30, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has hailed a record year for sales with more than 6,000 cars sold for the first time in its 118-year history.

The UK luxury brand, owned by Germany's BMW, said it achieved a 8% rise in sales volumes during 2022 compared to the previous year with all regions, except China, seeing growth.

While the company saw ""particularly strong year-on-year growth"" in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, the USA and Europe, it said that ""ongoing headwinds"" across Greater China, including Hong Kong, meant that volumes declined slightly.

The value of bespoke commissions also reached record levels in 2022.

The company, which employs 2,500 staff, said clients were ""willing to pay around half a million euros (£440,000) for their unique Rolls-Royce motor car"".

The COVID-linked disruption hit the wider sector hard in 2022.

He said: ""Not only did we reveal Rolls-Royce Spectre, our marque's first ever fully-electric series model to the world, it was also the first year we ever delivered more than 6,000 cars in a single 12-month period, with strong demand across our entire product portfolio.

""But as a true house of luxury, sales are not our sole measure of success: we are not and never will be a volume manufacturer.

NHS strikes to go ahead after meeting with health secretary Steve Barclay with unions breaks down;Monday 9 January 2023 12:41, UK;[];[];"Strikes by NHS staff will go ahead this month after a meeting between union bosses and the health secretary broke down.

Steve Barclay failed to avert further walkouts by ambulance workers and auxiliary NHS staff during a short meeting on Monday.

Former chancellor Javid in talks to join investment firm Centricus;Monday 9 January 2023 12:38, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Sajid Javid, the former chancellor of the exchequer, is in talks about a role with an investment firm with close links to SoftBank, the giant Japanese conglomerate.

Sky News has learnt that Mr Javid, who recently announced that he would not stand for re-election in his Bromsgrove seat, has held preliminary talks with Centricus, a London-based group which manages more than $40bn in assets.

Sources said the talks between Mr Javid and Centricus were not certain to result in a job.

If he does join the firm, the former cabinet minister would be reunited with a number of former colleagues from Deutsche Bank, where he worked for nearly a decade.

Mr Javid left the German investment banking powerhouse in July 2009 ""to give something back through public service"", according to his LinkedIn profile.

He held several senior ministerial roles, including at the Department of Health, as business secretary, and at the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government.

His eight-month stint as chancellor ended in February 2020.

Later that year, he became an adviser to a number of companies, including the Wall Street investment bank JP Morgan.

It was unclear on Monday what his precise role might be at Centricus if he did join the firm.

Founded in 2016, Centricus is focused on investments in sectors including financial services, infrastructure and consumer, media, entertainment and sports.

It helped to structure the fundraising for the vast SoftBank Vision Fund and led a $50m investment into Tamara Mellon's eponymous luxury shoe brand.

Last year, it submitted an unsuccessful bid to buy Chelsea Football Club.

Centricus's senior team includes Garth Ritchie and Nizar Al-Bassam, both of whom held executive posts at Deutsche Bank.

A spokesperson for Mr Javid said: ""Sajid of course continues to have strong relationships in business, finance and other sectors, but he has not yet considered any roles with any organisations.

""His recent decision to stand down means that he can start to explore, over the next two years, what the next phase of his career will involve.""

The same spokesperson issued a statement to Sky News on 25 November insisting that Mr Javid had ""sent confirmation to Conservative Party HQ that he intends to stand again at the next general election"", in response to questions about his parliamentary future.

A week later, the former chancellor announced publicly that he would step down as an MP.

Centricus declined to comment on its discussions with Mr Javid.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109130456/http://news.sky.com/story/former-chancellor-javid-in-talks-to-join-investment-firm-centricus-12783066;Category-2: business and economy

Orbital rocket blasts into space after historic launch from UK soil;Monday 9 January 2023 23:18, UK;[];[];"An orbital rocket carrying nine satellites has been blasted into space after a historic launch from UK soil.

LauncherOne, carrying nine satellites for deployment in Earth's lower orbit, shot off towards the stars from around 35,000ft above the Atlantic, having been carried skyward by a converted jumbo jet dubbed Cosmic Girl.

Nestled under its left wing was the 21 metre-long LauncherOne, tasked with transporting the satellites - several of which were made in Britain - into space at speeds of up to 17,500mph.

It was released from the aircraft just over an hour after take-off from Newquay, with the rocket's path taking it to the other side of the world, ready to release the satellites about an hour later.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109234702/http://news.sky.com/story/orbital-rocket-blasts-into-space-after-historic-launch-from-uk-soil-12783418;Category-6: science and technology

UK's historic space launch - live updates

The former Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 took off from Spaceport Cornwall, at the site of Newquay Airport, at just gone 10pm on Monday night, sparking wild cheers and applause from the 2,000 members of the public who were lucky enough to snag tickets.

Sky News's science correspondent Thomas Moore said that although the rocket did seem to reach space successfully, ""it does seem that at the last moment, the actual deployment of the satellites hasn't worked"".

Cosmic Girl has since successfully landed back here at Spaceport Cornwall.

It set off from Newquay shortly after 10pm, and reached the drop point for LauncherOne - the 21 metre-long rocket that was nestled under its left wing - just before 11.15pm.

The plane touched down back on the southwest coast of England less than two hours after its departure.

LauncherOne was due to reach the other side of the world, ready to release the satellites another hour or so later.

Despite news of LauncherOne running into problems, Cosmic Girl was greeted by raucous applause from the hundreds of members of the public watching at the spaceport.

What kind of satellites were being deployed?

Unlike the large satellites taken into space by vertical rocket launches, like those carried out by NASA and SpaceX, Virgin Orbit - the operator of Monday's Start Me Up mission - was dealing with far smaller hardware.

Only about the size of a cereal box, the newly-launched satellites were set to perform a range of tasks in space, such as maritime research and detecting illegal fishing and piracy, as well as national security.

They are also used for climate change observation.

Virgin Orbit shares set to crash after failure of first UK space launch;Tuesday 10 January 2023 12:02, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Shares in Virgin Orbit, the company behind the failed first UK space launch, are on course to fall by more than a fifth at the market open in the US.

The eagerly anticipated mission on Monday night, which planned to place nine satellites in orbit via the company's LauncherOne rocket, was scuppered when a secondary engine failed to fire properly.

It marked a huge disappointment after the first space mission launch from Spaceport Cornwall.

Relive the space mission as it happened

It used a converted jumbo jet named Cosmic Girl to deploy the rocket.

The company, which is majority-owned by Sir Richard Branson's investment vehicle, said an ""anomoly"" was to blame for the problem and is was investigating the cause.

The mission was to be Virgin Orbit's first outside of the United States.

The two-stage rocket has suffered technical problems before but they are understood to have been limited to the primary engine.

Virgin Orbit - spun out of Virgin Galactic - went public in 2021 via a so-called SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) merger.

It was valued at $3.7bn ahead of the market debut but its market capitalisation had tumbled to $6540m ahead of Tuesday's trading session.

The failed launch was seen as spooking investors further and the shares were a further 23% down in premarket deals.

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the reaction: ""There had been high hopes that the operation would be the start of a brighter future for Virgin following the troubles which have beset the company since it became a publicly traded company, following the SPAC merger with Next Gen Acquisition in 2021.""

""The cash burn rate for the company has been huge, and the prospects for revenue have been significantly set back.

""While space may have been heralded as the new investment frontier, the ventures clearly come with a huge amount of risk.

Who is JR Moehringer: The ghostwriter for Prince Harry's memoir Spare?;Tuesday 10 January 2023 12:24, UK;[];[];"The Duke of Sussex's much-talked out autobiography has now been officially released, leaving readers able to pore over every word.

Many fans gathered around midnight hoping to purchase Prince Harry's memoir Spare, with queues seen across London bookstores.

The bombshell book reveals intimate details of Harry's life and upbringing and discusses his thoughts on war, love, the Royal Family and the loss of his mother, Diana.

But with many of the passages only adding to the controversy surrounding the Prince and his wife Meghan, some are wondering about the person who actually wrote it - widely reported to be the author and journalist JR Moehringer.

Who is Moehringer?

The writer first began his Journalism career as a news assistant at the New York Times. In 1994, the author then made his move to the Los Angeles Times and in 1997 became an on-the-scene reporter.

In 2000, Moehringer received the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing for his article Crossing Over, about the lives of the descendants of slaves in the US Deep South.

Moehringer's writing continued to flourish as he released his own coming-of-age memoir in 2005, called The Tender Bar.

The book was turned into a movie, directed by George Clooney and starring Ben Affleck as his influential uncle Charlie and Tye Sheridan as Moehringer, released in 2021.

The Tender Bar explored the author's childhood, as he was raised by a single mother and sought out a father figure in his life.

His actual father, a Rock & Roll DJ in the early days of FM radio, had abandoned the family.

Touching upon this in an interview with NPR, Moehringer was asked what it meant to listen to his ""absent"" father on the radio.

He replied: ""It was surreal because, as I say, his voice was spectacular. He just had these beautiful pipes. I might not have been so inclined to romanticise him if he hadn't sounded the way he sounded.

""But it was so frustrating to be a little kid. I didn't have a relationship with him.""

Another piece of work he did, an article for the Lost Angeles Times Magazine based on a homeless man who claimed he was ex-heavyweight boxer Bob Satterfield, was also adapted into a film called Resurrecting the Champ, starring Samuel L Jackson, Josh Hartnett and Alan Alda.

After the success of The Tender Bar, Moehringer went on to ghostwrite tennis player Andre Agassi's memoir in 2009 called Open: An Autobiography.

In 2012, Moehringer then released his novel Sutton, based on the life of a bank robber.

The writer's successes later saw him collaborate with Nike co-founder Phil Knight on his autobiography, published in 2016.

What is Moehringer's process for Ghostwriting?

In a 2012 interview with NPR, the novelist discussed the differences between writing for others and for himself.

He added that when writing Agassi's biography they ""did a lot of things together. And the first thing that we did was we started a long really wonderful conversation about his life. It worked like therapy. I sat in a straight back chair and Andre sat on a couch and I had a pad in my lap and he really, he dug deep, and together we found patterns and themes in his life.""

""You try and inhabit their skin, and even though you're thinking third person, you're writing first person, so the processes are mirror images of each other, but they seem very simpatico,"" he told NPR about his process for Agassi's Open.

What is Ghostwriting?

Ghostwriting is when one person writes in the name of another person, group or company without receiving a byline or public credit.

There are various ways in which ghostwriters work with their clients, but often it involves conducting lengthy interviews and then writing up the subject's words into fluent prose. In most cases, the person whose autobiography it is will retain full control of what is included.

How much did Moehringer make?

In return for his services he received $1m (£820,000) to ghostwrite the book, according to Page Six in 2021.

The Duke of Sussex

Spare is now available to buy, with those first in the queue saying things like they ""want to hear from the horse's mouth"" and that Harry is ""incredibly courageous and brave"" to share his story with the world.

In the book, Harry reveals many private moments and also admits to taking cocaine, smoking cannabis and trying magic mushrooms.

He writes of his experiences as a teenager: ""Of course I had been taking cocaine at that time. At someone's house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more.

""It wasn't very fun, and it didn't make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different.""

It is predicted that the memoir will dominate best-seller lists, through presales alone, and has now been listed number 15 on Amazon's Hot New Releases In Books.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230110123256/http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-jr-moehringer-the-ghostwriter-for-prince-harrys-memoir-spare-12783496;Category-5: entertainment and culture
Police searching for missing couple with newborn say baby's welfare is 'overriding concern';Tuesday 10 January 2023 12:42, UK;[];[];"Police searching for a missing couple and their newborn child have said they ""do not wish to interrupt their family life"" and the baby's welfare is their ""overriding concern"".

Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, along with their child, have been sought by officers since their vehicle broke down on the M61 near Bolton on Thursday.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) previously said evidence suggested Ms Marten had ""very recently given birth and neither her or the baby have been assessed by medical professionals"".

As they issued a fresh appeal following sightings of the mother in the county, Essex Police insisted their efforts were focused on the infant's wellbeing.

""Clearly, the overriding concern that we share with our colleagues at Greater Manchester Police is for Mark and Constance's newborn child,"" the force's Detective Chief Inspector Rob Huddleston said.

""We do not wish to interrupt their family life; this search is primarily to ensure the welfare of the couple's child.

""We are carrying out a number of enquires in and around Colchester in order to locate them. We're also liaising with colleagues at British Transport Police around potential onward travel from Colchester.

""I would ask the people of Colchester, and indeed wider north Essex, to please familiarise yourself with Mark and Constance's faces and report any sightings to us immediately.""

A CCTV image released earlier was thought to show Ms Marten in a red shawl near Harwich Port in Essex at 9am on Saturday.

Police say Ms Marten was later seen in Colchester, Essex, about an hour later - the last sighting of her.

After their vehicle broke down, the family left the motorway and walked towards Anchor Lane bridge, which links the Highfield and Little Hulton areas.

Mr Gordon is described as wearing dark clothing while Ms Marten, who has a southern accent, was wearing a burgundy coat.

Chaos broke out in supermarkets last month following the release of the Prime sports drinks, which some people are thought to have bought in bulk due to high demand and are now selling at much higher prices.

The drink is created and marketed by Prime Hydration, a company founded by KSI, real name is JJ Olatunji, and fellow YouTuber Logan Paul.

The YouTuber's video now has more than six million views, with many people also sharing their frustrations in the comments.

""As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of enquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.

""However, it does highlight the excellent capability we and our partners have in place to monitor our ports and borders in order to keep the public safe from any potential threats to their safety and security that might be coming into the UK.""

The material has been identified as being contaminated with uranium, the force said, and no arrests have been made.

It added that officers are working with partner agencies to investigate and ensure there is no risk to the public.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on live investigations.""

Welcome To Chippendales: The grim true story of murder for hire behind the rise of the male-stripping cultural phenomenon;Wednesday 11 January 2023 08:06, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];[];"In 1979, a former caretaker who had moved from Bombay to Los Angeles in pursuit of the American dream became the unlikely founder of a male stripping empire.

The Chippendales were born. But while the shows were risqué - oiled-up men gyrating on stage for an audience of women clamouring to tuck dollar bills into G-strings, the first time male striptease had really been brought into the mainstream - as the dance troupe became a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s, the true story of what was happening behind the scenes turned out to be even more eye-opening.

Founder Somen ""Steve"" Banerjee's story of determination and entrepreneurship turned into a tale of bitter rivalry and greed, culminating in arson, hired hitmen, and murder. ""Anybody or anything that got in Banerjee's way, he would hire somebody to kill or burn the competitor,"" is how an LA FBI agent put it, quoted in an indictment when charges were filed in the 1990s.

The story is now being dramatised in Welcome To Chippendales, created by Robert Siegel (The Wrestler, Pam & Tommy) and starring Kumail Nanjiani alongside Juliette Lewis, Murray Bartlett, Zack Palmisano, Colin Seifert and Annaleigh Ashford.

""It's just an incredible true crime story,"" Siegel tells Sky News. ""Crime mixed with sex and drugs and male stripping. It's a crazy, fun world. But then there's a lot of real substance. It was an opportunity to explore all these big issues of racism and capitalism and what it means to be an outsider, and the American dream, immigration...

""And the protagonist... just to have this Indian immigrant, conservative, very buttoned up, nerdy guy, dropped in the middle of this wild world of Los Angeles and cocaine and stripping.

""He followed the classic immigrant journey of: go to America, work hard, apply your entrepreneurial skills and build a business and make something of yourself. He was doing exactly what is thought of as the classic immigrant success story, but he was applying it to this thing that was so blasphemous and so shocking.""

Banerjee moved to the US in the 1960s, operating a petrol station before buying the Destiny II club in 1975. Full of ideas to make his bar stand out, the venue reportedly hosted female mud wrestling and exotic dancing before the idea of male striptease - ""for ladies only"" - was born.

The Chippendales became a phenomenon, the dancers instantly known for their uniform of bow-tie, collar and cuffs - a reversal of the iconic Playboy trademark given the go-ahead following a deal with Hugh Hefner.

'Disneyland for women'

""The club began drawing overflow crowds of women, who for a $20 admission could ogle and kiss sweaty, tanned, well-muscled young men in G-strings,"" according to a Los Angeles Times archive report.

By 1981, the Chippendales had their own ""man of the month"" calendar. In an interview with the LA Times, Banerjee described the experience as ""Disneyland for women"". More clubs opened in New York, Dallas and Denver.

But the success of the Chippendales led to imitations. As reported in the LA Times, ""Banerjee's concern about those competitors led to three arson attempts"", according to a government sentencing memorandum; two attempts led to minor damage at two competitor bars, while plans for a third were abandoned.

Trouble was also brewing between Banerjee and TV director and choreographer Nick De Noia, who helped transform the show into the huge stage production it became. In 1983, De Noia wrote on a napkin that he had the right to take the Chippendales on the road and own the show in perpetuity; Banerjee reportedly signed it, not understanding the full nature of what that meant.

Amid all this came financial trouble, with a racial discrimination lawsuit filed in 1983, and an error during the 1987 calendar print run leading to February having 31 days - costing the company about $300,000 (about £247,000 today).

Murder-for-hire, solicitation to commit murder, and arson charges

Image: Pic: Disney+

In 1987, De Noia was shot in the face while sitting at his office desk in Manhattan, New York. It was several years before Banerjee was formally implicated for his involvement - but by the time he was charged with murder for hire in 1993, he was also charged with plotting to kill two Chippendales dancers and a producer who had reportedly defected to rival groups.

Candace Mayeron, who worked on the show and the touring production with De Noia after he parted ways with Banerjee, says there was not a ""scintilla of doubt"" in her mind as to who was behind the murder.

""Steve and Nick had come to loggerheads,"" she told Elle magazine in 2021. ""Nick was a silver-tongued New Yorker, who was constantly going on TV to talk about Chippendales. He started being referred to as 'Mr Chippendales'. I think that helped fuel the anger that Steve had toward Nick. Their verbal fights became vicious. I was with Nick for such a long time, and I never knew him to have other enemies. It wasn't that hard to connect the dots.""

Banerjee's charges came under the US federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) through a pattern of racketeering activity that included murder for hire, solicitation to commit murder and arson, according to official reports.

In the hours before his sentencing in 1994, Banerjee was found dead in his prison cell, having taken his own life.

Siegel researched the case from news reports and court documents from the time, as well as books and podcasts looking back at what happened.

""There are very few interviews with Steve,"" he says. ""I mean, almost none. So we kind of had to piece what little we had [about his life] together... there's court documents and articles about the crimes, the arsons... the club's financial troubles.

""There were articles about the racial discrimination lawsuit, where the club was discriminating against black patrons. Steve equated whiteness with class and he didn't want black people in the club.""

Siegel says he was most shocked finding out about what happened with the 1987 calendar, and how it became the catalyst for Banerjee's downfall.

""It's this total debacle that, that kind of causes the financial ruin of the company and causes [Banerjee] to kind of lose his s***. It's sort of the final nail in the coffin for him. Later I found out he came from a printing family.

""That's such a gift from the writing gods... he left India, turned his back on the family business and he came to America. And ultimately, the thing that was his undoing was a printing error.""

Sainsbury's achieves 'record' Christmas as cost of living crisis rages;Wednesday 11 January 2023 08:25, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Sainsbury's has become the latest retailer to post strong Christmas sales figures, saying it achieved a ""record"" festive season.

The UK's second largest supermarket group, which also includes Argos, said it now expected annual profits for the year to March towards the upper end of its previously guided range between £630m and £690m.

Underlying pre-tax profits, for its 2021-22 financial year, came in at £730m.

The downwards shift reflects investment across the grocery sector in staff pay and price as budgets are squeezed by the energy-led cost of living crisis.

T​​​​​otal sales, excluding fuel, grew by 5.2% over the 16 weeks to 7 January compared with the same period last year.

That was driven by inflation, the chain said, with ""relatively resilient volume trends"".

Sainsbury's said early Christmas shopping helped sales jump over the latest quarter as shoppers looked to spread the cost of the festive season.

Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""We delivered the best possible Christmas for customers as millions of households managed their budgets differently, hosting larger gatherings again and treating themselves at home.

""Customers shopped early, buying Christmas treats and fizz more than once and looked for deals, taking advantage of Black Friday and other seasonal offers.

""Argos offered great value and quality, and, as train and postal strikes disrupted the country, customers appreciated its reliability and convenience.

""Sales were also boosted by the World Cup as people celebrated more at home.""

Resilience in the face of the cost of living crisis has been a theme of the post-Christmas retail reporting season so far.

Market leader Tesco releases its update on Thursday.

Among other major retail names updating the market on Wednesday was JD Sports Fashion.

It reported total revenue growth of over 20% in the six-week Christmas shopping period to the end of December.

The company raised its full year profit forecast as a result, saying that it now expected profit before tax and exceptional items to come in above £1bn.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230111091916/http://news.sky.com/story/sainsburys-achieves-record-christmas-as-cost-of-living-crisis-rages-12784090;Category-2: business and economy

Johnny Vegas says his ADHD diagnosis 'answers a lot of questions';Wednesday 11 January 2023 15:02, UK;[];[];"Johnny Vegas has said his recent ADHD diagnosis ""answers a lot of questions"" about past behaviours.

The 52-year-old comedian said he had discovered he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after a suggestion from presenter Sue Perkins, who shares the same agent.

Adults with ADHD are said to often find it difficult to cope with stress, feel restless and impatient, or have trouble focusing on tasks.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the St Helens-born actor said: ""A lot of things make sense.

""It's that sense of disorganisation and doing basic tasks. Everybody has an element of it - it's how strong your filter is, I think.

""When you don't have a filter at all, very simple things become very time-consuming. It's like, I'll shift that cup, and then you have 10 other ideas, and you haven't shifted that cup, and then three weeks later that cup's still there and somebody's like, why haven't you shifted that, and it's become this monumental task, and it's built up.

""It's just, I suppose, how your brain organises itself. I always knew I was disorganised... but it [the diagnosis] helps make sense of a lot of things at school. I'm just on the verge of learning about it.""

Vegas added the condition ""made me who I am"" and ""that chaos helped me be a better stand-up"".

""In some respects you can go back and look at it with regret, but I've had a bit of a charmed life, so it's no regrets,"" he said.

""I know now, and it helps you make changes, I suppose, as you want to get more responsible later in life. I don't see it as defining me.""

Tony Lloyd, the chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said one in 20 people had ADHD, but that it was ""significantly under-identified and under-diagnosed in the UK"".

""There are many adults out there who have struggled for years with lots of different sort of characteristics of ADHD, but didn't think they had ADHD because they didn't identify with that enculturated belief that we were all given in school,"" he said.

""So there are a lot of adults who, now that ADHD is much better understood, are beginning to realise that maybe a lot of the reasons that they've struggled were in fact ADHD.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230111151722/http://news.sky.com/story/johnny-vegas-says-his-adhd-diagnosis-answers-a-lot-of-questions-12784356;Category-7: health

Uranium shipped to UK on passenger jet originated from Pakistan;Wednesday 11 January 2023 15:46, UK;[];[];"Counter-terror police are investigating how a small amount of uranium was shipped to the UK on a passenger flight.

The radioactive material was detected in a package at Heathrow Airport following a routine screening on 29 December.

It arrived on a flight from Oman after originating in Pakistan, say Sky sources.

It was found in a shipment of scrap metal, the BBC reported.

Counter-terror commander Richard Smith said the amount of contaminated material ""was extremely small"" and has been assessed by experts as posing no threat to the public.

He added: ""Although our investigation remains ongoing, from our enquiries so far, it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat.

""As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of enquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.

""However, it does highlight the excellent capability we and our partners have in place to monitor our ports and borders in order to keep the public safe from any potential threats to their safety and security that might be coming into the UK.""

The material has been identified as being contaminated with uranium, the force said, and no arrests have been made.

Former head of the British Army's chemical weapons unit, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, told Sky News that it was ""a concern"" that the material has apparently reached the UK, having come all the way from Pakistan, but that he did not think the public should be overly worried.

He added: ""I think it's excellent that the police and others have interdicted this and made it safe, but we must be on our guard because there are bad people out there who want to do us harm in this particular manner.""

Speculating about the intent, he said that ""we must be open to the fact this might be some sort of terror type thing"".

Mr Bretton-Gordon said while there is no indication that a group such as Al Qaeda were behind the incident, he argued it ""has their trademark and fingerprints on it"".

Whatever the origin, he said the material ""absolutely shouldn't be on a commercial airliner"".

However, defence and security analyst professor Michael Clarke told Sky News he believed it was unlikely to be terror-related.

He said: ""It is almost certainly an accident.

""If that was terrorists trying to bring that in, they would be bringing it into the one place in the UK that is bound to catch it.

""Heathrow is the one place where Uranium will always be detected - so that almost rules it out.

""The point about Uranium is that the Heathrow scanners would immietedly pick up any toxic Uranium.""

Uranium is a metal that exists naturally in the earth, but is harmful to humans because it is radioactive.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay told Sky News that he hoped for more information in ""due course"" about the material seized at Heathrow.

Man arrested on suspicion of murdering Elle Edwards in pub on Christmas Eve;Wednesday 11 January 2023 16:48, UK;[];[];"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering Elle Edwards on Christmas Eve.

Merseyside police said a 22-year-old man from the Wirral had been taken into custody and that a 23-year-old woman had also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Three people have already been arrested in connection with the murder, which took place in the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral shortly before midnight on 24 December.

A 31-year-old man from Tranmere, Wirral, and a 19-year-old woman from Rock Ferry, Wirral, were held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and bailed pending further inquiries, while a 30-year-old man from Tranmere, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, was recalled to prison on licence.

Ms Edwards, a 26-year-old beautician, was pronounced dead in hospital following the shooting.

Computer system glitch causes chaos after all flights grounded across US;Wednesday 11 January 2023 15:51, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"All flights across the US were grounded due to a glitch with the Federal Aviation Administration's computer system this morning.

All outbound flights were grounded until around 9am Eastern Time (2pm GMT) as the Federal Aviation Administration worked to restore its Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system, which alerts pilots of potential hazards along a flight route.

As of 3pm GMT 4,948 flights within, into or out of the US have been delayed, according to flight tracker FlightAware.com, while 868 have been cancelled. Most delays were concentrated along the East Coast.

""Normal air traffic operations are resuming gradually across the US following an overnight outage to the Notice to Air Missions system that provides safety info to flight crews,"" the FAA said.

""The ground stop has been lifted. We continue to look into the cause of the initial problem.""

Earlier it said ""final validation checks"" were being carried out and the system reloaded after ""operations across the National Airspace System"" were affected.

'Almighty mess' for US aviation industry

Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who was at Ronald Reagan Airport in Virginia, said: ""Well an almighty mess for the aviation industry in the United States.

""As of this morning we were told that the NOTAM system had failed, which is part of the air traffic control system. This is critical for flights to be able to take off safely. So as a consequence the busiest airspace in the world, the airspace over the United States, didn't open as it should have done this morning.

""Looking at the flight tracker websites it was very clear you could see flights clustered around many cities around the United States and none of them taking off. Chaos for passengers, as you might imagine.""

No evidence of cyberattack

US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the outage, his press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.

She said there was no evidence a cyberattack was behind the glitch, ""but the president directed [the US Department of Transport] to conduct a full investigation into the causes"".

Mr Biden told reporters earlier: ""Aircraft can still land safely, just not take off right now. They don't know what the cause of it is, they expect in a couple of hours they'll have a good sense of what caused it and will respond at that time.""

The president added that he had spoken to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the phone, and told him ""to report directly to me when they find out"".

Several people tweeted to say they had been stranded due to the outage, with one passenger at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport saying no flights were flying to the US.

Key questions remain after uranium discovered at Heathrow Airport;Wednesday 11 January 2023 19:52, UK;['dominic waghorn', '@dominicwaghorn'];[];"A major multi-pronged investigation will be under way following the discovery at Heathrow Airport of uranium in a package sent from Pakistan.

Authorities will be pleased their systems have worked and the material was detected but need answers to key questions and quickly, in case more packages are on the way.

There is no innocent explanation for putting uranium in the post, unlike other lower-level radioactive materials used in scientific and other devices.

It is used only for nuclear power and nuclear weapons so; it is fair to assume it was sent for sinister reasons.

Its reported trail of travel is not encouraging either.

""Where it comes from, who it appears to be going to and what it is. All that seems nefarious to me,"" Hamish de Bretton Gordon, former head of the British Army's chemical weapons unit, told Sky News.

The package originated in Pakistan, according to sources quoted in news reports, a country with nuclear weapons and shadowy links between extremist organisations and elements within its security agencies.

It was destined, we are told, for Iranians in the UK although, so far, no arrests have been made. If those reports are true, they will be deeply worrying to security agencies.

Iranians have been implicated most recently in alleged plots to assassinate targets in the UK, including journalists and dissidents.

The identity of the intended recipients of this package will be crucial to this investigation and establishing motives.

It may sound alarmist, but one of the most likely intended uses for the uranium may well be to build a dirty bomb.

Uranium shipped to UK on passenger jet originated from Pakistan

The amounts of uranium involved are too small to make a nuclear device. That would take kilos of the stuff.

A dirty bomb is a conventional explosive device that releases and scatters radioactive material over a wide area.

Packing uranium into a bomb and detonating it in an area packed with people would cause panic and terror. Its main impact would be psychological, sowing worry and alarm over a wide radius.

This is likely to be the most serious radiological incident since the use of polonium to poison Russian, Alexander Litvinenko in 2006.

The assassins' success in smuggling such a dangerous radioactive agent past border control led to an overhaul of controls. This development highlights the success of those changes.

Authorities will be on high alert for the possibility of more such breaches and seeking answers from both Pakistan and Oman to explain their failure in detecting the uranium as it passed through their borders.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230111195622/https://news.sky.com/story/key-questions-remain-after-uranium-discovered-at-heathrow-airport-12784562;Category-3: environment
Tatjana Patitz: 90s supermodel who appeared in George Michael's Freedom video dies aged 56;Wednesday 11 January 2023 21:49, UK;[];[];"Model Tatjana Patitz, who rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s and starred in George Michael's Freedom! '90 music video, has died aged 56.

Patitz's New York modelling agency confirmed on Wednesday that she had died in California.

Her agent Corinne Nicolas said the cause of death was illness but did not give further details.

Born in Hamburg, Germany, Patitz rose to prominence as a high-fashion model in the 1980s and 1990s.

She was part of an elite handful of ""original supermodels"" and starred in the music video for Michael's 1990s hit, alongside fellow models Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell.

She also featured in several other music videos, including the video for Duran Duran's Skin Trade and Nick Kamen's music video for Tell Me.

Cindy Crawford, who appeared in Michael's video alongside Patitz posted a picture of the two of them on Instagram, writing that she was ""so sad"" to hear of the passing of her friend.

""We were babies together in the fashion industry and I feel like we grew up together,"" she wrote.

""I found her soft-spoken, sensitive, kind, inquisitive and, who could ever forget those piercing eyes. Her love of animals and nature was infectious. Sending my condolences to her family - especially the son she adored. RIP.""

Chief operating officer of Conde Nast and global editorial director of Vogue, Anna Wintour, has remembered Patitz as the ""European symbol of chic, like Romy Schneider-meets-Monica Vitti"".

She told Vogue.com Patitz was ""far less visible than her peers, more mysterious, more grown-up, more unattainable, and that had its own appeal"".

In a 2006 interview, Patitz opined that the golden age of supermodels was over.

""There was a real era, and the reason that happened was because glamour was brought into it,"" she was quoted as saying in Prestige Hong Kong magazine.

""Now the celebrities and actresses have taken over, and the models are in the backseat completely.""

She also noted that models from her era had healthier physiques.

""Women were healthy, not these scrawny little models that nobody knows their names anymore,"" Patitz said.

During her career, she worked with a number of high-profile fashion photographers including Peter Lindbergh, whose 1990 British Vogue cover included the biggest models at the time, including Patitz.

Birth of world's rarest chimpanzee at Chester Zoo gives 'hope' to critically endangered species;Thursday 12 January 2023 05:45, UK;[];[];"Conservationists are celebrating the birth of the world's rarest chimpanzee at Chester Zoo, saying it gives ""hope"" to the critically endangered species.

New mum ZeeZee, a critically endangered western chimpanzee, safely delivered the ""precious"" baby boy following an eight-month pregnancy.

The new male is in good health and has spent the first few weeks of life bonding with his mother and the rest of the 22-strong troop, according to the zoo.

He will be named after a rockstar or famous pop icon to help boost the profile of the highly threatened species, in what is a longstanding tradition among conservationists.

Around 18,000 western chimpanzees now remain across Africa, and it is the first subspecies of chimpanzees to ever be declared critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The new baby boy's birth gives further ""hope"" to efforts to ensure the long-term survival of the species, primatologists say.

Image: Pic: Chester Zoo

Andrew Lenihan, team manager at Chester Zoo, said he and his colleagues are ""incredibly proud to see a precious new baby in the chimpanzee troop"".

He said a birth always creates ""a lot of excitement in the group"", as raising a youngster soon becomes a ""real extended family affair"".

""You'll often see the new baby being passed between other females who want to lend a helping hand and give ZeeZee some well-deserved rest, and that's exactly what her daughter, Stevie, is doing with her new brother. It looks as though she's taken a real shine to him, which is great to see,"" he said.

He added that ZeeZee's new baby is a ""small but vital boost to the global population of western chimpanzees, at a time when it's most needed for this critically endangered species"".

The apes are under significant threat in the wild as a result of hunting for the illegal bush meat trade, diseases spread by humans and extensive habitat loss and forest destruction across West Africa.

Mike Jordan, Animal and Plant Director at the zoo, added: ""In the last 25 years alone the world has lost 80% of its western chimpanzee population, so the arrival of a healthy baby here at Chester offers us real hope that we can help turn things around for this species.""

Small populations of the western chimpanzee can still be found in the likes of Senegal and Ghana in West Africa - but have become extinct in Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230112054741/http://news.sky.com/story/birth-of-worlds-rarest-chimpanzee-at-chester-zoo-gives-hope-to-critically-endangered-species-12784722;Category-3: environment

Corrupted file to blame for computer glitch which grounded every US flight;Thursday 12 January 2023 10:22, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A corrupted file has been blamed for a glitch on the Federal Aviation Administration's computer system which saw every flight grounded across the US.

All outbound flights were grounded until around 9am Eastern Time (2pm GMT) on Wednesday as the FAA worked to restore its Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system, which alerts pilots of potential hazards along a flight route.

As of 3pm GMT yesterday 4,948 flights within, into or out of the US had been delayed, according to flight tracker FlightAware.com, while 868 had been cancelled. Most delays were concentrated along the East Coast.

Normal air traffic operations resumed gradually across the US following the outage to the NOTAM system that provides safety information to flight crews.

A corrupted file affected both the primary and the backup systems, a senior government official told NBC News on Wednesday night, adding that officials continue to investigate.

""We are continuing a thorough review to determine the root cause of the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system outagem"" the FAA said in an update yesterday.

""Our preliminary work has traced the outage to a damaged database file. At this time, there is no evidence of a cyberattack.""

It added work was ongoing to ""further pinpoint the causes of this issue"" and take ""all needed steps to prevent this kind of disruption from happening again"".

Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who was at Ronald Reagan Airport in Virginia, said at the time of the outage: ""Well an almighty mess for the aviation industry in the United States.

""We were told that the NOTAM system had failed, which is part of the air traffic control system. This is critical for flights to be able to take off safely. So as a consequence the busiest airspace in the world, the airspace over the United States, didn't open as it should have done.

""Looking at the flight tracker websites it was very clear you could see flights clustered around many cities around the United States and none of them taking off. Chaos for passengers, as you might imagine.""

No evidence of cyberattack

US President Joe Biden was briefed on the outage, his press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.

She said there was no evidence a cyberattack was behind the glitch, ""but the president directed [the US Department of Transport] to conduct a full investigation into the causes"".

Mr Biden told reporters during the outage yesterday: ""They don't know what the cause of it is, they expect in a couple of hours they'll have a good sense of what caused it and will respond at that time.""

The president added that he had spoken to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the phone, and told him ""to report directly to me when they find out"".

Several people tweeted to say they had been stranded due to the outage, with one passenger at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport saying no flights were flying to the US.

Energy price surge prompts big earnings upgrade for British Gas owner Centrica;Thursday 12 January 2023 10:07, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has raised its earnings forecast for 2022 on the back of soaring energy prices.

Shares surged to levels not seen since May 2019 following the company's update.

Centrica credited its electricity generation and gas production activities for the upgrade - as opposed to profitability at its household supply arm.

The company said it now expected full year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) above 30p.

EPS - a measure of profitability calculated through the number of shares in circulation - had previously stood at the upper end of a 15.1p to 26p guided range following several upgrades.

Because Centrica had reported EPS of 4.1p for 2021, the new forecast meant earnings were now expected to rise at least sevenfold on an annual basis.

Shares, which gained 53% during 2022, spiked by almost 7%.

The company, and rivals, all suffered tens of billions in losses when the COVID pandemic struck - leaving raw energy prices at lows not seen in modern times.

But as economies slowly got back in gear, and with demand outstripping supply, prices recovered.

Wholesale gas costs later hit record levels and were kept high as supplies were squeezed amid Russia's war in Ukraine and the subsequent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its invasion.

The record profits enjoyed by big oil and the like placed a target on their backs.

Countries, including the UK, have imposed windfall taxes in a bid to offset some of the pain being inflicted on households and businesses from record bills.

Centrica is the subject of a 45% levy on electricity generators which began on 1 January.

It was announced by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in November as the government came under intense pressure from opposition parties and climate campaigners.

GMB union to consider up to six more ambulance strike dates after failed talks with health secretary;Thursday 12 January 2023 11:51, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];[];"The GMB union will meet ambulance representatives on Monday to discuss up to six more strike dates, Sky News understands.

It comes after talks with Health Secretary Stephen Barclay failed to reach an agreement earlier this week.

Yesterday, about 25,000 ambulance workers across England and Wales went on strike in a dispute with the government over pay.

Staggered walkouts by paramedics, call handlers, drivers and technicians from the Unison and GMB unions took place over a 24-hour period.

Union leader brands talks with minister a 'complete farce' - politics latest

NHS England warned that some people would have to make their own way to hospital.

While members of the armed forces and private providers were once again drafted in to help cover services, as was the case during the first strike day on 21 December.

Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has warned that strike action can lead to ""pent-up demand"" in the days after walkouts.

More strikes are scheduled, with nurses due to walk out next Wednesday and Thursday, and another ambulance strike the week after, on 23 January.

Despite no deal being reached following the talks with Mr Barclay on Monday, the health secretary did agree to look into a suggestion to backdate next year's NHS pay deal to this January.

But it is understood representatives of the GMB union are set to meet again next week to discuss whether industrial action should escalate.

It comes as new NHS figures show ambulances in England took an average of one hour, 32 minutes and 54 seconds in December to respond to emergency calls such as burns, epilepsy and strokes - the longest on record and well above the target of 18 minutes.

Strikes 'in protest at unsafe care'

The figures for England also showed a record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E; departments last month from a decision to admit to actually being admitted.

And the proportion of patients seen within four hours in England's A&Es; fell to a record low of 65% in December.

Responding to the latest NHS England performance data, RCN Director for England, Patricia Marquis, said: ""Today's figures suggest this picture is only going to get worse. Hospitals are full, many patients face very long waits to be admitted from A&E; and the waiting list for routine treatment remains sky high.

""The government has had months and months to address this but has not acted. They must row back on years of underinvestment in nursing, starting with an immediate pay rise.

""Nursing is saying enough is enough and standing up for their patients. Next week's strikes are in protest at unsafe care.""

Talks 'collaborative', not 'confrontational'

Mr Barclay held further talks this morning with medical unions which were described as ""constructive"" by the chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA).

Ahead of the discussions, the health secretary was urged by interim chief executive of NHS Providers Saffron Cordery to ""come to the table and talk about pay"".

Speaking after the meeting, Professor Philip Banfield told reporters the tone of the meeting with Mr Barclay was ""not confrontational"" but ""collaborative"".

""The secretary of state was a consummate politician in listening mode. It's what happens next that's the important thing.""

Professor Banfield said doctors feel they have been ""driven"" to the point of considering strike action because ""no-one is listening to us"".

""We've got about six weeks, haven't we, to sit down and try and resolve the situation. None of our doctors want to strike, they would prefer that this was resolved before we got into that situation,"" he said.

Others present at the talks were representatives of the hospital doctors' union HCSA and the British Dental Association.

The meetings came after 14 health unions announced that they will not be submitting evidence to the NHS pay review body for the next wage round while the current industrial disputes remain unresolved.

The 14 unions, representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses, porters, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists and other NHS workers in England, said they believe the lengthy pay review body process is not able to deliver a deal that resolves the current pay and staffing dispute.

They have called for direct pay talks with ministers.

Jeff Beck: 'One of the all-time guitar masters' - Tributes pour in after rock legend dies aged 78;Thursday 12 January 2023 07:55, UK;['lucia binding', '@luciabinding'];[];"Tributes have been pouring in from high-profile figures in the music industry following the death of rock legend Jeff Beck at the age of 78.

The iconic musician died on Tuesday after suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis, his family said in a statement.

Musicians from across the world have been paying tribute to the Grammy award-winning guitarist from Surrey, who rose to prominence with rock band The Yardbirds and went on to have a successful solo career that incorporated hard rock, jazz, blues and even opera.

He released his first solo single, Hi Ho Silver Lining, in 1969 - and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a member of The Yardbirds in 1992 and later as a solo artist in 2009.

Beck won a total of eight Grammy awards during the course of his career, and released a collaborative album with Johnny Depp last year after the Hollywood actor made a flurry of public appearances ahead of the verdict of his defamation battle with ex-wife Amber Heard - joining Beck on stage at gigs in Sheffield and London.

""Jeff was such a nice person and an outstanding iconic, genius guitar player - there will never be another Jeff Beck,"" Tony Iommi, guitarist for Black Sabbath wrote on Twitter.

Ronnie Wood, who played with Beck in the Jeff Beck Group, said that he felt one of his ""band of brothers has left this world"".

Corrupted file to blame for computer glitch which grounded every US flight;Thursday 12 January 2023 10:22, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A corrupted file has been blamed for a glitch on the Federal Aviation Administration's computer system which saw every flight grounded across the US.

All outbound flights were grounded until around 9am Eastern Time (2pm GMT) on Wednesday as the FAA worked to restore its Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system, which alerts pilots of potential hazards along a flight route.

As of 3pm GMT yesterday 4,948 flights within, into or out of the US had been delayed, according to flight tracker FlightAware.com, while 868 had been cancelled. Most delays were concentrated along the East Coast.

Normal air traffic operations resumed gradually across the US following the outage to the NOTAM system that provides safety information to flight crews.

A corrupted file affected both the primary and the backup systems, a senior government official told NBC News on Wednesday night, adding that officials continue to investigate.

Image: Stranded passengers at Orlando International Airport on Wednesday

""We are continuing a thorough review to determine the root cause of the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system outage"" the FAA said in an update yesterday.

""Our preliminary work has traced the outage to a damaged database file. At this time, there is no evidence of a cyberattack.""

It added work was ongoing to ""further pinpoint the causes of this issue"" and take ""all needed steps to prevent this kind of disruption from happening again"".

'Almighty mess'

Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who was at Ronald Reagan Airport in Virginia, said at the time of the outage: ""Well an almighty mess for the aviation industry in the United States.

""We were told that the NOTAM system had failed, which is part of the air traffic control system. This is critical for flights to be able to take off safely. So as a consequence the busiest airspace in the world, the airspace over the United States, didn't open as it should have done.

""Looking at the flight tracker websites it was very clear you could see flights clustered around many cities around the United States and none of them taking off. Chaos for passengers, as you might imagine.""

No evidence of cyberattack

US President Joe Biden was briefed on the outage, his press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.

She said there was no evidence a cyberattack was behind the glitch, ""but the president directed [the US Department of Transport] to conduct a full investigation into the causes"".

Mr Biden told reporters during the outage yesterday: ""They don't know what the cause of it is, they expect in a couple of hours they'll have a good sense of what caused it and will respond at that time.""

The president added that he had spoken to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the phone, and told him ""to report directly to me when they find out"".

Several people tweeted to say they had been stranded due to the outage, with one passenger at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport saying no flights were flying to the US.

Liberty Steel blames 'unviable' market as restructuring threatens hundreds of jobs;Thursday 12 January 2023 12:18, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Liberty Steel UK has placed 440 jobs under threat through a series of actions to secure its future amid ""unviable"" market conditions.

The company said high energy costs had combined with other uncompetitive factors such as cheap imports and it was vital its operations were ""refocused"".

Liberty, part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, said its Newport and West Bromwich plants would be made idle under the changes.

They would also include operations at Rotherham being shifted towards premium products.

Liberty, which has been battling financing headwinds since the collapse of its biggest lender Greensill Capital in 2021, said the next phase of its restructuring programme would see workers affected offered an alternative to redundancy.

Image: Sanjeev Gupta

The proposed scheme aims to retain, redeploy and reskill affected employees and guarantees salary and outplacement opportunities.

Liberty said they could be redeployed within the business, on previous employment terms, when market conditions allowed.

Its statement said: ""Despite the injection of £200m of shareholder capital over the last two years, the production of some commodity grade products at Rotherham and downstream mills has become unviable in the short term due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards.

""Primary production through Rotherham's lower carbon electric arc furnaces (EAFs) will be temporarily reduced while uncompetitive operating conditions prevail.""

It made the announcement despite the promise of extra financial help for energy intensive industries, including steel, through a new discount scheme for businesses.

The company said the measures would forge a ""viable way forward"" for the business and help safeguard jobs among its wider workforce of 1,900 permanent employees, rising up to 5,000 when contractors are included.

Jeffrey Kabel, chief transformation officer for Liberty Steel Group, said: ""Refocusing our operations will set the right platform for Liberty Steel UK's high-quality manufacturing businesses to adapt quickly to challenging market realities.""

He added: ""Liberty's shareholder Sanjeev Gupta has supported the business through a very difficult period and remains committed to the workforce here in the UK and ensuring our lower carbon operations help deliver a sustainable, decarbonised UK steel industry.""

Alun Davies, national officer of steelworkers union Community, responded: ""Since the collapse of Greensill Capital, the trade unions have supported the company because we believed that delivering the company's business plans, which were audited and backed by the unions' independent experts, was the best route to safeguard jobs and the future of all the businesses.

""However, the plans we reviewed were based on substantial investment and ramping up production, including at Liberty Steel Newport, and did not include the 'idling' of any sites.

""These are challenging times for all steelmakers but the company's decision to change their plans, on which we based our support, and announce a strategy seemingly based on capacity cuts and redundancies is devastating.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230112142421/https://news.sky.com/story/liberty-steel-blames-unviable-market-as-restructuring-threatens-hundreds-of-jobs-12784949;Category-2: business and economy
Putin replacing overall commander in Ukraine war could signal Russia is prepared for the 'long haul';Thursday 12 January 2023 14:28, UK;['diana magnay', '@dimagnaysky'];[];"Replacing Sergei Surovikin with the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, feels a little like President Putin is trying to consolidate the Ministry of Defence's hold over an operation whose most recent successes - if Soledar can be counted as that - have been driven by freelancers, such as Evgeny Prigozhin and his band of Wagner mercenaries.

Prigozhin had good words to say about Surovikin.

But Gerasimov and Prigozhin will not have that kind of pally rapport.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 8:19 'Last throw of the dice' for Russia

Could this be a way of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and ultimately, let's face it, President Putin, putting Prigozhin in his place?

Keeping him at arm's length - after all those triumphant videos Prigozhin posted of himself in the trenches and salt mines around Bakhmut - lest he get too buoyed by his successes and forget who's ultimately in command?

It may be a way of signalling, too, that Russia is in this for the long haul and now heralds a new, concerted phase in the war, an 'expansion of the scale of tasks' as the Ministry of Defence put it.

Less about what Surovikin failed to achieve and more about putting the 'special military operation' under the most senior leadership.

Surovikin had a tricky mandate. He had to take the fall for the retreat from Kherson even though it was a situation he inherited.

Image: President Putin and Valery Gerasimov pictured in Moscow in December 2022

Russian troops then essentially consolidated their positions for the winter with Wagner doing a lot of the offensive work around Bakhmut.

Surovikin can hardly be charged with having 'failed' in his short tenure.

Rather, appointing Gerasimov as head of operations in Ukraine may simply suggest that now begins a new phase, a tandem approach of the top army personnel, Gerasimov with Surovikin as his deputy.

Probably not a role Gerasimov will relish given the difficulty of pulling off anything game-changing any time soon.

Plus this will require his full attention, so who will take on his other responsibilities?

Questions still unanswered.

Dolphins 'forced to shout' over noise pollution which could threaten population levels, study suggests;Thursday 12 January 2023 20:45, UK;[];[];"Dolphins shout at each other over increasing levels of underwater noise pollution, new research suggests.

Sounds generated by humans may force the animals to make louder and less effective whistles, according to experts from the University of Bristol.

Dolphins rely on echolocation to hunt and reproduce, meaning activities like drilling and shipping could affect the health of wild dolphin populations.

Image: File pic

""Within the last couple of decades, we've seen a dramatic increase in human-made noise, and noise pollution in the oceans is no exception,"" said first author Pernille Sorensen.

She added: ""Those same reasons that make sound so advantageous for animals to use also make them susceptible to disturbance from noise in the environment.""

Researchers put two dolphins, named Delta and Reese, in an experimental lagoon where they had to work together to press a button at each end within a second of each other.

During certain trials, one dolphin was released five to 10 seconds after the other, meaning they had to rely on vocal communication to coordinate the button press.

Researchers discovered that when they raised the level of noise playing through an underwater speaker, both Delta and Reese changed the volume and length of their calls.

Their button-press success rate dropped from 85% to 62.5% between the lowest and highest levels of noise, the study found.

Dolphins' communication impaired by noise despite being highly motivated

Ms Sorensen said: ""This shows us that despite them using these compensatory mechanisms, their communication was impaired by noise.

""Our work shows that despite their attempts to compensate, despite being highly motivated and the fact that they know this cooperative task so well, the noise still impaired their ability to successfully coordinate.""

Europe's biggest ever discovery of rare metals used to make phones and cars;Thursday 12 January 2023 22:25, UK;[];[];"The largest discovery of rare earth metals in European history has sparked hopes of countering Chinese dominance in the sector.

Swedish mining company LKAB said it found more than one million tonnes of the rare resources used to make smartphones, electric vehicles, wind turbines and speakers in the nation's Arctic region.

EU leaders hope the discovery will counter Chinese and Russian dominance over the mining of rare earth metals.

Rare earth elements have not been mined in Europe, making the continent dependent on imports from elsewhere.

Demand for them is expected to rise in coming years due to a spike in demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy products.

LKAB chief executive Jan Mostrom said: ""This is good news, not only for LKAB, the region and the Swedish people, but also for Europe and the climate.

""It could become a significant building block for producing the critical raw materials that are absolutely crucial to enable the green transition.""

'Independence will begin in the mine'

The vast majority of the rare earth minerals are currently mined in China, where many of the world's most popular electronics are made.

Swedish energy minister Ebba Busch said: ""Electrification, the EU's self-sufficiency, and independence from Russia and China will begin in the mine.""

The science behind why we love chocolate so much - and how it could be made healthier;Friday 13 January 2023 01:14, UK;[];[];"Scientists have uncovered what makes chocolate so popular, as they advised confectioners how to keep its beloved texture while making it healthier.

The researchers decoded the physical process that takes place in the mouth as a piece of chocolate melts from a solid into a smooth emulsion.

They claim that a fatty film coating the harder centre, which helps it cover all parts of the mouth, makes chocolate's texture so appealing.

The University of Leeds scientists hope their findings will lead to the development of healthier luxury chocolate, maintaining the mouth feel while being better for us.

'The chocolate sensation'

According to the study, the smooth sensation that arises in our mouth comes from the way the chocolate is lubricated, either from ingredients in the treat itself, from saliva, or a combination of the two.

Almost as soon as chocolate comes into contact with the tongue, fat has a key role to play.

Solid cocoa particles are released, and they become important in terms of the tactile sensation.

Fat deeper inside the chocolate could be reduced without the feel or sensation of chocolate being affected.

Anwesha Sarkar, professor of colloids and surfaces in the School of Food Science and Nutrition at Leeds, said: ""If a chocolate has 5% fat or 50% fat it will still form droplets in the mouth and that gives you the chocolate sensation.

""However, it is the location of the fat in the make-up of the chocolate which matters in each stage of lubrication, and that has been rarely researched.""

Recession in doubt as economy achieves surprise growth in November;Friday 13 January 2023 07:13, UK;[];[];"The economy grew by 0.1% in November, partly aided by the football World Cup, according to official figures which call into question predictions the UK is already in recession.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed pressure on demand from the effects of high inflation but a boost from people packing pubs and bars to watch events in Qatar.

Economists had predicted a negative growth figure - of around 0.2%.

The figure for November came on the back of a positive growth reading the previous month, largely explained by activity getting back to normal after disruption to output from the late Queen's death.

The additional bank holiday for the funeral in September saw most businesses close.

The Bank of England is among public bodies to have forecast that the UK fell into recession during the third quarter of 2022.

Should a reading by the ONS for the October to December period show a negative growth figure, then the economy will have met the criteria for recession: two consecutive quarters of contraction.

It seems the possibility will be tight.

The ONS said that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3% in the three months to November.

Apple boss Tim Cook asks for 40% pay cut after investor backlash;Friday 13 January 2023 08:58, UK;[];[];"Apple chief executive Tim Cook is to take a pay cut of more than 40% after shareholders turned on the size of his awards last year.

The company said he requested the move after fewer than two-thirds of Apple investors supported his pay package at the tech firm's annual meeting in 2022.

Regulatory filings on Thursday showed his basic salary and bonus would remain the same at $3m (£2.45m) and $6m (£4.9m), respectively.

But stock bonuses would depend more, in future, on how well the iPhone maker's shares perform relative to market peers.

Mr Cook's compensation for Apple's financial year to the end of September 2022 was $99.4m - up slightly on the previous year's $98.7m.

The target for 2023 was set at a total of $49m.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the economy would need to shrink by 0.6% or more in December for the fourth quarter of 2022 to contract as a whole - triggering a technical recession.

The prospect of avoiding such a downturn is easing not only in the UK but across Europe and in the US too but it does not mean that all is rosy.

Business groups warned that many sectors were struggling - and needed the support of government to protect jobs as energy-led costs continue to stifle orders and investment.

Pressure on squeezed consumers too is set to intensify as the Bank of England is still forecast to maintain interest rate increases to help inflation ease over the first half of 2023, raising bills in the process as mortgage costs climb.

Couple missing for week with newborn baby spotted on CCTV in London;Friday 13 January 2023 09:49, UK;[];[];"A couple who went missing with their newborn child have been captured on CCTV arriving in London.

Police have been looking for 35-year-old Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, 48, since their vehicle broke down on the M61 near Bolton on 5 January.

Officers believe Ms Marten had very recently given birth and that neither she nor the baby have been seen by medical professionals.

The couple left the car on foot and are believed to have first travelled to Liverpool.

There were other sightings of them in Harwich and Colchester in Essex in the following days, and a CCTV image released previously is thought to show Ms Marten in a red shawl near Harwich Port.

Police said on Thursday that the latest sighting was on Saturday 7 January, when they took a taxi from Harwich to East Ham station in east London.

CCTV footage recorded them there between 11.45am and 12.30pm.

Double jeopardy killer Dennis McGrory will serve minimum 25 years for murder and rape of Jacqueline Montgomery in 1975;Friday 13 January 2023 12:00, UK;[];[];"Double jeopardy killer Dennis McGrory has been sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years for murdering and raping teenager Jacqueline Montgomery in 1975.

He was cleared of the crime nearly half a century ago but was found guilty following a second trial after new DNA evidence was found.

Now in his mid-seventies - and sentenced today to at least 25 years and 126 days - he is likely to die in jail.

McGrory, a violent drinker, was 28 when he raped and murdered the 15-year-old in her home in Islington, north London.

He was angry and looking for his estranged partner Josie, Jaqueline's aunt. It was thought he attacked her to force her to reveal Josie's new address.

Jacqueline's father found his daughter's body when he got home.

She had been raped, stabbed through the back, heart and diaphragm, and strangled - with the cord of an iron found around her neck.

McGrory carried out the attack ""fuelled by alcohol and driven by rage and lust for Jackie"", said judge Mr Justice Bryan during sentencing today.

He said the killer had an ""unreciprocated sexual interest"" in Jaqueline and had ""tried it on"" with her before.

There was ""very significant suffering before death"" - with the judge calling it a ""horrific, violent and sustained ordeal"".

Jacqueline would have been ""terrified"", he added, with experts believing she could have survived with the horrific injuries for up to 10 minutes before she died.

""How any man could inflict such sexual and physical harm upon a 15-year-old child who had done them no harm beggars belief?"" the judge said.

He said there was also the possibility she was tortured because of the iron cord around her neck and a burn mark on her leg.

'A billion-to-one match'

McGrory was described in court as showing ""not one iota of remorse or compassion"" for his victim and her family.

He continued to deny the murder despite the damning new DNA evidence against him.

The killer originally claimed he had been attacked and beaten up by four strangers on the night of the murder and had not been to Jacqueline's home.

Image: McGrory said his injuries were caused after he was attacked by four men

But the prosecution said they were injuries caused when his victim tried to fight him off.

Eventually, a judge at the Old Bailey threw out the case in 1976 after deciding the prosecution evidence, which was purely circumstantial, was too weak.

But vaginal swabs from Jacqueline's body had been kept and were retested using new scientific techniques.

They showed a billion-to-one match with McGrory's DNA, his unique genetic fingerprint. He was re-arrested and charged with rape and murder for a second time.

It took jurors at Huntingdon Crown Court just three hours to find him guilty of rape and murder.

This was a rare retrial - and the oldest - after the scrapping of the ancient double jeopardy legal principle which prevented a defendant being charged with the same crime twice.

The law was changed in 2003 to allow retrials of acquitted defendants if new and compelling evidence emerged and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) was convinced that each case was fair and in the public interest.

Since the change in the double jeopardy law there have been only a few retrials of previously acquitted defendants.

The most famous is the successful prosecution of Gary Dobson who had been found not guilty over the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in South London in 1993.

Recession remains a threat ahead but there is cause for some optimism;Friday 13 January 2023 11:41, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Good news has been in such rare supply in economics recently that it's worth dwelling on it when it arrives.

This morning, on Friday 13th of all days, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced that the economy had grown by 0.1% in November.

This is hardly especially strong gross domestic product growth, but it's considerably better than what economists had expected: a 0.2% contraction.

And it's significant because of what it implies.

Unless the economy contracts by 0.4% in December the UK could avoid falling into technical recession.

This is no mean feat. We are faced with one of the biggest price shocks in modern record.

The majority of economists, including the Bank of England and Office for Budget Responsibility, assumed that the economy would shrink in the final quarter of the year and, given a recession is typically defined as two successive quarters of contraction, that would mean we had formally succumbed to the R-word.

It's now quite plausible that Britain avoids that fate - for the time being at least.

That final clause matters because whether or not the UK falls foul of this somewhat arbitrary economic phenomenon, its economy is still barely growing.

Since the change in the double jeopardy law there have been only a few retrials of previously acquitted defendants.

The most famous is the successful prosecution of Gary Dobson who had been found not guilty over the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in South London in 1993.

He and another original suspect David Norris, who hadn't previously stood trial, were convicted in 2012 and jailed for life.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230113120100/https://news.sky.com/story/double-jeopardy-killer-dennis-mcgrory-will-serve-minimum-25-years-for-murder-and-rape-of-jacqueline-montgomery-in-1975-12785128;Category-7: health

'Spiteful' strike law undermines efforts to resolve public sector disputes, union chief warns;Friday 13 January 2023 13:13, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Attempts to settle public sector pay disputes have been undermined by ""spiteful"" anti-strike legislation tabled by the government this week, the UK's senior union official has told Sky News.

Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), vowed to fight the proposed laws ""tooth and nail"", and questioned whether ministers negotiating with public sector unions were acting in good faith.

Describing Jeremy Hunt as ""missing in action"", the TUC boss called on the chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak to provide the funding needed to unlock disputes.

Ministers say the legislation is intended to ensure a minimum level of public service during strike action, initially from paramedics, firefighters and on the railways, but unions say it is an attack on the fundamental right to strike.

The new legislation would give ministers wide discretionary power to define minimum service levels and leave workers who ignore orders to work during a strike vulnerable to dismissal.

""This legislation effectively takes away the right to strike from millions of public sector workers,"" Mr Nowak said.

""It means that someone who votes for industrial action in a lawful industrial action ballot could be forced to work, and if they don't work, can be sacked from their jobs. This is a government that appears to have moved from clapping nurses to sacking nurses.""

Mr Nowak said the tabling of the aggressive legislation as ministers invited health and teaching unions to talks raised doubts about the government's sincerity.

""It's really difficult to negotiate in good faith when you have a government that is intent on attacking trade union and hard-working NHS workers,"" he said.

""The government has to make up its mind whether it is serious about solving the staffing crisis in the NHS or go back to a 1980s playbook of attacking workers and blaming union members.""

Talks have resumed this week between the RMT rail union and train operators over a new offer to staff, but negotiations with health unions appear to have stalled as the government insists it will not reopen talks over a pay settlement for 2022.

Mr Nowak called on Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt to provide the money required to settle the disputes.

""I think it is really important that the chancellor and the prime minister take some responsibility. Ultimately we are going to need some new money on the table to unlock these disputes,"" he said.

""They can't wash their hands of these problems. When you have 300,000 vacancies in the NHS and social care you are going to have to find the resources to fix those problems. I would call on the PM and the chancellor to get involved.

""Ultimately there has to be Treasury involvement in settling these disputes so we are still on the hunt for Hunt. The government has to come to the table and negotiate seriously and take away these regressive draconian legislative proposals.""

Ahead of a fresh round of strikes by nurses and civil servants in the coming week Mr Nowak said public support is still behind workers.

""Two thirds of the public hold the government responsible for this wave of industrial action,"" he said.

""When it comes to a straight battle in the court of public opinion between [health secretary] Steve Barclay, Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt and our nurses, our paramedics, our teachers and civil servants I think I know which side the British public is on.

""So I urge the government to listen to the public, listen to their own workforce, get round the table, resolve these disputes and put fair pay at the heart of it.

""I think the vast majority of the British people will see this for what it is, a fundamental attack on workers.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230113134727/http://news.sky.com/story/spiteful-strike-law-undermines-efforts-to-resolve-public-sector-disputes-union-chief-warns-12785666;Category-1: politics
Benjamin Mendy: Manchester City player not guilty of six counts of rape and faces retrial on two more charges;Friday 13 January 2023 13:40, UK;[];[];"Footballer Benjamin Mendy has been found not guilty of six counts of rape and one charge of sexual assault against five women.

The jury has been discharged after it failed to reach a verdict on two further charges and he will be retried on these in the summer.

Co-accused Louis Saha Matturie, Mendy's alleged ""fixer"", was found not guilty of three counts of rape against two women.

Jurors were unable to reach verdicts on six more charges against him.

The trial began in August after 13 women made allegations against the pair.

Mendy will face a retrial in June over the two charges - alleged rape and attempted rape - that the jury couldn't decide on.

The 28-year-old covered his face with both hands and gently rocked back and forth as the jury foreman read the unanimous verdicts.

On Friday, the judge asked if the jury would reach verdicts if they had more time. However, the foreman replied: ""No. We are at a point now where we can't agree.""

Mendy was accused of being a ""predator"" who turned the pursuit of women for sex into a game, but both men denied the charges and said all the sexual activity was consensual.

Specialist officers are supporting her next of kin.

A second woman who received treatment for dog bites has since left hospital.

A total of eight dogs were detained, and they remain in the custody of the police.

No arrests have been made.

Roads in the area remained cordoned off on Friday as forensic work continued, with only residents being allowed in and out.

Inspector Lyndsey Whatley of Surrey Police said: ""Officers were called to Gravelly Hill in Caterham to reports of dogs attacking members of the public.

Rick And Morty star Justin Roiland in court to face charge of domestic violence against former girlfriend;Friday 13 January 2023 16:01, UK;['bethany minelle', '@bethanyminelle'];[];"Rick and Morty star Justin Roiland has been charged with felony domestic violence against a former partner.

The 42-year-old - who co-created the animated series and voices the two title characters - appeared in court in Orange County, California, for a pre-trial hearing.

A criminal complaint filed by prosecutors in May 2020, and seen by NBC News, charges Roiland with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, fraud, and violence or deceit against the woman, who he was living with at the time.

The woman was not identified in court documents. Roiland has pleaded not guilty.

The incident occurred in January of 2020 and Roiland was charged in May of that year, however the charges apparently went unnoticed by media outlets until NBC News reported them.

Further documents seen by NBC News show Roiland was arrested and released on a $50,000 (£41,000) bond in August 2020 before returning to court in October 2020.

A protective order, put in place in October 2020 and remaining in place until October 2023, says he must not harass, threaten or surveil the person named in the protective order, and cannot go within 100 feet of the person. He is also ordered to turn in any firearms he owned or possessed.

Roiland is set to return to court in April. A trial date has not been set.

So far, there have been around a dozen court hearings, including pre-trial hearings.

Best known for his work on Rick And Morty, Roiland created the animated sci-fi sitcom about a mad scientist and his grandson with writer Dan Harmon.

The popular adult television comedy has aired for six seasons on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim night-time programming, and has been renewed for a seventh season.

The show has won two Emmy Awards, for episodes in 2018 and 2020, and a Hollywood Critics Choice Association TV award in 2022.

Roiland, who has recently ventured into the art world, selling several NFT (non-fungible token) art projects over the last few years, has also created two projects for TV streaming platform Hulu - Solar Opposites, which has been renewed for a fifth season, and Koala Man which launched this month.

He also released his own video game, High On Life, late in December through his studio, Squanch Games, which became the top-selling game on Steam and the fourth most-played Xbox game in the week of its release.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230113161723/http://news.sky.com/story/rick-and-morty-star-justin-roiland-in-court-to-face-charge-of-domestic-violence-against-former-girlfriend-12785600;Category-7: health

The Westminster Accounts: The story so far;;[];[];"What the numbers tell us about MPs' earnings, donors, leaders and APPGs

In a series of four extended reports, Sky's deputy political editor Sam Coates goes deep into the database, revealing rankings never put together before and speaking to those at the centre of the debate about money in our politics.

Earnings

MPs declare money earned from second jobs in the register of members' interests. But the way the register is published makes it almost impossible to collate the total amounts for each MP, let alone compare them. The Westminster Accounts changes that.

In the opening film of the project, Sam Coates looks at the MPs with the biggest outside earnings since the last election.

Donors

Donations made to political parties are clearly visible in the Electoral Commission register. But just as with earnings, when a donation is made directly to an MP it is recorded in a register which does not allow you to easily see the big picture.

In this report, Sam Coates reveals which donors have given the most to individual MPs since the last election - and some of the names he identifies raise questions about just how transparent the system really is.

Leaders

The price of the political chaos of the last few years can be put into numbers when you look at the MPs who have received the most donations.

Campaigning is costly, and if you have multiple leadership contests on top of actual elections - that cost ratchets up.

So what does it take to make a bid for the big jobs, and who pays for it?

APPGs

They may be little known outside of Westminster, but All-Party Parliamentary Groups have become big business.

In this report Sam Coates looks at the millions of pounds of benefits these informal interest groups have received from external organisations - and hears direct from lobbying industry insiders that some of these APPGs might not be fully transparent about the corporate interests funding them.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230113220223/http://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091;Category-1: politics

But no. It's not the Rescue Rangers.

Instead, a drama about the drug-filled and murderous history of one of the most iconic dance troupes in America, the Chippendales, has hit the streamer - you know, the buff lads that take their clothes off for their adoring audience of (largely, but not exclusively, women).

With an all-star cast, Welcome To Chippendales tells the story of US immigrant Somen 'Steve' Banerjee (played by Marvel star Kumail Nanjiani) and his rise to fame, and infamy, and finally his fall from grace, all in the name of keeping his raunchy revue show alive at any cost.

Joining Nanjiani is Broadway icon Annaleigh Ashford, who plays Banerjee's wife Irene, White Lotus star Murray Bartlett as troupe choreographer Nick De Noia and Dan Stevens as Paul Snider - the man who killed his Playboy model wife in a fit of jealousy.

""The Chippendales dancers are sort of an American icon, if you will,"" Ashford explained to Backstage, the TV and film podcast from Sky News.

""They're sort of a funny part of pop culture that came about in the late seventies and kind of lived through the early nineties.""

She added: ""Since the dawn of time, we've been watching men get to watch women take their clothes off, so it took until 1970 for women to watch men take their clothes off.

""That's always been sort of... Chippendales culture that I think is fascinating - but basically, we think of collars and cuffs and men taking their pants off for ladies. Finally.""

Ashford also explained that her mother's love of true-crime meant she knew about the troupe's murky history.

""My mom watches a lot of true-crime shows, and so she had told me about it many moons ago.

""Lots of murder and in lots of different places and very, very shocking. The kind of story that if you wrote it from your brain, we'd all say, 'that's too crazy. That would never happen in real life'.

""So that's obviously why we needed to make a television show about it.""

But while Ashford was tapped in to what the Chippendales are - Nanjiani had less of an idea.

""I honestly didn't know much about the story behind it until this project came my way,"" he admitted to Backstage.

""I didn't know that it was an immigrant who started Chippendales, I didn't know that it had this like sort of sordid backstory with, you know, the sex and drugs. The arson and murder were surprising - so I really had no idea until... the creator of our show told me what happens episode by episode.

""And that's when I found out all of this. I had no idea about any of this. Chippendales is a part of pop culture... but the story behind it surprisingly is not.""

Image: The Chippendales has a pretty dark history... Pic: Disney+

When asked what made them want to play the roles, one a murderous strip club owner and the other his dutiful wife, Ashford replied: ""We crave characters who are complicated, who have high stakes, who have challenges, and the circumstances of this story are just a wonderful sort of breeding ground for all of those complicated things to navigate as a character and as an actor.

Nanjiani fired back: ""I thought you said it was because of me that you wanted to do it. You said the reason you were doing it was because of me. What? I don't know what all this stuff is...?""

Ashford said that of course her co-star was one of the ""puzzle pieces"" as to why wanted to take the role, with Nanjiani joking: ""I just want to be a piece of the puzzle.""

Euston shooting: Suspects fired shotgun at funeral mourners from moving car;Sunday 15 January 2023 10:23, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"Suspects fired a shotgun from a moving car at mourners gathered outside a church in north London, police have said.

Superintendent Jack Rowlands of the Metropolitan Police described the shooting as a ""senseless act of violence"" and said officers were looking for a 2019 model black Toyota.

Several people were injured after the drive-by shooting near a memorial site for a young woman who died of cancer.

A seven-year-old girl is in a stable but life-threatening condition in hospital. A 48-year-old woman also suffered potentially life-changing injuries.

Witnesses described how the attack sent people running and screaming from St Aloysius Roman Catholic Church in Euston, central London, on Saturday afternoon.

The seven-year-old girl, another aged 12 and four women, aged 21, 41, 48 and 54, were taken to hospital after the incident at around 1.30pm.

The 12-year-old has been discharged and is expected to make a full recovery.

It happened as a requiem mass for 20-year-old Sara Sanchez and her mother, Fresia Calderon, who died within a month of one another in November, took place inside the church in Phoenix Road.

""I was inside the church. I heard the bang and people ran back into the church,"" he said.

""They knew something had happened outside.

""They were very scared, people sheltered in the church until the police said they can leave, but some of them were so scared they had to wait a while to get their confidence back up to go outside.""

Queen Macauley was visiting a friend who lives near the church when she heard the gunshots.

She told Sky News her ""heart was racing"" as she saw people running and heard screams.

""It was quite chaotic,"" she added.

One resident of an estate across the road from the church, who did not want to be named, also heard gunshots.

""I was having a quiet day on my balcony and I heard this almighty bang and I thought this was not normal,"" they said.

""The next minute, everyone was screaming and shouting. We have a food bank there and everyone was running off.

Boy thrown from 10th floor of Tate gallery now practising judo and can blow out candles again, family says;Monday 16 January 2023 00:02, UK;[];[];"A boy who was thrown from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art gallery in London is practising a gentle form of judo and adapted archery as his condition improves, his family has said.

The French youngster, who was six at the time of the attack, suffered life-changing injuries including a bleed on the brain and broken bones from the 100ft (30m) fall in August 2019.

Autistic teenager Jonty Bravery was living in supported accommodation at the time but was allowed out unsupervised when he targeted the boy.

Bravery intended to select and kill someone, a court was later told.

He was convicted of attempted murder in 2020 and jailed for 15 years.

Posting on a GoFundMe page, which has raised nearly €400,000 (£354,000) for the youngster's care and rehabilitation, his family said that he was increasingly taking part in physical activity as part of his treatment.

They said: ""Since September, we have returned to Paris several times to consult specialists because we have to monitor the development of our son's back, shoulder and hip, given his growth.

""We will now have to do this check every six months, to make sure that he does not need a corset again. Similarly, some new operations may unfortunately become necessary.

""In prevention, specialists recommend appropriate physical activity. This is why we have registered our son for equine therapy and the swimming pool with his specialised educator.

""And the latter also accompanies him, since the end of October, to judo. She does it very gently and does not let go of an inch on the tatami, of course.

""From time to time, we also take him for adapted archery. Our son has always loved sports, he is delighted to do all this.""

Explaining that the youngster was also improving with his breathing, they wrote: ""We have also found a new speech therapist, and thanks to her, our little knight has made considerable progress in swallowing and breathing.

""He's able to blow out candles again, he hardly makes any more wrong turns when he drinks liquids, and he's starting to keep the rhythm of the songs better.

""He is also pursuing orthoptics and his sight is improving further, as is his memory thanks to cognitive remediation sessions with his neuropsychologist.

""He remembers more and more things he did or was told during the day.""

The family said that the boy had ""very positive"" school results, and added: ""Our son's teacher and guide are both very happy with his progress: he manages to follow in class despite his difficulties, because he is extremely courageous and hardworking.

""Thus, despite the fact that he still has to automate the writing of letters, he nevertheless manages to improve in spelling and to obtain very good marks in dictation, which he is very proud of.

""Moreover, thanks to all his mobility progress (balance, left arm, muscle strengthening, etc.), he is increasingly able to play alone at home and in the hospital.

What is Blue Monday - and what makes it the most depressing day of the year?;Monday 16 January 2023 11:08, UK;[];[];"Welcome to Blue Monday, dubbed the most depressing day of the year.

But what's so miserable about it, and where did the concept come from? Here's everything you know about the supposedly gloomiest of days.

What is Blue Monday?

Blue Monday falls on the third Monday of the year - in 2023, that makes it Monday 16 January.

Blue Monday was originally dreamed up by psychologist Dr Cliff Arnall in 2004. He devised the formula for the bleakest day to help a travel company sell holidays, with the first Blue Monday on 24 January, 2005.

How did he work out this formula?

The model is: [W + (D-d)] x TQ

M x NA

In this equation there are seven variables: (W) weather, (D) debt, (d) monthly salary, (T) time since Christmas, (Q) time since failed quit attempt, (M) low motivational levels and (NA) the need to take action.

It's supposed to account for January's worsening weather, the long stretch until payday underscored by festive debt, lapsed New Year's resolutions and the joy of Christmas fading in the rear view mirror.

So is Blue Monday really the most depressing day of the year?

In short, no. It was a marketing stunt with legs (long ones, given it turns 18 this year).

In the words of a neuroscientist writing for the Guardian, ""It is unscientific. It is pseudoscientific. It is uber-pseudoscientific.

""The equation itself is farcical,"" Dean Burnett writes. ""Even if most of these weren't nonsensical measurements (how do you determine the motivation of everyone in the population?), they're not compatible. How do you quantifiably combine 'time since Christmas' with 'weather'? You can't.""

Why do we still hear about it every year?

Possibly because it taps into something we are feeling. It's thought seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, affects around 2 million people in the UK, causing symptoms similar to depression including low mood, lethargy and loss of interest in hobbies.

Samaritans has started a counter-campaign called Brew Monday, which labels Blue Monday a ""myth"" and encourages people to ""make time for a cuppa and a catch-up"".

""We all have our good days and our bad days, and those aren't for the calendar to decide,"" the charity says.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230116130429/http://news.sky.com/story/what-is-blue-monday-and-what-makes-it-the-most-depressing-day-of-the-year-12787873;Category-3: environment
Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida dies aged 95;Monday 16 January 2023 12:09, UK;[];[];"Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida has died at the age of 95, according to ANSA news agency.

She was one of the highest-profile European actresses of the 1950s and early 1960s, playing opposite Hollywood stars including Humphrey Bogart, Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra.

Image: Lollobrigida with Tony Curtis in Trapeze, in 1956. Pic: Snap/Shutterstock

Starting out from humble beginnings, she became one of the most recognisable faces of Italian post-war cinema.

An international sex symbol, rivalled only by fellow Italian actress Sophia Loren, Lollobrigida was one of the last of the last remaining stars of Hollywood's Golden Age.

Her former lawyer, Giulia Citani, said she died at a clinic in Rome, but did not give her cause of death.

Affectionately known in her native Italy simply as ""La Lollo"", she starred in films including The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Solomon and Sheba, Beautiful But Dangerous and The World's Most Beautiful Woman during her five-decade acting career.

Eventually stepping away from the movie word, Lollobrigida found success as a photographer and sculptor in later life, also venturing into the world of politics.

In 1975, rumours swirled that she had had an affair with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, after she secured exclusive access to him for a documentary she produced.

She later made headlines in 2006, when aged 79, she announced she was marrying a man 34 years her junior.

Investigating officers are now appealing for witnesses to come forward as they try to find the driver.

They believe the VW Golf had been parked nearby.

Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: ""The Golf failed to stop and we believe it drove off in the direction of Corn Exchange Road.

""Our enquiries are ongoing and we are keen to trace the driver.

""In particular, I am asking for road users in the area at the time of the incident to check their dashcams to see if they have footage that could help with our investigation to get in touch.

""In addition, if you saw what happened or where the car went afterwards and have not already spoken to officers then please contact us.""

'Hangover effect' remains after mini-budget chaos but mortgage shock is over, BoE governor says;Monday 16 January 2023 17:21, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The governor of the Bank of England has told MPs there is still ""something of a hangover effect"" in the wake of the mini-budget market chaos last year but declared that the hit to mortgages was over.

Andrew Bailey used remarks to the Treasury committee to declare that market conditions had returned to normal after the economic competence of the-then Liz Truss government was called into question - sparking chaos in the bond markets and forcing up borrowing costs.

The damage caused by the so called growth plan, outlined by her short-lived chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last September, had now been largely eradicated, according to Mr Bailey.

He said: ""I hoped that we would see mortgage rates come down, and that has happened, we have seen new fixed-rate mortgage rates have come down since.

""I'm talking there about the lower-risk end of the mortgage market, so loans with a sub-75% loan-to-value, and actually the higher-risk end as well.

""We have seen correcting in that respect and, of course, that benefits people seeking mortgages.""

While the crisis may be over, data from financial information service moneyfacts.co.uk suggested that fixed rate mortgage costs were still above were they were ahead of the mini-budget.

Its figures showed that the average two-year fixed rate stood at 5.6% on Monday.

The five-year figure stood slightly above 5.4%.

Both of them had stood above 4% in the weeks before the Truss government's giveaway but the key reason for the disparity is the Bank's action to tackle inflation since the mini-budget through hikes to Bank rate.

The current availability of mortgage deals is consistent with the number at the beginning of September last year at close to 3,800.

Mr Bailey added that the ""risk premium"" in the UK interest rate environment had now gone - meaning the higher rates demanded in countries where there is greater economic instability - but added that the ""hangover"" element was down to trust.

""It is going to take some time to convince people that we are back to where we were before"", he said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230116183516/http://news.sky.com/story/hangover-effect-remains-after-mini-budget-chaos-but-mortgage-shock-is-over-boe-governor-says-12788260;Category-2: business and economy

The government's controversial Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill has passed its latest parliamentary stage in the Commons after MPs voted in favour of the legislation by 309 votes to 249 - a majority of 60.

The bill contains measures to enforce minimum service levels during strike action, including for ambulance staff, firefighters and railway workers.

Under the bill, some employees would be required to work during a strike and could be sacked if they refuse.

The bill will now progress to committee stage where MPs have the opportunity to scrutinise key details of the legislation in more detail.

Father arrested on live TV after toddler seen waving a loaded handgun outside their apartment;Tuesday 17 January 2023 03:06, UK;[];[];"A father has been arrested after a toddler was seen holding a loaded handgun outside their apartment in Indiana.

Footage from a neighbour's security camera had shown the toddler holding the pistol in the hallway of the complex in the city of Beech Grove and at one point pulling the trigger.

However, no bullets were fired from the weapon, according to Indianapolis TV station WXIN.

While no rounds were in the gun's chamber, there were 15 rounds in the magazine.

The toddler's father, 45, was arrested and is expected to appear in court for his initial hearing on Tuesday afternoon, NBC News has reported.

Live footage of the father's arrest was filmed by and broadcast on the reality TV show called On Patrol: Live, which follows law enforcement officers on duty, Beech Grove Police Department has said.

The father has been accused of felony neglect of a dependent, police said.

The boy, whose age has not been reported, does not appear to have been harmed in the incident.

Facing pressure from Tory rebels, PM set to toughen up Online Safety Bill;Tuesday 17 January 2023 02:44, UK;[];[];"Rishi Sunak appears to have bowed to pressure from rebel Tory MPs to make social media bosses criminally liable for failing to protect children from online harm.

The prime minister was facing a major backbench rebellion as 50 MPs put their names to an amendment to the Online Safety Bill.

The amendment would toughen up the punishments for tech chiefs who fail to block children from seeing damaging content on their platforms.

Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan has reached a deal with rebels after talks over the weekend, according to a source close to her, allowing the prime minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.

The source suggested Ms Donelan likes the intention of the amendment, but the wording ""wasn't quite right"".

It is understood the rebels have dropped the amendment ahead of its return to the Commons later today - and the culture secretary is working with them to table it in the House of Lords ""in a more workable format"".

It marks the third time Mr Sunak has backed down in the face of uprisings on his backbenches since entering Number 10 in October, having ditched onshore wind farms and housing planning reforms.

Former cabinet ministers including ex-home secretary Priti Patel and former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith are among those backing the change to the Online Safety Bill.

With Labour supporting it too, failure to find a compromise would have seen Mr Sunak on course for his first major defeat in the Commons.

The rebel amendment looks to introduce a new clause into the Online Safety Bill to ""make it an offence for the provider of a user-to-service not to comply with the safety duties protecting children"" which are set out in the draft law.

In its current form, the new internet safety law would require tech companies to remove illegal material from their platforms, with a particular emphasis on protecting children from seeing harmful content.

Social media platforms and other user-generated, content-based sites that break the rules would face large fines from the sector's new regulator, Ofcom.

But the proposed law would only hold tech bosses liable for failing to give information to the watchdog.

Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig said: ""The government has confirmed a major climbdown in the face of a threatened rebellion which could have lead to a government defeat on the Online Safety Bill.

""On the eve of a big showdown, in which up to 50 Tory MPs were threatening to vote against the government, the government has pledged to, not accept the amendment put down by the rebels, but to bring it back in the Lords.

""The government has backed down because it would have potentially lost the vote.""

Sir Iain had said current protection offered by the draft legislation was ""weak"" and children needed greater safeguards against seeing ""extreme pornography"" and material about suicide.

The NSPCC has been helping drive a campaign to have managers made criminally responsible for failing to offer protection to youngsters.

Richard Collard, associate head of child safety online policy at the children's charity, said: ""By committing to senior manager liability, the culture secretary has sent a strong and welcome signal that she will give the Online Safety Bill the teeth needed to drive a culture change within the heart of tech companies that will help protect children from future tragedies.

""The government has rightly listened to the concerns raised by MPs and we look forward to working with ministers to ensure the final legislation holds senior managers accountable in practice if their products continue to put children at risk of preventable harm and sexual abuse.""

Ian Russell, the father of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing harmful material on social media, said the threat of imprisonment is ""the only thing"" that will make the bosses ""put safety near the top of their agenda"".

Children's 'word of the year' revealed - but can you guess the top three?;Tuesday 17 January 2023 03:30, UK;[];[];"Queen has been voted the Children's Word of the Year after the UK mourned the loss of its longest-serving monarch.

More than 4,000 children aged between six and 14 were asked for words they felt had been important during 2022 and, based on the top themes, three words - Queen, happy and chaos - were shortlisted.

A separate poll, of a further 1,000 children by Opinium, was carried out to determine the Word of the Year 2022 from the shortlist of three.

The research from Oxford University Press (OUP) suggests that nearly half (46%) of those children chose Queen as their number one word.

This was followed by happy (36%) and chaos (14%).

The OUP said the findings highlight that the news has an impact on children and they absorb the language around current events.

When asked why they chose Queen, many children cited sadness and loss as well as feelings of pride in relation to the late monarch.

The Queen featured prominently in children's lives over the past year, with last February marking 70 years since her accession to the throne.

This was followed by Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, and the country mourning her death at the age of 96 in September.

Many children across the UK will have taken part in Jubilee celebrations last year, and experienced the death of a monarch for the first time.

While more than half (52%) of girls questioned chose the word Queen, this was lower for boys at 39%.

The OUP report suggests the difference between the sexes could be because the Queen provided ""an important female role model"" for girls, or that they could ""relate to her more readily"".

Helen Freeman, director of Oxford Children's Books, said: ""It comes as no surprise that Queen is Children's Word of the Year for 2022.

""This not only reflects her majesty's 70 years of incredible service, but over the past decade our research consistently reveals how attuned children are to the news and the impact current affairs have on their language.

""It's vital we continue to invest in language development and ensure children have access to a wide range of vocabulary in order to feel equipped to process and discuss the news.""

For more than a decade, lexicographers, experts and academic researchers in the children's language department at the OUP have analysed the evolution of children's language and self-expression.

Last year's Children's Word of the Year was anxiety, and in 2020 it was coronavirus.

The OUP also included a shortlist of three colloquial words - cool, sick/sic and slay - in its survey of 1,000 children.

Two in five (40%) chose cool to be their top slang word, ahead of sick/sic (28%) and slay (15%).";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117033217/http://news.sky.com/story/childrens-word-of-the-year-revealed-but-can-you-guess-the-top-three-12788445;Category-5: entertainment and culture
Met Police reviewing over 1,600 cases of alleged sexual offences and domestic abuse involving its staff;Tuesday 17 January 2023 04:00, UK;[];[];"The Metropolitan Police is reviewing more than 1,600 cases of alleged sexual offences or domestic violence involving its own officers and staff.

It comes a serving officer turned out to be one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders.

PC David Carrick - who was known to his colleagues as ""B*****d Dave"" - admitted dozens of rapes and sexual offences following attacks on 12 women.

Image: Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick is one of Britain's worst-ever sex offenders

He admitted 49 charges - including 24 rape counts - for crimes committed over an 18-year period.

The Met Police has now said a total of 1,633 cases involving 1,071 officers and staff are set to be reviewed.

The force said that accusations ranging from arguments to the most serious sexual crimes from the last 10 years are being checked to make sure that the appropriate decisions were made.

Scotland Yard added that most officers whose cases are reviewed will remain on duty without being subject to restrictions while the inquiries are carried out.

A spokesman said: ""In the event that information was to emerge from a review that raised concerns then an officer or member of staff's status would be reconsidered without delay.

""All new allegations against officers and staff are subject to robust risk management including restrictions and suspension where appropriate.""

It comes after Downing Street said Carrick's crimes were ""appalling"" and urged forces to root out criminal officers ""to restore the public's trust which has been shattered"".

Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force had ""failed"" and Carrick ""should not have been a police officer"".

The force has apologised after it emerged Carrick came to the attention of officers over nine previous incidents, including claims of rape and domestic violence - but faced no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings over those allegations.

Image: David Carrick joined the Met Police in 2001 - his offences were branded 'absolutely abhorrent'

Carrick joined the Met in August 2001 after serving with the Army and worked with the force's parliamentary and diplomatic command from 2009.

The armed officer, whose role included policing parliamentary, government and diplomatic premises, was only suspended after a second rape complaint was made against him in October 2021.

The Met said Carrick was vetted in 2001 and again in 2017, and passed on both occasions.

The court heard that Carrick met some of his victims through online dating sites, such as Tinder and Badoo, or during social occasions - and used his position as a police officer to gain their trust.

The 48-year-old admitted raping nine of the women, some on multiple occasions over months or years, with many of those attacks involving violence that would have left them physically injured.

Some victims were locked in a small cupboard under the stairs in his Hertfordshire home for hours without food or forced to clean his house naked.

Carrick whipped one woman with a belt, urinated on some of his victims, and told them when they could eat and sleep.

He called women ""fat and lazy"" or his ""slave"" as he controlled them financially, isolated them from friends and family, and forbade them from speaking with other men or even their own children.

Avon and Somerset Police received more than 100 reports of road-related incidents in the space of just five hours last night - with treacherous conditions causing most of them.

Between 6pm and 11pm, a total of 53 collisions were reported to the force, and seven of these incidents reportedly resulted in injuries.

While work is underway to properly grit roads ahead of this morning's rush hour, Superintendent Mark Runacres said: ""If travel is necessary, we ask the public to take extreme caution and allow additional time to travel.

""We have seen a significantly higher number of road-related collisions and incidents in the past 12 hours, which has increased the demand on police resources.""

Yesterday, the UK Health Security Agency issued a level three cold alert in response to ""severe winter weather"" - and according to the Met Office, the whole of England will continue to experience low temperatures until 9am on Friday.

A yellow warning for ice is in place across southern England until 10am today - with an additional yellow warning for snow in force across Devon and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, a yellow warning for snow and ice across Northern Ireland, North West England and Wales will expire at 12pm - and in Scotland at 9am.

Speaking ahead of his departure, Mr Cleverly said: ""The UK, US and Canada always have each other's backs when it counts, protecting the rules-based order for nearly 80 years.""

He continued: ""Today we stand united against Putin's illegal war, and we will continue to use our uniquely strong defence and security ties to ensure that, in the end, the Ukrainian people will win.""

He will deliver a keynote speech at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, at which he is set to outline Britain's foreign policy priorities before talks with his US counterpart Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The two will then hold a joint news conference.

On Monday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that British tanks, artillery pieces and armoured vehicles are to be sent to Ukraine.

Mr Cleverly is set to use this British pledge to persuade the Americans and the Canadians to follow the UK's lead. He is expected to stress the need for the right battlefield tools to be given to the Ukrainians quickly to allow them to win the war.

The Americans have delivered billions of dollars worth of weaponry to Ukraine over the past 11 months, but only in carefully managed tranches with limited capability for fear of provoking Russia.

Brink's is a private security company which offers cash transportation services.

The security worker was about to make a money drop at a Chase Bank branch in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, when he was approached by the robbers at about 1pm on 6 January.

Train drivers' union rejects pay offer and members will go ahead with fresh strike action;Tuesday 17 January 2023 10:08, UK;[];[];"Train drivers are to strike on 1 and 3 February after their union rejected a pay offer, Aslef announced.

The conditional two-year pay offer worth 8% to the Aslef union - made in the first week of January - by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) on behalf of operators included a 4% pay rise for 2022 and a further 4% increase covering 2023.

""If accepted, the proposal would mean the base salary for the average driver would increase from £60,000, to almost £65,000 by the end of 2023"", the RDG had said.

The conditions attached to the proposed hikes included new Sunday working arrangements but also promised no compulsory redundancies until April 2024.

A statement had said: ""The offer is contingent on common sense, vital and long overdue changes to working arrangements across the industry.

""Many of these are already best practice in parts of the railway and are designed to avoid disruptive gaps in services.""

The offer was made amid a separate, and more lengthy dispute, between Network Rail and train operators involving the RMT union which had already rejected a similar offer to resolve their pay fight.

Government and the industry has argued that any settlement must be affordable in the new reality facing the railways - with passenger numbers still well below their pre-pandemic peaks.

Rishi Sunak bows to pressure from Tory MPs as Michelle Donelan makes deal to toughen up Online Safety Bill;Tuesday 17 January 2023 11:04, UK;[];[];"Rishi Sunak appears to have bowed to pressure from rebel Tory MPs to make social media bosses criminally liable for failing to protect children from online harm.

The prime minister was facing a major backbench rebellion as around 50 of his MPs put their names to an amendment to the Online Safety Bill.

The amendment called for tougher punishments for tech chiefs who fail to block children from seeing damaging content on their platforms.

Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan has reached a deal with rebels after talks over the weekend, according to a source close to her, allowing the prime minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.

The source suggested Ms Donelan likes the intention of the amendment, but the wording ""wasn't quite right"".

It is understood the rebels have dropped the amendment before its return to the Commons later today - and the culture secretary is working with them to table it in the House of Lords ""in a more workable format"".

The move to appease the rebels marks the third time Mr Sunak has backed down in the face of uprisings on his backbenches since entering Number 10 in October, having ditched onshore wind farms and planning reforms intended to boost housebuilding.

Former cabinet ministers, including ex-home secretary Priti Patel and former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, are among those backing the change to the Online Safety Bill.

With Labour supporting it too, failure to find a compromise would have seen Mr Sunak on course for his first major defeat in the Commons.

A government source told Sky News: ""Michelle's main priority has always been strengthening the protections for children online, whilst ensuring adults have more choice and control over what they see.

""She has been clear from the beginning that any additions to the Online Safety Bill need to work in practice and that she would take a pragmatic and common sense approach prioritising children.

""She is pleased that colleagues will no longer be pushing their amendments to a vote following constructive conversation and work.""

The rebel amendment suggested introducing a new clause into the Online Safety Bill to ""make it an offence for the provider of a user-to-service not to comply with the safety duties protecting children"" which are set out in the draft law.

In its current form, the new internet safety law would require tech companies to remove illegal material from their platforms, with a particular emphasis on protecting children from seeing harmful content.

Social media platforms and other user-generated, content-based sites that break the rules would face large fines from the sector's new regulator, Ofcom.

But the proposed law would only have held tech bosses liable for failing to give information to the watchdog.

Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig said: ""The government has confirmed a major climbdown in the face of a threatened rebellion which could have lead to a government defeat on the Online Safety Bill.

""On the eve of a big showdown, in which up to 50 Tory MPs were threatening to vote against the government, the government has pledged to not accept the amendment put down by the rebels, but to bring it back in the Lords.

""The government has backed down because it would have potentially lost the vote.""

Current protection 'weak'

Sir Iain Duncan Smith had said the proposed protection offered by the draft legislation was ""weak"" and children needed greater safeguards against seeing ""extreme pornography"" and material about suicide.

Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said that Labour want the regulator to have ""sufficient teeth"" to make Silicon Valley bosses ""sit up and take notice"".

The NSPCC has been helping drive a campaign to have managers made criminally responsible for failing to offer protection to youngsters.

Richard Collard, associate head of child safety online policy at the children's charity, said: ""By committing to senior manager liability, the culture secretary has sent a strong and welcome signal that she will give the Online Safety Bill the teeth needed to drive a culture change within the heart of tech companies that will help protect children from future tragedies.

""The government has rightly listened to the concerns raised by MPs and we look forward to working with ministers to ensure the final legislation holds senior managers accountable in practice if their products continue to put children at risk of preventable harm and sexual abuse.""

Ian Russell, the father of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who died by self-harm while suffering ""negative effects of online content"", said the threat of imprisonment is ""the only thing"" that will make the bosses ""put safety near the top of their agenda"".

""I think that's a really important thing in terms of changing the corporate culture at these platforms,"" he told BBC Newsnight.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117120813/https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-bows-to-pressure-from-tory-mps-as-michelle-donelan-makes-deal-to-toughen-up-online-safety-bill-12788447;Category-2: business and economy
Britishvolt: UK battery start-up files to appoint administrators;Tuesday 17 January 2023 12:01, UK;[];[];"Battery start-up Britishvolt has filed to appoint administrators after failing to secure a buyer.

The group had been in talks with investors over a possible sale to keep the firm afloat but on Tuesday the company made an application for administration to the courts.

Britishvolt has been on the brink of collapse since £100m of promised government funding to build a planned battery gigafactory was delayed.

A source told Reuters news agency that the majority of Britishvolt staff will be made redundant. In November, Sky News understood that, at the time, Britishvolt employed 300 people.

The move will have implications for Britain's vehicle manufacturers, which experts say need battery factories to stop much of the country's car production from shifting to mainland Europe.

Downing Street issued a statement soon after the news was announced saying it was aware of the speculation but would not comment directly on the firm, saying ""we will await further updates from that specific company"".

The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We continue to take steps to ensure the UK remains one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing as we transition to electric vehicles.

""We are investing record sums in R and D including the recent announcement of £211 million into the Faraday battery challenge.""

But replying to a question from Labour's Darren Jones, the chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, a government minister was forced to state in Parliament that the government had not withdrawn any money from Britishvolt.

Kevin Hollinrake replied: ""Clearly taxpayers money is important. It's important that we dispense that money in a responsible way.

""There were clear milestones we expect anybody who's received public money to hit and we are looking at the situation very carefully to make sure they are.""

Private funding contingent on government cash

Britishvolt chief executive Graham Hoare told Sky News in November that staff agreed to a ""substantial"" temporary pay cut as it continued to weigh up its financial future.

The £3.8bn gigafactory project, in the Port of Blyth, Northumberland, was backed by £1.7bn of private funding. But the private finance was offered up on the condition that much of that sum would only be unlocked when the government aid was paid.

It is understood that, last year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) believed that the company had not met certain criteria for the £100m payment to be handed over, forcing it to seek cash elsewhere.

The company intended to manufacture power cells for 300,000 electric vehicle (EV) battery packs a year, eventually employing 3,000 people on the site of the former coal-fired Blyth Power Station.

Project praised by Boris Johnson

Britishvolt's ambitions were praised by former prime minister Boris Johnson, who said the factory will ""boost the production of electric vehicles in the UK"", and cement the country's place ""at the helm of the global green industrial revolution"".

But in October last year, Labour said the government was clearly to blame for the company's financial troubles.

Breakthrough laser beam used to successfully divert lightning strikes;Tuesday 17 January 2023 13:36, UK;[];[];"In a development that would look right at home in a sci-fi disaster film, researchers have developed a laser beam that can divert lightning.

Pointing skyward from the spectacular Mount Santis in northeastern Switzerland, the so-called laser lightning rod has been hailed by its creators as the biggest step in thunderstorm protection since Benjamin Franklin.

One of America's founding fathers, Franklin invented the lightning rod in 1752. Since then, the metal masts have remained the most effective form of protection.

But while a lightning rod is limited in how far its protection can reach by its height (for example, a 10 metre-high rod would cover a 10-metre radius), the laser-based solution promises to do the job for wider areas.

In findings published in the Nature Photonics journal, researchers reveal that their new mast managed to deflect four lightning strikes over several dozen metres - even in the most challenging weather.

The laser lightning rod - measuring 1.5 metres wide, eight metres long, and weighing more than three tonnes - was stationed at the very summit of Mount Santis, some 2,500m above sea level.

There sits a Swisscom telecommunications tower, which was equipped with a normal lightning rod.

Over the course of three months, from June to September 2021, researchers monitored the performance of the upgraded laser rod, which was activated every time storms were forecast to protect the tower.

Project coordinator Aurelien Houard, of France's Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee, said: ""The aim was to see whether there was a difference with or without the laser.

""We compared the data collected when the laser filament was produced above the tower - and when the tower was struck naturally by lightning.""

Other institutions involved in the research included the University of Geneva and the Munich-based specialist manufacturing TRUMPF, which designed the laser.

How does the laser lightning rod work?

A traditional lightning rod aims to attract lightning bolts and then guide the volts into the ground.

The laser lightning rod works to the same principle of guiding the bolt, but rather than via a metal pole, it does so by generating channels of ionised air using its laser beam.

This is when air molecules are electrically charged, and gives them a conductive quality like metal.

Study author Jean-Pierre Wolf, of the University of Geneva, explained: ""When very high power laser pulses are emitted into the atmosphere, filaments of very intense light form inside the beam.

""These filaments ionise nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air, which release electrons that are free to move. This ionised air, called plasma, becomes an electrical conductor.""

Image: Pic: Nature Photonics

What happens next?

It is hoped that the laser lightning rod could be used not just in its own right, but to extend upwards from a traditional mast and increase the size of the area it protects.

Professor Wolf said after almost a year of analysis, the team concluded the laser rod's beams could guide a bolt's discharge for nearly 60 metres before reaching the Swisscom tower - a dramatic increase in the protection area.

Long term, it could extend a 10m-high rod by 500 metres.

The scientists say it could change the way airports, launch sites, and other important infrastructure locations are protected from lightning strikes, which kill an estimated 24,000 people every year.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117134730/http://news.sky.com/story/breakthrough-laser-beam-used-to-successfully-divert-lightning-strikes-12788698;Category-6: science and technology

Britishvolt collapse should spark debate on whether it was actually needed;Tuesday 17 January 2023 14:23, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"The collapse into administration of Britishvolt will rekindle concerns for the long-term future of the British car-making industry.

The sector is under extreme pressure to pivot from making cars powered by the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs). To that end the UK government has decreed that, from 2030, no new petrol or diesel cars will be sold in the UK.

Central to that transition to EVs is the need for a number of new 'gigafactories' - plants that could produce electric car batteries at scale - and the Johnson government had targeted at least seven or eight of them.

The assumption among industry analysts is that, due to the weight of EV batteries and the expense of transporting them, they need to be located near to the carmakers. Hence the need to build them in the UK.

That need for local sourcing is amplified by 'rules of origin' provisions in the UK's Brexit deal with the EU which require that 70% of a battery must be built in either the UK or the EU for the EV it powers to be sold tariff-free in the bloc. Four in every five British-built cars are exported and just over half of them are sold to countries in the EU.

It is why Britishvolt was promised £100m from the Automotive Transformation Fund, the £850m taxpayer-backed programme aimed at supporting the electrification of Britain's automotive supply chain.

So the failure of Britishvolt will be seen as a severe setback to the country's ambitions for EVs. It casts doubt over what is one of only two gigafactories in the UK towards which meaningful progress was being made, the other being built at Sunderland by the Chinese battery maker Envision, which is partnering Nissan locally.

Yet some will argue it is premature to extrapolate Britishvolt's woes to wider prospects for gigafactories in the UK.

Britishvolt has been seemingly cursed from the off.

Its co-founder, Lars Carlstrom, left the company nearly three years ago after it emerged he had been convicted for tax offenses in his native Sweden. There was then confusion when the company announced its factory would not be in Bridgend in south Wales, as originally intended, but at Cambois near Blyth, in Northumberland, where it had been offered more attractive financial incentives to locate.

Image: The original South Wales site was selected on the basis of access to key markets and a skilled local workforce

In the meantime, the company continued to rack up costs, with the monthly salary bill for its 300 employees reported to be £3m.

Britishvolt then pushed back the planned start date for production to 2025, blaming Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pushing up costs, while a request for government support was made. It later emerged that management had put the company on what was described as 'life support' in July.

Then, in August last year, Mr Carlstrom's co-founder, Orral Nadjari, unexpectedly resigned.

The Guardian newspaper subsequently reported details of his extravagant spending, revealing that the company had leased a seven bedroom £2.8m mansion with a swimming pool and jacuzzi for executives, as well as hiring a Dubai-based fitness instructor to conduct yoga classes for staff remotely.

Graham Hoare, the respected former head of Ford of Britain, was hired in his place as an interim chief executive and, in November, the company secured an emergency lifeline from Glencore, the commodities trading and mining giant, which was one of its shareholders.

But at the heart of its problems was that it had never signed firm supply deals with carmakers sufficient to guarantee future revenues of the kind that potential investors would have wanted to see.

All it had were preliminary agreements with two luxury carmakers, Aston Martin and Lotus, to design batteries for their EVs.

Image: The future for the Blyth site hangs in the balance

Last week, the company said it was in talks to sell a majority stake in itself to a consortium of investors in order to secure its future, but those came to nothing.

Today brought the news, which had seemed increasingly inevitable, of administration.

That need not be the end of the story.

Britishvolt's main asset, the site at Cambois, is well-located close to a deep-water port and enjoys both good rail links and access to clean energy from Norway. It is highly likely to attract potential buyers.

India's Tata Motors, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has been suggested as a possible buyer although it is hard to see why it would want to own a site in Blyth when a site in Coventry, much closer to the bulk of its manufacturing facilities elsewhere in the West Midlands, remains possible for development.

Perhaps the bigger question - and concern - is how many car manufacturers will be in need of British-made EV batteries come the end of the decade.

Honda has already closed its plant at Swindon in Wiltshire while Stellantis, the Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen combine, is ending volume car production at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and converting production there to electric vans and cars whose battery cells will be sourced on mainland Europe.

Mini's owner, BMW, has confirmed the next generation of the model's electric version will be built not at Cowley in Oxfordshire but in China. And it is not yet clear from where the luxury British carmakers Rolls-Royce and Bentley, respectively owned by BMW and Volkswagen, intend to source their batteries as they switch to EV production. Nor are Toyota's intentions clear for its site at Burnaston in Derbyshire.

The biggest question of all concerns Jaguar Land Rover which, it seems, is likely to be relying on European production for at least some of the batteries powering its UK-built vehicles.

So perhaps the bigger worry is not the lack of gigafactories but whether they will actually needed amid declining output from British-based volume car producers.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117150227/http://news.sky.com/story/britishvolt-collapse-should-spark-debate-on-whether-it-was-actually-needed-12788736;Category-2: business and economy

Scientists simulated a nuclear explosion on a major city - and how you might hope to survive it;Tuesday 17 January 2023 16:19, UK;[];[];"Scientists have simulated what would happen if a nuclear bomb was dropped on a major city.

Whether you're close enough to be vaporised in an instant, or within range of possible radiation poisoning, there's no such thing as a good place to be if one goes off where you live.

But a new peer-reviewed study, published in Physics of Fluids by the American Institute of Physics, aimed to focus on the specific impact on people who manage to shelter indoors.

Using advanced computer modelling, researchers looked into how a nuclear blast from an intercontinental ballistic missile would sweep through buildings.

According to their results, while some would be destroyed, even being in a sturdy structure which might ultimately survive the bomb itself is not enough to avoid risk of serious injury.

The already significant blast waves can be exacerbated by tight spaces, as the air generated reflects off walls, bends round corners and bounces through the building at speeds strong enough to lift people into the air.

In the worst cases, it can produce a force equivalent to 18 times a human's body weight.

Blast's airspeeds 'a considerable hazard'

Research author Dimitris Drikakis, of the University of Nicosia, said: ""Before our study, the danger to people inside a concrete-reinforced building that withstands the blast wave was unclear.""

He added that the ""high airspeeds"" caused by a nuclear blast are a ""considerable hazard"", in addition to more established threats like the explosion itself and subsequent radiation.

There would only be a few seconds between the explosion and the arrival of the blast wave.

'Most dangerous' places to shelter indoors

The researchers highlighted three places of notable danger when sheltering indoors: windows, corridors and doors.

Ioannis Kokkinakis said these were the ""most dangerous, critical indoor locations to avoid"".

""People should stay away from these locations and immediately take shelter,"" he warned.

""Even in the front room facing the explosion, one can be safe from the high airspeeds if positioned at the corners of the wall facing the blast.""

The study's authors hope that understanding the impact of a nuclear explosion can help prevent injuries and guide rescue efforts, though they of course hope their advice will never be needed.

It comes after New York's authorities released a video telling locals how to survive a nuclear attack, stressing the importance of staying indoors and washing off any radioactive dust or ash.

The clip was released to bemusement and some alarm last summer, but officials stressed that it was not tied to any specific threats and was only meant to raise awareness.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117163207/http://news.sky.com/story/scientists-simulated-a-nuclear-explosion-on-a-major-city-and-how-you-might-hope-to-survive-it-12788636;Category-6: science and technology
Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe confirms interest in buying Manchester United;Tuesday 17 January 2023 17:31, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has confirmed his interest in buying Manchester United.

The 70-year-old's chemical firm Ineos announced it had formally lodged interest with the club's current owners, the Glazer family.

""We have formally put ourselves into the process,"" an Ineos spokesperson said.

There have been other expressions of interest, with Saudi and other money from the Middle East understood to be focused on the club.

Mr Ratcliffe, Britain's richest man, has made no secret of the fact he would be interested in buying the Old Trafford club.

He supported United as a boy and is understood to remain a fan.

Manchester United was seen as being put up for sale late last year when the Glazers, who have been at the helm for 17 years, ordered a strategic review.

Their tenure proved controversial with fans from the off because of the level of debt they placed on the club's books, a burden which many argue has hampered investment in the team and stadium ever since.

Ratcliffe was among bidders for Chelsea when its ownership came up for grabs after the start of Russia's war in Ukraine but his offer, of £4.25bn, was rejected under the sale process ordered by the government.

Gender reform bill pantomime is no laughing matter;Tuesday 17 January 2023 18:52, UK;['jon craig', '@joncraig'];[];"The inevitable Commons row over Rishi Sunak blocking the Scottish Gender Recognition Reform Bill quickly descended into a pantomime.

And not just because the SNP's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, and his MPs repeatedly mocked the Scotland secretary, calling him ""Baron Jack"".

That's a reference to widely reported claims that Alister Jack is on his way to the House of Lords, courtesy of a peerage from Boris Johnson.

But the Commons proceedings were also a pantomime at times because a 13-page legal document explaining the reasons for the veto, referred to several times by Mr Jack, was initially kept under wraps and withheld from MPs.

MPs clash over veto of controversial Scottish gender reform bill - politics latest

Even when Mr Flynn was about to open a two-hour emergency debate he'd secured on the gender row between Westminster and Holyrood, the document - ""statement of reasons"" - was nowhere to be seen.

A set of feeble excuses from Mr Jack about the delay and an even more feeble offer to email it to senior MPs only made matters worse. And at one point an exasperated Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, appeared poised to postpone the emergency debate.

Yes, that's right. Sir Lindsay was urged by some MPs to postpone a debate that was so urgent it was an emergency. You couldn't, as they say, make it up.

Eventually, Mr Jack's much-sought after document miraculously appeared on the government website. But that didn't bring an end to the pantomime. If anything, the farce got worse.

It was ""not worth the paper it's written on"", complained the SNP's former Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. It was ""a load of mince"", declared Kirsty Blackman. Undercooked mince as well, no doubt.

The SNP's veteran jester Pete Wishart said the document's claims were ""specious"" and ""hypothetical"".

He claimed the UK government seemed to be arguing that under the bill a man might change gender so that he could qualify for lower pay. Howls of laughter at that, not surprisingly.

But Mr Jack claimed the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was in conflict with UK equality laws and could have an impact on single sex clubs, schools, equal pay and even - according to the document - tax, benefits and state pensions.

The Tories' normally excitable Scottish leader, Douglas Ross, had a sensible suggestion, however. Surely, the Bill should simply be amended to protect the rights of women and girls in the rest of the UK.

Later, the Father of the House, the eminently sensible and wise Sir Peter Bottomley, called on Mr Jack and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, simply to get together and sort it out.

But with such bad blood between the Tories and the SNP, the chances of that happening are near zero. And that's why this pantomime is no laughing matter.

Nicola Sturgeon's opponents will claim she is relishing a confrontation with Rishi Sunak on this or any other issue to use as ammunition in her drive for a second independence referendum.

Some Tories also suspect that the new Holyrood gender legislation is not as popular with voters as the SNP would have us believe. Others argue that there are bigger issues than this to have a massive fight over.

Mr Sunak, we're learning fast, is not one to seek confrontations and would prefer to avoid one on this issue.

This week, after all, he has retreated from a Commons showdown with rebel Tory backbenchers on online safety, after similar climbdowns on onshore wind farms and planning rules.

So this issue looks certain to be fought out in the courts now. Mr Jack acknowledged that. That's right: another legal quagmire, to go along with the dispute over the legality of a second referendum.

In this row, the Scotland secretary is the pantomime villain, according to the SNP.

Concerns about government 'freeport' as dead marine life washes up on Teesside beaches;Tuesday 17 January 2023 18:20, UK;['tom clarke', '@atomclarke'];[];"Dead and dying marine life has been washing up on beaches around Teesside for almost a year after a ""mass-mortality event"" of crabs and lobsters there in the autumn of 2021, according to official documents and eyewitness reports seen by Sky News.

Scientists and local campaigners said the reports are evidence of a continued ecological disaster affecting more than 30 miles of coastline - from Hartlepool to Whitby and beyond.

""There have been ongoing die-offs,"" said Dr Gary Caldwell, a marine biologist at the University of Newcastle who has been studying the causes of the initial event in October 2021.

The incident led to the ""virtual extinction"" of crabs and lobsters in the area immediately around the Tees estuary, Dr Caldwell added.

There are concerns it could be connected to a ""freeport"" there. Freeports are areas where specific tax and customs rules can apply. The government says they are designed to ""create thousands of high-quality jobs in some of our most disadvantaged communities"".

According to the local authority, the Teesside freeport is the largest in the UK, covering 4,500 acres, and is predicted to create more than 18,000 jobs over the next five years.

Image: Marine life has been washing up dead

Almost 50 reports of dead fish, shellfish and marine mammals being stranded, as well as reports from fishermen of dead and dying catches, have been logged by the North East Fisheries Conservation Agency since December 2021.

Local campaigners have also photographed dead shellfish and seabirds found on beaches in numbers they say are not typical for the area. Fishermen have reported that catches in inshore waters have been much lower and include dead and dying lobsters.

Sharon Bell, who lives in the village of Marske-by-the-Sea, has been spotting dead marine life since 2021.

""There were literally thousands,"" she said. ""I couldn't estimate the figure, to be honest. We were walking on them, there was that many. Some were already dead, but the big majority of them were still alive.""

Hartlepool fisherman Paul Widdowfield commented: ""We may as well be putting our pots in the Sahara desert now because there's nothing out there.""

In May, a report by the environment department, DEFRA, and other government agencies concluded that a toxic algal bloom was the most likely cause of the mass mortality event.

However, research by Dr Caldwell and others, commissioned by a group representing the local fishing industry and campaigners, concluded that an industrial chemical called pyridine was a more plausible explanation.

Pyridine is known to be present in sediments in the Tees estuary following decades of industrial activity in the area.

Sampling studies of sediment in the Tees estuary, and lab tests of the chemical, suggest a strong potential link between disturbed sediment and harm to marine life, according to Dr Caldwell.

""We're seeing that legacy of Teesside's industrial heritage long buried in the sediment being brought back up and released back into the environment,"" he said.

The initial death of marine life occurred shortly after almost 150,000 tonnes of sediment was dredged from the mouth of the Tees estuary and dumped a few miles offshore.

A dredging operation of that size is unusual. Daily ""maintenance"" dredging to keep the Tees shipping channel clear tends to be on a smaller scale.

The potential link to contaminated sediments caused campaigners to raise concerns about ongoing dredging work to construct the freeport.

In addition, a dredging campaign at a nearby location in the estuary is currently moving 145,000 tonnes of sediment from the estuary and dumping it at sea.

Following pressure from activists and MPs, Defra convened an independent panel of experts to review the potential causes of the incident. It is due to publish its conclusions later this month.

For the time being, DEFRA is dismissing the proposed link between dredging, pyridine and dead marine life.

""A comprehensive investigation was conducted where government scientists considered the evidence robustly and concluded a naturally occurring algal bloom was the most likely cause,"" the department said in a statement.

According to DEFRA, 10 ""wash-ups"" of marine life on beaches in the area were investigated by the Environment Agency in 2022. One, it concluded, was caused by outfall from a nearby power station, while another was due to higher than average sea temperatures in the summer of 2022 followed by cold temperatures in December.

""Any wash-ups which followed the incidents between October and December 2021 were on a much smaller scale and in line with what would be expected during stormy winter months,"" it said.

Campaigners insist they are not trying to put a stop to continued development of the Tees estuary freeport.

""This didn't need to happen,"" said Hartlepool fisherman Stan Rennie.

He added that ""of course we want jobs"", but if the freeport is connected to recent events, it should not involve ""the sacrifice of the fishing industry and the ecosystem"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117190304/http://news.sky.com/story/concerns-about-government-freeport-as-dead-marine-life-washes-up-on-teesside-beaches-12788899;Category-3: environment
Microsoft to axe thousands of jobs in latest cull by tech giant;Tuesday 17 January 2023 18:39, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Microsoft is preparing to axe thousands of jobs in the latest move by one of the world’s biggest technology companies to reduce its workforce in the face of a slowing global economy.

Sky News has learnt that the US software giant could announce plans to cull a significant number of posts around the world within a matter of days.

Microsoft, which employs more than 220,000 people - including 6,000 in the UK - is said to be contemplating cutting roughly 5% of its workforce, which if accurate would equate to approximately 11,000 jobs.

That figure could not be verified on Tuesday evening, and one analyst suggested that Wall Street would be surprised if the figure was not higher than that.

It was also unclear whether or how many UK-based positions might be affected.

The company, which has placed huge bets on the growth of cloud computing and now has a market value of $1.78trn, is due to report second-quarter earnings next week.

If finalised, an announcement about headcount reductions is likely to come before Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, updates investors on its financial performance on January 24.

In recent weeks, a slew of large tech companies have wielded the axe, with Amazon disclosing plans earlier this month to cut 18,000 jobs - or about 6% of its workforce.

Salesforce, the cloud software provider, said it would cut 8,000 jobs, while Meta, the owner of Facebook, is reducing its workforce by approximately 11,000 roles.

Large technology companies have been forced to respond to signs of a global economic slowdown, with many having recruited tens of thousands of additional employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under the ownership of Elon Musk, Twitter has also moved to cut thousands of jobs, while 6,000 have also gone at the personal computer manufacturer HP.

Microsoft warned in October of a slowdown in its cloud computing business, an acknowledgement that major corporate customers were re-evaluating spending amid economic challenges.

""In a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind,"" Mr Nadella said in October.

Image: Satya Nadella

""In this environment, we're focused on helping our customers do more with less, while investing in secular growth areas and managing our cost structure in a disciplined way.""

The company has been transformed under Mr Nadella's leadership, although its earnings have been hampered by the strength of the dollar in recent quarters.

It is also fighting a battle with regulators to secure approval for a £56bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, the maker of Call of Duty.

Last month, it surprised investors by acquiring a £1.5bn stake in the owner of the London Stock Exchange as part of a long-term cloud computing partnership.

Microsoft expects to generate $5bn in revenue during the life of the alliance.

Ahead of its earnings next week, analysts at Guggenheim downgraded Microsoft's stock to a sell rating, arguing that the figures ""may disappoint investors"".

""While most investors see Microsoft as a large stable business that can weather any storm, it does have vulnerabilities, some of which could be exacerbated by this macro[economic] slowdown,"" they wrote.

Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a spokesman said Microsoft ""does not comment on rumour or speculation"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117190304/http://news.sky.com/story/microsoft-to-axe-thousands-of-jobs-in-latest-cull-by-tech-giant-12788916;Category-2: business and economy
David Carrick: Victim of serial rapist police officer describes months of physical and mental abuse;Tuesday 17 January 2023 18:49, UK;[];[];"A victim of serial rapist police officer David Carrick has told Sky News how he used his job as a firearms officer to gain her trust before subjecting her to months of physical and mental abuse, telling her: ""The safest place you can be is with me.""

This article contains details of abuse that some people may find distressing.

Speaking exclusively to Sky News, the woman said Carrick boasted about his job in the Metropolitan Police, but later went on to repeatedly rape and assault her over the course of their relationship.

The former firearms officer also shot the victim's young daughter with a BB gun, causing injuries ""because he said she was being naughty"", the woman said.

She said Carrick's controlling behaviour included him starving her and her daughter and placing several surveillance cameras around his home to track their movements while he was at work.

""He would only allow me to have two protein bars a day because he wanted me to be weak and he would watch us on the cameras while he was at work. His eyes were always on us,"" she said.

""Once I started eating a pack of blueberries, but he called me and went mad screaming 'what do you think you are doing?!'

""He said he could see me on the cameras eating something I shouldn't be.""

The victim said Carrick used to boast about protecting the Queen at Windsor Castle, US President Barack Obama on state visits and how he regularly used to protect prime ministers.

Carrick met the victim on a dating app and immediately said he was a police officer to gain her trust.

""At first, he was the dream man. He was so charming. But over time that changed. His eyes changed. He was evil.

""I have no idea how someone so f***** up can be a police officer, never mind give him a gun. If he shot anyone I wouldn't be surprised.""

The victim said she was introduced to his Met colleagues at a pub in London for off-duty drinks but wasn't allowed to talk.

""When I started to speak to his friends he would stop me,"" she said.

""He didn't want me talking to anyone. A couple of his colleagues reached out to me after that. A couple have been in touch since his arrest as well.""

The woman was one of many victims who lived with Carrick at his home during their relationship.

Shortly after moving in, Carrick bought permanent window shutters so no one would see in or out.

'He just told me to let him die'

The victim told Sky News: ""In the morning I wanted to get up and start working but he wouldn't let me. He closed the shutters and said I had to rest because of what he would do to me later. He said he wanted me to have energy.

""He was so manipulating - he knew what he was doing.""

Carrick repeatedly raped her over the course of several months, causing injuries, and urinated over her.

She added: ""After he raped me, he would say 'don't pretend you didn't want it as much as me'.

Image: Carrick will be sentenced in February after admitting 49 offences

""He was such a horrible person. He used to drink wine bottles at a time, saying work was stressing him. He said he hated foreigners.

""One time I wanted to see my friend dying in hospital of cancer and he just told me to let him die.""

The victim said she reached out to a local women's refuge but that it refused to help after hearing Carrick was a police officer.

She eventually ran away from the property when Carrick was at a wedding because it would be unlikely he would be monitoring the surveillance cameras.

Carrick tried to track her down after she escaped, but she managed to avoid him.

The woman came forward to police when she saw a press report that Carrick had been arrested for rape. ""I just burst out crying,"" she added.

Carrick pleaded guilty to 49 offences including rape, false imprisonment and possession of a weapon.

The victim's daughter said: ""I know this sounds weird, but I was angry when he pleaded guilty. I wanted to have the chance to tell my story.""

The pair are receiving trauma therapy but say they want to move on with their lives after Carrick is sentenced in early February.

Germany should 'follow UK's example' and send us tanks, Ukrainian deputy PM tells Sky News;Tuesday 17 January 2023 21:47, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Talk to enough of the delegates gathered here in the Swiss town of Davos and the impression you pick up is a palpable sense of relief.

They're relieved that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is finally meeting again - in person.

They're relieved that the global economy seems to have shaken off much of the impact of COVID and relieved that life seems almost to be returning to normal.

Except, say those in the Ukrainian delegation, this is precisely the wrong lesson to take.

They point out that barely a thousand miles from the chalets and hotels where the world's rich and influential are meeting, Europe is fighting its most serious war since 1945.

Image: The Swiss town of Davos, where the World Economic Forum is meeting

They point out that assuming the world is returning to normal is precisely the lesson the Russians want the West to take - that Vladimir Putin is banking on Europe getting tired of the economic sacrifices involved with waging financial war on the Kremlin.

They point out that there has rarely been another moment when they have been more in need of the West's help.

Davos is such an enormous event with so many varying strands of different activities, so many separate events and meetings and such a diverse guest list, that there is rarely a single narrative for each day, let alone the event as a whole.

Even so, this first day of the 2023 WEF was dominated, once again, by the war in Ukraine.

The very first address of the meetings came from the Ukrainian First Lady, Olena Zelenska, who said the delegates at Davos were not doing enough to help her country.

The country's deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, told Sky News that while she welcomed the UK's recent decision to send tanks to the country, she was hoping for more help from other nations.

She said: ""We are grateful for our partners and for the UK, who are among the countries that will provide us with heavy weapons - tanks, everything that we need to obtain the victory during this year.""

Asked about Germany, which has prevaricated over sending tanks to Ukraine, she added: ""I hope that they will make the right decision, and provide us with tanks. We hope that they will follow your example.""

The Ukraine conflict is not the only item on the agenda at the forum this year, but it, and its economic implications, including the energy price spikes which have fuelled a cost of living crisis throughout much of the world, dominate much of the discussion in this Swiss mountain town where the world's rich and influential meet.

However, according to one influential Putin critic, Bill Browder, the forum has conspired to make it tougher for campaigners like him to get their voices heard.

He had hoped to spend much of the week making the case that billions of pounds of frozen Russian money, held in central banks including the Bank of England, should be released and given to Ukraine to aid its defence and reconstruction.

However, he told Sky News that the forum had attempted to charge him $250,000 to be a formal delegate this year, meaning he has had to work from the sidelines of the event.

Ukraine war likely to 'go on for some time', warns US secretary of state Antony Blinken;Tuesday 17 January 2023 22:42, UK;[];[];"Russia's war in Ukraine is likely to ""go on for some time"" and now is the moment to ramp up military aid, the US secretary of state has said.

Antony Blinken said ""ferocious"" fighting continues along Ukraine's eastern front - but Western partners are determined to ""make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to regain what they have lost and to deal with the Russian aggression"".

Appearing at a news conference in Washington DC alongside James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, Mr Blinken also warned Russia will continue ""using energy to try and punish countries supporting Ukraine"".

""I anticipate that this will unfortunately go on for some time,"" Mr Blinken said.

""But we're determined together… to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to regain what they have lost and to deal with the Russian aggression. That hasn't changed.""

Mr Cleverly has travelled to Washington for talks on the war, and spoke alongside Mr Blinken in an attempt to encourage Western leaders to step up support.

Pointing to the UK's shipment of 14 tanks to Ukraine, Mr Cleverly said it is important to provide the ""right equipment at the right time"" so Kyiv can engage in the necessary type of fighting.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117225550/https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-likely-to-go-on-for-some-time-warns-us-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-12789114;Category-1: politics

Revealed: 12 steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting dementia;Wednesday 18 January 2023 02:00, UK;[];[];"People can take 12 steps to reduce their risk of getting dementia - and the vast majority of us are not doing enough to ward off the condition in later life, according to Alzheimer's Research UK.

The charity said it wanted to empower people to make choices to help reduce their odds of developing dementia, saying that it is the ""most feared consequence of ageing"".

Dementia is a syndrome, a group of related symptoms, associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning.

Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the majority of cases.

Some 40% of dementia cases are thought to be linked to lifestyle factors, which can be modified to reduce a person's risk.

Academics have called for brain health to be included as part of the NHS mid-life MOT - also known as the NHS Health Check - after a survey conducted on behalf of the charity found that just 2% of adults are doing their utmost to help their brains stay healthy.

This includes looking after their hearing, daily challenges to keep the brain active, socialising, keeping fit and eating a healthy diet.

Twelve top tips for reducing the risk of dementia include:

• Getting at least seven hours of sleep a night

Advertisement

• Regularly challenging the brain

• Looking after mental well-being

• Staying socially active

• Looking after your hearing

• Eating a balanced diet

• Staying physically active

• Quitting smoking

• Drinking responsibly

• Keeping a healthy level of cholesterol

• Maintaining healthy blood pressure

• Managing diabetes as well as possible

People of any age are encouraged to use the new Think Brain Health Check-In tool, though it is primarily aimed at people in their 40s and 50s.

Professor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said that only 30% of people know they can take action to reduce the risk of dementia in later life.

""There are some people who are (genetically) destined to develop dementia, but we know now that up to 40% of worldwide dementia risk is potentially modifiable,"" he said.

""And we now are developing a rational evidence base of at least 12 modifiable and potentially modifiable risk factors.

""It's vital that we do all that we can, as individuals and society, to reduce our risk.""

Meanwhile, a separate study has also shown that continuing education in younger life, avoiding traumatic head injury and reducing exposure to air pollution can also help reduce risk.

The new survey, conducted by YouGov on behalf of the charity, found that people are falling short in the steps they can perform themselves to reduce their risk.

The poll of 2,200 UK adults found that 35% of people said they have had concerns about their hearing, but more than half of those (59%) reported that they have not done anything about it.

Previous studies have found that people with hearing loss had a lower risk of mild cognitive impairment compared with people who do not tackle their hearing problems.

Meanwhile, the survey also found that only 31% of adults said they get at least seven hours of quality sleep each night.

Just over a quarter (27%) said they do activities to challenge their brain every day and only 30% said they meet physical activity guidelines each week.

However, the majority of people polled said that they speak to, or meet, friends, family or colleagues a number of times each week and most said they had recently had their blood pressure checked.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118023246/http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-12-steps-you-can-take-to-reduce-your-risk-of-getting-dementia-12789143;Category-7: health
Thousands of nurses beginning two-day strike - and walkout will be much bigger than last month;Wednesday 18 January 2023 03:21, UK;[];[];"Thousands of nurses will go on strike today as a bitter pay dispute with the government continues.

Nursing staff from more than 55 NHS trusts will take part in industrial action on Wednesday and Thursday following two days of action in December.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has announced that two further, bigger strikes will be held next month, while the GMB union is expected to announce further ambulance worker strike dates this afternoon. Junior doctors are also preparing to walk out.

Thousands of operations and appointments are expected to be cancelled during the two consecutive days of strike action. Almost 30,000 needed to be rescheduled following December's nurse strikes.

Patients have been told to attend all their usual appointments unless they have been contacted.

NHS England said patients should use services ""wisely"" by going to NHS 111 online but continuing to call 999 in a life-threatening emergency.

The RCN has agreed to staff chemotherapy, emergency cancer services, dialysis, critical care units, neonatal and paediatric intensive care.

Some areas of mental health and learning disability and autism services are also exempt from the strike, while trusts will be told they can request staffing for specific clinical needs.

When it comes to adult A&E; and urgent care, nurses will work Christmas Day-style rotas.

RCN chief executive Pat Cullen said: ""Today's strike action by nursing staff is a modest escalation before a sharp increase in under three weeks from now... People aren't dying because nurses are striking. Nurses are striking because people are dying.""

The RCN has been calling for a pay rise at 5% above inflation, though it has said it will accept a lower offer.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said while he recognises the cost of living pressures on NHS staff, ""unaffordable pay rises"" will stoke inflation.

Writing in The Independent, he said: ""If we provide unaffordable pay rises to NHS staff, we will take billions of pounds away from where we need it most. Unaffordable pay hikes will mean cutting patient care and stoking the inflation that would make us all poorer.""

Separately, Mr Barclay has signalled that pay negotiations will look ahead to next year rather than reflecting on the 2022/23 pay award, which unions have said must be reviewed.

NHS trying to break 'vicious cycle'

The strike action comes as Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, urged ministers to renew pay talks with unions in a bid to halt further industrial action.

He suggested waiting lists are likely to remain stubbornly high unless the government gives the ""NHS a fighting chance"".

Mr Taylor also said continued strike action and winter pressures are jeopardising the ability of the NHS to break out of a ""vicious cycle"".

He added: ""We've been saying for weeks that the strike action couldn't have come at a more difficult time for the NHS, but we hoped a compromise would be reached by now to bring an end to the impasse.

""All the while this continues, the NHS won't be able to break out of the vicious cycle it's in.""

Majority of public think government is more to blame in pay row

Meanwhile, nearly three in five Britons think the government is more to blame for the ongoing pay row with nurses lasting so long, according to a new poll.

Some 57% of people said the government is more at fault for the length of the industrial dispute with nurses, compared with just 9% who said nurses are more at fault.

The Ipsos poll of 1,080 British adults, carried out earlier this month, also found that a quarter of people felt both sides are at fault.

Nurse says 'we want to provide care'

Matt Tacey, a 32-year-old nurse who lives in the East Midlands, has said he doesn't want to go strike today - but he, as well as fellow colleagues, have been ""forced"" into the position because ""the government just won't enter any meaningful negotiations with us as a union"".

""You won't find one single nurse that wants to be outside hospitals or places of work,"" he added.

""We are disappointed to be striking because it goes against the fundamental aspect of being a nurse - providing care - and we want to be able to provide care, we want to improve lives.

""To stand outside hospitals and not provide care goes against every grain in our DNA and it's going to be around three to four degrees tomorrow, so the government has literally left us out in the cold.""

Mr Tacey said patient safety needs to improved, and warned: ""The NHS isn't at breaking point, the NHS is broken.""

He went on to warn that some of his colleagues now need to pick up extra shifts ""just to get by"", adding: ""My wife and I often have to borrow money from parents just to see us through to the end of the month because current salaries are not covering the basic bills.

""We live in one of the richest countries in the world and yet people can't afford heating, they can't afford to put food on the table ... it's a national disgrace.""

Sewage plant attendants and Thames Barrier staff to strike

Meanwhile, thousands of Environment Agency staff across England will walk out today as they strike over pay for the first time.

Members of Unison including river inspectors, flood forecasting officers, coastal risk management officers, sewage plant attendants and staff at the Thames Barrier are among those escalating their industrial action after refusing to do voluntary overtime in the run up to and during the festive period.

Unison says there are severe staffing shortages across the whole of the Environment Agency, fuelled by pay issues.

'Schools may have to close'

It comes as Downing Street has warned that widespread strikes planned by teachers, train drivers and civil servants on 1 February could likely cause ""significant disruption"" to the public.

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), has said school leaders may have ""no choice"" but to close their doors to pupils during strikes.

The National Education Union (NEU) announced plans to hold seven days of walkouts in February and March in a dispute over pay.

Nine out of 10 teacher members of the NEU who voted in the ballot backed strike action, and the union passed the 50% ballot turnout required by law.

Billie Eilish says man broke into her house to profess his love - and requests a restraining order;Wednesday 18 January 2023 03:52, UK;[];[];"Billie Eilish has asked for a restraining order against a man who allegedly broke into her house and professed his love for her.

The 21-year-old global megastar said the alleged break-in - and five prior incidents she says involved the same man - had caused her ""substantial anxiety, fear and emotional distress"" over her safety and that of her family.

Eilish states in legal documents that the man, named Christopher Anderson, had also issued ""threats of violence"" against her.

The legal documents outline allegations that the 39-year-old had turned up ""unannounced and uninvited"" at Eilish's childhood home multiple times between late December and early January.

Eilish said Anderson had entered the property most recently on 5 January - ""apparently professing his love for me and expressing that he really wanted to meet me"".

The singer stated in the documents: ""I have viewed images of this individual and can confirm I have no idea who he is and that I have had no prior relationship or communication with him.""

She added: ""I worry that some day one of these individuals will do something violent or extremely disturbing to me or one of my family members.""

The restraining order requests protection for her mother and father, Maggie May Baird and Patrick Mead O'Connell, as well as her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell.

Eilish's request was submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118044702/http://news.sky.com/story/billie-eilish-says-man-broke-into-her-house-to-profess-his-love-and-requests-a-restraining-order-12789155;Category-5: entertainment and culture

Advanced battery plant in Oxfordshire to be opened later this year, creating up to 300 new jobs;Wednesday 18 January 2023 10:32, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Britain's battery sector has been delivered some unexpected good news, after an Australian billionaire told Sky News he will be opening an advanced battery plant in Oxfordshire later this year, creating up to 300 new jobs.

Andrew Forrest, the founder of the Australian iron ore giant Fortescue, said he was expanding operations at Williams Advanced Engineering, the technical offshoot of the famous Formula 1 team, which he bought last year.

The new plant in Kidlington will work on batteries and fuel cells which could be used in heavy goods vehicles in the coming decades.

The news comes barely 24 hours after the collapse of Britishvolt, the most prominent independent firm hoping to build a so-called gigafactory, mass producing batteries for electric cars manufactured in the UK.

While the Williams plant has a different focus - on high density batteries for large trucks, such as those used by mining companies - and while its output will be considerably lower than the promised levels of Britishvolt, the news will nonetheless reassure those worried that Britain's aspirations of developing an EV industry are doomed.

Speaking on the fringes of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Mr Forrest said: ""We invested heavily in British technology, British knowhow and British work ethic last year. But then we've said: 'Listen, it's great you've got the most advanced, innovative prototype batteries in the world… but we've got to get into manufacturing'.

""So last year, we started building a large factory in Kidlington. We'll open it in April. It will [create] hundreds and hundreds of new British jobs.

""And that's only the start. I want to expand it from there and I want to take that technology to Australia, to North America. I want to really stop the British brain drain and bring the smartest British engineers… home.

""These are batteries which are going to be everywhere: in motorbikes, cars, trucks, even even our huge mining trucks in Australia, even trains.""

The plant at Kidlington will produce up to 400MW/h per year of battery modules and fully assembled integrated power systems - so it cannot be considered a ""gigafactory"" (which produces more than a gigawatt-hour of cells each year).

Even so, these batteries are aimed at a different market, for higher density, higher performance batteries.

Williams Advanced Engineering hopes to build more of these manufacturing hubs around the world, following the blueprints of the facility in Oxfordshire. They also plan to build a new manufacturing and prototype test facility in the UK, which could create more new jobs.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118113411/http://news.sky.com/story/advanced-battery-plant-in-oxfordshire-to-be-opened-later-this-year-creating-up-to-300-new-jobs-12789274;Category-2: business and economy
Teenager convicted of murdering software engineer after row at Asda supermarket;Wednesday 18 January 2023 13:32, UK;[];[];"A 15-year-old has been found guilty of murdering software engineer Ian Kirwan, who was stabbed in the chest after a row at an Asda in Redditch.

Mr Kirwan, 53, was knifed in the heart by the youth, then aged 14, after challenging him for messing around in the supermarket's toilets on 8 March last year.

The killer, from Birmingham, travelled with a group of male friends by train to the Worcestershire town and subjected Mr Kirwan to a minute-long attack near the entrance of the Asda store.

The youth acted as a part of a masked gang which ""terrorised"" members of the public in Redditch.

Three other youths - two aged 14 and one aged 16 - were cleared of murder and manslaughter but jurors found them guilty of violent disorder.

A fifth boy, aged 16, was acquitted of murder, manslaughter and violent disorder, having claimed he was not involved in the fatal confrontation and could not have predicted it.

Why global investors are looking afresh at the UK stock market;Wednesday 18 January 2023 14:11, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"The new year is only three weeks old but already the FTSE 100, the best-known UK stock index, is already up by just under 5.5%.

That is better than the 0.9% growth it eked out for the whole of 2022.

And it seems possible that, at some point in coming sessions, the Footsie will challenge the intra-day record high of 7,903.5 that it hit on 22 May 2018.

The Footsie is not alone in having made an encouraging start to the year.

The S&P; 500, the most important of the big US stock indices, is up 4.4% so far this year and Japan's Nikkei 225 up by 4.2%. All of the main European stock indices, including Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40 and Italy's MIB, are each up by 9% or thereabouts.

It is all something of a turnaround from 2022.

The meagre 0.9% gain that the Footsie managed meant it was actually one of the best performers last year, with the S&P500; falling by 20%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing a third of its value and the DAX 40 declining by 12.4% and the CAC 40 by 9.5%.

And there are signs that global investors are looking afresh at the UK stock market.

The latest edition of the widely-followed monthly survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America Securities, published on Tuesday, found that a net 15% of fund managers are underweight in UK stocks.

That is obviously still a net negative position, of course, but represents the biggest allocation to UK equities since August last year.

So what's driving it?

Several factors. The first, of course, is that a rising tide lifts all boats. Investors everywhere have managed to convince themselves that the trajectory of interest rate rises by central banks around the world, most notably the US Federal Reserve, will slow this year now that inflation appears to have peaked in most developed economies.

Inflation in the US in December was 6.5% and in Germany it was 9.6%, while even in the UK, where it was higher at 10.7%, it is heading in the right direction having now fallen to 10.5%.

The proportion of investors expecting a recession in the US this year has fallen slightly in recent weeks and some even now expect the Fed to be cutting interest rates later this year.

Image: The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to ease its pace of rate tightening

In the UK, although the Bank of England is expected to raise its main policy rate from 3.5% to 4% when the monetary policy committee next meets on 2 February, market expectations of the so-called 'terminal rate' - when Bank Rate peaks in the current rate-hiking cycle - have fallen sharply since the chaos of Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget in September last year.

Then, Bank Rate was expected to peak at around 6%, but it is now seen as peaking at around 4.4%. That is clearly positive for the economy and, by extension, for the main driver for the stock market - company earnings.

The fact that the UK is unlikely to have fallen into recession in the second half of last year, contrary to the expectations of the Office for Budget Responsibility, among others, will also have lifted sentiment, even though it must always be remembered that the Footsie is a big global index and not especially focused on the UK economy.

Now it is perfectly possible that the markets are getting ahead of themselves - most economists still have, as their base case, a recession in the US this year - but, for now, that sunnier outlook is supporting equity markets in most countries, including the Footsie.

The second factor is the composition of the Footsie. One reason it outperformed its international peers last year was its make-up. The Footsie has comparatively few tech companies among its members and, as that was the most beaten-up sector last year, meant it avoided the shellacking handed out to, for example, the Nasdaq.

Instead, the Footsie is teeming with big oil and mining companies, all of which benefited last year on the back of rampant inflation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Shell and BP are respectively the second and sixth largest companies in the index while Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American are respectively the fifth, eighth and eleventh largest. Glencore, for example, is up by 39% over the last year and Rio by nearly 16%.

Image: The improving outlook for Western and the Chinese economies has helped FTSE 100 miners recover ground

The Footsie in addition has a number of big companies which, in the jargon, are 'defensive' - in other words, their earnings tend to be relatively stable whatever the economic weather, meaning their share price tends to underperform when the market is on a tear but tends to outperform during downturns and recessions.

Pharmaceutical stocks are generally regarded along these lines and again, the Footsie has two big ones in AstraZeneca and GSK, respectively the first and tenth largest companies in the index - although there is a case for now saying AZ in particular deserves to be regarded as more than just a defensive stock.

Its share price is up 32% over the last 12 months. Another good example is the tobacco sector and here, the Footsie includes both British American Tobacco, the world's second biggest quoted tobacco company and the ninth biggest in the index, along with the smaller Imperial Brands, whose share prices is up 17% over the last year.

Banking stocks always benefit in a rising interest rate environment and, again, these have strong representation in the Footsie with the likes of Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds, Standard Chartered and HSBC, the third biggest company in the index.

A third factor is valuation. Along with many of its continental European peers, the FTSE-100 is comparatively cheaply rated when set against American counterparts using the most common yardstick, the price/earnings ratio. The Footsie is currently trading on a trailing PE ratio of 11.8 times - the historic average is around 15 times - compared with 14.3 for the DAX, 19.25 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 20 for the S&P; 500. That reflects the long-standing dislike of international investors towards the UK stock market that, if anything, intensified following the Brexit vote.

A fourth factor is the weak pound. Despite a rally during the fourth quarter of 2022, sterling remains 9% lower against the US dollar than it was this time last year and 5% lower against the euro. The Footsie's membership derives around three-quarters of its earnings from outside the UK and in particular from the US and the eurozone.

Image: The weaker pound has flattered overseas earnings for FTSE 100 constituents headquartered in the UK

A weaker pound means those international earnings are automatically flattered when translated back into sterling.

Another way of looking at it is that, when listed in a cheap currency like sterling, big UK dollar earners (even world beating companies like Diageo, Unilever and Relx) represent a comparatively cheap way of buying into a flow of dollar earnings for US investors - especially in the case of those companies, like the oil majors, who pay their dividends in dollars.

It also makes UK stocks comparatively cheap to would-be buyers. The bargain basement valuation of many UK companies means that, while the cost of debt financing has obviously risen, they will be high on the shopping list of those overseas companies looking to carry out mergers and acquisitions. That is certainly borne out by conversations with investment bankers and asset managers.

Now it is perfectly possible, given the deteriorating outlook for the global economy, that corporate earnings will suffer this year and that this is being overlooked by investors despite the comparatively lowly valuation of the FTSE 100.

However, given the current optimism in equity markets everywhere, it would be no surprise to see the Footsie hitting a new record in coming days or weeks.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118143231/http://news.sky.com/story/why-global-investors-are-looking-afresh-at-the-uk-stock-market-12789475;Category-2: business and economy

Windfall tax blamed as North Sea's biggest oil and gas producer plans job cuts;Wednesday 18 January 2023 15:29, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Major North Sea oil and gas operator Harbour Energy has revealed plans for job cuts, blaming the impact of the government's windfall tax on profits.

A spokesperson for Harbour, the biggest offshore producer in UK waters, said the job losses would impact its head office functions in Aberdeen.

They added that staff had been informed of the plans but the extent of the cuts were yet to be decided.

The final proposals would be subject to consultation, the spokesperson added.

It marked an escalation in the company's response to the rise in the levy on energy profits revealed in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement last November.

It took the rate to 35% from 25% as the government sought to recover some of the cost of its energy bill support for households and businesses.

The effective tax rate stands at 75% because of the 40% corporation tax charge already applied but some investment relief is granted under the levy.

Image: Aberdeen is home to much of the North Sea oil industry

Despite that, Harbour announced in December that it would review its capital allocation plans and shun an oil and gas licensing round in the North Sea.

The company said at the time that it would focus on growth opportunities within its existing portfolio.

Oil and gas giants including Shell and BP suffered tens of billions in losses when the COVID pandemic struck as raw energy prices stood at lows not seen in modern times.

But as economies slowly got back in gear, and with demand outstripping supply, prices recovered.

Wholesale gas costs, however, later hit record levels and were kept high as supplies were squeezed amid Russia's war in Ukraine and the subsequent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its invasion.

The record profits enjoyed by big oil and the like placed a target on their backs, with countries, including the UK, imposing windfall taxes to try and offset some of the pain being inflicted on households and businesses from record bills.

Mr Hunt also introduced a 45% levy on electricity generators.

She added: ""Today I felt like I couldn't hide away anymore. I'm already starting to show and the anxiety I have felt has been unreal. Telling the world means I have to accept we are having another baby and this fills me with all kinds of emotions.

""I'm scared every single day that I might have to go through the pain of losing another baby. It makes you feel ungrateful for something you've so desperately wanted for the last year.

""But I also know there are going to be so many people, like I was, seeing my post and wishing I would go away with my happy ending.

FA criticises finding that sacked Crawley manager John Yems was 'not a conscious racist';Wednesday 18 January 2023 17:36, UK;['rob harris', '@robharris'];[];"The Football Association has criticised its own independent regulatory panel's verdict that a manager was ""not a conscious racist"" despite being found to have referred to his players' ethnic origin and colour.

John Yems was banned from football until June 2024 after being found guilty of 11 offences and admitting to one charge for the offensive comments between 2019 and 2022 while managing League Two club Crawley Town.

The commission found four others to be unproven against Yems, who the FA wanted to be banned for two years.

The FA told Sky News: ""We had requested a longer ban. Based on the evidence presented to the commission, we don't agree that the panel should have found that this was not a case of conscious racism.""

The FA has not said if it would appeal against the findings of the panel, which was led by Robert Englehart KC and featured Wolverhampton club secretary Matt Wild and former Sheffield United player Tony Agana.

Their verdict said: ""We regard this as an extremely serious case. We have accepted that Mr Yems is not a conscious racist.

""If he were, an extremely lengthy, even permanent, suspension would be appropriate.""

Football's anti-racism body, Kick It Out, said the findings set a ""dangerous precedent"" by allowing a perpetrator to claim harmful language was ""banter"".

Royal warrant-holder Hunter Boot steps into new funding talks;Wednesday 18 January 2023 18:26, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Hunter Boot, the royal warrant-holding footwear brand, is on the march towards a fresh injection of funding nearly three years after it was rescued from the brink of oblivion.

Sky News understands that the owners of Hunter, whose boots have frequently been spotted on the feet of festival-going celebrities, have begun working with advisers on plans to secure new capital.

City sources said the company was using AlixPartners to run an accelerated sale process with the objective of securing a deal in the coming weeks.

Alternative outcomes if a transaction cannot be struck were unclear on Wednesday.

Hunter, which was founded in 1856 as the North British Rubber Company, is understood to have seen a post-COVID rebound in sales, with revenue in China accounting for a chunk of that recent growth.

The company was saved in 2020 through a £16.5m capital injection, part of which came from Pall Mall Legacy, a fund backed by Goldman Sachs and Three Hills Capital Partners, an existing shareholder.

Pall Mall Legacy owns the majority of Hunter's shares, with Searchlight Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and Pentland Group, the sportswear giant behind brands such as Speedo, holding the remainder.

It was unclear how much new funding was being sought as part of the process being run by AlixPartners.

Hunter is one of Britain's most prominent footwear brands, and is one of only ten companies to hold two royal warrants - one of which was issued by Queen Elizabeth II.

It registered record sales in 2018, but saw its US business experience sharp sales declines in the final quarter of last year before being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cancellation of live entertainment events and music festivals such as Glastonbury has had a particularly severe impact on Hunter, which has long-been associated with celebrities such as Kate Moss, the model.

Hunter was traditionally dominated by sales of Wellington boots, but has increasingly diversified into a broader array of lifestyle products.

It has exited its retail store portfolio such as its former flagship on London's Regent Street with the exception of a site at Bicester Village and Woodbury in New York.

A source close to the business said it was seeing sales in China double each year, with the rest of Asia also showing strong growth.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118190359/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-warrant-holder-hunter-boot-steps-into-new-funding-talks-12789615;Category-2: business and economy

Elon Musk's 'lies' about Tesla on Twitter cost investors millions, court told;Thursday 19 January 2023 04:17, UK;[];[];"Elon Musk ""lied"" when he claimed he had ""secured"" funding to take Tesla private, a lawyer for investors has told a court.

The company's chief executive wrote in 2018 that he had ""secured"" funding to take the electric carmaker private and later that investor backing was ""confirmed"", causing shares to fall and then to soar.

Less than three weeks later, Musk backtracked on the plans.

Tesla investor Glen Littleton is seeking damages on behalf of shareholders who bought or sold stock in the days after the tweets, claiming Musk's tweets cost them ""millions"".

However, a lawyer for Musk argued in court that the billionaire merely used the ""wrong words"" when he tweeted about his plans.

During opening statements, Nicholas Porritt, lead attorney for the investors, told a jury in San Francisco that ""millions of dollars were lost when [Musk's] lies were exposed"".

But Alex Spiro, representing Musk, said the billionaire was ""serious"" about taking the company private in 2018, but ultimately encountered shareholder opposition.

""You will come to learn very soon that this was not fraud, not even close,"" he told jurors.

The lawyer did however tell the jury that Musk's Twitter post contained some ""technical inaccuracies"".

""In a rush, he used the wrong words,"" he told the court.

Littleton, giving his testimony to the court, said he had invested in Tesla in 2015.

He said after seeing Musk's ""funding secured"" post he had scrambled to unwind his Tesla options positions, which the tweet made unprofitable.

A jury of nine will decide whether Musk's tweets artificially inflated Tesla's share price by playing up the status of funding for the deal, and if so, by how much.

The trial will resume on Friday with an expert witness and might include Musk taking the stand.

The judge, Edward Chen, denied a request by Musk to have the case moved to Texas last week, with the billionaire expressing concern that potential jurors in California would be biased against him.

He cited negative media coverage of the thousands of jobs he has cut at Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, following his takeover of the social media platform last October.

The jury will be tasked with deciding whether Musk's tweets influenced investors, whether he acted knowingly, and whether damages should be awarded.

Judge Chen has already ruled that the statements the SpaceX owner made were untrue, but the defendants will argue that he had good reason to believe funding for taking Tesla private was secured.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119045419/http://news.sky.com/story/elon-musks-lies-about-tesla-on-twitter-cost-investors-millions-court-told-12789872;Category-2: business and economy
Premier League clubs dominate football's top money makers - but which team earned the most?;Thursday 19 January 2023 04:27, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Manchester City has topped a closely watched global revenue ranking for the second year running, with the wider Premier League taking ""the lion's share"" of the top spots globally for the first time.

The 26th edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, which determines the top 20 clubs for revenue during the 2021/22 season, showed Premier League sides taking 11 of the positions - up from 10 the year before.

The top 20 raked in a combined £7.8bn over the period, according to the research - a 13% rise on the previous season as matchday spending rebounded following the return of fans to stadia as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.

The table was led by Manchester City - the Premier League champions at the end of the 2021/22 season - with £619.1m in total revenue followed by Real Madrid on £604.5m.

Image: Liverpool moved up to third in the money league from seventh the previous season

The top three was completed by Liverpool, the biggest upwards mover on £594.3m - with Manchester United achieving £583.2m and Paris Saint-Germain £554m.

The other Premier League clubs to feature were Chelsea (£481.3m), Tottenham Hotspur (£442.8m), Arsenal (£367.1m), West Ham (£255.1m), Leicester City (£213.6m), Leeds (£189.2m), Everton (£181m) and Newcastle United (£179.8m).

The report was published against a backdrop of rising pressure on the Premier League to agree a new funding settlement with the lower-tier English Football League.

The EFL is pressing for a new regulator - as recommended by the Crouch review in 2021 - to ensure its members get fairer funding arrangements for the good of the wider game.

Tim Bridge, lead partner in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, said: ""For the first time, Premier League clubs fill the lion's share of positions in Deloitte's Football Money League.

""The question now is whether other leagues can close the gap, likely by driving the value of future international media rights, or if the Premier League will be virtually untouchable, in revenue terms.

""The Premier League was the only one of the 'big five' European leagues to experience an increase in its media rights value during its most recent rights sale process. It continues to appeal to millions of global followers and its member clubs have a greater revenue advantage over international rivals.

""Commercial partner, fan and investor interest in the Premier League appears higher than ever before.

""While this suggests optimism for further growth, continued calls for greater distribution of the financial wealth of English clubs across the football system and the impact of a cost of living crisis makes it all the more important for the game's stakeholders to keep a clear focus on their responsibility as stewards of leading clubs.""

The report was released against a backdrop of uncertainty over the future ownership of two of the top five clubs by revenue.

John Henry-led Fenway Sports Group and the Glazer family respectively are likely to have had their interest in a sale lubricated by the strong price achieved for Chelsea last year when Russian owner Roman Abramovich was forced to sell amid his country's invasion of Ukraine.

The Deloitte report also highlighted why there could be interest in Premier League club ownership more generally, with women's teams continuing to contribute more in terms of revenue year on year as its popularity increases.

There were 16 English clubs in the top 30 of the Money League.

Sports Business Group director Sam Boor added: ""The Premier League's financial superiority is unlikely to be challenged in the coming seasons.

""This is particularly apparent at a time when these clubs continue to attract international investment which often, in the best examples, encourages a focus on profitability, as well as on-pitch success.

Donald Trump plotting first tweet since ban was lifted - and he wants to return to Facebook, too;Thursday 19 January 2023 04:05, UK;[];[];"Donald Trump might start tweeting again soon, a confidante of the former president has revealed.

Advisers for his 2024 presidential campaign have been workshopping ideas for what his first post should be, according to NBC News.

Trump had been banned from Twitter in the aftermath of the Capitol riots - but was allowed back on the platform following Elon Musk's takeover.

A Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with Mr Trump about returning to the platform, said: ""Trump is probably coming back to Twitter. It's just a question of how and when.

""He's been talking about it for weeks, but Trump speaks for Trump, so it's anyone's guess what he'll do or say or when.""

The former president has also told Fox News that he is in talks with Meta about a possible return to Facebook and Instagram.

He said: ""We are talking to them, and we'll see how it all works out.

""If they took us back, it would help them greatly, and that's okay with me. But they need us more than we need them.""

Facebook said Trump's ban would be reviewed after two years when it was imposed in January 2021 - with that review date coming on 7 January 2023.

The social media giant said at the time the ban was imposed that Trump would only be allowed back on the platform if the ""risk to public safety"" had receded.

""We believe that the ban on President Trump's account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse,"" Mr Trump's campaign wrote in a letter to Meta on Tuesday, according to a copy reviewed by NBC News.

Trump's campaign didn't threaten a lawsuit, as some sources close to him thought he would.

It instead talked about the importance of free speech and petitioned Meta for a ""meeting to discuss President Trump's prompt reinstatement to the platform"".

A Meta spokesperson declined to comment about Mr Trump beyond saying the company ""will announce a decision in the coming weeks in line with the process we laid out"".

A Trump adviser who spoke to NBC News said his campaign believes Facebook will reinstate him.

House Democrats, including Adam Schiff of California, told Facebook last month to keep Trump off the platform.

Trump's plans to expand his social media footprint also speak to low reach of Truth Social - the platform he created to reach supporters.

The former US president has slightly more than 4.8 million followers on the platform, compared to nearly 88 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook.

Facebook was crucial to Trump's success in 2016, when his campaign used computer programming to tailor ads to viewers' data - called microtargeting - which helped him raise money with small-dollar donors and outmessage Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign.

An internal Facebook report found that Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads, compared to 66,000 for Clinton, according to Bloomberg News.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119045702/http://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-plotting-first-tweet-since-ban-was-lifted-and-he-wants-to-return-to-facebook-too-12789896;Category-6: science and technology

The remote place with a unique insight into a potentially perilous standoff between Taiwan and China;Thursday 19 January 2023 05:57, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];[];"We set off before dawn to drive to Taiwan's most southern point.

A remote, wind-swept place with a unique insight into a potentially perilous standoff playing out above.

Atop a blustery hill, you can see out across the water in three directions, the Pacific Ocean to the East, the Bashi Channel to the South and West across Taiwan Strait.

Our host is a former navy radar operator and radio enthusiast.

Robin Hsu comes to this spot almost every day with a car rigged up with homemade antenna and audio receivers.

He says it's the best place on the island to listen in to fighter jet activity.

There are plenty of mundane communications captured by his kit, the crew of nearby ships conversing for instance, and air traffic control directing commercial aircraft.

But others are extraordinary, and it didn't take long for us to hear some.

'You are jeopardising our safety'

A sudden, crackled but loud burst of sound through Robin's rigged up speakers is a voice in Mandarin, identifying itself as Taiwanese military with a clear direction to Chinese fighter jets.

""You have entered our South East ADIZ [Air defence identification Zone],"" it barks.

""You are jeopardising our safety, turn around and leave immediately.""

Just a few moments later, a similar message follows.

""This is usual,"" says Robin.

It is evidence that somewhere in the skies above, a Chinese fighter jet has approached Taiwanese airspace - crossing over what's known as the Median Line, the unofficial maritime border between the two.

Taiwan is a self-governing democracy that China sees as its own. Taking control of the island is a stated priority of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and these flights are part of a broader picture of heightened pressure.

Robin records interactions like this every day now and he says he's noticed a huge increase from when he first started doing this in 2020.

Number of Chinese jets making trips increased fivefold

Indeed, the statistics support his observations, the number of Chinese jets making these trips increased fivefold from 2020 to 2022.

And he has other recordings too, an American voice sending a warning to Chinese aircraft.

""I'm a United States military aircraft, conducting lawful military activity, in international airspace and exercises, as guaranteed by international law,"" it says.

""I'm operating with the duties, rights and duties of all states.""

Robin thinks the tone is sometimes intentionally mocking and provocative.

'Leave immediately'

And perhaps most intriguingly, he sometimes hears Chinese pilots too. The Chinese voices he says come from within the planes themselves and not from military command.

We hear one issuing a warning to US aircraft to not stray any closer to Chinese airspace.

""This is the PLA [People's Liberation Army] air force,"" it says. ""You have entered China's territorial airspace.""

And then, in English, a robust and clear: ""Leave immediately, leave immediately.""

""You can hear they are nervous,"" says Robin.

Premier Foods to shut Knighton factory, impacting 300 jobs;Thursday 19 January 2023 10:09, UK;[];[];"Premier Foods, the maker of Oxo stock cubes and Mr Kipling cakes, has announced plans to close a plant in the West Midlands, putting more than 300 jobs at risk.

Premier Foods said on Thursday morning that the site in Knighton, which straddles the border between England and Wales, had become unprofitable and would be shut by the middle of 2023.

The company is currently in negotiations with staff working at the factory, which predominantly makes powdered drinks.

The move will cost the business about £10m, Premier Foods said.

""It is recognised that this will be an unsettling time for those c.300 colleagues who are potentially affected by these proposals, and they will be fully supported and consulted with throughout the process,"" the company said in a statement.

The announcement comes on the back of successive quarters of strong financial results for the company.

In the final three months of 2022, Premier Foods saw group sales rise by 12% compared with the previous year, with grocery sales up by 17% and international sales up by 10%.

Before that, Premier Foods had enjoyed three successful years thanks to increased consumption during the pandemic, rewarding shareholders with a 20% increase in dividend payouts in 2022.

Alex Whitehouse, chief executive of Premier Foods, said: ""These results illustrate the continuing appeal of our portfolio of market-leading brands in such a challenging environment and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our branded growth model.

More babies born outside marriage or civil partnership for first time;Thursday 19 January 2023 12:21, UK;[];[];"More babies were born outside marriage or a civil partnership in England and Wales in 2021.

It is the first time that has happened since records began in 1845, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

There were 624,828 live births in 2021, it reported, of which 320,713 (51.3%) were registered to women who were not in a formally recognised relationship.

The figures reflect a long-term trend during which the number of marriages has declined while more couples have decided to cohabit instead.

Age makes a big difference, however. In 2021, new mothers aged 30 and over were almost twice as likely to be married or in a civil partnership (60.5%) than those under 30 (31.2%).

The average age of mothers increased to 30.9 in 2021, while the average age of fathers remained at 33.7.

The most popular date of birth was 23 September, while the least common was 26 December.

Coronavirus may have affected the statistics, the ONS said, causing ""delays in birth registrations"".

Birth registration services in England and Wales were ""temporarily suspended in March 2020"", it noted.

Births should normally be registered within 42 days, but in 2020, 42% of registrations came in after that time, while in 2021, 26% arrived after 42 days, the ONS said.

For that reason, it included ""all births up to 15 May 2022 in the 2021 dataset"", to ensure the stats were as ""complete as possible and comparable with previous years"".

Stillbirths were most common in women aged 40 and over, with a rate of 5.9 per 1,000 births, the ONS said.

That was followed by women aged under 20, at 5.0 stillbirths per 1,000 births.

The highest stillbirth rate was among babies from the black ethnic group, at 6.9 per 1,000 births.

Two retired Met Police officers charged with offences relating to child sex abuse images;Thursday 19 January 2023 15:19, UK;[];[];"Two retired Metropolitan Police officers have been charged with offences related to the possession of images showing child sex abuse as part of an investigation into a serving chief inspector who was found dead before he was charged.

Jack Addis, 63, of no fixed address and Jeremy Laxton, 62, from Lincolnshire, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 9 February.

Both left the Metropolitan Police more than a decade ago.

Addis is charged with conspiracy to distribute or show indecent images of children.

Laxton is charged with conspiracy to distribute or show indecent images of children, three counts of making indecent photos of a child, possession of prohibited images of a child, possession of extreme pornographic images and intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence (misconduct in public office).

The alleged offences took place between 1 January 2018 and 20 September 2021.

Laxton was arrested in September 2021 and Addis in November 2021.

In a statement, the Met said the charges followed a ""lengthy and complex"" investigation into Richard Watkinson, 49, who was a serving Met Chief Inspector for neighbourhoods policing at the West Area Command unit.

Watkinson was found dead in Buckinghamshire on 12 January - the day he was due to answer bail to be charged with conspiracy to distribute or show indecent images of children; three counts of making indecent photos of a child; voyeurism and two counts of misconduct in public office.

His death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. An inquest has been opened and adjourned.

Commander Jon Savell, in charge of the Met's professional standards team, said: ""Chief Inspector Watkinson was facing extremely serious and concerning charges, as the result of a painstaking and thorough police investigation.

""Before this matter came to light, we had no previous information about these allegations or to indicate the officer posed any risk to the public. He had not faced any other criminal or conduct matters during his Met career.

""He had been suspended from duty since his arrest.

Rishi Sunak defends using RAF jet to fly 41 minutes to Lancashire;Thursday 19 January 2023 16:02, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];[];"Rishi Sunak has defended using a small RAF jet to fly to Lancashire instead of using a train.

The prime minister flew on an RAF jet from Northolt in west London to Blackpool Airport after announcing the latest round of levelling up funding.

Labour accused Mr Sunak of ""jetting around the country on taxpayers' money like an A-list celeb"" and said it made a ""mockery"" of his environmental strategy.

The 41-minute flight came 10 days after he used the same plane to fly 36 minutes from London to Leeds.

Asked about flying instead of taking a train to Morecambe, where he was giving a speech, Mr Sunak said: ""I travel around so I can do lots of things in one day, I'm not travelling around just for my own enjoyment - although this is very enjoyable, of course.

""I'm travelling around so I can talk to people in Accrington this morning, then I've talked to you, then I'm going to get over to Hartlepool because I'm working on all of your behalves.

""Trust me, I'm working as hard as I can to deliver for you and I travel to make myself as effective as possible.""

Restorative justice: Should domestic abuse survivors meet their convicted ex-partners?;;[];[];"Very little research exists into the impact of restorative justice on the victim and the perpetrator for domestic violence cases.

But there is some evidence that shows it can have positive outcomes.

A 2013 study from the US found domestic violence offenders who went through the restorative justice process were 53% less likely to be reconvicted in the following two years.

In 1999, an Austrian study initially found that restorative justice sessions did not lead to perpetrators reforming their behaviour, but it had left victims feeling empowered. Researcher Christa Pelikan summed up her findings with a statement:

‘Men don’t get better, but women get stronger.'

Ten years later she followed up with a questionnaire to participants.

Of those who experienced no further violence from their partner, 80% said mediation had contributed to this.

In 2013, a review of studies into restorative justice found that these sessions had a larger effect on reducing violent crime than they did on crimes against property.

Victims reported higher satisfaction levels and were less likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress.

In 2001, the UK government spent £7m on a seven-year research programme into restorative justice. It found that the process has an 85% satisfaction rate for victims of all crime types.

The research also found that for every £1 spent on restorative justice sessions, on average £8 was saved by reducing reoffending over a two-year period.

In 2021, an inquiry into restorative justice in the UK stated that a national public awareness campaign was needed, as too few victims were made aware of the service.

The inquiry also called for an end to blanket bans in areas where restorative justice services were blocked for certain crimes, such as domestic violence.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119165908/https://news.sky.com/story/restorative-justice-should-domestic-abuse-survivors-meet-their-convicted-ex-partners-12790347;Category-7: health

Lloyds Pharmacy to close all Sainsbury's branches putting 2,000 jobs at risk;Thursday 19 January 2023 16:17, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Lloyds Pharmacy is to pull out of 237 in-store Sainsbury's branches, potentially putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk and exposing the financial pressure on UK pharmacies at the height of the NHS crisis.

Lloyds Pharmacy, which bought Sainsbury's 280-strong pharmacy network in 2015 in a deal worth £125m, said it would close the branches in the course of the year ""in response to changing market conditions"".

Individual branches will be put up for sale and the company said it was ""working with colleagues potentially affected by the changes and has underlined its commitment to support them through the process"". It did not say how many roles could be affected.

When its parent company Celesio bought the Sainsbury's pharmacy network, around 2,500 staff transferred to its employment.

Kevin Birch, chief executive of Lloyds Pharmacy, said: ""This decision has not been an easy one and we understand that our patients and customers may have questions about how the change will affect them.

""We would like to thank them for their continued support and assure them that we are committed to providing a smooth transition over the coming months.""

Lloyds Pharmacy operates about 10% of UK pharmacies but a number of its branches have been sold in recent months.

Its supermarket sites may be attractive to potential buyers and Boots, the UK's biggest pharmacy with 2,200 stores, is expected to examine sites in areas where it is under-represented. Given its scale, however, any wholesale purchase could face objections from regulators.

The Lloyds Pharmacy sale underlines the financial squeeze being felt by pharmacists even as ministers call on its resources to relieve pressure on NHS services.

The Department of Health wants pharmacists to expand their services to take some of the pressure off healthcare settings. During the pandemic, pharmacists were a crucial element of the vaccination programme.

The industry has argued that the latest pharmacy contract represents a real-terms cut in income because of the impact of inflation.

Image: An industry group warned that the move ""means significant reductions in access to a pharmacy for patients""

Figures published this month showed the industry had lost £1.6bn as a consequence of inflation since 2016, a trend the industry says threatens the future of thousands of community pharmacies.

The Pharmacists Defence Association said the Sainsbury's closures could adversely affect patients.

""We have seen many disposals of Lloyds Pharmacy branches over recent months and we know more may occur, however for every disposal there has been a buyer, therefore patients and communities have seen no reduction in availability, the pharmacy network has not lost capacity and there were no job losses,"" Mark Pitt, its assistant general secretary, said.

""This situation is different and means significant reductions in access to a pharmacy for patients and we expect those who represent communities to be concerned about the loss of a key part of their local NHS service.

""Forward-thinking governments around the UK are seeking to make greater use of pharmacies as the most accessible contact point in the NHS, to reduce pressure on other parts of the healthcare system, so there should be greater community pharmacy capacity, not less.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119165908/https://news.sky.com/story/lloyds-pharmacy-to-close-all-sainsburys-branches-putting-2-000-jobs-at-risk-12790310;Category-2: business and economy

Berlin asked for permission to send German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, Ben Wallace reveals;Thursday 19 January 2023 21:33, UK;['deborah haynes', '@haynesdeborah'];[];"A country that operates German-made Leopard tanks has asked for permission from Berlin to give the heavy armour to Ukraine, Britain's defence secretary has revealed.

Ben Wallace did not say which nation he was referring to but it is likely to be Poland, which has made clear it would like to send some of its Leopard 2 main battle tanks to support Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russia.

Pressure is mounting on Olaf Scholz's government to allow the Leopard, one of the world's most lethal and modern tanks, to be part of a new wave of increasingly powerful military aid to Kyiv ahead of what many believe will be a new escalation in the war.

Wagner Group chief 'hospitalises chef over bad tomatoes' - war latest

Germany holds the export licence so any country wanting to supply Ukraine with its own fleet of tanks needs to obtain permission from Berlin.

""My understanding is a formal request from a country has gone in today - I don't know any further details about who or what - and obviously that's the process that needs to be worked through,"" Mr Wallace told Sky News after holding talks with 10 other allies at a military base in Estonia.

Asked whether he thought Germany should say yes, Mr Wallace said: ""I want as many tanks to support the Ukrainian effort for 2023.

""There is no secret about that… If we are to get a message to the Kremlin that we are not giving up, that we are doubling down, tanks are part of that.""

The Lithuanian defence minister, who was also at the gathering, went one step further, telling the Reuters news agency that several countries would announce their intention to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine at a major meeting at a US air base in Germany on Friday.

""Some of the countries will definitely send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, that is for sure,"" Arvydas Anusauskas said about the pledges.

The UK became the first country this week to say it will send Western tanks to Ukraine, a landmark moment and a significant step-up in support.

'Scholz can't decide'

Britain is only sending 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks - enough to equip a squadron but not enough to make any significant impact on the direction of the war alone.

The hope had been to encourage Germany to follow suit, but Mr Scholz has yet to confirm a willingness to do so.

A senior European source told Sky News that the German armed forces understood the importance of tanks to Ukraine's fight, signalling that the obstacle appeared to be political.

""The German military... understands that you can't say that Ukraine has to win but not send tanks… But Scholz can't decide,"" the source said.

Mr Wallace said he agreed that the hardest battle in Ukraine is yet to come.

Image: The UK has sent Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine

""If last year was about defence and attrition of the Russian army this year is about demonstrating that Ukraine can push back Russia significantly and even further than it's already been pushed back,"" he said.

The defence secretary spoke to British soldiers deployed to the Tapa military base in Estonia with a detachment of Challenger 2 tanks as part of a NATO mission to deter Russian aggression towards the military alliance.

In service since 1994, the Challenger 2 tank weighs 62.5 tonnes and is armed with a 120mm rifled gun and a 7.62mm chain gun.

Stars are disappearing before our eyes - and faster than we thought;Thursday 19 January 2023 20:58, UK;[];[];"Stars are disappearing before our eyes at a faster rate than originally thought, with almost a third of people around the world now unable to see any at all, according to new research.

While the unaided human eye should be able to spot several thousand stars on a clear, dark night, our view of our home galaxy - the Milky Way - and dozens of intricate constellations is rapidly being lost.

Due to light pollution, it is estimated that 30% of people worldwide have been robbed of their nightly view.

The startling figure comes via analysis from a citizen science programme called Globe at Night, which published its findings in the journal Science.

NOIRLab, a US research centre for nighttime astronomy, runs the study, which projects that a child born today in a place where 250 stars are visible would only be able to see 100 by the time they turn 18.

Astronomer Connie Walker said the findings underscore ""the importance of redoubling our efforts"" to protect the nighttime sky from a phenomenon dubbed ""sky glow"".

What is sky glow?

Sky glow refers to the illumination of the night sky beyond that caused by natural sources, like stars or the moon.

It has long been known to be a problem, but Globe at Night's observations suggest it is increasing far more quickly than shown in satellite measurements of the Earth's brightness at night.

The study is based on crowdsourced reports from all over the world, with people submitting their findings online.

They are then shown a number of star maps and record which one best matches what they can see in the sky, providing an estimate of what's known as ""the naked eye limiting magnitude"".

This is a measure of how bright an object must be in order to be seen, and estimates the brightness of sky glow.

Globe at Night's findings are based on more than 50,000 observations submitted from Europe and North America between 2011 and 2022.

How the Earth looks different from space after 50 years

Why should we be concerned?

Light pollution doesn't just spoil the view of the sky, it can also impact our health - and that of wildlife.

This is because it disrupts the natural cyclical transition from sunlight to starlight that we and other organisms have evolved alongside - and sky glow is anything but natural.

Humans have generally had an awe-inspiring view of the starry night sky throughout history, but the path we are on now means that an ever-increasing number of people are losing out.

The loss of visible stars reported by Globe at Night indicates an increase in sky brightness of 9.6% per year over the past decade, much more than the 2% measured by satellites.

""This shows that existing satellites aren't sufficient to study how Earth's night is changing,"" said study lead author Christopher Kyba, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences.

And while the new findings are focused on the western world, the paper notes that the sky is likely brightening more quickly in developing countries, where the prevalence of artificial lighting is growing at a higher rate.

""The increase in sky glow over the past decade underscores the importance of redoubling our efforts and developing new strategies to protect dark skies,"" said Connie Walker.

""The Globe at Night dataset is indispensable in our ongoing evaluation of changes in sky glow, and we encourage everyone who can to get involved to help protect the starry night sky.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119235929/http://news.sky.com/story/stars-are-disappearing-before-our-eyes-and-faster-than-we-thought-12790026;Category-6: science and technology

Ukraine war: Wagner Group suffers heavy losses as their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, steps firmly into the spotlight;Friday 20 January 2023 16:16, UK;['diana magnay', '@dimagnaysky'];[];"The graves are all fresh. Row after row of them, almost identical. The same mound of sandy soil, the same black, red and yellow wreath mounted with a golden star.

The same wooden, orthodox cross to mark the grave, though there are some Muslim headstones too. Just the names and the dates on a small bronze plaque to distinguish the lives extinguished. None of them lived to a ripe old age.

This is a cemetery for Wagner mercenaries near Krasnodar in southern Russia. Krasnodar region is the Wagner Group's heartland. Their training ground is nearby in a village called Molkino.

There is a newly built chapel not far away which houses the urns of cremated fighters. And there is space available for still more graves in this cemetery, when the next wave of bodies come home.

Wagner is heavily involved in Russia's offensive around Bakhmut and Soledar in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Its fighters have died, Ukraine says, in their thousands.

Most likely the bulk of those were convicts, sent in to die like cannon fodder and be buried in a Wagner cemetery far from home. Perhaps after time in Russia's penal colonies they no longer had homes to speak of.

Image: The rows of graves of Wagner fighters are almost identical

""The area near Soledar is covered with corpses of the invaders… This is what madness looks like"", Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in one of his nightly addresses.

Russia claims to be in control of Soledar, a victory that Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declares as his own.

In the last few days he has also claimed to be behind the capture of the village of Klishchiivka about nine kilometres south of Bakhmut, though that has yet to be confirmed from the Ukrainian side. Russia's Ministry of Defence has been less gracious about Wagner's role but it has conceded that they played a role in capturing Soledar.

Live updates from Ukraine war

There are rumours, dismissed by the Kremlin as media speculation, that army boss Valery Gerasimov was brought in to replace Sergey Surovikin as head of Ukraine operations partly to keep Prigozhin in line.

Putting the top military commander in charge of Russia's ""special military operation"" could be interpreted as a way of reinforcing army hierarchy and reminding Prigozhin and his band of mercenaries who is ultimately in charge.

Prigozhin, who just a few months ago refused to confirm the well-known secret that he ran the Wagner Group and sued anyone who suggested otherwise, has come out in public all guns blazing. There is no longer a need for the ""regime of silence"", he said.

Image: Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin inspects body bags. Pic: Fan Media Agency

There are videos of him now in the salt mines around Bakhmut where US officials believe he has an eye on the mineral spoils.

There are videos of him handing out medals to his fighters. There are videos of him surveying piles of body bags behind the frontlines and attending funerals back home. He has not shied away from his losses, demanding the same burial rights for his men as for regular army soldiers.

He has shown himself willing to be a presence at the frontlines, quite the battleground commander, which is more than can be said for the ultimate commander-in-chief who, unlike Ukraine's president, has paid no visits to the front.

Prigozhin's PR team provide quick responses, purportedly from the man himself, to media questions. In a recent salvo, he takes aim at Kremlin bureaucrats who he says are longing for Russia to lose the war and for the US to start calling the shots in Russia. But the US ""won't take you in"", he writes to these supposed Kremlin traitors. ""And then you will come to us, where the Wagner sledgehammer will be waiting for you.""

Image: It is getting harder for the Wagner Group to recruit fighters after heavy losses

The sledgehammer is no idle threat. In November, video appeared purporting to show a Wagner mercenary bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer for defecting to Ukraine. When asked to comment, Prigozhin replied, ""a dog receives a dog's death"".

Later that month, a bloodied sledgehammer in a violin case was presented to the European Parliament as they debated declaring Russia a terrorist state, a sinister message from the group also known in Russia as ""The musicians"".

But losing that many men creates problems and the recruitment drive in Russia's prisons is reportedly drying up.

Paul Whelan, a US citizen (who also holds British citizenship) and was jailed in 2018 on espionage charges, told his brother David that Wagner recruiters had little luck the last time they came round his prison colony. ""Everyone else has a clear picture of what happens to prisoners who go to fight the Kremlin's war in Ukraine"", David Whelan wrote in his regular email updates. This time round, they reportedly managed to sign up just eight men, compared with 115 on the previous occasion.

Prigozhin is a powerful man. He is unashamedly critical of both Russia's senior military command and of the Kremlin elites though he does not say a bad word about Vladimir Putin.

Wagner has played a key role for years already as an unofficial arm of Russian foreign policy in Syria, Libya and other African countries.

Now in Ukraine, the group is out in the open. But Ukraine is a far bloodier battlefield and the fight more existential, both for the Wagner Group and for Putin's Russia, which has enabled men like Prigozhin, with his brutal, sledgehammer tradecraft, to flourish.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120173319/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-wagner-group-suffers-heavy-losses-as-their-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-steps-firmly-into-the-spotlight-12790830;Category-1: politics

Politics latest: Rishi Sunak given fixed penalty notice from Lancashire Police over seatbelt video;;[];[];"Analysis: Downing Street will hope it can move on from 'embarrassing' error

Downing Street will be hoping that once the PM has paid up, voters and journalists will move on and forget this rather embarrassing unforced error.

To Rishi Sunak's credit, he put his hands up and admitted the error almost immediately.

But it is a reminder that in the top job, with a permacrisis of strikes, NHS delays and high inflation, mistakes can slip through the Number 10 net.

Failing to wear a seatbelt is illegal, but filming it and publishing the evidence on social media suggests a lack of checks within the PM's team.

This is the second police fine Mr Sunak has received in nine months, after the Met Police punished him for attending a lockdown-busting birthday gathering for Boris Johnson.

In recent months Mr Sunak has struggled with contactless payments, had an awkward conversation with a homeless man about financial services, and demonstrated a fondness for using private jets to travel around the UK even for relatively short journeys.

Added together, such slip-ups may be exploited by the PM's enemies to claim he is out of touch.

There is certainly a danger these small missteps distract from Rishi Sunak’s attempts to stabilise the economy and sort out seemingly intractable issues like migrant crossings and delayed discharges.

Like many occupants of Number 11, Rishi Sunak was a 'submarine chancellor'. Invisible below the waves for months on end, he occasionally rose from the deep to launch a killer economic intervention: his ""whatever it takes"" COVID budget, the furlough scheme, Eat Out To Help Out.

But as Gordon Brown (the last politician to move from 11 to 10) found, similar manoeuvres are not possible as prime minister.

Pest controllers using facial recognition software to kill rats in people's homes;Saturday 21 January 2023 13:06, UK;[];[];"The world's biggest pest-control group is planning to eliminate rats through the use of facial recognition, with trials now taking place in people's homes.

The software - which Rentokil began developing 18 months ago alongside Vodafone - tracks rodents' habits to help decide how to kill them.

Following laboratory trials, which helped the software learn about the creatures, it has now been used in real-life settings.

Rentokil says rodents are thought to be responsible for more deaths than all the wars over the last 1,000 years.

Andy Ransom, chief executive, told the Financial Times: ""With facial recognition technology you can see that rat number one behaved differently from rat number three.

""And the technology will always identify which rat has come back, where are they feeding, where are they sleeping, who's causing the damage, which part of the building are they coming from, where are they getting into the building from, whether it's the same rodent that caused the problem last week.""

To develop the technology, Rentokil observed the rats in a controlled setting, with cameras monitoring behaviour and feeding this into the AI system.

This used machine learning to build the recognition capabilities.

It has since moved on to pilot programmes in customer's houses to test the technology, and while it remains at early stages, the company hopes it will make pest control more effective and efficient.

Chinese New Year 2023: How it is celebrated - and what the Year of the Rabbit signifies;Sunday 22 January 2023 02:43, UK;[];[];"Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, is celebrated over multiple days and marks the beginning of the coming 12 months on the traditional lunisolar calendar.

The occasion is observed by many people of Chinese descent and is also commemorated in other countries across Asia, including South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore.

Here, Sky News takes a look at this year's celebrations - and how it's significant.

What is this year's Zodiac animal?

Ending the year of the Water Tiger, which is seen as a symbol of strength, braveness and exorcising evils, the 2023 Lunar New Year is set to welcome the Year of the Rabbit.

The Rabbit is the fourth animal in the zodiac sequence of 12, and is seen as the luckiest.

People born in the year of the Rabbit are believed to be vigilant, witty, quick-minded and ingenious.

The animal is also said to signify mercy, elegance and beauty.

In the Chinese five-element theory, it is believed that each zodiac sign has one of the five elements: Metal, wood, water, fire or earth.

These elements rotate for each year on which the sign falls, meaning they come every 60 years.

This year is the Water Rabbit, which last came in 1903 and 1963.

There are five types of rabbit, each said to have different characteristics - and those associated with the Water Rabbit suggest believers in the Chinese lunisolar calendar who were born in those years may not be entirely pleased.

The traits linked to each of the rabbits are:

Water Rabbit: Gentle and amicable, but has a weak mindset

Wood Rabbit: Clever and quick-witted, but selfish

Fire Rabbit: Broad-minded, smart and flexible

Earth Rabbit: Straightforward, ambitious and hard-working

Metal Rabbit: Kind-hearted, lively and enthusiastic

When is the 2023 Lunar New Year?

The Year of the Tiger ends on 21 January and the Year of the Rabbit begins the following day, on 22 January.

How Chinese New Year celebrated?

One of the most important holidays in the Chinese calendar, the Lunar New Year kicks off a 15-day festival of celebrations in China and among Chinese communities around the world.

Commonly known in China as Spring Festival, people in the country get seven consecutive days off each year to mark the occasion.

During this period, there are a number of traditions.

Festivities get under way with a lion dance, in which performers mimic a lion's movements while in a lion costume - with the animal symbolising power, wisdom, and superiority.

The performers move with the rhythm of the beating of the drum, cymbals and gong. The loud sounds are intended to scare away evil spirits and welcome the lion to bring in good fortune.

A dragon dance is the highlight of the celebration in many areas, as the dragon is a symbol of good fortune.

Other traditions include people cleaning their homes thoroughly to rid the household of bad luck.

Some eat specially prepared foods on certain days during the celebrations, which are also supposed to bring good luck.

They include dumplings, which are often eaten on Chinese New Year's eve and symbolise wealth, and sweet rice balls - a symbol of family togetherness.

US gun violence: Two weeks of shootings data around the Uvalde attack shows the scale of the issue;;[];[];"Mecosta County, Michigan - 27 May

Within three days of Uvalde, 1,500 miles north, in Michigan, there was another mass shooting.

A domestic this time; a mother, Dawn Gillard, and her three children shot dead.

It made the local news but not much more because here in America events like this are unremarkable.

The frigid cold of Michigan feels a long way from Texas.

But in the second floor apartment of a block in a town on Lake Michigan I met a man whose words and grief and anger felt so similar to the pain I'd felt in Texas.

""Well, Dawn was a bright soul. I would say she always seemed to want to support other people. She's always been that person that would show up.""

""And her three children, Caitlyn, Ronald and Joshua… Yeah, I would say they were the sun in her life. They were what she was most proud of. Her kids.""

Randy Myers is Dawn's cousin.

He wouldn't mention by name the father of the three children - the man accused of the killings.

""There wouldn't be four family members dead, right? Without that gun.""

But, holding back tears, he wanted to talk about guns.

""I don't own a gun. I don't find a need for a gun. I feel pretty strongly that the guns in this country, it seems to be that we, as people, seem to utilise them as a crutch to deal with our mismanaged emotions,"" Randy said.

""It was a domestic violence situation. And so that, that was, that was his crutch. And if that gun wasn't there, maybe Dawn would have been injured… the outcome would have been different.""

Then a revelation which, for me, cut to the heart of the everyday banality of gun violence in America.

Randy explained how he had seen the story of the shooting online, hours before he was told about it, but took no notice. He hadn't realised it concerned his own family.

""I scrolled past that story... I stopped, I read the headline and I just kept scrolling. It didn't have her name or anything like that. And I just scrolled past it,"" he said, sobbing.

In our two-week snapshot, there were 30 mass shootings - defined as a shooting where four or more people are killed or injured, not including the gunman.

Brazil's new president sacks country's army chief following far-right uprising;Sunday 22 January 2023 12:34, UK;[];[];"Brazil's president has sacked the country's army chief over concerns the country's democracy is under threat following an uprising of far-right protesters.

The official website of the Brazilian armed forces said General Julio Cesar de Arruda had been removed as head of the army.

He has been replaced by General Tomas Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, who was head of the Southeast Military Command.

Around 1,500 people have been detained after the invasion of Brazil's congress, presidential palace and supreme court at the start of January.

Rioters were seeking military intervention to either restore the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro or oust the newly inaugurated leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, who won the election with just 50.9% of the votes.

Supporters of the former president stormed through government buildings and destroyed public property.

Mr Lula said several times in public that there were definitely people in the army who allowed the rioting to occur.

Similarities to 6 January 2021 Congress riots

The riot bore strong similarities to the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Congress by mobs who wanted to overturn former president Donald Trump's election loss to Joe Biden.

Mr Lula met defence minister Jose Mucio, chief of staff Rui Costa, and the new army commander in Brasilia later on Saturday.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Mucio said the 8 January riots had caused ""a fracture in the level of trust"" in the army's top levels and the government decided a change was needed.

Brazil's supreme court has now agreed to look at the ugly scenes, much as US politicians held an inquiry into Donald Trump's role in those in Washington.

Agreeing to a request by federal prosecutors, Justice Alexandre de Moraes stated: ""Public figures who continue to cowardly conspire against democracy trying to establish a state of exception will be held accountable.""

Labour calls for investigation into appointment process for BBC chair after Boris Johnson 'sleaze' allegations;Sunday 22 January 2023 15:19, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];[];"Labour is calling for an investigation into the BBC appointment process for its chair following ""sleaze"" claims.

The man currently in the top role, Richard Sharp, allegedly helped Boris Johnson secure a loan guarantee before being recommended for the job.

Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell has written to the Commissioner for Public Appointments, William Shawcross CVO, asking him to investigate the appointment process.

Labour has already reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards following the report in the Sunday Times, which his spokesperson described as ""rubbish"".

Mr Sharp has also denied a conflict of interest, but calls for clarity are growing after Foreign Secretary James Cleverly evaded answers on the story during media rounds this morning.

Ms Powell said the BBC is meant to be impartial and ""it is vital that the public and parliament can have trust in the process and it is free from any real or perceived conflict of interest"".

""Accordingly, I urge you to investigate this process, and satisfy the public and parliament of its integrity,"" she said in her letter.

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp, a Tory donor, was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020.

Mr Sharp told the newspaper he had ""simply connected"" people and there was no conflict of interest, while Mr Johnson's spokesman insisted his financial arrangements ""have been properly declared"".

Lord Kerslake, the former head of the Civil Service, told Sky News there should be an independent investigation into the claims - either through a parliamentary select committee or by the prime minister's new ethics adviser - so the facts can be ""completely established"".

""The position of the chairman of the BBC is an enormously important one for the country and you want the process for appointing a new person to be absolutely squeaky clean,"" he said.

""The problem we have got here is we have only got half the information, it's a set of stories that aren't fully validated and that's why I agree it needs independent investigation.

""There's plenty of routes where this could be examined, and the facts completely established, including to what extent the prime minister himself was aware of and involved in the discussions that went on here.""

Image: Boris Johnson in Ukraine

Earlier, cabinet minister James Cleverly defended Mr Sharp's appointment, saying he had ""no doubt"" the chairman was given the job based ""on merit"".

But he admitted he had not tried to contact Mr Johnson, who made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Sunday, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge: ""You're the journalist not me.""

This was criticised by several Labour MPs, with Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, tweeting: ""We're all briefed before going on the media.

Former Virgin Money chief Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia lands new role as Moneyfarm chair;Sunday 22 January 2023 14:32, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"The bank executive who helped to transform Virgin Money into one of Britain's biggest high street lenders has landed a role at the helm of a British-based digital wealth manager.

Sky News understands that Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia will on Monday be unveiled as chair of Moneyfarm.

Dame Jayne-Anne's appointment will ignite speculation that Moneyfarm, which is backed by the asset management group M&G; Investments, is preparing the ground for a stock market listing.

Launched in 2012, Moneyfarm has about £2.5bn of assets under management, and roughly 90,000 active investors as customers.

Among its other shareholders are Poste Italiane, the Italian postal service, and Allianz Asset Management.

The Moneyfarm chairmanship adds to Dame Jayne-Anne's portfolio of roles, which includes chairing HM Revenue & Customs and Snoop, a money-saving app she founded and runs.

Her role steering Virgin Money towards and through its initial public offering is likely to have been of particular interest to Moneyfarm's founders and board.

""Moneyfarm has a clear vision and strategy to deliver this and reminds me very much of my early days at Virgin Money,"" she said.

""It has the same energy, drive and innovative culture, with a diverse client base and business that encourages everyone to take control of their financial future.""

Giovanni Daprà, one of Moneyfarm's co-founders and its chief executive, said: ""When we were looking for a new Chair, we wanted to appoint someone with significant expertise in the financial services sector that had a proven track record of delivering high levels of corporate governance and stakeholder engagement in a highly regulated and fast-growing industry.""

Cold snap forces National Grid to put three coal power plants on standby;Sunday 22 January 2023 19:21, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];[];"Britain is firing up three coal power plants ready for use on Monday as a prolonged cold snap grips the country.

The National Grid said the three plants - two at Drax's site in North Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Lincolnshire - will not necessarily be needed tomorrow.

But it has asked them to be warmed up and ready to run if required.

The recent cold spell that has brought sub-zero temperatures, freezing fog and snow to swathes of the country is set to continue into next week.

Check the weather forecast where you are

The plants on standby are three of the five coal power stations that were set for retirement, but whose lives were extended through this winter in a bid to boost supplies amid energy security fears.

""This morning we've issued a notification to warm the winter contingency coal units. This measure should give the public confidence in Monday's energy supply,"" the ESO (Electricity System Operator) branch of the National Grid said.

""The ESO as a prudent system operator has these tools for additional contingency to operate the network as normal and the public should continue to use energy as normal.""

In October the ESO warned it was ""likely to be a challenging winter for energy supply throughout Europe"" but said it was planning for a 6.3% margin to ensure reliable electricity supply.

This is the second time this winter that coal plants have been put on standby. They were also warmed up in December when snow blanketed much of the country and energy demand climbed, but they were not eventually needed.

Coal is the most polluting type of fossil fuel, and has been broadly been phased out in the UK as it seeks to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and stave off dangerous levels of climate change.

But ministers in Britain, along with those in Germany and Italy, warned they may be forced to burn more coal after Russian President Vladimir Putin squeezed Europe's gas supplies, sending prices soaring and threatening supplies.

Germany called its decision to fire up old coal plants a ""bitter but necessary"" pill to swallow as it sought to replace Russian gas.

Train strikes: Pub chain blames walkouts for £4m sales hit;Monday 23 January 2023 07:43, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"A leading pubs and hotels operator has warned investors it is expecting annual earnings to come in below market expectations, claiming that train strikes have taken the gloss off its performance.

Fuller, Smith & Turner (FS&T;) estimated it had lost £4m in sales due to the strike action since last autumn - denting its momentum despite the continued challenge from the cost of living crisis.

""Sales for the four-week Christmas and New Year period increased by 38% against a trading period last year that was impacted by Covid restrictions and work from home guidance"", the company said.

""Due to the impact of the train strikes, our sales compared to the same four weeks in 2019 have declined by 5%.

""Since the start of October, we estimate that industrial action has reduced our sales by some £4m and the consequent impact on profitability means that we now expect to report earnings below market expectations for the full year.""

The update from Fuller's chimes with separate evidence that train strikes have damaged high street sales for both retail and hospitality businesses.

Traffic numbers have consistently shown a slump in visits to town and city centre destinations on days when strikes have taken place.

Business chief urges green growth to boost economy as forecast warns of deeper recession;Monday 23 January 2023 09:34, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Britain's biggest employers' group is urging the government to take ""big decisions"" on boosting growth as a prominent forecaster warns that the country may be facing a deeper recession than it had expected.

Chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) will use a speech on Monday afternoon to demand the chancellor reverses ""the UK's trajectory"" of falling investment through a series of actions, with a focus on green growth.

Tony Danker will argue that the country is lagging behind international rivals in the sphere - and that Jeremy Hunt's looming spring budget provides an opportunity for government to help business achieve it.

This could be done in areas including reform of the consent process for green infrastructure.

He is also seeking new regulation to stimulate domestic demand for green technologies.

Mr Danker was due too to complain about huge uncertainties for UK firms over the Retained EU Law Bill, which says that at the end of this year all retained EU law in the UK expires.

A permanent successor to the super deduction tax that ends in April is needed to prevent the UK from dropping from fifth to 30th place among the 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) advanced economies for capital investment, Mr Danker was also expected to say.

""The PM set out less than a year ago what is needed to transform our economy. The ideas are there. Let's stop second guessing ourselves and get on because there is money on the table to capture right now.""

Mr Danker's remarks chime with warnings that the UK economy, which could yet be in recession, may see a deeper downturn than initially expected.

Record number of Britons receiving benefits that amount to more than they pay in tax, study finds;Monday 23 January 2023 10:31, UK;[];[];"Britain's benefits dependency has hit an all-time high, with more than half of households receiving more from the government than they pay in tax, research suggests.

Analysis by Civitas of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from 2020-21 showed a record 54.2% of people (36 million) now live in households which received more in benefits than they contributed in taxes.

This includes non-cash benefits such as NHS and education services.

The study also showed 83% of all income tax is paid by 40% of British adults.

Authors Tim Knox and Daniel Lilley say the ""net dependency ratio"" is the highest on record.

It fell from 52.5% to 47.5% in 2019-20, but grew during the pandemic due to increased government aid.

Civitas, a right-wing think tank, said the long-term trend is ""clearly"" on the up, comparing the 1977-2000 average of 41.2% with 2020-21's figure of 54.2%.

It also found around 27 million people receive an average of £23,000 per year in cash benefits and ""benefits in kind"" - goods and services provided to an employee for free or at reduced costs such as a company car or private health insurance.

Lithia revs up deal to buy Ferrari dealer Jardine Motors for £300m;Monday 23 January 2023 10:54, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"An American car dealership giant is in advanced talks to buy Jardine Motors, one of the largest automotive retail groups in Britain, for about £300m.

Sky News has learnt that Lithia Motors, which has a market capitalisation on the New York Stock Exchange of more than $6.5bn, is within weeks of finalising a deal to buy its UK-based peer.

One insider cautioned that a deal remained under discussion and could yet fall apart.

If successfully completed, it would see Jardine Motors being sold by Jardine Matheson Holdings, the historic Hong Kong-headquartered conglomerate.

Jardine Matheson owns assets including the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain and Hong Kong Land.

Sources said a takeover would give Lithia a substantial foothold in the UK, with access to luxury car brands including Ferrari and Maserati.

Lithia is committed to using the Jardine Motors business as a platform for growth, they added.

It would be the latest in a string of attempted deals in the sector, with Pendragon recently having ended talks about a takeover by its largest shareholder.

Lithia itself also tried to buy Pendragon last year.

Other big players in the sector include Lookers, while major online competitors such as Cazoo have suffered from the global sell-off in technology stocks.

Jardine Motors was acquired as a single East Anglia dealership by Jardine Matheson in the early 1990s.

It employs roughly 2,700 people at 50 sites across the UK, according to its website.

Responding to an enquiry from Sky News on Monday, a Lithia spokesman said: ""Lithia has a stated desire to expand into the UK market and has held discussions with Jardine Matheson with a view to investing in Jardine Motors Group UK.

""Jardine Motors Group UK is one of the UK's leading automotive retailers and Lithia firmly believes that a combination of the two businesses will help to deliver significant value for employees, partners and customers.

""Lithia views the potential acquisition of Jardine Motors as a platform for future growth in the UK and plans to invest in the business, working with Jardine Motors' market-leading management team to build on the strong momentum the Group has generated in recent years.

""Discussions around a potential transaction are ongoing and a further update will be issued in due course.""

Jardine Motors has yet to reveal financial results for 2022, but saw revenues rise 19% in 2021, with an operating profit of £28m.

The Last Of Us: The science behind the real 'zombie' fungus - and is it an actual threat?;Monday 23 January 2023 12:47, UK;[];[];"Could the next public health crisis be caused by a fungus?

The threat of such an emergency is posed at the outset of the hit TV series, The Last Of Us, which begins in the 1960s with a bleak speech by an epidemiologist on the danger of fungi.

""If the world were to get slightly warmer, then there is reason to evolve,"" warns a prescient John Hannah, referencing their potential to infect and overpower a person's mind.

""Candida, ergot, cordyceps, aspergillus: any one of them could be capable of burrowing into our brains and taking control of not millions of us, but billions.""

The show takes this idea and runs with it, jumping forward 40 years to when a mass cordyceps outbreak leads to a devastating pandemic which transforms people into blood-thirsty abominations.

An extreme outcome with plenty of artistic licence taken - but is it entirely without scientific basis?

Do fungi really threaten humans?

""There are already fungi inhabiting the brains of human beings all over the planet,"" says Professor Elaine Bignell, a world leader in the field of human fungal pathogen research.

""A number of fungi species are quite prominent pathogens and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year - it's just that the public is not aware.""

The Last Of Us viewers may have noted that a few of the dangers identified by its fictional epidemiologist featured last year on a list of health-threatening fungi by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Among the ones deemed most high-risk was Aspergillus fumigatus, a common mould that is widespread in the environment in homes and outdoors, which can cause ""chronic and acute lung disease"" and can be deadly.

Image: Aspergillus is a type of mould, common in homes

Candida species, which causes common infections such as thrush and ringworm, is also a leading cause of bloodstream infection in intensive care patients.

Cryptococcosis neoformans - which infects the lungs and brain, causing pneumonia and meningitis in immunosuppressed patients - also made the list. It kills more than 100,000 people a year in sub-Saharan Africa.

""One thing that killer fungi do have in common is that they are able to grow at human body temperature, and that's unusual for a fungus,"" Prof Bignell tells Sky News.

""Most fungi in the environment are used to growing in more temperate conditions, and it places quite a strain on any microorganism to counteract an immune response in a human body and cope with the high temperature.""

What about cordyceps?

Cordyceps was not on the threat list - but it is absolutely real.

The parasitic fungus infects and takes over the mind of insects, as it does to humans in The Last Of Us.

""There are about 600 species,"" says Dr Mark Ramsdale, a professor in molecular microbiology at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology.

""They are predominantly insect pathogens. It's their insect host that they manipulate and change their behaviour. And so from that perspective, there is some basis there.""

Image: A fly infected by a cordyceps fungus. Pic: Alejandro Santillana/University of Texas

Found in tropical forests, the fungus penetrates an insect's body via spores, which are released to allow a fungus to reproduce and defend itself.

The fungus then guides its host into more humid locations to help it grow, before feeding on the remains and launching new spores from its corpse.

When it comes to humans, cordyceps is used in treatments and therapeutics - notably Chinese herbal medicines.

""There's a long history of relationships between humans and this particular group,"" Dr Ramsdale tells Sky News.

""There's no evidence they're causing disease in humans. However, in terms of their insect relationships, they do manipulate their hosts - and several fungi have evolved this capacity over time.""

Could climate change the picture?

Another facet of The Last Of Us's foreboding speech shared by the WHO's landmark report was the influence of climate change on the nature of fungi and our relationship with it.

Prof Bignell says the impact of global heating will be ""profound"" for all microbes on our planet.

There are some 150,000 identified species of fungi in the world, well short of the millions estimated to exist, and few have what it takes to cope with the 37C temperature and other stresses imposed by the human body.

But some do, and more could - either those yet to be discovered or which adapt to survive on a warming planet.

Fungus unknown to science discovered in Scotland

""It changes the selection pressures that are put on those huge, diverse life forms,"" says Dr Ramsdale.

""Perhaps some could potentially make that transition from one lifestyle to another and become pathogenic in a context that we haven't thought of before.""

So the show's pandemic may be far from factual, but it's not completely without merit.

""What really is the most removed from the current status quo is the scale and the rate of the infections occurring in The Last Of Us,"" says Prof Bignell.

""Some fungi can get passed from one person to the next - and in the environment we are exposed to them all the time - but it would take a very significant variant to be able to cause the sorts of species extinction event that they're dramatising.""

So … no reason for alarm?

You can sleep easy knowing there won't be a fungus that turns you into a zombie in your cereal tomorrow morning.

But COVID, researchers say, is proof that we can't rest on our laurels when it comes to public health threats and the potentially sudden nature of their arrival.

And based on the response to the opening episode of The Last Of Us, people were quick to see the parallels.

With fungal infection in humans being a relatively modern phenomenon, with few examples until the 1980s, and the absence of any antifungal vaccine research programmes, there's certainly work to do.

""We have to be in a state of preparedness,"" says Prof Bignell.

""We have to have a very good understanding of how different fungi can cause human diseases, how our immune systems cope with those microbes, and a good medicine cabinet with antifungal agents we know are effective.""

In the meantime, if you do happen to see anyone that looks like they're covered in mushrooms and feasting on a member of their family - best steer clear.

Once-in-a-lifetime green comet approaching closest point to Earth;Monday 23 January 2023 12:01, UK;[];[];"A once-in-a-lifetime green comet not seen since the Stone Age will make its closest approach to Earth next week.

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has already been visible through binoculars and telescopes this month, but could become visible with the naked eye as it gets ever nearer to our planet.

Experts say those without equipment should try to catch it on 1 and 2 February, when the green comet will look its brightest against the night sky.

At its closest point (a mere 28 million miles away), it will be visible from the northern and southern hemisphere.

NASA described the comet's rare fly-by as an ""awesome opportunity to make a personal connection with an icy visitor from the distant outer solar system"".

When is the best time to see it?

Until now, the visibility has been at its best before dawn.

But as January winds down and February begins, the comet will be visible from the evening onwards.

The comet will be at its nearest and brightest between next Wednesday and Thursday.

However, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich suggests you check what time the moon will rise where you live, so to avoid its bright light drowning out the comet's shine.

And while C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has been tipped to be one of the very best comet sightings of 2023, it won't be quite as stunning as the Neowise comet from three years ago.

That one left a picturesque streak behind it as it flew by Earth.

Is there anything I can use to help me spot it?

Binoculars and telescopes have made the comet easy to spot since 12 January.

But even without such equipment, there are ways you can give yourself a better chance of seeing it as it gets closer.

Stargazing apps like Night Sky, SkyView and Sky Guide can be a great utility, as they can help you find the precise location of comets by helping you map constellations of stars.

By pointing your smartphone's camera up at the night sky, such apps will use augmented reality to tell you which constellations you're looking at and offer tips on how to spot comets.

When the green comet gets closest to Earth, it will be in the Camelopardalis constellation.

If you want to try and see it before then, it's travelling through Corona Borealis, Bootes, Draco, and Ursa Minor.

What else do we know about C/2022 E3 (ZTF)?

The icy green comet was only discovered on 2 March 2022, spotted from the Zwicky Transient Facility in California.

Astronomers calculated that it had an orbital period - the time it takes to travel round the sun - of 50,000 years.

That would put its last journey this close to Earth as back in the Stone Age.

The comet is thought to have originated in the outskirts of the solar system in the Oort Cloud.

NASA describes the cloud as a ""collection of icy objects farther away than everything else in the solar system"".

It's so far away that no spacecraft have yet been sent to explore it, though there are some en route.

Unfortunately, it will take so long for them to get there that they will be long out of power by the time they arrive.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123125309/http://news.sky.com/story/once-in-a-lifetime-green-comet-approaching-closest-point-to-earth-12793447;Category-3: environment
BBC chairman asks for review into his job after claims he helped Boris Johnson secure loan;Monday 23 January 2023 12:02, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];[];"BBC chairman Richard Sharp has asked for a review into potential conflicts of interest following reports he helped Boris Johnson secure a loan.

Mr Sharp said that while the appointment of the chairman is ""solely a matter for the government"", he wants to ensure that ""all appropriate guidelines have been followed within the BBC since I have joined"".

Politics latest: Zahawi told to quit - amid 'evidence' TV interview defence was 'not true'

""We have many challenges at the BBC and I know that distractions such as this are not welcome,"" he said in a statement read out on BBC News.

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020, and that the then-prime minister went on to recommend him for the top job at the BBC.

A spokesperson for Mr Johnson called the report ""rubbish"" while both sides denied a conflict of interest.

The review will look at any conflicts of interest since Mr Sharp joined the BBC, and not his role in Mr Johnson's loan.

But in a letter to BBC staff, Mr Sharp clarified some of the details surrounding his involvement.

He confirmed he introduced multimillionaire Canadian businessman Sam Blyth to cabinet secretary Simon Case ""as Sam wanted to support Boris Johnson"".

""I was not involved in making a loan, or arranging a guarantee, and I did not arrange any financing. What I did do was to seek an introduction of Sam Blythe to the relevant official in government,"" he said.

""Sam Blyth, who I have known for more than forty years, lives in London and having become aware of the financial pressures on the then prime minister, and being a successful entrepreneur, he told me he wanted to explore whether he could assist.""

Mr Blyth is a distance cousin of Mr Johnson's.

The statement was released moments after Mr Johnson said that Mr Sharp ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances"".

Image: Boris Johnson

Speaking to Sky News he said: ""This is a load of complete nonsense - absolute nonsense.

""Let me just tell you, Richard Sharp is a great and wise man but he knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding dang sure.

""This is just another example of the BBC disappearing up its own fundament.""

The BBC reported that Mr Sharp ""has agreed with the board's senior independent director"" that the nominations committee will look at conflicts of interest when it next meets and, ""in the interests of transparency, publish the conclusions"".

It comes after Labour called for an independent investigation into the process for appointing the chair of the BBC.

The party has also reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, saying the former prime minister's financial affairs are ""dragging the Conservative Party deeper into yet another quagmire of sleaze"".

The Cabinet Office has insisted Mr Sharp was appointed ""following a rigorous appointments process"".

This included assessment by a panel of experts and ""additional pre-appointment scrutiny by a House of Commons Select Committee"", according to a statement released yesterday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123125309/http://news.sky.com/story/bbc-chairman-asks-for-review-into-his-job-after-claims-he-helped-boris-johnson-secure-loan-12793498;Category-1: politics

Spotify cuts 6% of workforce as tech sector jobs cull continues apace;Monday 23 January 2023 13:04, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Spotify has become the latest company in the technology sphere to announce big job cuts, with 6% of the workforce to go in the coming months.

The US listed but Sweden-based music streaming firm said a broader shake-up of its operations would see its chief content officer Dawn Ostroff leave the business.

The number of employees set to depart would total around 600 people - based on the company's last official count.

Former Labour MP Jared O'Mara tried to claim taxpayers' cash to fund 'significant cocaine habit', court hears;Monday 23 January 2023 19:11, UK;[];[];"A former Labour MP tried to claim up to £30,000 in taxpayers' cash to fund a ""significant cocaine habit"", prosecutors have said.

Jared O'Mara, 41, was in ""poor mental health"" at the time and abusing the class A drug in ""prodigious quantities"", Leeds Crown Court heard.

A friend, charged alongside him, believed the politician was suffering a ""severe psychotic episode"" and feared a conspiracy against him.

It is claimed that O'Mara, who represented the Sheffield Hallam constituency between 2017 and 2019, submitted ""dishonest"" invoices to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

Jurors were told he made four claims between June and August 2019 from a ""fictitious"" organisation called Confident About Autism SY.

They also heard he submitted two invoices from his ""chief of staff"", Gareth Arnold, for media and PR work. Prosecutors say that work was never carried out.

O'Mara, who appeared in court by videolink on Monday, is also accused of submitting a false contract of employment for his friend John Woodliff, saying that Woodliff worked for him as a constituency support officer.

O'Mara is charged with eight counts of fraud by false representation.

Arnold is jointly charged with six of the offences, while Woodliff is jointly charged with one.

Image: John Woodliff said he 'knew it was dodgy', the court was told

Setting out his argument, prosecutor James Bourne-Arton said Arnold and Woodliff were ""old friends of Jared O'Mara and sadly were persuaded to go along with his dishonest claims"".

In the summer of 2019, however, Arnold contacted South Yorkshire Police after ""reaching a point at which he was no longer willing to participate in the fraud"", the court heard.

In a phone call played to the jury, Arnold said: ""It's a bit of a tricky one, but yesterday I spoke to the 999 service and the mental health crisis team about my employer, who I believe is suffering a severe psychotic episode and has delusions of a conspiracy against him.

""I also believe he has been submitting fake expense claims to the government very recently.""

The allegedly fraudulent invoices included £19,400 for support from Confident About Autism SY, and £4,650 for Arnold.

Mr Bourne-Arton said Confident About Autism SY was an ""invention of Jared O'Mara that he hoped to slip through as a legitimate claim, no doubt seeking to hide behind the fact that it related to his disability if ever challenged"".

There is no evidence that any training or consultancy was provided by Arnold, the prosecutor said, and ""legitimate staff"" working for O'Mara had never heard of him.

""(Ipsa) staff noted that the invoices, particularly those from Confident About Autism, are in different formats, have inconsistent references, and in one case was dated for a date after it was submitted for payment,"" Mr Bourne-Arton said.

All of the invoices were either rejected or not processed - one of them rejected three times.

Arnold described an ""undoubtedly sad state of affairs"", Mr Bourne-Arton said.

He told jurors: ""O'Mara was plainly unable to cope with the office he held, was in poor mental health and was heavily addicted to cocaine that he was abusing in prodigious quantities.""

Financial investigations revealed O'Mara was ""living to or beyond his means and in dire need of cash"", the court heard.

The prosecutor said: ""The reason for that appears to have been that he was funding a significant cocaine habit of which both Gareth Arnold and John Woodliff were plainly aware.""

The three defendants were arrested following an investigation and Woodliff, who was a nightclub doorman when O'Mara was a nightclub manager, said ""I knew it was dodgy"", jurors were told.

The court also heard that O'Mara emailed Ipsa in February 2020, falsely claiming the police investigation had been completed with no action taken, and saying he was entitled to be paid the two invoices relating to services supplied by Arnold.

O'Mara, of Walker Close, Sheffield; Arnold, of School Lane, Dronfield, Derbyshire; and Woodliff, of Hesley Road, Shiregreen, Sheffield, deny all charges.

Six Nations rugby: Coaches and players split over new rules on height of tackles ahead of international competitions;Monday 23 January 2023 21:10, UK;['rob harris', '@robharris'];[];"With players ordered to keep tackles lower across community rugby in England next season, some on the pitch are asking whether the new rules will reduce the number of concussions, as England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy prepare to take on each other.

Six Nations rugby: Coaches and players split over new rules on height of tackles ahead of international competitions

The Six Nations kicks off on 4 February

Questions about the effectiveness of asking rugby union players to lower the height of tackles hung over the launch of the Six Nations in central London on Monday.

It means the new year - which features an autumn world cup - has opened with renewed concerns about the dangers of playing the sport.

With governing bodies facing accusations of negligence in new lawsuits from former players, questions are being raised about whether action being taken is enough to prevent long-term brain damage and neurological conditions.

But doubts have also been raised about the usefulness of ordering players to keep tackles lower - as will happen across community rugby in England next season.

The question is: will the new rules reduce the number of concussions?

Coaches and players were split on the issue ahead of the Six Nations, which kicks off a week on Saturday.

Ireland captain Johnny Sexton is not convinced his country should adopt England's new regulations.

""You can get a knee in the head, you can get a hip in the head,"" he said.

""I'm not sure who puts these rules in place, but I don't agree with them, definitely. Especially for a taller man like myself who likes to tackle high.""

The priority, for Sexton, should be eradicating reckless tackles.

More than 60,000 people have signed a petition trying to overturn the RFU's ban - claiming it will lead to a rise in head-on-knee contact.

Players will have to be coached on lowering tackle height - with fears about the impact of collisions with knees.

Get that wrong and ""tackles can become just as dangerous"", according to Ireland coach Andy Farrell.

But the splits in the game were reflected by Farrell's son, England captain Owen, who can see the value in changes to address player welfare.

""The game is trying to become a safer game, which is good,"" he said.

""I think we, as England, are going to try to make sure we're on the right side of that and make sure we're pushing it in terms of trying to play the game hard, but safe and fair.""

Farrell would still be allowed to make above-waist tackles because the new rules won't apply in the Premiership or Championship.

But an extension of the changes more widely could be on the cards, with world rugby's governing body welcoming the RFU's decision to lower the height of tackles.

Tyre Nichols: Man who died after 'three-minute police beating' was treated like 'human pinata' by officers, says family lawyer;Monday 23 January 2023 23:45, UK;[];[];"A man who died after allegedly being beaten by police for three minutes was a ""human pinata"" for the officers, according to a family lawyer.

Tyre Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said.

Five black officers involved in the arrest have been sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Relatives have accused police of attacking Mr Nichols and causing him to have a heart attack. But authorities have only said he had a medical emergency.

Alec Baldwin will remain in lead role of Rust - days after being charged over shooting on the film's set;Tuesday 24 January 2023 02:58, UK;['connor sephton', '@connorsephton'];[];"Alec Baldwin will remain in the lead role of Rust as it continues filming, the movie's lawyer has confirmed.

The 64-year-old actor is facing an involuntary manslaughter charge following the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the film's set in October 2021.

Her husband Matt will also remain executive producer - and Joel Souza, who was injured in the incident, is returning as director.

Hutchins died on the set outside Sante Fe, New Mexico, when a revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with fired with a live bullet.

Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting - saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety.

The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Legal analysts have suggested that prosecutors may face an uphill battle in efforts to convict Baldwin of criminal charges without proof he knew live ammunition was present.

An investigation by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has yet to reveal how live rounds got onto the film set in the first place.

Melina Spadone, the attorney for Rust Movie Productions, told Sky News that the film is still on track to be completed.

Frank Hanebuth: Former Hells Angels leader and 49 alleged collaborators appear in Spanish court;Tuesday 24 January 2023 04:26, UK;[];[];"A former leader of the Hells Angels in Europe could face 13 years in prison if he is convicted of running a chapter of the motorcycle club linked with organised crime on the Spanish island of Mallorca.

German national Frank Hanebuth appeared in court alongside 49 alleged collaborators from numerous countries, at least 34 of whom agreed to a plea deal allowing them to pay fines instead of serving time.

Hanebuth did not seek a deal.

Some of the defendants were of German, Greek or British origin and needed an interpreter to follow the developments, which were conducted in Spanish.

Three of the accused took part via video link from Germany.

Spanish prosecutors have charged Hanebuth with membership in a criminal organisation, money laundering and illegal possession of firearms.

They are also asking the judge overseeing the trial to fine him €4.2m (£3.7m) for the money laundering charge.

In addition to belonging to a criminal organisation, other defendants have been charged with running a prostitution ring and drug trafficking, and face up to 38 years in prison.

The Hells Angels conducted illegal activities in Mallorca from 2009 to 2013 under Hanebuth's leadership, according to the criminal indictment.

Hanebuth appointed members who then carried out crimes including extortion, prostitution, acquiring illegal firearms and robbery in popular tourist spots, prosecutors said.

They also moved into real estate on Mallorca and nearby island Ibiza, prosecutors said.

The Hells Angels in Europe are believed to have chosen Mallorca because of a large number of foreign residents and other money laundering and drug trafficking schemes.

The Mallorca chapter of the gang was strongly international, with recruits from as far away as the Dominican Republic and Morocco, according to the indictment.

One of the defendants who took a plea deal was Paul Witworth, a British associate of Hanebuth's who prosecutors say maintained links with the Adams family, a notorious UK gang also known as The Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate.

Primark: Consumer spending 'more resilient than expected' over Christmas;Tuesday 24 January 2023 08:15, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Primark's owner has reported ""very strong"" trading over Christmas, admitting that consumer spending was stronger than it had anticipated amid the squeeze on household budgets.

Associated British Foods (ABF) reported a 15% rise in retail sales over the 16 weeks to 7 January.

In the UK, Primark said much of its 15% lift on the same period last year was achieved on a like-for-like basis, meaning the growth could not be credited to new Primark store openings.

The company pointed to record demand in the run-up to Christmas, with its sales on the continent and elsewhere also rising on the back of its value offering.

The prospect of a discounted shopping experience has proved attractive to consumers across much of the western world given the pressures placed on the purse strings from energy-led inflation.

The cost of living crisis has been the main threat to retailers - especially those in the non-essential spending sphere.

Official retail sales figures for the UK, released last week, showed a surprise drop during the key month of December despite a largely upbeat set of trading updates from listed retailers since the festive season finished.

ABF, which also owns major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, said its total revenue rose 16% on a constant currency basis.

Despite the upbeat performance, the company said its outlook for the full year was unchanged.

It is expecting adjusted operating profit to be down on the 2021-22 figure of £1.4bn.

The group said it continued to encounter significant cost pressures but inflation had become less volatile and some commodity costs had declined more recently.

It said of the performance at Primark: ""To date, Primark trading has been good in all our markets and was ahead of expectation.

Tyre Nichols: Man who died after 'three-minute police beating' was treated like 'human pinata' by US officers, says family lawyer;Tuesday 24 January 2023 08:00, UK;[];[];"A man who died after allegedly being beaten by police for three minutes was a ""human pinata"" for the officers, according to a family lawyer.

Tyre Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said.

Five black officers involved in the arrest have been sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Relatives have accused police of attacking Mr Nichols and causing him to have a heart attack. But authorities have only said he had a medical emergency.

A lawyer for Mr Nichols' family, Antonio Romanucci, said the beating lasted three minutes and ""he was a human pinata for those police officers"".

Another lawyer, Ben Crump, said the bodycam footage of the incident reminded the family and lawyers of the 1991 video of Rodney King being beaten by police in Los Angeles, where a year later officers were acquitted by a jury, leading to riots in the city.

He said the footage of the latest encounter shows it was ""violent"" and ""troublesome on every level"", and added it was ""appalling"", ""deplorable"" and ""heinous"".

Mr Crump said the video will be released to the public but not for a week or two.

Energy support and debt costs drive record public borrowing in December;Tuesday 24 January 2023 08:28, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Government borrowing hit its highest December figure since records began last month, according to official figures.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a total of £27.4bn - a leap of almost £17bn on the same month a year ago.

It blamed £7bn in costs from energy support schemes.

Added to that was interest payments on debt, reaching £17.3bn.

The ONS said that sum was the second largest in any single month behind the £20bn recorded in June 2022.

It added that £13.7bn within the figure reflected the impact of inflation, as many government bonds are linked to the Retail Prices Index measure.

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that the government's debt interest bill alone will come in at almost £116bn in the financial year to March.

December's figure took the total to date to £87.8bn.

The overall net borrowing figure was around £10bn higher than many economists had forecast.

It could be used by ministers to bolster their tough stance over public sector pay increases as strikes continue to cripple many services.

The government has argued that settlements must be affordable as unions representing the likes of nurses, ambulance staff and firefighters continue to demand hikes that will better shield their members from the cost of living crisis.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in reaction to the borrowing figures: ""Right now we are helping millions of families with the cost of living, but we must also ensure that our level of debt is fair for future generations.

China's extreme weather in pictures as temperature drops to a record -53C in city

Temperatures in parts of northern China have dropped to their lowest ever, with -53C (-63F) recorded in one city.

State broadcaster CCTV said a weather station in Mohe, in Heilongjiang province, logged the record low on Sunday, breaking the city's previous record of -52 (-61F) degrees in 1969.

The channel said Mohe, which has the nickname ""North Pole village"", had experienced temperatures of below -50C (-58F) for three consecutive days over the weekend, with the severe cold weather expected to continue.

China's national meteorological centre renewed a cold wave alert on Tuesday, forecasting more freezing weather conditions and strong winds across eastern and southern regions.

Sky News meteorologist Joanna Robinson said: ""An intense cold surge has been affecting a large part of eastern Asia, which is not unusual at this time of the year when winds can bring in Siberian air.

""Very low temperatures have been seen across parts of eastern Russia and northeastern China, some 15 to 20C lower than average in places.

""The current extreme weather follows one of China's worst heatwaves which was experienced last year. The heatwave lasted over two months and saw more than 250 weather stations recording their highest temperature.""

Topshop pensioners fashion £1bn funding deal with Aviva;Tuesday 24 January 2023 12:21, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Thousands of pensioners left facing an uncertain retirement by the collapse of Sir Philip Green's high street empire are on the verge of a funding deal backed by one of Britain's biggest insurers.

Sky News has learnt that the trustees of the Arcadia Group pension scheme are close to striking a binding deal with Aviva to guarantee its members' incomes.

City sources said a formal agreement was likely within weeks, with Aviva understood to have seen off competition from rival insurance companies, including Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC).

If concluded, it would bring to an end negotiations about one of the UK's most contentious corporate pension schemes.

The fate of Arcadia's pensioners, comprising employees of prominent chains including Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop, has been in the balance since Sir Philip was forced to put the group into administration in the autumn of 2020.

The retailer had been in financial trouble for some time, hurt by consumers' switch to online shopping and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sir Philip was in negotiations with The Pensions Regulator for months before Arcadia's collapse, and agreed to inject a substantial sum into the scheme.

His fraught discussions with the watchdog were precipitated by the political row which engulfed the tycoon in the aftermath of the collapse of BHS, the department store chain, in 2016.

A memorable select committee hearing with MPs that year saw the then billionaire castigated for his decision to offload BHS to Dominic Chappell, a now-imprisoned bankrupt, for just £1.

Along with wife Lady Tina, Sir Philip eventually committed more than £350m to boost payouts to BHS's pension scheme members, but not without an ugly critique of his conduct by parliamentarians.

The precise structure of the deal between the Arcadia trustees and Aviva was unclear on Tuesday, but one insider said it was expected to involve members receiving full benefits - albeit potentially with more limited future increases than current inflation levels would justify.

Arcadia members are certain to receive superior payouts to those they would have got through the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, which effectively guarantees benefits worth 90% of pension pots to unretired members.

The last public figure for Arcadia's pension liabilities was in the order of £1bn, although the current figure was unclear.

Many retirement schemes have seen deficits shrink in recent months as interest rates have risen.

Aviva and a spokesperson for Arcadia's pension trustees both declined to comment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124124720/http://news.sky.com/story/topshop-pensioners-fashion-1bn-funding-deal-with-aviva-12794184;Category-2: business and economy
Sea spiders can regrow lost anuses and sex organs - leaving scientists stunned;Tuesday 24 January 2023 13:23, UK;[];[];"Scientists say they are stunned after discovering sea spiders have the ability to grow new reproductive organs and an anus.

Experts already knew that when the arthropods lose legs, they can regrow them.

But in a development that will no doubt inspire the next generation of Spider-Man stories, a study has found the underwater creatures have regenerative powers which extend to their entire bottom halves.

""Nobody had expected this,"" said the lead researcher behind the breakthrough in understanding, Professor Gerhard Scholtz.

Other arthropods - invertebrates with no internal skeleton or backbone, but which do have an exoskeleton - such as centipedes and crabs, are also capable of regrowing limbs.

Some creatures can go further, with starfish able to regenerate their entire bodies on occasion - and lizards able to produce a new tail.

""If you look at the animal kingdom, the capability of regeneration differs very much in various groups of animals,"" Professor Scholtz told Sky News.

""Flatworms, for example, can regenerate their whole body from a limited amount of tissue.

""On the other hand, us - mammals - cannot regenerate much - liver, tissue, skin, but apart from that very little.

""For arthropods - crustaceans, insects, myriapods, and types of spider - it was entirely unknown that they could regenerate body parts other than limbs.""

The study, which has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, saw the hind limbs and backends of 23 sea spiders amputated.

While four older spiders did not regrow anything, most of the 19 juveniles did.

Sixteen of them regenerated at least one lost body part, 14 recovered their posterior, and 90% survived long-term despite the amputations.

Until now, it was thought that the spiders' hard exoskeleton prevented any regeneration beyond the limbs, added Professor Scholtz. But his research found the creatures were recreating body parts within ""several weeks or months"".

The regenerations did not always go smoothly - some spiders were a leg or two short.

Hope 'always there' for amputation breakthrough

Professor Scholtz, of Humboldt University of Berlin's Institute for Biology, said the findings should inspire further study into different species.

""One has to look to other arthropods and whether they can do the same,"" he said.

He is planning further research by reproducing the study with insects, crabs and other crustaceans.

And the breakthrough could be transformative for health care.

Such research could one day advance treatments for human amputees.

""The hope is always there,"" said Professor Scholtz.

""I don't think the sea spiders will play a crucial role, but who knows? The more you know about regeneration in the animal kingdom, the better you might be able to use it for medical treatment.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124140210/http://news.sky.com/story/sea-spiders-can-regrow-lost-anuses-and-sex-organs-leaving-scientists-stunned-12794124;Category-6: science and technology
Doomsday Clock moves 10 seconds closer to midnight as Ukraine war rages;Tuesday 24 January 2023 15:48, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"The Doomsday Clock has been set at 90 seconds to midnight - representing a time of ""unprecedented danger"" - largely because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

A glimmer of hope for public finances but don't expect giveaway spring budget;Tuesday 24 January 2023 14:42, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"At first blush, the public sector net borrowing figures for December are pretty depressing.

At £27.4bn, the overall figure is not only more than double the revised £10.4bn seen in December 2021, it was also appreciably higher than the £17.7bn that the City had been expecting.

It is the highest December borrowing since the data began being prepared in this way 29 years ago.

The December number was also £9.8bn more than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast only as recently as November last year - although that was due largely to changes in student loan valuations.

For the broader picture, though, you do not have to look too far to find out why borrowing remains so high.

Interest payments on the national debt during the month came in at £17.3bn, the second highest on record, reflecting the fact that interest payments on around a quarter of the national debt (28% to be precise) are linked to the rate of inflation.

When inflation goes up, so do interest payments.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) noted that, of that £17.3bn, some £13.7bn reflected the impact of inflation on index-linked goods.

It underlines why the government's primary economic focus remains bringing down inflation and why it is taking such a hard line on public sector pay awards.

Advertisement

The other big element of spending, costing nearly £7bn during the month, reflected the extraordinary sums being thrown by the government at supporting households and businesses with their energy bills.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:59 Chancellor cautious over inflation

All that meant government spending during the month exceeded what the government raked in.

The latter figure came in at £74.6bn during the month, up £3.9bn on December 2021, most of which - some £3.4bn - was in the form of extra taxes.

These, in some cases, have been growing quite nicely from the government's point of view.

VAT receipts for the month were up 4.9% on December 2021, which could well reflect the fact that inflation is pushing higher the absolute sums being spent by consumers, while corporation tax receipts were up 11.5% and income tax receipts collected via PAYE were up 9.7%.

The latter is in part testament to some of the big pay increases being seen now, particularly in the private sector, some of which have even been exceeding the rate of inflation in some categories. These are likely to continue to rise as the year goes on thanks to the decision by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, not to raise income tax thresholds in line with inflation - 'fiscal drag' as it is known in the jargon.

Those frozen thresholds also apply to other taxes. For example, the government is raking in ever-larger sums from Inheritance Tax, the 'nil band' threshold for which has stayed the same since 2010-11 and which, like the main residence nil rate, has been frozen until 2026.

Figures published separately by HM Revenue & Customs brought in £5.3bn in inheritance tax from April to December last year - up £700m on the same period in 2021. That largely reflects higher house prices and means a lot of families who might not necessarily consider themselves to be well-off are now being stung by this unpopular levy.

As Alex Davies, chief executive of the investment broker Wealth Club, observed: ""Contrary to popular belief, inheritance tax doesn't just affect the super-rich, many who would not consider themselves wealthy at all will also bear a considerable burden.

""Rampant inflation and years of frozen allowances and soaring house prices mean many more families will find themselves hit with a hefty inheritance tax bill which they might not have envisaged or planned for.""

The bigger picture is that borrowing so far this financial year stands at £128.1bn, up £5.1bn on the same period last year, albeit £2.7bn less than the OBR was expecting at this stage.

But there is a slight glimmer of hope.

It is that the two big ticket areas that have caused public spending to so outweigh public borrowing are set to moderate.

Inflation looks to have peaked in October last year and is now set to fall steadily.

The economics team at Barclays, for example, forecast that the headline rate of Consumer Prices Inflation will have fallen to 6.3% by July this year and, by December this year, will be down to 3.9%.

That decline in inflation will bring down sharply the inflation-linked element of interest payments on the national debt.

The other big element, the support to households and businesses with their energy bills, is also set to fall sharply as, firstly the government withdraws support and secondly, wholesale energy prices come down.

As Victoria Clarke, UK Chief Economist at Santander CIB, put it: ""The miss against OBR forecasts is not likely to be repeated over the months ahead and so borrowing still appears on track to come in a touch below the £177bn… set out in the November autumn statement.

""Furthermore, there is still more wiggle room in the cash numbers. Further ahead, the government is likely to face lower than predicted fiscal costs for household energy support, after falls in wholesale gas prices.""

Yet that wiggle room is likely to be limited.

There will still be demands from business for support with energy bills while, as was reported in the Sunday press, Mr Hunt is inclined to keep in place the temporary 5p-a-litre cut in fuel duty, introduced in March last year, for a further 12 months. That is a hugely expensive giveaway that would cost the Treasury £6bn.

Moreover, it feels almost inevitable that ministers are going to have to give ground to some public sector pay demands, particularly in the NHS. That will also limit Mr Hunt's room for manoeuvre.

For that reason, even though Mr Hunt is coming under pressure from his backbench MPs to cut taxes in his forthcoming budget, it would be unwise to expect any big giveaways in March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154708/http://news.sky.com/story/a-glimmer-of-hope-for-public-finances-but-dont-expect-giveaway-spring-budget-12794287;Category-2: business and economy

Zara Aleena murder: Delays meant probation staff had only nine days to assess killer before his release from prison;Tuesday 24 January 2023 15:29, UK;[];[];"""Significant"" delays meant probation staff who assessed Jordan McSweeney before his release from prison were only allocated the case nine days before he was let out into the community, a watchdog has found.

McSweeney, 29, attacked and killed law graduate Zara Aleena in Ilford, east London, on 26 June last year, just nine days after being released from HMP Belmarsh.

A damning report by the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation has found there was a catalogue of errors in the Probation Service's handling of McSweeney's release, which meant he was not treated as a high-risk offender and was ""free"" to commit this ""most heinous crime"".

Among the issues flagged in the report was a two-month delay in formally assigning the case, meaning probation officers had less than a fortnight to carry out important assessments and planning for his release.

When the case was assigned, it was handed over with a ""lack of detail"" to a newly-qualified probation officer, the report found.

It also found delays in signing off on a recall to prison issued for McSweeney following his release.

Though the report does not suggest that without the delays Ms Aleena's murder could have been prevented, it does say that the chance to have located and arrested McSweeney ""would have been maximised"".

In December, McSweeney was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 38 years after pleading guilty to the law student's murder.

A life-long offender

McSweeney was well known to the probation service, with a long history of offending stretching back to 2005 when he was reprimanded for two assaults at the age of 12.

After being punished for burglaries in his teenage years, he was given his first conviction for violence in 2010 when he was convicted of causing actual bodily harm (ABH).

McSweeney, whose offending was, according to the report, mostly motivated by his need for money to feed his addiction to drugs and alcohol, was later handed a series of burglary-related prison sentences,

After being granted parole in 2020 for a burglary offence, he was charged with carrying a weapon, criminal damage, and racially aggravated public order offences while in prison.

It was for these offences that McSweeney would be jailed and eventually released in the days before his murder of Ms Aleena.

Delays in assigning his case

McSweeney was out on licence - serving the remainder of a sentence in the community whilst sticking to certain conditions - in November 2020 when he was charged with the prison offences.

He remained out of prison until February 2021 when he was arrested on suspicion of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) - charges he was later found not guilty of.

However, as a result of the new charges, he was recalled to prison to serve the remainder of his 2020 burglary sentence.

The sentence expired in October 2021, after which McSweeney was held in custody until April 2022, when he was sentenced to 16 months for the prison-related offences.

His time spent on remand was taken off his total sentence, giving him a release date of 17 June 2022.

Owing to the short time until release, McSweeney should have then been assigned a community offender manager, the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation found.

However, according to his report, this did not happen until June, leading to a two-month delay in the formal allocation to a named probation officer.

During that time, his report said, there was ""limited contact"" between the prison offender manager and the community probation officer, due to ""excessive workload and the limited time available"".

Serious probation failings over law graduate's killer, watchdog finds

The case was formally assigned to the probation officer on 9 June 2022, nine days before his release, giving limited time for pre-release planning and assessment.

It was handed to a newly-qualified probation officer, who was assigned McSweeney because they had previously worked on his case.

McSweeney's release from prison was signed off with conditions for drug testing and a requirement to attend a well-being service.

However, the official did not opt for use of an electronic GPS monitoring tag, something which the report said could have been applied.

McSweeney is released

According to the report, in February 2022 McSweeney's mother had asked probation staff not to release her son to her address because she was concerned he would reunite with associates in the area who could lead him back into a life of crime.

Despite the probation service having no clarity of where he would stay after his release, McSweeney left HMP Belmarsh on 17 June 2022. He failed to attend the well-being service later that day.

His mother confirmed to probation that he was drunk and at her address. Probation staff issued a warning to McSweeney for non-compliance with his licence conditions.

According to the report, an instant recall to prison could have been considered at this stage, but it was ""usual"" for staff to offer offenders deemed ""medium risk"", as McSweeney was, further opportunities to attend.

""A term used was that cases such as McSweeney would usually 'rock up' at some stage,"" the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation found.

""This was indicative of using a generic approach ... rather than assessing a case on its own merits,"" his report added.

McSweeney did not attend two further meetings and, by 22 June, had not been seen by his mother or the police in five days.

According to the report, McSweeney's probation officer then initiated recall proceedings. However, a senior staff member did not countersign the request for 48 hours - despite there being a 24-hour target time.

The recall notice was issued at 4.10pm on 24 June, less than 48 hours before McSweeney murdered Ms Aleena in the early hours of 26 June.

The report said: ""National data on recalls shows that the median time between licence revocation and a return to prison custody is three days.

""Had a recall been initiated following the missed appointment on 20 June, or completed within the specified timescale on 23 June, the time for police to locate and arrest McSweeney would have been maximised.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124160333/http://news.sky.com/story/zara-aleena-murder-delays-meant-probation-staff-had-only-nine-days-to-assess-killer-before-his-release-from-prison-12794150;Category-7: health

Land of fear: Inside Myanmar's military regime;;[];[];"'Then comes the ominous march of missiles'

It feels like we're driving through a dystopian movie set. It's dawn and the roads are shrouded in mist.

Suddenly, we grind to a halt. The end of a long metal pole creeps past our window. As it inches closer, I realise it's attached to a tank.

Minutes later, a fleet of model navy ships decked in bright green and yellow bulbs shimmer out of the shadows. They look almost festive.

Then comes the ominous march of missiles.

Our destination is growing closer and we're not alone. A cavalcade of buses roll in, packed with performers in vibrant regional dress. Their hair and make-up is immaculate.

A few are still snoozing on arrival. It is 4am and they've been compliantly rehearsing at this early hour for weeks.

We're in Myanmar - a country that's been largely off limits to Western journalists since the military seized power in a coup nearly two years ago.

Some call it the Land of the Shadows - a nation caught between light and darkness. The abiding impression from our first day is that it embodies that paradox - hugely colourful and deeply intimidating.

Our journey starts at the 75th Anniversary of Myanmar's independence from Britain.

The military government who has planned it all is looking to show the world - and convince their own country - that the regime is stable. It's a hard sell.

The junta is accused of war crimes and genocide. It's been condemned by the UN, sanctioned and the economy is precarious to say the least.

But the man at the top, self-declared caretaker Prime Minister Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, wants to deliver a day of national pride.

He arrives at the event alongside an army of soldiers on horseback, their hooves clattering alongside an unnerving discordant soundtrack.

Teenager guilty of manslaughter for stabbing Afghan refugee in Twickenham park;Tuesday 24 January 2023 20:45, UK;[];[];"A teenager has been found guilty of manslaughter for stabbing an Afghan refugee to death just hours after he was sentenced for having a knife.

Hazrat Wali, 18, died from a 10cm deep wound in Craneford Way Playing Fields in Twickenham, southwest London, on 12 October 2021.

The 17-year-old boy had appeared at a magistrates' court on the morning of the killing to plead guilty to being caught with a knife two months before. The judge gave him a youth rehabilitation order.

In his murder trial, he claimed he hadn't intended to cause Mr Wali, a student and aspiring cricketer, serious harm.

On Tuesday, an Old Bailey jury found him innocent of murder but guilty of the lesser alternative charge of manslaughter.

The court heard the victim had been sitting with a female friend on the day he died, when the defendant and five other teenagers approached them.

Prosecutors said a girl in the group said they ""looked nice together"" before the killer stared swearing at him.

Mr Wali stood up and approached him, and the defendant pushed him in the chest, challenging him to ""come at me then"".

Jurors were told Mr Wali rang a male friend for help, but the 17-year-old pulled out a 20cm black knife.

Mr Wali told his female friend to step away and as the pushing continued he was stabbed in the right side.

Image: The stabbing happened on playing fields. Pic: Google

He grabbed the defendant's jacket, asking: ""Why did you stab me?"" before picking up a fallen branch and collapsing as players from a school rugby match looked on.

The jury heard that a teacher gave first aid and emergency services were called, but Mr Wali died about an hour later.

The defendant told the court he had produced the knife as they were ""pushing each other"" and he wanted to be left alone.

He said he was ""scared"" when Mr Wali called his male friend for ""back-up"" and thought he might also have been carrying a knife.

At the time of the killing, he also claimed to have carried a knife because he didn't feel safe on the streets and after incidents in which he, a cousin and a friend were attacked.

He also described being involved in county lines drug dealing after being pressured by older boys in 2020 - who he claimed had threatened him.

The teenager, who can't be named because he's under 18, was remanded into youth detention and will be sentenced on 10 March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124204730/http://news.sky.com/story/teenager-guilty-of-manslaughter-for-stabbing-afghan-refugee-in-twickenham-park-12794433;Category-4: sports
Better home insulation could mean people live longer, study suggests;Tuesday 24 January 2023 23:57, UK;[];[];"Making homes better insulated and using renewable energy to power them could mean people live longer.

That's the conclusion of a new study that found net zero policies like home insulation, if successfully introduced, would ""significantly"" cut mortality in England and Wales by 2050.

The government's net zero strategy, published in 2021, sets out a pathway to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century.

An extra two million years of life lived would be added across the population by 2050, if the balanced pathway plan - a 60% reduction in emissions by 2035 - was implemented, said researchers.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 10:13 National Grid: Cash to reduce energy

The study looked at six net zero policies - it argued that retrofitting homes with insulation would be the most effective, resulting in an additional 836,000 life years for the population by the middle of the century.

Switching to renewable energy to power homes was the second most-effective policy, resulting in an extra 657,000 years over the same period, the modelling suggested.

Researchers said retrofitting homes, to make them more energy efficient and reduce consumption and emissions, would mean properties get warmer in the winter.

They argued that as long as there was adequate ventilation, then people would be exposed to less pollution generated indoors, like from particles and radon.

Radon is a natural radioactive gas which comes from the decay of uranium in rocks and soil, and can seep from the ground and get into homes through the floor.

The researchers stressed that without additional ventilation, the indoor generated pollution could build up inside properties, which is bad for people's overall health.

Retrofitting can include insulating roofs, walls and floors; replacement windows; improved ventilation design; airtightness works and more efficient heating and hot water systems.

Moving forward, those behind the study claimed it may even underestimate the health benefits of net zero policies, as they did not model all the potential health benefits of the policies' implementation.

The peer-reviewed study was published in the journal, The Lancet Planetary Health.

The Gambling Commission said the company, which operates a number of online sites including bonusboss.co.uk, had been slapped with a £6.1m penalty - its third fine related to oversight failures.

The issues at In Touch Games, the watchdog said, included not having appropriate policies, procedures and controls in place and not sufficiently considering or implementing the regulator's money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment or guidance.

It also accused the firm of not acting in customers' best interests.

The commission cited an example, saying In Touch had not interacted with a customer until seven weeks after they had been flagged for erratic and extended play.

It said a customer's word that they earned £6,000 a month had been accepted without verification until they were flagged for gambling during unsociable hours.

Met Police condemn 'sickening' child sexual offences by serving officer;Wednesday 25 January 2023 08:23, UK;[];[];"A serving Metropolitan Police officer has pleaded guilty to child sexual offences.

PC Hussain Chehab, 22, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 15 - as well as three counts of making indecent photographs of a child, and one of engaging in sexual communication with a child.

He appeared at Wood Green Crown Court in north London yesterday and was released on bail for sentencing on 17 March.

Chehab's offending came to light in July 2021 when the family of a 16-year-old girl raised concerns with police that she had recently been in a relationship with the officer, which they believed began when she was 15.

He was arrested the following month and placed on restricted duties, which involved no contact with schools or children.

A number of digital devices were seized and examined, during which a number of indecent images were found and he was further arrested in October 2021 and suspended from duty.

Analysis of further devices revealed messages between Chehab and a 14-year-old girl engaging in sexual communication. She later provided evidence to police that they had entered into a sexual relationship in 2019 when she was 14 years old.

Detective Chief Superintendent Caroline Haines said: ""Our thoughts foremost today are with the young girls who Chehab exploited and took advantage of for his own sexual gratification.

""These offences are made all the more sickening by the fact that some of the image offences were committed while PC Chehab was in a role as a Safer Schools officer attached to a secondary school in Enfield between May 2021 and his arrest in August 2021.""

She added: ""This news will of course cause considerable damage and concern, not only to the local community, but Londoners as a whole, who place their trust in police officers to go into our schools alongside their children every day and keep them safe.

Pub chain issues rallying cry to hospitality industry over tax 'disparity';Wednesday 25 January 2023 10:35, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"One of the UK's most prominent pub chain bosses has issued a rallying cry to the hospitality industry, saying a tax disparity is the biggest threat to its success.

JD Wetherspoon's chairman, Tim Martin, has long-complained about supermarkets' treatment when it comes to the payment of Value Added Tax (VAT), saying it gives them an unfair advantage - particularly at a time when the hospitality sector is struggling to recover from the COVID pandemic because of the cost of living crisis.

""Supermarkets pay zero VAT in respect of food sales, whereas pubs and restaurants pay 20%. This tax benefit allows supermarkets to subsidise the selling price of beer,"" he wrote.

""We estimate that supermarkets have taken about half of the pub industry's beer volumes since Wetherspoon started trading in 1979, a process that has likely accelerated following the pandemic.""

He complained: ""Pub industry directors have, in general, failed to campaign for tax equality, which is an important principle of taxation.

""Unless the industry campaigns strongly for equality, it will inevitably shrink relative to supermarkets, which will not help high streets, tourism, the economy overall, or the ancient institution of the pub.""

He made his remarks against a backdrop of strong trading for major supermarket chains, which benefited hugely from lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions as pubs and restaurants were forced to shut their doors.

Trading updates since Christmas have largely shown continued sales growth as shoppers eat and drink more at home because of the squeeze on their finances from energy-led inflation.

Mr Martin's plea was contained in an update to the market on the value-focused chain's performance.

He said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the current financial year despite its sales for the 25 weeks to 22 January falling below pre-pandemic levels.

Like-for-like sales were 0.7% lower than the corresponding period immediately before COVID.

Performance dropped further - by 2% - in the last 12 weeks, underscoring the hit to trading during the traditionally strong festive season.

Rivals have blamed the surge in living costs and disruption caused by rail strikes.

Wetherspoons, which has more than 900 pubs and hotels, said however that like-for-like sales were 13.1% higher for the 25 weeks from a year earlier.

Shares were more than 2% down in early deals.

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Wetherspoon's value offer is helping it to outperform its peers, and the recent steps it's taken to shore up the balance sheet leave it well placed to ride out the storm.

""As the clouds continue to darken for the hospitality sector, it may be a case of last man standing.

""Wetherspoon will in our opinion no doubt survive, and indeed prosper with increased market share for when the cycle turns. But in the short term, the news could well get worse before it gets better.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125104837/http://news.sky.com/story/pub-chain-issues-rallying-cry-to-hospitality-industry-over-tax-disparity-12794934;Category-2: business and economy

Sir Mark Rowley apologised to the victims of former officer David Carrick and said the public should ""prepare for more painful stories as we confront cases that… corrupt our integrity"".

What is the Doomsday Clock and how does it work?;Wednesday 25 January 2023 11:06, UK;[];[];"The Doomsday Clock has inched 10 seconds closer to midnight - the closest it has ever been to a global catastrophe.

But what does that actually mean?

Although only a metaphor for the dangers facing humanity, the clock is updated by those in the know about a range of risks.

The countdown is agreed on by experts at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

This year the clock has moved forward due to the ""mounting dangers of the war in Ukraine"".

With the increase in nuclear threat, political tensions, climate change and illnesses, experts believe that this could be a defining moment in history.

The latest update describes 2023 as ""a time of unprecedented danger"".

What is the Doomsday Clock and how is it set?

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - the creators of the clock - first launched the initiative in response to the threat of nuclear war in the 1940s.

Advertisement

After the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the Second World War, members of the Bulletin saw a need to help the public understand the scale of the nuclear threat to the existence of humanity.

To this day, the Bulletin's science and security board, made up of nuclear and climate experts, set the time for the clock. The board has done this since 1973, when it took over from Eugene Rabinowitch, Bulletin editor and disarmament campaigner.

The symbolism of the Doomsday Clock is powerful. If it were to strike midnight, it would mark the end of time and the theoretical point of annihilation for the human race.

The clock moves closer or further away from midnight based on how the experts on the board, plus academic colleagues and the Bulletin's sponsors - which include 13 Nobel laureates - read threats at a particular time around the globe.

Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight as Ukraine war rages

Ukraine war - follow our latest coverage

What have scientists said?

The latest update to the clock is the most dire since its inception.

In a statement released by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday, its experts said: ""Russia's thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict by accident, intention, or miscalculation is a terrible risk.""

The statement added: ""The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone's control remains high.""

The scientists said the war has ""increased the risk of nuclear weapons use, raised the spectre of biological and chemical weapons use, hamstrung the world's response to climate change, and hampered international efforts to deal with other global concerns"".

Image: The Russia-Ukraine war has moved the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight

The Bulletin's warning continued: ""The invasion and annexation of Ukrainian territory have also violated international norms in ways that may embolden others to take actions that challenge previous understandings and threaten stability.

""In this time of unprecedented global danger, concerted action is required, and every second counts.""

How have people reacted on social media?

The Doomsday Clock is not without its critics.

Some say it's an arbitrary act of scaremongering, masquerading as a more precise warning.

As Derek Thompson wrote on Tuesday: ""The Doomsday Clock is so absurd. How are news organizations still treating this joke of false precision with any kind of reverence? It's like meteorologists solemnly and humourlessly reporting the results of Groundhog Day.""

Twitter Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this. Open Privacy Options

However, others were more supportive of the concept. Another Twitter user, @harryhagopian, said the new time made sense to him as he was ""increasingly concerned"" about global security.

The Doomsday Clock's history

When it first began in 1947, the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight.

Artist Martyl Langsdorf came up with the idea of the clock and set the time to symbolise the dangers of nuclear confrontation, on the front cover of the Bulletin.

Since then it has been ticking away as political, nuclear and climate changes continued over the years, with experts revising the time up and down - mostly closer to midnight and its metaphor for total disaster.

There have been more reassuring years, though. In 1995 the clock was at 14 minutes to midnight, the safest reading in its history.

And there were ""positive strides"" in some years, such as the Paris climate agreement.

Ever since 1998, however, the hands of the clock have been at less than 10 minutes to midnight.

In 2020, scientists moved the hands of the clock forward to 100 seconds to midnight after the breakout of COVID-19.

The clock remained at 100 seconds till its latest announcement in 2023, bringing humanity 10 seconds closer to a ""global catastrophe"", in the view of some scientists at least.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125111731/http://news.sky.com/story/what-is-the-doomsday-clock-and-how-does-it-work-12794884;Category-6: science and technology

Adult Swim's Justin Roiland decision means Rick and Morty voices will be recast as co-creator leaves show over allegations;Wednesday 25 January 2023 12:40, UK;[];[];"The voices of US comedy characters Rick and Morty will be recast, after the show's co-creator Justin Roiland was dropped amid domestic violence allegations against him.

The 42-year-old - who co-created the Adult Swim animated series and voices the two title characters - has been charged over an incident involving an ex-girlfriend. He denies the allegations.

Rick and Morty has aired for six seasons on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim night-time programming block, and has been renewed for a seventh.

A statement from Adult Swim said the popular US cartoon would continue despite the writer's absence.

A statement released online by Adult Swim on Tuesday said: ""Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland.

""Rick and Morty will continue. The talented and dedicated crew are hard at work on season seven.""

A criminal complaint filed by prosecutors in May 2020, and seen by NBC News, charged Roiland with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, fraud, and violence or deceit against the woman, who he was living with at the time.

The woman was not identified in court documents. Roiland has pleaded not guilty.

The charges concern an incident in January of 2020 and Roiland was charged in May of that year. However, the charges apparently went unnoticed by media outlets until NBC News reported them.

Further documents seen by NBC News show Roiland was arrested and released on a $50,000 (£41,000) bond in August 2020 before returning to court in October 2020.

Rupert Murdoch abandons bid to reunite News Corp and Fox Corp;Wednesday 25 January 2023 13:43, UK;[];[];"A proposed reunion of two parts of Rupert Murdoch's empire has been abandoned by the media tycoon.

The 91-year old and his son Lachlan had floated the idea of bringing together News Corp, the US company behind the Wall Street Journal, Harper Collins and The Times newspaper, and Fox News owner Fox Corp.

The two companies were split in 2013 in a move designed to draw a line between the publishing businesses, which was struggling at the time, and its entertainment division.

The board of News Corp said last year it had formed a committee to independently assess whether the reunification of the two businesses would be in shareholders' interests.

Several top investors had since spoken out against the idea, suggesting it could have undervalued News Corp.

The Murdoch family controls about 40% of the entities.

The proposed tie-up was perceived, in some quarters, as potential succession planning by Murdoch Sr to consolidate power behind his son, the Fox chief, though that prospect was dismissed as ""absurd"" by the company last November.

News Corp said: ""The company's board of directors received a letter from K Rupert Murdoch withdrawing the proposal to explore a potential combination of News Corp and Fox Corporation.

""In withdrawing the proposal, Mr Murdoch indicated that he and Lachlan K Murdoch have determined that a combination is not optimal for shareholders of News Corp and Fox at this time.""

By later in the morning, Downdetector showed the number of reports had dropped considerably.

Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN.

The firm later tweeted it had rolled back a network change it believed was causing the issue and was using ""additional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process"".

A man stabbed several people on board a train travelling from Kiel to Hamburg, German news agency dpa reported.

Officers arrested a suspect shortly after the attack which the Bild newspaper said occurred as the train was arriving at Brokstedt station in northern Germany.

Police spokesman Juergen Henningsen said three people were severely injured and four others suffered minor injuries - but no further details were given about the identity of the victims.

The attacker was also injured and taken to the hospital, with police saying he was between 20 to 30 years old without providing any further information on the suspect.

attack with casualties, while police said an initial investigation indicated seven people were wounded.

NHS crisis: The journey through the emergency system;;[];[];"Across almost every part of the NHS that you can measure, it is performing worse now than it ever has done before.

And not just slightly worse. We're talking about scales of magnitude, even compared with just before the pandemic when there had already been a decade of decline.

Ambulances for strokes are three times slower. Forty times more people in A&E wait more than 12 hours for hospital beds to become available before they can be admitted. Over 200 times more people have been waiting a year for routine surgery.

The average heart attack sufferer in England in December waited an hour-and-a-half before an ambulance got to them.

When that ambulance arrived at the hospital, they waited another half an hour for space in A&E. Then it was four more hours waiting to be assessed by a health professional, and four more waiting for a hospital bed.

That's 10 hours in total, and that's normal.

Leah Croucher murder: Prime suspect may have changed his appearance to avoid being recognised, police say;Thursday 26 January 2023 03:53, UK;[];[];"Police investigating the murder of teenager Leah Croucher have released a new e-fit image of the prime suspect - and said he likely changed his appearance to ""avoid being recognised"".

In a new appeal, Thames Valley Police said convicted sex offender Neil Maxwell is likely to have grown a beard and ""may have lost weight"" to evade capture.

Maxwell was found dead in April 2019 after he took his own life, and detectives are appealing for information so they can confirm he killed the 19-year-old.

Leah disappeared on her way to work at a finance company in Milton Keynes on 15 February 2019.

Her remains were discovered more than three years after she went missing in the loft of a house in Furzton in October last year.

The murder investigation is continuing.

In an update, Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said Maxwell ""knew"" he was wanted in connection with a sexual assault investigation that occurred in 2018 and appeared to have made ""extensive efforts to evade arrest"" by using false names.

""He is likely to have known that he would be returning to prison if he was arrested and convicted.

""The investigation has now also established that Maxwell is likely to have changed his appearance to avoid being recognised. He had grown a beard and may have lost weight.""

The victim's four-wheeled scooter was found abandoned on Bisley Old Road by a member of the public shortly before 8am on Sunday.

A post-mortem returned inconclusive results about the cause of the man's death, and an investigation is ongoing, police said.

From 'iron lungs' to test tube babies - a visual history of the NHS;;[];[];"The 'Iron Lung'

It looks like a metal coffin on legs, but the iron lung machine was considered pioneering life-support technology in the early 20th century.

Patients were placed inside a box with their whole body covered, apart from the head. The box was attached to a set of bellows to pump air in and out, allowing people to breathe.

NHS crisis: This is where - and why - there are long waits for emergency care;;[];[];"Across almost every part of the NHS that you can measure, it is performing worse now than it ever has done before.

And not just slightly worse. We're talking about scales of magnitude, even compared with just before the pandemic when there had already been a decade of decline.

Ambulances for strokes are three times slower. Forty times more people in A&E wait more than 12 hours for hospital beds to become available before they can be admitted. Over 200 times more people have been waiting a year for routine surgery.

We're going to take you on a journey through each stage of the emergency system, to explain where and why the long waits come in, as well as hearing the stories of people who've been caught up in them.

We're not talking about the extraordinary cases of people waiting whole days for an ambulance. We're not talking about strike days or exceptional circumstances. We're talking about the ordinary, average, frustrating journey for someone seeking emergency care in Britain in 2023.

The average heart attack sufferer in England in December waited an hour-and-a-half before an ambulance got to them.

When that ambulance arrived at the hospital, they waited another half an hour for space in A&E. Then it was four more hours waiting to be assessed by a health professional, and four more waiting for a hospital bed.

That's 10 hours in total, and that's normal.

Half of patients would have been seen faster, to a greater or lesser extent, but the other half would have had an even longer wait.

UK car production slumps to 66-year low but improvement expected ahead;Thursday 26 January 2023 08:11, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"UK car production fell to its lowest level since 1956 last year, according to industry figures showing that the global shortage of parts continued to drag on performance.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) had already reported how the sale of new vehicles in 2022 was severely damaged by the lack of key components, particularly semiconductor chips.

COVID-led supply chain disruption harmed the ability of UK factories to drive availability to meet demand, though there is optimism the worst is now behind the sector.

Although 2022 will not be considered a success, there was limited progress in efforts to produce more zero emission or more climate-friendly vehicles as the clock ticks down towards the 2030 ban on the sale of new cars powered by diesel and petrol.

A total of 775,014 cars were built in 2022, the SMMT said.

That was down almost 10% from the 859,575 made during the previous year and 40.5% below pre-COVID crisis levels in 2019.

The SMMT said the figures were distorted by the closure of Honda's factory in Swindon in July 2021 and the decision by Stellantis to stop producing the Vauxhall Astra in Ellesmere Port in April 2022 to produce electric vans instead.

The bright spark was the production of 234,066 fully electric, or battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and hybrid (HEV) electric vehicles.

It was a record total, with combined production up 4.5% versus 2021.

Hybrids and BEVs accounted for 30.2% of all car production, the SMMT said.

Independent forecasts suggest the reopening of the Chinese economy from COVID restrictions should help drive a 15% increase in UK output this year as crucial chips become more readily available.

There are challenges.

These include the risk of investment flowing to the United States due to heavy government subsidies.

The collapse of the Britishvolt electric vehicle battery start-up has also raised fears over the domestic supply chain ahead of the 2030 deadline.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: ""The potential for this sector to deliver economic growth by building more of these zero-emission models is self-evident; however, we must make the right decisions now.

""This means shaping a strategy to drive rapid upscaling of UK battery production and the shift to electric vehicles based on the UK automotive sector's fundamental strengths - a highly skilled and flexible workforce, engineering excellence, technical innovation and productivity levels that are among the best in Europe.""

A government spokesperson said of the state of affairs: ""We are determined to ensure the UK remains one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing.

""Our success is evidenced by the £1bn investment in Sunderland in 2021, and we are building on this through a major investment programme to electrify our supply chain and create jobs.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126082455/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-car-production-slumps-to-66-year-low-but-acceleration-expected-ahead-12795661;Category-2: business and economy
Man charged with assaulting Matt Hancock on London Underground;Thursday 26 January 2023 11:20, UK;[];[];"A 61-year-old man has been charged with assaulting former health secretary Matt Hancock on the London Underground.

Geza Tarjanyi, from Leyland, Lancashire, faces three counts - one of common assault and two public order offences, British Transport Police said.

He has been released on bail and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 22 February.

Mr Hancock is understood to have been unhurt after the alleged attack on Tuesday which began at Westminster station before continuing on a Tube train.

The second public order offence relating to the MP for West Suffolk is alleged to have taken place on 19 January in nearby Parliament Street.

The 44-year-old was health secretary when the coronavirus pandemic struck - and was a key figure in the lockdown restrictions and vaccine rollout that followed.

He resigned from his cabinet post in June 2021 after pictures were leaked of him having an affair with his former aide in his office, breaking guidance about mixing with other households.

In November last year he appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and surpassed the expectations of many by reaching the final but finished in third place.

Footballer Joelinton fined more than half a week's wages for drink driving;Thursday 26 January 2023 11:20, UK;[];[];"The Newcastle United footballer Joelinton has been fined nearly £30,000 - more than half a week's wages - after admitting drink driving.

The Premier League midfielder, 26, was stopped by police in Newcastle at around 1.20am on January 12.

The Brazilian failed a breath test, which showed he had 43mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath when the legal limit is 35mg.

District Judge Paul Currer fined him £29,000 and banned him from driving for 12 months, which will be reduced to nine months if he completes a rehabilitation course.

The judge calculated the fine on his weekly wage, which is £43,000.

He must also pay a £2,000 surcharge and £85 costs.

Charged as Joelinton Cassio, and living in Ponteland, Northumberland, he wore a dark suit, white shirt and black tie and was accompanied to Newcastle Magistrates' Court by a club security official.

Prosecuting, Jonathan Stirland, said officers saw his car driving at speed near the football ground, and asked him to stop - to which Joelinton obliged, telling them he drank two glasses of wine earlier in the evening.

Defending, Geoffrey Forester added: ""He will be subject of disciplinary proceedings within the club once this process has concluded.""

Judge Currer told the court he took the footballer's early guilty plea, and his compliance with police, into consideration, adding he was convinced that player was remorseful.

He did however warn Joelinton that drink-driving was a serious offence.

He told the player: ""What is clear to me is you accept you have made a grave mistake and a significant error of judgment.

""You placed yourself in real jeopardy, and it could have had disastrous consequences for the lives of others.

""I sincerely hope you have learned from this mistake, and we don't see you in this court again.""

Ex-chancellor Philip Hammond says he would not have accepted job if taxes were under investigation;Thursday 26 January 2023 11:25, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];[];"The former chancellor Philip Hammond said he would not have accepted the job if he was being investigated by the tax office.

Asked by Sky News if it was ""acceptable"" that Nadhim Zahawi paid a penalty to HM Revenue & Customs to settle a tax dispute while in charge of the Treasury, Mr Hammond said: ""My own personal view is that I would not want to accept the office of chancellor if I was at that time involved in a live negotiation of an outstanding tax case with HMRC.""

Mr Zahawi was chancellor in the closing days of the Boris Johnson administration and Mr Hammond said the former prime minister ""has questions to answer"" about his appointment to the cabinet.

""If he was aware of these issues, then I think the question falls at his door,"" he said.

""Why did he appoint somebody to this role who clearly was not in a position to carry out that function?""

Mr Sunak has asked his ethics adviser to investigate whether Mr Zahawi, now the Tory party chairman, breached the ministerial code with the estimated £4.8m HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his previous tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

Mr Hammond was chancellor under Theresa May and has previously called Mr Johnson ""not a good prime minister"".

Asked if Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, should take some blame, Lord Hammond said: ""Well, ultimately it's the prime minister who makes the decision who to appoint, who not to appoint to his cabinet, and what offices they should hold.

""It would have been a very different question if Nadhim Zahawi was being appointed to a different office of state.

Asda shake-up risks job cuts and lower pay for 4,000 night workers;Thursday 26 January 2023 12:26, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Asda's owners have revealed a planned shake-up that places hundreds of jobs at risk and will see thousands moved to lower-paid roles.

The UK's third-largest grocery chain by market share said its changes were the result of an ""efficiency"" drive but they were met with stinging criticism by the GMB union.

The company has proposed that some overnight restocking shifts at 184 stores are moved to the daytime, putting 211 night shift manager roles at risk.

Asda said the changes would also affect 4,137 hourly-paid workers as their shift patterns would also move to the daytime, resulting in the loss of their night shift pay premium of at least £2.52 per hour.

The plans would also see the opening hours for 23 in-store Post Office branches cut by a quarter and seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers, closed down.

The shake-up comes at a time when supermarket profitability has been squeezed by the need to cut prices and compete as discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to eat away at the established grocers' customer bases amid the cost of living crisis.

Value ranges and essentials have formed the main battle ground, with the sector signalling last year that the days when they competed for customers through loss-leading fuel offerings were over.

Asda retail director Ken Towle said: ""The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible so that we can continue to invest and grow our business.

""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals.

""We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.""

The GMB union said its reps would be meeting later on Thursday to discuss its response but hinted that a fight was looming, fearing that more than 4,000 jobs could actually be lost.

National officer Nadine Houghton said: ""The real term impact of this on low-paid retail colleagues is that a night colleague on 30 hours stands to lose in the region of £300 to £400 a month, during a cost-of-living crisis.""

She added: ""For this reason, we expect the proposals to result in significant job losses.

""GMB is also concerned the proposals are quite simply unworkable due to a reduced amount of time being made available to replenish the shop floor.""

The union has been highly critical of Asda's owners, particularly on the issue of pay, in the wake of their debt-fuelled takeover in 2021.

The Times reported last week that Asda could be merged with petrol forecourts business EG Group - also owned by Zuber and Mohsin Issa and London-based private equity group TDR Capital.

UK must respond as prospect of transatlantic trade war looms large;Thursday 26 January 2023 13:46, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"It is laughably misnamed - but there is nothing funny about President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act if you are from outside the United States.

The act, signed into law in August last year, has absolutely nothing to do with tackling the cost of living crisis.

Rather, it is a gigantic piece of pump-priming, a $369bn package dangling generous subsidies and incentives to stimulate the take-up and roll-out of green energy across the US.

It is specifically aimed at encouraging more manufacturing of electric vehicles, and the batteries that power them, in the United States.

Businesses, particularly those involved in making things essential for the energy transition such as wind turbines and solar panels, will obviously benefit.

So, too, will households. Among the act's provisions are lobs to individual households, with tax credits worth up to $7,500 for those who buy new electric vehicles, while those buying EVs that are at least two years old could qualify for credits worth up to $4,000.

To put the size of those bungs in context, the median annual salary for an American worker last year was $54,132. The credits, naturally, will go only to those households buying EVs built in the US.

Image: The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act has been widely criticised abroad

Great news, then, for US households and businesses.

The EU, however, is horrified. It believes the act breaks World Trade Organisation rules that forbid countries like the US from discriminating against imported goods and has warned it could retaliate.

Also unhappy are Canada, which has been jogged into rolling out more green subsidies of its own, while Japan and South Korea have also been aggrieved.

The act, then, threatens to spark a trade war. Such risks were common during the presidency of Donald Trump, who frequently threatened the EU with tariffs, for example in retaliation for penalties on the US tech giants.

Mr Trump also engaged in tit-for-tat trade disputes with China. Mr Biden's approach to both China and trade disputes more broadly appears very little different from that of his predecessor.

It all presents a dilemma for the EU. Does it either seek to retaliate under WTO rules or does it respond with similar subsidies of its own, as has been urged by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister?

Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition chief, indicated in a speech on Wednesday in Brussels that she favours a mix of measures. Describing the US measures as ""toxic"", she said the EU's response would be ""firm, but of course it will remain proportionate."" At the same time, though, she has called for ""an EU green deal industrial plan"".

Note that very precise wording. It goes to the heart of the EU's problem.

Countries like France and Germany, with big manufacturing bases to support, would be more than happy to subsidise such activities and, due to the size of their economies and the financial firepower at their disposal, would have little difficulty in doing so. Other EU member states, though, might struggle.

As Ms Vestager put it in her speech on Wednesday: ""The reality in the EU today is that not all countries have the same capacity to spend. This means that a subsidy race between the member states will always be inherently unfair.""

She said that, while Brussels might seek to offer tax breaks to support new investments in the green economy, this would have to be done in a way that did not pit member states against each other or threaten the integrity of the EU's single market - integrity which, as the UK has discovered to its cost with the Northern Ireland Protocol, the bloc will go to great lengths to defend.

Ms Vestager added: ""We will not sacrifice the single market. Because a well-functioning single market is part of the engine that will make this work.""

In other words, stand by for a classic dose of EU fudge, aimed at supporting the green economy in the way Mr Biden aims to in the US but that will, in the process, probably involve individual protection or support for favoured groups. An industrial equivalent, if you like, of singling out French cheese producers or Italian olive farmers for special help.

Caught between these two blocs, at risk of being tossed like a cork on the high seas, is post-Brexit Britain.

Now outside the single market, there is little in principle to stop the UK offering big subsidies to manufacturers supporting the green transition. But British companies might also be at risk of being caught in the cross-fire should the EU choose to respond to Mr Biden's act by rolling out subsidies for its manufacturers.

And, as business leaders have been stressing this week, there is not a moment to lose.

As Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, noted in a well-received speech: ""The UK is falling behind rapidly - to the Americans and the Europeans, who are outspending and outsmarting us. We're behind the Germans on heat-pumps, insulation and building retrofits, the French on EV charging infrastructure, and the US on operational carbon capture and storage projects - despite the UK's North Sea advantage. We're lagging all three on hydrogen funding.

""We believe the UK could lead the world on green growth as we did in setting net zero targets. But we're on the verge of being relegated from the Champions League by the Americans and the Europeans: both in an arms race to win global market share.

""Not only are they spending money, they're abandoning regulatory barriers including state aid to win the prize. That's a lesson for us on what it means to go big.""

Doing nothing is not an option, either, as Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has made clear.

Releasing data that showed UK car production last year fell to its lowest level since 1956, the year of the Suez Crisis, Mr Hawes said the UK government has ""got to do something"" in response to Mr Biden's act and the potential EU response.

He added: ""You can't just accept this laissez faire approach to investment, it's not a level playing field.""

The problem is that, with the public finances shattered by the pandemic and now under strain due to both surging debt servicing costs and the cost of subsidising energy bills, the UK is in no position to throw as much money at green subsidies as either the US or the EU.

All is not lost, though. Mr Danker believes it is possible to ""make smart fiscal choices rather than believing we can outspend the competition"", such as supporting immature technologies, while engaging in long overdue reform of the UK's sclerotic, anti-growth planning rules.

The question, as he noted, is whether the political willpower exists to do this.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126143236/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-must-respond-as-prospect-of-transatlantic-trade-war-looms-large-12795945;Category-2: business and economy

Maria Branyas Morera was born in San Francisco on 4 March 1907 - seven years before the start of World War One.

In just over a month, she will be 116.

Her parents decided to return to Spain in 1915 to settle in Catalonia but her father died from pulmonary tuberculosis towards the end of the voyage.

Ms Morera, whose Twitter biography says she is ""very old but not an idiot"", has lived in the region ever since.

She has three children, 11 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.

In 2020, she fought off COVID within a few days after becoming infected a few weeks after celebrating her 113th birthday.

Her predecessor as the world's previous oldest person, French nun Sister Andre, died at the age of 118 last week.

""She is in good health and continues to be surprised and grateful for the attention that this anniversary has generated,"" the home said in a statement.

""To celebrate this very special event we will have a small celebration behind closed doors in the residence in the coming days.""

With the help of her daughter, Ms Morera shares advice on Twitter, attributing her longevity to ""order, tranquillity, good connection with family and friends, contact with nature, emotional stability, no worries, no regrets, lots of positivity, and staying away from toxic people"".

She added: ""I think longevity is also about being lucky. Luck and good genetics.""

Ms Morera said she had ""very bad memories"" of the Spanish Civil War, which broke out in 1936 when she was 29.

She married her husband, a Catalan doctor called Joan Moret, in 1931.

After waiting hours for the priest, the couple were told he had died.

""There was no phone,"" she said on Twitter. ""A car had to go down to Girona to look for an available chaplain.

""At that time, in the entire province of Girona, there must have been around 50 cars.""

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to dismiss 'gloom' about economy - but set to resist calls for tax cuts;Friday 27 January 2023 01:16, UK;[];[];"The chancellor will dismiss ""gloom"" about the prospects for the UK economy and say the government will bring about long-term prosperity in a plan ""energised"" by Brexit.

Mr Hunt will deliver an upbeat message in a keynote speech today, where he will say the government has a plan to use ""British genius and British hard work"" to boost economic growth and make the country ""the world's next Silicon Valley"".

He will go on to say the UK is ""poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century"".

According to advance extracts from his speech released by the Treasury, he will also say ""declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today"".

Speaking at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, Mr Hunt is also expected to continue to resist calls from some Tory MPs for tax cuts to kickstart flagging economic growth.

Instead he will say the UK should exploit the opportunities provided by the UK's withdrawal from the EU to raise productivity while using the proceeds of growth to support public services.

Mr Hunt will say that some of the ""gloom"" about the current economic outlook is based on statistics that ""do not reflect the whole picture"".

""Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it,"" he will say.

""But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany.

""If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.""

""(And) world-beating enterprises to make Britain the world's next Silicon Valley.""

The chancellor will add: ""It is a plan necessitated, energised and made possible by Brexit which will succeed if it becomes a catalyst for the bold choices we need to take.

""Our plan for growth is a plan built on the freedoms which Brexit provides. It is a plan to raise productivity.

""It is a plan to use the proceeds of growth to support our public services at home, to support businesses in the new low-carbon economy and to support democracy abroad.

Mr Hunt will also use his speech to announce that the government is to proceed with reforms to so-called ""Solvency II"" - an EU directive that governs the amount of funds British insurers are required to hold in reserve.

The chancellor is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut taxes in his budget in March to inject growth into the economy.

But at Chequers, both he and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak emphasised the priority remained inflation which was only predicted to fall because of the ""tough decisions"" taken to stabilise the economy following former PM Liz Truss's catastrophic mini-budget tax giveaway.

The HS2 project has been dogged by criticism over its financial and environmental impact.

In October 2021, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove suggested capital investment for HS2 would be reviewed, but Chancellor Jeremy Hunt subsequently backed the project.

The target cost of Phase 1 between London and Birmingham was £40.3bn at 2019 prices.

A budget of £55.7bn for the whole of HS2 was set in 2015.

Penny Gaines of the campaign group Stop HS2 said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs are spiralling out of control.

Scientists solve mystery behind 17th-century warship wreck found off Sussex coast;Friday 27 January 2023 03:15, UK;[];[];"Scientists have solved the mystery of the identity of a 17th-century Dutch warship wrecked off the coast of England while carrying slabs of fine Italian marble.

While the wreck sank in 1672 and was discovered in 2019 off the coast of Sussex, until now it was known as the ""Unknown Wreck off Eastbourne"".

However, scientists have now identified the wreck as the Dutch warship Klein Hollandia.

Built in 1656 and owned by the Admiralty of Rotterdam, the ship was involved in all major battles in the second Anglo-Dutch war from 1665 to 1667.

Over the past year, specialists from Historic England, the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and the Nautical Archaeology Society have been working on identifying the ship.

They used evidence gathered from the wreck, as well as archival research and tree ring analysis of the wood samples.

Experts say the wreck's condition is remarkable and could offer a wealth of information about how 17th-century Dutch ships were built and the activities of the warship during its final voyage.

Heritage minister Lord Parkinson said the identification ""offers a glimpse back into the 17th century, giving us a chance to learn more about the maritime history of this period and to uncover treasures which have been underwater for hundreds of years"".

Upon its discovery, the wreck was considered so important that it was granted the highest level of protection in the same year, under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.

A large part of the wooden hull, cannons, Italian marble tiles and pieces of Italian pottery were among the material found on the seabed.

The marble tiles came from the Apuan Alps quarries close to Carrara in Italy.

The tiles were bound for the Netherlands and would have been used to build high-status homes.

The wreck was discovered by Eastbourne dive operator David Ronnan and reported to Historic England. Mr Ronnan and Mark Beattie-Edwards are the licensees and have been investigating the wreck.

Woman, 29, arrested after allegedly posing as a high school pupil and spending four days in classes;Friday 27 January 2023 04:36, UK;[];[];"A 29-year-old woman has been arrested after she allegedly spent four days fraudulently enrolled as a high school student in New Jersey.

Hyejeong Shin, from New Brunswick in the state, has been charged with one count of providing a false government document with the intent to verify one's identity or age, NBC News reports.

Police said she showed a false birth certificate ""with the intent to enrol as a juvenile high school student"".

""Last week, by filing some false documents, an adult female posing as a student was able to be enrolled in our high school,"" New Brunswick Public School District Superintendent Aubrey Johnson said at a board of education meeting.

During her days in school, Shin spent a lot of time with guidance counsellors who were trying to find out more information about her, Mr Johnson added.

He said staff members at the school ""uncovered this woman's ruse and enabled us to address this situation promptly"".

""Once our staff determined it was dealing with fraudulent information, they immediately notified the appropriate authorities. The individual in question has now been charged,"" Mr Johnson said in a statement on Wednesday.

The school has warned students to refrain from having any further contact with the woman, in person and remotely, he added.

Mr Johnson said the district will take a look at its enrolment process to better identify false documentation.

""This is an unfortunate event. Communication has been provided to the parents of individuals that the young lady may have come into contact with, and communication has been provided to all high school parents today,"" Mr Johnson said.

Police have said schools are required to ""immediately enrol unaccompanied children, even in the absence of records normally required for enrolment"".

However, a district can request such documents later to verify a student's age.

The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said it is not investigating the incident.

Shop occupancy rates improve despite cost of living crisis;Friday 27 January 2023 05:29, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The number of shops lying vacant on British high streets fell during the final three months of 2022, despite pressure on both firms and consumers from surging costs.

Figures in a report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Local Data Company (LDC) showed the overall vacancy rate improving to 13.8%.

It marked a 0.1 percentage point improvement on the July-September period, the report showed.

The total was also 0.6 percentage points better than the same period last year and marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling vacancy rates in the wake of the COVID pandemic.

Despite government support, a swathe of chains and independent stores closed amid the public health restrictions.

A shift towards online shopping and staying at home during the pandemic was soon followed by a surge in costs following the reopening, with stores and hospitality struggling to recruit staff at the same time.

Costs tied to the reopening were exacerbated by energy-led inflation which is still, industry says, claiming victims by the day as many struggle to pay their way at a time of depressed spending by consumers.

The report showed that Greater London, the South East and East of England had the lowest vacancy rates.

While the highest rates were in the North East, followed by Wales and the West Midlands.

The North East, however, was seeing the highest rates for store openings.

Jeremy Hunt to dismiss economic 'gloom' as pressure builds from Tories over tax cuts;Friday 27 January 2023 09:02, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];[];"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will dismiss economic ""gloom"" in a major speech today as he promises to use ""Brexit freedoms"" to increase growth and productivity in the UK.

Speaking at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, he will attack ""declinism"", instead saying the country is ""poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century"".

But his speech will come against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis, ongoing strikes over pay, and demands from some of his party to focus on tax cuts to boost the economy.

Chancellor's speech as it happens - politics latest

Mr Hunt took over the Treasury under the turmoil of Liz Truss' government, which saw her and her first chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announce a raft of unfunded tax cuts, which saw the markets react badly.

As a result, his first speeches from Number 11 focused on the dire situation the country was left in, telling the public it was ""likely to get worse before it gets better"".

But it appears the chancellor will now seek to echo some of the former prime minister's optimistic language around growth that proved so popular with Conservative Party members, saying the government has a plan for ""long-term prosperity based on British genius and British hard work"".

Mr Hunt will say: ""Declinism about Britain was wrong in the past - and it is wrong today. Some of the gloom is based on statistics that do not reflect the whole picture.

""Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it. But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany.

""If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.""

Sky News' business presenter, Ian King, warned the comparisons had been ""very, very carefully selected… to paint the UK in a positive light"". He added: ""Probably more pertinent is the fact that the UK economy is the only one in the G7… whose economy remains smaller than it was going into the pandemic.""

While Labour's Andrew Gwynne said people were not ""talking down the country"", but the Tory government was ""running down the country"".

He told Sky News: ""We've had 13 years of the same messaging. Tory chancellor, after Tory chancellor has talked about the need for growth, the need for productivity, the need for investment over the long term, the need for infrastructure, the need for levelling up.

""If I had a pound for every time a Tory chancellor spoke about all these things, I could pay Nadhim Zahawi's tax bill.

""The proof of the pudding is in the eating and we don't need the same old tired message. What we need is a real plan for growth.""

Inflation priority

The speech comes two months ahead of his first full budget, and a number of Tory MPs are pushing for him to introduce tax cuts to bring down the historically high tax burden under the premiership of Rishi Sunak.

Former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the Daily Express: ""The government must make it very clear that we believe in lowering the tax, lowering costs, giving people greater choice.

""That always seems to me to be a positive message to send - rather than saying simply you can't do tax cuts, that's a negative.""

But Mr Hunt is expected to resist such calls, with both him and Mr Sunak sticking to their guns that lowering record inflation is the key priority.

A readout from the cabinet's awayday at Chequers yesterday said he told his colleagues ""it would be necessary to retain this disciplined approach in order to reduce inflation, because it is the greatest driver of the cost of living"".

Instead, the chancellor will talk about exploiting what he claims are the opportunities of Brexit in order to kickstart the economy.

""Confidence in the future starts with honesty about the present, and we should not shy away from the biggest challenge we face which is our poor productivity,"" he will say. ""Our plan for long term prosperity tackles that challenge head on.

""It is a plan necessitated, energised and made possible by Brexit which will succeed if it becomes a catalyst for the bold choices we need to take.

""Our plan for growth is a plan built on the freedoms which Brexit provides. It is a plan to raise productivity. It is a plan to use the proceeds of growth to support our public services at home, to support businesses in the new low carbon economy and to support democracy abroad.

""It is the right course for our country and the role in the world to which we aspire.""

However, many experts believe Brexit has contributed to the UK's struggling economy due to increased trade barriers with the EU.

Mr Hunt will also use his speech to announce that the government is to proceed with reforms to so-called ""Solvency II"" - an EU directive that governs the amount of funds British insurers are required to hold in reserve.

Laura Winham, 38, lay dead in her flat in Woking for more than three years;Friday 27 January 2023 13:49, UK;[];[];"A woman was found in a ""mummified and skeletal state"" after lying dead in her flat for more than three and a half years.

Laura Winham, 38, was discovered at her home in Woking, Surrey, by her brother in May 2021.

Dental records showed she died in November 2017, the family's solicitors said, adding that she had ""only a small amount of spare change to her name"".

The markings on her calendar stopped, shortly after she had written ""I need help"".

Hudgell Solicitors said Ms Winham's rent continued to be paid through housing benefits, and a gas safety check was registered as having been carried out by contractors in January 2018, two months after she died.

Her sister, Nicky, said the family were unable to maintain contact with her.

Years of schizophrenia had led her to believe they would harm her, she said.

""Nobody ever physically checked on her,"" the solicitors said, despite her being sectioned twice, first in 2006.

The gas supply to her property was cut off in January 2019, they added.

Surrey Police said it was satisfied there was ""no third-party involvement"" in Ms Winham's death.

A spokeswoman said officers found the body on 24 May 2021. She added: ""An investigation was completed and officers were satisfied that there was no third-party involvement. A file was passed to the coroner.

""Officers previously attended the address in October 2017. No offences were identified and a report was completed and shared with adult social care at that time.""

Nicky claimed social care and mental health teams had ""turned a blind eye"" and everybody with a duty of care had ""wiped their hands of her and forgot (Laura)"".

Speaking before a pre-inquest review at Surrey Coroner's Court, due to begin next week, her sister said: ""Laura has been so badly let down.

""It's just heart-breaking to think of how she lived in her last few years, unable to ask for help, without anyone there for her. It's just tragic.""

Solicitor Iftikhar Manzoor, acting for the family, said ""so many red flags"" were ""missed"".

He has written to the coroner calling for an Article 2 Inquest to be held, which would widen the scope to consider whether correct procedures were followed.

Nicky said the family initially felt ""reassured"" that Laura had been ""given her own home, she was entitled to benefits, she had her own car and some part-time work"".

The family also ""believed she would be supported by her mental health team and others moving forward"", Nicky added.

She went on: ""We always hoped she would get better with professional help and that one day our contact would resume. We never believed for one second we would end up finding her dead on her floor having laid there for so long without anyone knowing.

""We are sharing our story because we do not want any other families to suffer in this way.""

Surrey County Council and Woking Borough Council offered their ""heartfelt"" and ""deepest"" condolences to Ms Winham's family.

They said they would continue to support the coroner with their inquiries and the inquest process.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127134149/http://news.sky.com/story/laura-winham-38-lay-dead-in-her-flat-in-woking-for-more-than-three-years-12796622;Category-7: health

Gautam Adani: One of the world's richest men loses ground after £39bn stock market slump;Friday 27 January 2023 12:16, UK;[];[];"Shares in listed companies controlled by one of the world's richest men have lost $48bn (£39bn) in market value over three days following a report by a short seller that claimed he was behind the ""largest con in corporate history"".

Shares of Gautam Adani's flagship Adani Enterprises sank by 20% on Friday alone in the wake of Wednesday's report by New York-based Hindenburg Research that questioned his group's business practices and debt levels.

Wider stock market sentiment in India has also plunged in the wake of the study, with banks that have exposure to Adani firms coming under particular pressure.

The sector held 40% of the $24.5bn of Adani Group debt in the financial year to March 2022.

In addition to the report's concerns related to debt, flags were also raised about alleged improper use of entities set up in

offshore tax havens, stock market manipulation and accounting fraud.

The group has denied the accusations and said it is considering the prospect of legal action on the grounds that the report is baseless.

The Reuters news agency said that India's capital markets regulator was studying the Hindenburg report and could use it to aid its own ongoing investigation into offshore fund holdings of Adani Group.

Mr Adani's other listed entities have suffered big reductions to their market value - in line with Adani Enterprises.

They include Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports.

The stock market plunge has also seen Mr Adani's position tumble from third in the world's richest league.

With an estimated net worth of $97.6bn (£79bn) he is now the world's seventh richest man, according to Forbes.

Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president of research at SMC Global Securities, said of the market mayhem in India: ""The sell-off is seriously extreme ... it has clearly dented the overall investor sentiment.""

Morgan Stanley places bet on sale of high street gaming chain;Friday 27 January 2023 13:24, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"The Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley is to offload Britain’s biggest independent operator of high street slot machine venues.

Sky News has learnt that the bank, which owns GameNation through a fund that it manages, has hired bankers to kick off an auction of the business.

GameNation, which trades from 50 sites across the UK, was established by an experienced industry management tam with backing from North Haven Tactical Value Fund, a Morgan Stanley-managed entity.

According to one insider, the company is drawing up plans to form a digital partnership to complement its high street presence.

GameNation operates in the low-stakes segment of the regulated entertainment industry, with £2 maximum stakes and top jackpots of £500.

It has plans to expand further through the opening of new sites in the coming years, potential investors have been told.

One source said that GameNation, whose parent company is City Gaming, was likely to attract interest from gaming firms as well as private equity funds.

The company is run by Adam Hodges and Sina Azeri, its co-founders.

Global Leisure Partners has been hired to oversee the sale process, with initial bids due in March.

Tax List finds Russian-born billionaire has overtaken Bet356 family as UK's top taxpayer;Friday 27 January 2023 11:44, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"A Russian-born City billionaire is the UK's top taxpayer, according to a closely watched list.

Alex Gerko, the founder of XTX Markets who has British citizenship, was deemed to have stumped up £487.4m in the last tax year by the Sunday Times Tax List.

The sum is the equivalent of around £55,639 an hour, the report said, as it revealed a shake-up at the top of the rankings.

The founder of online gambling firm Bet365, Denise Coates, and her family were shifted into second place for the first time in the list's history.

They were said to have paid £460.2m to UK coffers on the back of their earnings.

The top ten taxpayers, main area of interest, and estimated sum:

• Alex Gerko (financial trading) £487.4m

• Denise, John and Peter Coates (gambling) £460.2m

• Stephen Rubin and family (sportswear) £392.3m

• Sir Chris Hohn (hedge fund) £263m

• Fred and Peter Done and family (gambling) £136.8m

• Mike Ashley (sports equipment and fashion) £133.5m

• Tim Martin (pubs) £123.2m

• Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan and family (food) £120.7m

• Tom Morris and family (retail) £112.2m

• Ian and Richard Livingstone (property) £104m

Image: Denise Coates and her family have headed the list for the past three years

Other big names in the top 100 include Sting, the Duke of Westminster and Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

Those making the list were liable for a total of almost £5.2bn of UK tax last year - with the top ten responsible for delivering £2.3bn alone - a rise of nearly 14% on the total reported 12 months ago.

The sums are calculated based on publicly available filings and can include corporation tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, income tax and payroll tax payments, along with any gambling and alcohol duties.

Who is Alex Gerko?

Mr Gerko - unlike many of the others making the top 100 - is not a household name.

He owns 75% of algorithm-led trading firm XTX which, according to Bloomberg, paid out a dividend of £1.3bn last March.

Mr Gerko has many charitable interests and those have reportedly included support for Ukraine-linked causes in the wake of Russia's invasion.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also under pressure on the issue of tax. He is facing pressure from critics on multiple fronts, with Tory backbenchers keen on tax cuts and others urging him to make the wealthiest pay more to help ease the budget deficit and pay striking public sector workers more.

In a speech today he appeared to rule out any immediate tax cuts while talking up Britain's economic prospects.

List raises questions about funding public services

Robert Watts, the list's author, said: ""You will find celebrities on the Tax List but many of the entries are people who quietly run largely unheralded businesses that have been creating jobs and paying millions of tax for decades or even centuries.

""So-called 'unicorn' tech firms may dominate the headlines, but they often aren't cash cows for the Treasury because they don't employ large numbers of people or show big profits.

""It's the long-established retailers, pub groups and other bricks-and-mortar businesses that often contribute more.

""There lies the challenge for the chancellor and his successors.

Chancellor's 'Britain needs you' plea to the retired may be a tall order;Friday 27 January 2023 14:39, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Jeremy Hunt became chancellor because he was the most sensible candidate left standing in the wake of Liz Truss's catastrophic mini-budget.

Four months on, he's earned praise for balancing the books but still had a blank space to fill in when it comes to growth - a crucial plank of economic policy in danger of becoming a dirty word after Truss pursued it over a cliff edge.

The economic circumstances remain deeply challenging, with inflation running above 10%, interest rates on the rise and public sector workers demanding pay rises while business and Conservative backbenchers want tax cuts to incentivise investment.

Two months before his first budget, the chancellor was not about to blow a reputation for rectitude by announcing detailed new policy.

Instead, we got a speech that, in tone if not style, could have been delivered by Boris Johnson, recasting the economic challenge as a debate between optimists and pessimists.

Brexit, Mr Hunt said, remains the opportunity on which future prosperity will be based, despite the myriad challenges reported by businesses at the sharp end.

He had statistics to prove it. Britain has performed ""about as well"" as Germany since 2016 and better than Japan, Italy and France on one measure of GDP since 2010.

Asked by Sky News whether it would be more honest to acknowledge that Brexit had failed to live up to promises, he said no.

""It's a big change in our economic relations with our closest neighbours and of course that is going to need adaptation,"" he said.

""Of course there is some short-term disruption, but I think it's completely wrong to just focus on that without looking at the opportunities.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:15 'Brexit is an opportunity'

Anyone denying the UK was well-placed to thrive was peddling ""declinism"", a characterisation with echoes of Johnson's ""gloomsters"" that channelled the crudest divisions of the referendum debate.

Those guilty, Mr Hunt said, include newspaper columnists on the left and right, and the Labour Party.

Judging by conversations in the margins of his speech, he also blames a number of Britain's largest employers, who have called for more business-friendly government policy.

For the backbenchers who have lobbied hard for tax cuts despite the recent trauma of Truss' unfunded giveaway, there was a clear message.

""The best tax cut right now is a cut in inflation,"" he said.

That means do not expect much in March.

For the audience in the room, entrepreneurs and investors in the new technologies, life sciences and advanced manufacturing crucial to delivering growth, the message was delivered with a broad brush.

He said enterprise and education were priorities, pointing to the natural advantages of the City of London and the brains trust of the UK's world-leading universities.

New investment worth up to £100bn would be unlocked when reforms to EU-era regulation governing the reserves held by insurance companies are finally passed ""in the coming months"", he said.

The chancellor did not deny that the economy faces challenges, referring to the ""productivity puzzle"" that has seen output still not recover to pre-pandemic levels.

He said increasing employment was the key, highlighting a shortage of workers that many businesses blame on new Brexit immigration controls.

Mr Hunt preferred to focus on the growth of ""economic inactivity"" - those of working age who are not in work, by choice or through illness.

Around one-in-five 16-64 year olds currently meet that definition, 6.6 million people once students are removed from the figures.

Mr Hunt promised help to get the long-term sick back to work and then made a striking direct appeal to retirees: ""To those who retired early after the pandemic, or haven't found the right role after furlough, I say - Britain needs you.""

Persuading those who don't need to work to come back to the daily grind may be a tall order.

Boxing promoter Leslie Allen, 66, recruited a group of people to help him get off charges of having £150,000 of cannabis and cocaine and a pepper spray in 2018.

However, the plot backfired ""spectacularly"" after other jurors in the Warwick Crown Court case became suspicious of Damien Drackley's behaviour during deliberations.

Drackley was reported to the judge who went on to convict Allen without the jury and jail him for 13 years.

After a trial at the Old Bailey, Allen, Drackley, 37, Mark Walker, 57, who was known as ""Walker the one-legged mechanic"", and Laurence ""Del Boy"" Hayden, 54, were found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Drackley's mother Lorraine Frisby, 56, from Birmingham, had admitted the charge and soliciting the disclosure of jury deliberations.

On Friday they were all handed jail sentences by Mr Justice Cavanagh.

Leader Allen was handed five years to run consecutively to his drugs sentence.

""Naive and foolish"" Drackley was given four years for his part in the plot.

Alan Cumming gives back OBE over links to 'toxic' British Empire;Friday 27 January 2023 14:54, UK;[];[];"Alan Cumming has given back his OBE, expressing concern over its links to what he describes as the ""toxicity"" of the British Empire.

The actor said he had made the decision to return the award after listening to conversations about the future of the Royal Family after the Queen's death.

Cumming was made an OBE in 2009 as part of the Queen's birthday honours, being recognised for acting, as well as the work he does to campaign for LGBTQ+ rights in the US.

He said at the time that he was ""shocked and delighted"" to be given the honour.

Writing on Instagram on his 58th birthday, he said: ""The Queen's death and the ensuing conversations about the role of monarchy and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes.

""Fourteen years ago, I was incredibly grateful to receive it in the 2009 Queen's birthday honours list, for it was awarded not just for my job as an actor but 'for activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community, USA'.

""Back then the Defence of Marriage Act ensured that same-sex couples couldn't get married or enjoy the same basic legal rights as straight people, and Don't Ask, Don't Tell ensured that openly gay, lesbian or bisexual people were barred from serving in the military.""

Man found naked and surrounded by Champagne guilty of bludgeoning father to death with 'bottle of Bollinger';Friday 27 January 2023 16:35, UK;[];[];"A man who bludgeoned his elderly father to death with a bottle of Champagne in a drunken rage is facing life in jail.

Deekan Singh Vig was found guilty on Friday of murdering 86-year-old shopkeeper Arjan Singh Vig at the family home in Southgate, north London.

The Old Bailey had heard how officers found the body of Mr Vig on the evening of Saturday 30 October, 2021, on the floor of his son's bedroom with his ""head caved in"".

His 54-year-old son was naked and surrounded by about 100 bottles of Champagne, including blood-stained bottles of Veuve Cliquot and Bollinger.

""I killed my dad. I hit him over the head with a f***ing bloody bottle of Bollinger champagne,"" he said.

Prosecutor Deanna Heer KC had said the victim had been hit repeatedly in the face and head with a full bottle of Champagne, causing extensive injuries and almost immediate death.

Jurors heard how Vig had lived with his father and mother in their four-bedroom detached home for about 40 years.

The court was told he had developed a taste for alcohol during the COVID lockdown.

On the evening of the killing, Mrs Vig heard vomiting noises from her son's room and he told her he had consumed half a bottle of whisky, jurors heard.

The last thing she saw was her husband comforting their son, but she called her daughter when he appeared to get ""out of control"".

She then dialled 999.

When police arrived, the defendant told them he could not open the door, saying: ""You're too late. He's been dead for an hour.""

Once officers gained entry, they saw Mr Vig's head had been ""severely caved in"" and it was obvious he was dead.

The defendant, who was naked and had blood on his hands, feet and legs, was Tasered and detained.

Later, he wept as he said: ""My dad is dead. I killed my dad. I hit him over the head with a f***ing bloody bottle of Bollinger champagne. Why did I kill my dad?""

At the crime scene, police found 100 bottles of Champagne, 10 Amazon delivery boxes of whisky bottles, and an empty bottle of Talisker Scotch on the bed.

Beside Mr Vig's body were two bottles of Champagne - one Veuve Cliquot and the other Bollinger - with a ""significant amount"" of blood on them.

Vig had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the basis that he did not intend to cause his father really serious harm.

A jury deliberated for less than a day to find him guilty of murder on Friday.

Judge Angela Rafferty adjourned sentencing until 10 February and remanded Vig in custody.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127164009/http://news.sky.com/story/man-found-naked-and-surrounded-by-champagne-guilty-of-bludgeoning-father-to-death-with-bottle-of-bollinger-12796793;Category-2: business and economy

Tyre Nichols: Last words of US man who died after police 'beating' were 'mum, mum, mum', says lawyer;Friday 27 January 2023 20:22, UK;[];[];"The final words of a US motorist who died after he was allegedly beaten by five police officers were ""mum, mum, mum"", according to a lawyer.

Tyre Nichols, 29, passed away in hospital three days after the confrontation following a traffic stop in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

Bodycam footage of the altercation is expected to be released later on Friday evening.

His family said the ""very horrific"" video showed officers savagely beating the FedEx worker for three minutes in an assault their lawyers likened to the Los Angeles police attack on motorist Rodney King in 1991.

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols's death.

Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing his family, said when the public watches the footage they will see him calling out for his mother.

He said: ""When you all see this video, you're going to see Tyre Nichols calling out for his mum.

""He calls out three times for his mother. His last words on this earth are, 'mum, mum, mum'. He's screaming for her. When you think about that kidnapping charge, he said 'I just want to go home'.""

""It's a traffic stop for God's sake. A simple traffic stop.""

Mr Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, told reporters: ""For a mother to know their child was calling them in their need and I wasn't there for him. Do you know how I feel right now? Because I wasn't there for my son.""

Ms Wells recalled she had ""a really bad pain in my stomach"" and once she found out what happened she realised ""that was my son's pain that I was feeling"".

""For me to find out my son was calling my name, you have no clue how I feel right now,"" she added, struggling to hold back tears.

She also said she had not yet seen the video but urged anyone with children not to let them watch it.

""I have never seen the video but what I have heard is very horrific.""

She added the charged officers had ""disgraced their families"".

""I want to say to the five police officers who murdered my son, you also disgraced your own families when you did this.

""But I am going to pray for you and your families. Because this shouldn't have happened. We want justice for my son.""

She has pleaded for peaceful protests.

Police pulled Mr Nichols over for alleged reckless driving before there was an ""altercation"" where officers used pepper spray on him, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

Mr Nichols then tried to flee on foot and another altercation followed, he added.

His family say the officers beat him and the injuries he sustained during the encounter led to his death.

Relatives accuse police of causing him to have a heart attack and kidney failure. Authorities have only said he experienced a medical emergency.

The officers were assigned to the 'scorpion' unit which focuses on violent street crime. The family's lawyers want it to be disbanded.

Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis has said the department will review scorpion and other specialised units.

President Joe Biden said the Nichols family and the city of Memphis deserve ""a swift, full and transparent investigation"".

""Public trust is the foundation of public safety, and there are still too many places in America today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken,"" he added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127191140/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-death-mother-of-us-man-beaten-by-officers-says-they-disgraced-their-own-families-12796861;Category-1: politics

Tyre Nichols: Last words of US man who died after police 'beating' were 'mum, mum, mum', says lawyer;Saturday 28 January 2023 01:11, UK;[];[];"The final words of a US motorist who died after he was allegedly beaten by five police officers were ""mum, mum, mum"", according to a lawyer.

Tyre Nichols, 29, passed away in hospital three days after the confrontation following a traffic stop in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

Bodycam footage of the altercation is expected to be released later on Friday evening.

His family said the ""very horrific"" video showed officers savagely beating the FedEx worker for three minutes in an assault their lawyers likened to the Los Angeles police attack on motorist Rodney King in 1991.

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols's death.

Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing his family, said when the public watches the footage they will see him calling out for his mother.

He said: ""When you all see this video, you're going to see Tyre Nichols calling out for his mum.

""He calls out three times for his mother. His last words on this earth are, 'mum, mum, mum'. He's screaming for her. When you think about that kidnapping charge, he said 'I just want to go home'.""

""It's a traffic stop for God's sake. A simple traffic stop.""

Mr Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, told reporters: ""For a mother to know their child was calling them in their need and I wasn't there for him. Do you know how I feel right now? Because I wasn't there for my son.""

Ms Wells recalled she had ""a really bad pain in my stomach"" and once she found out what happened she realised ""that was my son's pain that I was feeling"".

""For me to find out my son was calling my name, you have no clue how I feel right now,"" she added, struggling to hold back tears.

She also said she had not yet seen the video but urged anyone with children not to let them watch it.

""I have never seen the video but what I have heard is very horrific.""

She added the charged officers had ""disgraced their families"".

""I want to say to the five police officers who murdered my son, you also disgraced your own families when you did this.

""But I am going to pray for you and your families. Because this shouldn't have happened. We want justice for my son.""

She has pleaded for peaceful protests.

Police pulled Mr Nichols over for alleged reckless driving before there was an ""altercation"" where officers used pepper spray on him, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

Mr Nichols then tried to flee on foot and another altercation followed, he added.

His family say the officers beat him and the injuries he sustained during the encounter led to his death.

Relatives accuse police of causing him to have a heart attack and kidney failure. Authorities have only said he experienced a medical emergency.

The officers were assigned to the 'scorpion' unit which focuses on violent street crime. The family's lawyers want it to be disbanded.

Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis has said the department will review scorpion and other specialised units.

President Joe Biden said the Nichols family and the city of Memphis deserve ""a swift, full and transparent investigation"".

Adam Boulton: Long Johnson is still plaguing the Tories - Sunak needs to take decisive action;Saturday 28 January 2023 02:47, UK;['adam boulton', '@adamboultontabb'];[];"Those worried about the health of British politics have diagnosed a new disease at Westminster.

Chris Patten, a grandee from the Conservative establishment, spotted what he called ""Long Boris"" last summer.

Weeks after Boris Johnson announced his resignation as prime minister, Lord Patten, a former party chairman and former BBC chairman, lamented the persistent ""corrupting and debilitating impact of Johnson's premiership on British politics and government.""

As with 'SARS-Covid-19' there was some debate as to how the condition should be named in general conversation.

Eventually, ""Long Johnson"" was settled on rather than the more familiar ""Long Boris"".

The commentator Paul Waugh listed some of the symptoms of Long Johnson he saw in the bloodstream of the Conservative party: ""A debilitating condition that led it to lose its sense of taste, decency and direction.""

Long Johnson hit fever pitch with the Conservative party's short-lived collective decision to select Johnson's preferred candidate, Liz Truss, as the next prime minister. That quickly burnt itself out.

Westminster Accounts: Search for your MP

On taking office Rishi Sunak tried to shake off Long Johnson by promising that his government would be one of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability"" at all times. It is not proving so easy for the new prime minister to escape unwanted legacies from his predecessor-but-one.

Advertisement

Questions of probity over two men who were promoted by Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi and Richard Sharp, have combined to create the biggest political crisis of Sunak's short premiership.

According to Raphael Behr, political columnist on The Guardian, the ""Zahawi episode is a symptom of Long Johnson, the chronic, recurrent, debilitation of government by a pathogen that still circulates in the ruling party long after the original infection has been treated"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 7:03 Analysis: Labour says PM 'too weak'

The embarrassments Sunak is grappling with are debilitating hangovers from the Johnson era, so is the fumbling way the prime minister is dealing with them.

Nadhim Zahawi had the reputation at Westminster of a comparatively competent and personable minister, one of those credited with the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme. But as often with politicians who become conspicuously wealthy there was much gossip about his finances.

His wealth was generated as a co-founder of the polling company YouGov before he became an MP.

Scrutiny of Zahawi's finances sharpened when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer, the politician responsible for the nation's finances and tax system. In seeking the truth, journalists received what they considered to be aggressive threats of libel from lawyers acting for Zahawi, designed to suppress allegations, some of which have been confirmed as accurate.

It is now known that while he was Chancellor, Zahawi quietly negotiated a tax settlement totalling some £5m, including a penalty of more than £1m, with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for which he was the minister responsible.

Zahawi says his mistake was ""careless but not deliberate"". Jim Harra, the head of HMRC, told MPs this week: ""There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs.""

There is no pressing reason why Boris Johnson should have made Zahawi chancellor. Nor does the haste with which the appointment was made suggest that the prime minister or his officials, led by the Cabinet Secretary, had sufficient time for due diligence looking into his suitability for this most sensitive financial post. Yet their green light then effectively gave him a free pass to prominent ministerial ranks under both Truss and Sunak.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:01 'Questions need answering' in Zahawi case

By late last year scrutiny by an honours committee elsewhere in Whitehall reportedly held up a proposed knighthood for Zahawi.

In the past, when serving prime ministers have announced their intention to resign, other ministers have stayed in post until the successor is chosen. He or she then assembles their own cabinet team. This has been so even when threatened ministerial resignations force out a prime minister, as happened to both Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.

Once he announced he was going, Johnson could have said that he was not accepting resignations and that all minsters would stay on in the interim. That is not the way Boris Johnson behaved. He used his dying powers of patronage to settle scores and to try to influence the outcome of the leadership election.

He fired Michael Gove and then he troubled the ailing Queen to appoint an entirely new temporary cabinet for the few weeks of the leadership contest. Johnson promoted Zahawi to the Treasury, thus crucially depriving Rishi Sunak of the status of high office during the leadership battle, while Truss luxuriated in the great office of state of foreign secretary.

Earlier, after Sunak emerged as the person most likely to replace Johnson, he became the subject of damaging leaks about his US Green Card and his wife's non-dom status. The Metropolitan Police coincidentally tarnished the teetotal Sunak's reputation, and blunted the impact on Johnson, by issuing them both with fixed penalty notices for breaking COVID regulations at the ""ambushed with a cake"" Johnson birthday party in the cabinet room.

Sunak experienced the hard way the phenomenon, now hitting Zahawi and Sharp, that friendship with Johnson often has adverse consequences.

Richard Sharp insists that he was appointed the chairman of the BBC on merit after a rigorous selection process. There is no reason to doubt his perspective. When I knew him at university, more than 40 years ago, he was an exceptionally decent and considerate person. He went on to build a highly successful career in finance alongside generous voluntary contributions to public service and charity.

Men with known political affiliations such as Michael Grade, Gavyn Davies and Marmaduke Hussey have been appointed to the BBC chair by other prime ministers. But Boris Johnson made the final decision over Sharp, after he and his allies had previously broken with precedent by conjuring up culture wars and pre-endorsing friends and allies such as Paul Dacre and Charles Moore for top posts in the media, normally viewed as apolitical - unsuccessfully it turned out.

Johnson used his patronage to appoint Peter Cruddas to the House of Lords, someone who had helped him out with his personal finances. Richard Sharp says he ""simply connected"" people, who then facilitated an undeclared personal £800,000 overdraft guarantee for the prime minister.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 7:18 Zahawi should 'stand aside'

Richard Sharp and cabinet secretary Simon Case may genuinely have decided this was immaterial to Sharp's BBC application but is that the way Boris Johnson sees things? Several enquiries into Sharp's appointment are now under way. Johnson's benefactor Sam Blyth is an old friend of Sharp.

The inquiries will doubtless ascertain whether Boris Johnson knew of this obliging distant cousin's existence before Sharp introduced him to the cabinet secretary.

Long Johnson is also evident in the way the government is handling these potential scandals.

Quick resignations and moving on are things of the past. Following a pattern which became familiar during the Johnson era, Sunak has presided over, and sometimes joined in, denials that have turned out to be inaccurate, playing for time by calling for further inquiries after awkward facts are established.

Sir Keir Starmer had a two-pronged attack at PMQs: ""We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance, but his failure to sack him, when the whole country can see what is going on, shows how hopelessly weak he is.""

Sizeable minorities in parliament and perhaps even more in the Tory membership are not loyal to Sunak and hanker for a return of Johnson. This limits Sunak's ability to lead firmly.

With his oblique reference to the great wealth of Sunak's family, the leader of the opposition went further, implying that the prime minister is really just one of them - sharing similar values, or the absence of them, to Johnson and Zahawi and the same acquisitiveness.

Only urgent decisive action by Sunak can demonstrate that he has beaten the plague of Long Johnson.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128035218/http://news.sky.com/story/adam-boulton-long-johnson-is-still-plaguing-the-tories-sunak-needs-to-take-decisive-action-12796446;Category-1: politics

Chancellor's 'Britain needs you' plea to the retired may be a tall order;Friday 27 January 2023 14:39, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Jeremy Hunt became chancellor because he was the most sensible candidate left standing in the wake of Liz Truss's catastrophic mini-budget.

Four months on, he's earned praise for balancing the books but still had a blank space to fill in when it comes to growth - a crucial plank of economic policy in danger of becoming a dirty word after Truss pursued it over a cliff edge.

The economic circumstances remain deeply challenging, with inflation running above 10%, interest rates on the rise and public sector workers demanding pay rises while business and Conservative backbenchers want tax cuts to incentivise investment.

Two months before his first budget, the chancellor was not about to blow a reputation for rectitude by announcing detailed new policy.

Instead, we got a speech that, in tone if not style, could have been delivered by Boris Johnson, recasting the economic challenge as a debate between optimists and pessimists.

Brexit, Mr Hunt said, remains the opportunity on which future prosperity will be based, despite the myriad challenges reported by businesses at the sharp end.

He had statistics to prove it. Britain has performed ""about as well"" as Germany since 2016 and better than Japan, Italy and France on one measure of GDP since 2010.

Asked by Sky News whether it would be more honest to acknowledge that Brexit had failed to live up to promises, he said no.

""It's a big change in our economic relations with our closest neighbours and of course that is going to need adaptation,"" he said.

""Of course there is some short-term disruption, but I think it's completely wrong to just focus on that without looking at the opportunities.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:15 'Brexit is an opportunity'

Anyone denying the UK was well-placed to thrive was peddling ""declinism"", a characterisation with echoes of Johnson's ""gloomsters"" that channelled the crudest divisions of the referendum debate.

Those guilty, Mr Hunt said, include newspaper columnists on the left and right, and the Labour Party.

Judging by conversations in the margins of his speech, he also blames a number of Britain's largest employers, who have called for more business-friendly government policy.

For the backbenchers who have lobbied hard for tax cuts despite the recent trauma of Truss' unfunded giveaway, there was a clear message.

""The best tax cut right now is a cut in inflation,"" he said.

That means do not expect much in March.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:02 Carmakers seek support in face of 'protectionist' threat

For the audience in the room, entrepreneurs and investors in the new technologies, life sciences and advanced manufacturing crucial to delivering growth, the message was delivered with a broad brush.

He said enterprise and education were priorities, pointing to the natural advantages of the City of London and the brains trust of the UK's world-leading universities.

New investment worth up to £100bn would be unlocked when reforms to EU-era regulation governing the reserves held by insurance companies are finally passed ""in the coming months"", he said.

The chancellor did not deny that the economy faces challenges, referring to the ""productivity puzzle"" that has seen output still not recover to pre-pandemic levels.

He said increasing employment was the key, highlighting a shortage of workers that many businesses blame on new Brexit immigration controls.

Mr Hunt preferred to focus on the growth of ""economic inactivity"" - those of working age who are not in work, by choice or through illness.

Around one-in-five 16-64 year olds currently meet that definition, 6.6 million people once students are removed from the figures.

Mr Hunt promised help to get the long-term sick back to work and then made a striking direct appeal to retirees: ""To those who retired early after the pandemic, or haven't found the right role after furlough, I say - Britain needs you.""

Persuading those who don't need to work to come back to the daily grind may be a tall order.

FlyBe collapse asks questions about the resilience of UK's transport infrastructure;Saturday 28 January 2023 18:53, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"FlyBe is a smaller, less significant business than when it collapsed for the first time in March 2020, but a second failure in three years raises questions not just for prospective owners, but the connectivity of the UK.

Three years ago the failure of what was then Europe's largest regional airline was blamed on the advancing pandemic, but in truth the company had been in trouble for years.

A government-brokered deal two months earlier with shareholders, including Virgin and the US hedge fund Cyrus Capital, kept planes in the air, but ultimately they couldn't defy economic gravity.

Flybe collapses and cancels all flights, with hundreds of jobs lost

What are passengers' rights when flights are cancelled by a bankrupt airline?

Cyrus Capital bought the brand out of administration and, in April last year, resumed operations trying to do what FlyBe 1.0 had failed to do; turn a profit from an airline dedicated to serving the UK's nations and regions.

Its strategy was to use the regional services as a bridgehead into international travel, filling spaces on flights to and from Belfast, Birmingham and London not filled by domestic travellers with passengers bound for the US and Europe.

A route to Amsterdam and slots at Heathrow were central to the plan, offering access to major hub airports from which FlyBe hoped alliances with larger airlines would follow.

With the airline industry still recovering from COVID and stiff competition from more established low-cost operators, that plan has not paid off.

FlyBe had been due to take delivery of 17 new aircraft this year, but delays to the new fleet limited the potential for partnership despite Cyrus putting in an estimated £50m to keep the enterprise airborne.

That cash has now run out, leaving administrators seeking a buyer willing to give the brand a third chance, and the UK facing a recurring question about the resilience of its transport infrastructure.

It is a question of particular salience in Northern Ireland, where FlyBe was a major operator out of Belfast City airport.

In 2020 FlyBe's future was a political issue, with ministers willing to discuss cutting passenger duty in order to make good on Boris Johnson's election promise to level up the UK's regions.

Three years on the political imperative, along with Mr Johnson, has largely moved on, but the economic imperatives remain. Transport infrastructure is a prerequisite of growth, particularly if you are trying to share it around, and the cutting of regional ties comes at a cost.

Lockwood & Co: Joe Cornish on his first TV project since The Adam And Joe Show;Sunday 29 January 2023 01:37, UK;['claire gregory', '@claireskynews'];[];"Many will remember Joe Cornish as one of the hosts of cult TV series The Adam And Joe Show - which saw the two friends recreating films out of toys, performing pranks, and getting Adam's dad to review music videos.

But it's now more than two decades since the programme ended and Cornish has since established himself as a writer and director, working on Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin, Marvel's Antman and his own directorial feature debut Attack The Block - which starred John Boyega in his breakout role - and more recently The Kid Who Would Be King.

Now, he's returned to TV with an adaptation of the young adult supernatural book series Lockwood & Co, for Netflix. And while it might feel to some as if Cornish takes his time between projects, he insists he's not slacking.

""This is me in rapid-fire mode,"" he laughs, pointing out to Sky News' Backstage podcast that the gap between Attack The Block (2011) and The Kid Who Would Be King (2019) is far greater than the three years between the latter and his current show.

""It takes a while to make these things - to get the money to write them, to film them, to post-produce them, so give me a break,"" he jokes. ""I'm going as fast as I can!""

Lockwood & Co is about three young paranormal investigators, set in a version of London where an invasion of ghosts is causing misery to many, and children are used to fight against them.

It's certainly not the first time Cornish has worked with a younger cast.

""I love it, I love the energy that younger actors bring,"" he says. ""I love the excitement of coming to work every day - this part of the process is incredible, the process of the cast and crew screening, the premieres, it's so exciting and it brings this really youthful energy to everything, I guess.

""And I'm less scared of directing them than I am of very experienced actors because remember: actors make three films a year, directors only make a film every three years if they're lucky, so it makes me feel like the wise old man, which I kind of am I suppose - old, maybe not so wise.""

Lockwood & Co is something Cornish has been interested in for a while; he read the first of Jonathan Stroud's books a decade ago, describing it as ""really brilliant and unique in these core ideas it has"", but after a bidding war another studio bought the rights and his career took him elsewhere.

Some 10 years later, the rights became available again - and now with several more books in the series - and after a phone call to Stroud himself the wheels were in motion for the show to go into production with Cornish at the helm.

""They're right in my wheelhouse, they have all the things I love and they just have these really brilliant original ideas at the core,"" he says of the stories. ""The first of which is ghosts can kill you by touching you.""

He continues: ""The second is quite an old-school supernatural idea that young people are more sensitive to ghosts and the supernatural than older people; the third is that these agencies build up that employ the young people to fight the ghosts; the fourth is that ghosts can be repelled with iron and salts and these fairly sort of old-school analogue methods.

""So I'd never come across a ghost story with this new set of rules that turned it into an action-adventure story. Also, the central characters of Lockwood - Lucy, George - are so compulsive.""

While this was a fresh take on the supernatural for Cornish, it certainly wasn't his first, though he'll be hoping it's better received than his first one was.

""I tried to make a Super8 film at school when I was 13,"" he admits. ""It was called Yesyes, because that's [one theory] why a Ouija board is called Ouija board - Oui (French) - Yes, Ja (German) - Yes.

""I thought that was a very clever title! But we never finished it because no one cared about it as much as I did. They all got bored.""

Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Steve Phillips resigns after claims of racism, sexism and homophobia in organisation;Sunday 29 January 2023 07:37, UK;[];[];"Steve Phillips has resigned as chief executive of Welsh Rugby Union after claims of misogyny, sexism, racism and homophobia were levelled at the organisation.

In a statement, Phillips said: ""It is with a huge amount of regret that I have decided to hand in my resignation.

Nadhim Zahawi sacked: What Sir Laurie Magnus found in his tax row probe;Sunday 29 January 2023 11:31, UK;[];[];"Nadhim Zahawi's failure to disclose that he was in discussions with HMRC over his taxes was a ""serious failure to meet"" ministerial standards, a damning report into the affair has found.

Sir Laurie Magnus, who carried out the investigation as the prime minister's new ethics adviser, said the former chancellor ""should have understood"" from the outset that he was under investigation by HMRC and that it was a ""serious matter"".

He also criticised the MP for Stratford-on-Avon for failing to correct the record for more than six months, after he dismissed reports that HMRC was ""looking into"" his tax affairs as ""smears"" during a July 2022 interview with Sky News's Kay Burley.

Mr Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chairman on Sunday by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak following the publication of Sir Laurie's report, which looked into whether the former minister had fallen foul of the ministerial code.

Here Sky News looks at the key points in Sir Laurie's report:

'Mr Zahawi should have understood this was a serious matter'

""Mr Zahawi has told me that he had formed the impression that he and his advisers were merely being asked certain queries by HMRC concerning his tax affairs, and that this impression persisted until he received a letter from HMRC on 15 July 2022.

Image: Sir Laurie Magnus

""On the basis of the confidential information to which I have had access, including correspondence between HMRC and Mr Zahawi personally, I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood at the outset that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.""

'Investigation was a relevant matter for a minister to declare'

""I consider that an HMRC investigation of the nature faced by Mr Zahawi would be a relevant matter for a Minister to discuss and declare as part of their declaration of interests.

""I would expect a Minister to inform their Permanent Secretary and to seek their advice on any implications for the management of their responsibilities.

Politics news - latest: Zahawi attacks media after sacking

""I would likewise expect a Minister proactively to update their declaration of interests form to include details of such an HMRC process.""

'Mr Zahawi's failure to declare investigation did not meet ministerial standards'

""After his appointment as Chancellor on 5 July 2022, Mr Zahawi completed a declaration of interests form which contained no reference to the HMRC investigation.

""A later form acknowledged (by way of an attachment) that Mr Zahawi was in discussion with HMRC to clarify a number of queries.

""Only following receipt of HMRC's letter received on 15 July 2022, did Mr Zahawi update his declaration of interests form to acknowledge that his tax affairs were under investigation, but he provided no further details other than the statement made previously that he was clarifying queries.

""Given the nature of the investigation by HMRC, which started prior to his appointment as Secretary of State for Education on 15 September 2021, I consider that by failing to declare HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022 - despite the ministerial declaration of interests form including specific prompts on tax affairs and HMRC investigations and disputes - Mr Zahawi failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict.""

'Mr Zahawi failed to declare HMRC investigation ended in penalty'

""The subsequent fact that the investigation concluded with a penalty in relation to the tax affairs of a Minister also requires declaration and discussion.

""It is a relevant interest which could give rise to a conflict, and particularly so in the case of HM Treasury Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system.

'Omissions constitute a serious failure to meet ministerial standards'

Nadhim Zahawi's interview with Sky News in July 2022

What Mr Zahawi said:

""There have been news stories over the last few days which are inaccurate, unfair and are clearly smears. It's very sad that such smears should be circulated and sadder still that they have been published.

""These smears have falsely claimed that the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency, and HMRC are looking into me. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not aware of this. I have not been told that this is the case.

""I've always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK. If there are questions, of course, I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.""

What Sir Laurie said about the statement:

""Mr Zahawi has told me that at the time of this statement, he was under the impression that he was answering HMRC's queries, but that he was not under investigation.

""I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.

""Under the Ministerial Code, Ministers have a duty to 'be as open as possible with Parliament and the public'.

""Whilst this duty clearly does not extend to disclosing personal tax information, it does include a general duty to be accurate in statements to ensure a false impression is not given or maintained.

""Mr Zahawi did not correct the record until 21 January 2023, when Mr Zahawi's public statement indicated that he had reached a settlement with HMRC following an investigation.

""I consider that this delay in correcting an untrue public statement is inconsistent with the requirement for openness.""

'Insufficient regard for Ministerial Code'

I also fully appreciate the pressures faced by Ministers as they address the complex issues of government and the difficulties they encounter in balancing the demands of their personal lives and their ministerial responsibilities.

What most scares Sarah Michelle Gellar and how she moved on from 'toxic' Buffy set with new show Wolf Pack;Monday 30 January 2023 01:38, UK;['claire gregory', '@claireskynews'];[];"Known for her iconic role as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Sarah Michelle Gellar is once again taking on the supernatural with her new show Wolf Pack.

Having described some behaviour on the '90s hit drama as toxic, she told Sky News that now she's an executive producer, she wanted to use her influence to ensure the only monsters she fights are on screen.

""I needed to have a set that was communicative, that was collaborative, where everybody had a voice,"" Gellar explained.

""And, you know, when I was growing up in this industry, we were told not to, and if we did, we were difficult.

""And I think this isn't a Hollywood thing - when you're new in a job, you don't want to make waves, you accept a lot of stuff that should be unacceptable, and I needed to have the power to change that and to be on the set that I wanted to be on, and not just that I wanted to be on, that everybody wanted to be on.

""Look, we get to play make believe, it's really fun, but there's long hours involved and there's dangerous stunts and there's, you know, all sorts of things, and I needed it to be a safe place for everyone.""

On Wolf Pack, Gellar is no longer one of the youngest people on set. Her character is an investigator looking into a wildfire that has seemingly awakened a mysterious creature - and in the process changed the lives of two teenagers.

But learning from her own experiences, the star took practical action to ensure younger cast and crew on Wolf Pack were comfortable during filming.

She said: ""I was like, here's my cell phone, call me - and I think it was easier for them to speak to me if something was bothering them.""

She added: ""It's hard when it's your producer, boss, network and everyone has a bottom line - I don't have one, I'm here to make all of this work and work well.

""And by the way, not just for the actors - I said that to the crew, too, to the production assistants: If you're too tired, and the hours are too long, let me know. There's Uber now, there's a really easy way for people not to get in car accidents when they're working, it's nothing to a production to call an Uber and guess what? If production won't pay for it, I'll get you an Uber.""

'The scariest things in life emotionally scare us'

It's 20 years since Buffy ended and Gellar says she was drawn back to the genre not by mythical creatures, but what they represent.

""To me, the scariest things in life are what emotionally scare us, and that's what this monster is that metaphor for and really dealing with anxiety,"" the actress explained.

""You know, that's a word we throw around a lot right now, we're all feeling it, we're bombarded with news 24/7, and what it does and this constant stream of information.

""The idea is that anxiety is actually your body running at peak condition, but we don't know what to do with that, so when you harness that, you can actually make that your superpower - and if we have the tools to really deal with anxiety, what would we be capable of?""

How star got through COVID

But she admits she nearly didn't get involved with Wolf Pack at all - initially saying no when asked to look at the script, joking that it was ""animal instinct"" that took over when she eventually relented.

""The idea of the pack to me just really hit home. It was the right time, you know, we were just coming out of COVID where if it wasn't for my pack, my pod, if you will, I wouldn't have gotten through it,"" Gellar said.

""And what it's like when you don't have that and how lonely that feels.

""I surprised myself when I said yes, it surprised Jeff [Davis - the show's creator], it surprised my team - it was a very just emotional response to material that meant something to me.""

Lisa Loring, the original Wednesday Addams actress, dies after stroke;Monday 30 January 2023 09:28, UK;[];[];"Lisa Loring, the actress best known as the young Wednesday Addams in the 1960s series The Addams Family, has died aged 64.

She died on Saturday night of complications from a stroke caused by high blood pressure, her daughter Vanessa Foumberg told Variety.

""She went peacefully with both her daughters holding her hands,"" she said.

Her friend Laurie Jacobson paid tribute on social media to Loring, ""in our hearts always as Wednesday Addams"".

""Beautiful, kind, a loving mother, Lisa's legacy in the world of entertainment is huge,"" she wrote.

Loring was six years old when she took the role of Wednesday Addams, the gloomy, death-obsessed, pigtailed daughter of the Addams family.

She played the role for two years from 1964 to 1966.

After 64 episodes of The Addams Family, she was cast in the short-lived sitcom The Pruitts Of Southampton and spy drama The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., before landing a recurring role on As The World Turns from 1980 to 1983.

In 1977 she appeared as Wednesday Addams senior in the television film Halloween with the New Addams Family.

The recent Netflix adaptation Wednesday revitalised the popularity of The Addams Family, with star Jenna Ortega's version of Loring's spiky dance from the original spawning a viral trend.

Loring was born in 1958 in the Marshall Islands. She was briefly raised in Hawaii before moving with her mother to Los Angeles, where she began child modelling aged three.

Schoolgirl's hi-tech backpack designed to tackle airborne diseases;Monday 30 January 2023 10:54, UK;[];[];"A schoolgirl's design for a backpack that can filter air to protect people from pollution and airborne disease has won a national innovation contest.

Eleanor Woods was presented with a real-world incarnation of her product in London over the weekend, having won over judges with a hi-tech satchel that ""looks cool, will help get kids outside, and fights off colds"".

All that and it will still carry her textbooks, stationary and homework.

The 12-year-old, from High Burton, Huddersfield, said the inspiration for her Breathe Better Backpack came from her mother's asthma, which she was especially aware of during the COVID lockdowns.

""I have an air filter at home because my mum has mild asthma,"" she said, adding that it was also designed to help friends and classmates stay safe.

""My generation is really aware of pollution and we have lessons on it at school along with diseases spreading.

""This is another reason I designed this, because it is getting much worse.""

'I can taste the petrol'

Eleanor, for whom climate activist Greta Thunberg is a ""big role model"", said she can ""taste the petrol"" outside when walking to school from her home on a main road.

She drew up her solution when her mum, Annabel Hobbs, 58, put a Backpack To The Future form in her room.

Her creation is powered by solar energy and a dynamo, which is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, and has a built-in filter and fans to clean the air.

It's blue and decorated with bubbles, which Eleanor said gave the backpack a ""clean theme"".

""If just a few people start using it, it could be really good for the planet,"" she added.

Firefighters to strike for first time since 2003 after real-terms earnings 'drop by 12%';Monday 30 January 2023 16:07, UK;[];[];"Firefighters are set to stage strike action in a row over pay after experiencing what they say is a cut in real-terms pay.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) voted for action in a ballot that closed on Monday - resulting in the UK's first nationwide fire service strike over pay since 2003.

Firefighters have experienced a 12% drop in real-terms earnings since 2010, the union says, while around one in five firefighter jobs have been cut in the same period.

It comes after members rejected a below-inflation 5% payoff in November.

Polling previously showed strong public support for strike action by firefighters, the union said, with around three in five people backing action.

FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: ""Firefighters have faced a sustained attack on pay for more than a decade, with average pay falling by about £4,000 in real terms.

""Our members face hazardous situations every day and sometimes risk their health to do the job.

""Facing double-digit inflation and rocketing energy bills, they are now being told to put up with an even bigger real-terms pay cut.""

Commissioner removes himself from investigation into appointment of BBC chairman after Boris Johnson loan claims;Monday 30 January 2023 16:32, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];[];"The Commissioner for Public Appointments has removed himself from the investigation into the hiring of the BBC's chairman after revealing he had met with him ""on previous occasions"".

William Shawcross confirmed last week that he would be leading the probe into the appointment of Richard Sharp following reports the chairman had helped Boris Johnson secure a loan.

But just seven days later, Mr Shawcross has written to the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, saying he would be handing the case over to an ""independent person"".

Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell - who called for the investigation - hit out at the timing of Mr Shawcross' decision, tweeting: ""It's taken him a week to realise a conflict of interest, sharing these cosy relationships.

""The truth must come out about this appointment.""

Mr Sharp was appointed to the top BBC role in 2021 after a recommendation by Mr Johnson when he was prime minister.

But ahead of that in late 2020, the Sunday Times claims Mr Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for the then-PM.

Mr Sharp has said there was ""no conflict of interest"" and he was given the job ""on merit"", while Mr Johnson told Sky News that the chairman ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding-dang sure"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/commissioner-removes-himself-from-investigation-into-appointment-of-bbc-chairman-after-boris-johnson-loan-claims-12799342;Category-1: politics
How the pandemic has meant that 2022 has seen a high turnover of chief executives;Monday 30 January 2023 15:20, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"Less than a month into the year and two of the UK's biggest companies have already signalled a change of leadership.

Penny James stepped down on Friday as chief executive of Direct Line following a shock profits warning days earlier that wiped out a quarter of the general insurer's stock market value.

Then, on Monday morning, life insurance giant Legal & General announced its chief executive of the last 11 years, Sir Nigel Wilson, is stepping down.

The two events have little in common.

Sir Nigel, who is 66, has been at the helm for more than a decade - no mean feat when the average longevity of a FTSE-100 chief executive is just five years.

His services will be in demand should he choose to extend his boardroom career as a non-executive chairman.

Ms James, by contrast, probably had little choice.

Direct Line blamed a surge in the cost of vehicle repairs and weather-related claims for the fact that it will report an underwriting loss in respect of 2022 - which has forced it to scrap its full-year dividend.

At the time, shares of other general insurers also fell, with investors assuming its woes would afflict the rest of the industry. Subsequent trading updates from rivals have pointed to problems specific to the FTSE-250 member.

Advertisement

The two departures, while unrelated, underline a bigger issue, though, which is that the last year or so has seen a huge turnover among chief executives of top companies.

Research by Russ Mould, of the investment platform manager AJ Bell, shows that, during 2022, one in five FTSE 100 companies signalled a change of leadership, including Prudential, Burberry, Rolls-Royce, Shell, Reckitt and JD Sports.

All changed their chief executives last year while another clutch of blue chips, including Whitbread, Hargreaves Lansdown and Halma, announced the forthcoming departures of their CEOs during 2023.

Another was Unilever, the Magnum, Marmite and Persil giant, which announced last July that its chief executive, Alan Jope, would be departing this year.

The successor to Mr Jope, whose departure comes after the arrival of an activist investor on the shareholder register and disquiet about a failed approach for the consumer healthcare group Haleon, was named on Monday.

He is Hein Schumacher, currently head of Royal Friesland Campina, a Dutch dairy and nutrition co-operative with global operations, who previously ran the Asian operations of Heinz, which five years ago tried to buy Unilever.

How the pandemic has pushed executives from their jobs

Why the high turnover in chief executives?

One theory is that the pandemic has played a major role since, apart from 2022, only 2020 this century has seen a higher turnover of chief executives in the FTSE-100.

Running a business is stressful and hard work, as any SME owner will testify, at the best of times.

That was even more the case during the pandemic and particularly for big companies, like Rolls-Royce, for whom COVID-19 was an existential crisis.

It was no surprise that Warren East stepped down as chief executive of the aircraft engine maker once he and his colleagues had ensured its survival through a series of asset sales and emergency refinancing.

There will be some chief executives who leave due to personal circumstances. Often it is because they have been in the job for a long time and need a change of scene.

Alison Brittain, who shortly steps down at Whitbread, probably falls into that category having run the Premier Inn-to-Brewers Fayre combine for seven years.

So, too, does Pete Redfern, who stepped down at the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey last summer after 14 years at the helm.

And then there are others, like Ms James, whose departure is probably required by circumstances.

Robert MacLeod, who left the industrial materials and sustainable technologies group Johnson Matthey last year, is a good example here. Another is Nick Read, who left Vodafone just before Christmas after four years spent tidying up the mobile giant's sprawling portfolio of assets, but failing to convince investors of its growth prospects.

Timing is everything

What should be very clear from all of this is that the chief executive who can dictate the timing of their departure is blessed.

The late Richie Benaud, a distinguished former Australian cricket captain and later one of sport's most beloved commentators, once famously said: ""Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill - but don't try it without that 10%.""

The same can be said of being chief executive of a FTSE-100 company.

The typical Footsie company is a complex beast with a great many moving parts and, accordingly, potential for a great many things to go wrong.

The typical successful chief executive will obviously have got where they are with ability and hard work - but they also require a big dollop of luck: a benign economic backdrop, perhaps, or the unexpected collapse of a competitor. Some chief executives have that luck and others do not.

Sir Rod Eddington, at the helm of British Airways during the 9/11 terror attack and its aftermath, falls into the latter camp.

But that ""10% skill"" to which Benaud was referring also reflects how some chief executives make their own luck through sheer determination.

Sir Nigel and the need for capitalism to be more inclusive

Sir Nigel, who grew up on a council estate in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, is one such chief executive.

A man who competes at everything - Monday's stock exchange announcement of his departure noted that he ""has won several national masters athletics championships"" - he has skilfully navigated the life insurance company through a number of economic challenges, including Brexit and the pandemic, while growing its revenues and profits.

L&G; observed that its total shareholder return (the total return a shareholder receives and which includes capital gains, dividends or special distributions) since he joined the company was more than 600%, which puts him easily in the top quintile of boardroom performers during the period.

At the same time, he has been a strident advocate of pension funds investing more in long-term infrastructure to support regeneration, social mobility and the decarbonisation of the economy, something that saw him offered a ministerial role by Liz Truss (he declined).

These days, it is increasingly rare for a chief executive to talk about anything other than the performance of the business they lead.

But Sir Nigel, a Newcastle United supporter, was equally happy talking about the need for capitalism to be more inclusive and more attuned to supporting the life chances of those who lack capital.

He told Building Magazine in November last year: ""When I grew up, I grew up in Newton Aycliffe, which was a new town. I got to move into a new council house, a two-bedroom house, very different at the time - we were just so excited about it.

""I went to the local new school, with new teachers, new everything - and that really created a platform for the rest of my life. And that created an opportunity, and I would never have been here today if I had continued to live with my grandparents in a massively overcrowded house.

""We want people to have those opportunities today.""

British business could use a few more executives with such perspective.

It is to be hoped Sir Nigel will continue to raise such issues wherever his career next takes him.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/how-the-pandemic-has-meant-that-2022-has-seen-a-high-turnover-of-chief-executives-12799258;Category-2: business and economy
Electric vehicle start-up Arrival cuts 800 jobs as it focuses on US future;Monday 30 January 2023 15:40, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Arrival, the UK start-up focusing on development of commercial electric vehicles, has revealed that it is to cut its workforce by half as it focuses on incentives to build its operations in the United States.

The company said the layoffs, part of a plan to significantly reduce costs, would leave it with 800 employees globally.

It was yet to give details on where the bulk of the job losses would fall.

The bulk of its teams are in the UK and in Georgia - the latter destination a result of the company's decision to pull out of Russia because of the Ukraine war.

Arrival has struggled to grow because of persistent difficulties raising funds - with start-ups generally finding it more difficult to secure supplies and meet heightened costs.

Funding troubles accounted for Britishvolt earlier this month.

Arrival had previously revealed that it was to shift its focus away from its UK operations, which include state of the art production and development facilities in Oxfordshire, to take advantage of sweeteners being offered by the US government.

Incentives for green energy initiatives, available to both businesses and the public, under the Inflation Reduction Act have placed western governments and the European Union (EU) under huge pressure to follow suit or lose green investment.

The EU, for example, argues that the $369bn (£298bn) package of subsidies break World Trade Organisation rules on the grounds that the act would discriminate against imported goods.

While public road trials in the UK of its first certified and registered vans have begun, and are continuing, Arrival expects its US Van product will start production in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2024.

That, however, remains dependent on the raising of additional capital.

Image: Arrival workers at Bicester

Arrival said it had appointed Teneo, a financial adviser, to assist in ""evaluating strategic alternatives, including opportunities to raise additional capital, optimise its balance sheet, and improve liquidity.""

The company added: ""When combined with other cost reductions in real estate and third-party spending, the company expects to halve the ongoing cash cost of operating the business to approximately $30m per quarter.

The company also appointed Igor Torgov, who joined in February 2020, as its chief executive officer.

He said of the task ahead: ""Arrival has developed unique technologies in a market that has huge growth potential and can play a key role in addressing climate change.

""To unlock these opportunities, we need to make difficult decisions and to take swift action.

""Following a detailed evaluation of Arrival and the wider EV market during the past two months, the leadership team and the board have taken decisive action to ensure the most effective use of our current resources and optimise the efficiency of the business.

""The actions support our journey to become a champion in innovative products and new, more efficient methods of vehicle production, particularly in the important US market for commercial electric vehicles.

""We are keenly aware that these decisions, while necessary, will have a profound impact on a significant number of our colleagues. We are 100% committed to supporting our employees during this difficult process.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/electric-vehicle-start-up-arrival-cuts-800-jobs-as-it-focuses-on-us-future-12799287;Category-2: business and economy
Barrett Strong: I Heard It Through The Grapevine writer and Motown's first star dies aged 81;Monday 30 January 2023 15:18, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];[];"Founding Motown artist Barrett Strong, who collaborated on classic songs such as I Heard It Through The Grapevine and Papa Was A Rollin' Stone, has died at the age of 81.

Strong's death was confirmed by the Motown Museum in a series of tweets paying tribute to his prolific career.

""Barrett was not only a great singer and piano player, but he, along with his writing partner Norman Whitfield, created an incredible body of work,"" Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement. No further details have been released.

Strong was the pianist and lead singer on Motown Records' breakthrough hit Money (That's What I Want), released early in 1960 and later covered by artists including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

It came less than a year after he agreed to let his friend Gordy - then in the early days of building his recording empire in Detroit - manage him and release his music.

While he never again approached the success of Money on his own - and the song ironically led to arguments over money as he fought for acknowledgement as a co-writer - with Whitfield he formed a productive and eclectic songwriting team.

Amy Winehouse to Bruce Springsteen - the artists who covered Strong's work

I Heard It Through The Grapevine was first recorded by Gladys Knight And The Pips in 1966, and Marvin Gaye's release two years later became one of the label's biggest sellers of all time. The track has been covered numerous times, by everyone from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Amy Winehouse, and also charted again in the 1980s thanks to being featured in the famous Levi's Launderette advert.

The Barrett-Whitfield partnership also wrote Cloud Nine and Psychedelic Shack for The Temptations, as well as the protest anthem War - with its famous refrain: ""War! What is it good for? Absolutely... nothing!"" - for Edwin Starr.

""With War, I had a cousin who was a paratrooper that got hurt pretty bad in Vietnam,"" Strong told LA Weekly in 1999. ""I also knew a guy who used to sing with (Motown songwriter) Lamont Dozier that got hit by shrapnel and was crippled for life. You talk about these things with your families when you're sitting at home, and it inspires you to say something about it.""

His other hits with Whitfield, who died in 2008, included I Can't Get Next To You, That's The Way Love Is, and the Grammy-winning chart-topper Papa Was A Rollin' Stone.

Artists who covered their songs ranged from The Rolling Stones (Just My Imagination) and Aretha Franklin (I Wish It Would Rain) to Bruce Springsteen (War) and Al Green (I Can't Get Next to You).

Strong was born in West Point, Mississippi, and moved to Detroit a few years later.

He was a self-taught musician who learned piano without needing lessons and, with his sisters, formed a local gospel group called the Strong Singers.

In his teens, he got to know such artists as Franklin, Smokey Robinson and Gordy, who was impressed with his writing and piano playing.

Strong spent part of the 1960s recording for other labels, and left Motown again in the early 1970s and made a handful of solo albums, including Stronghold and Love Is You. In 2004, he was voted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame, which cited him as ""a pivotal figure in Motown's formative years"".

The music of Strong and other Motown writers was later featured in the Broadway hit Ain't Too Proud: The Life And Times Of The Temptations.

According to BMI (Broadcast Music Inc), there are more than 240 songs in his back-catalogue.

""Songs outlive people,"" Strong told The New York Times in 2013. ""The real reason Motown worked was the publishing. The records were just a vehicle to get the songs out there to the public.

""The real money is in the publishing, and if you have publishing, then hang on to it. That's what it's all about. If you give it away, you're giving away your life, your legacy. Once you're gone, those songs will still be playing.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/barrett-strong-i-heard-it-through-the-grapevine-writer-and-motowns-first-star-dies-aged-81-12799283;Category-5: entertainment and culture

What is the current state of the British armed forces?;Monday 30 January 2023 19:08, UK;[];[];"UK defence spending as a proportion of GDP has halved since the 1980s - leading to a decline in equipment and a drop of one in six military personnel, Sky News analysis has revealed.

It comes after US defence sources warned cuts to the British Army meant it was no longer a top-level fighting force.

Sky News revealed on Sunday that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had been told of the US concerns.

Defence minister James Heappey told the Commons he understood Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt know the army is ""in urgent need of recapitalisation"" and ""there is a budget coming"".

So what has happened to UK defence spending?

In 2021, the UK spent 2.2% of its Gross Domestic Product on defence, amounting to about £45.9bn.

However, this number has fallen since the mid-1950s. In the financial year ending in 1956, the UK spent just under 8% of its GDP on defence and in 1980 it was 4.1%. Since 2000, the proportion has remained around the 2% mark.

In comparison, health spending as a proportion of GDP in 1956 was just under 3% and in 2020 this figure jumped to over 7%.

Defence spending has remained consistent over recent years because of the government's pledge, as a NATO member, to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence each year.

Military expenditure compared with other countries

The UK is only one of a handful of countries to have consistently met this NATO benchmark.

The UK has the third-highest average defence spending as a fraction of GDP, behind just the US and Greece.

Also, Greece only hits this 2% target because the money is predominantly spent on salaries and pensions.

However, this could change as many countries are taking measures to increase their defence spending.

Last year, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, pledged a one-off special fund of €100bn (£82bn) to bolster Germany's defences and to invest 2% of its GDP on defence going forward.

For context, in 2021 Germany's GDP was $4.26trn and 2% of this is $85.2bn.

Personnel and equipment

The UK has also maintained the NATO standard of allocating at least 20% of its defence budget on equipment.

Over a quarter (28%) of the UK's defence budget was spent on equipment in 2022, according to NATO estimates.

However, several types of equipment types have seen a decrease in recent years, according to data from the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Armoured fighting vehicles, like tanks, have seen a decrease of 5% from 2016 to 2022 and artillery has seen a decrease of 2%.

Fixed winged aircraft that are in service have seen a decrease of 10%, and in-service rotary winged platforms, such as helicopters, have seen a decrease of 24% in the same time period.

While British defence spending has been maintained over a substantial amount of time, personnel numbers in the armed forces have been on the decline for years.

Conservative defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood told Sky News that ""we have become complacent. We need to invest to make sure we retain people, the good people that are there, but there are not enough of them and the equipment is now obsolete"".

Quarterly figures from the MoD show that in 2022 there are just over 145,000 regular armed forces personnel.

This represents a decrease of 14% from the figures of 169,150 10 years ago and personnel figures are set to decrease even further.

Back in November 2022, Ben Wallace told the parliament that the British Army would now be reduced to 73,000 by the middle of the decade. Latest figures show that the number of regular British Army personnel stood at 79,139.

Rising energy costs and inflation will affect the armed forces

The MoD was the only department on the receiving end of budget cuts at the government spending review in October 2021.

The ministry's most recent annual staff costs were just under £15bn and the ministry can expect calls, like other sectors, for larger pay increases to protect the real terms pay of members of the armed forces.

Rising global energy prices are also likely to put pressure on MoD spending with recent figures showing a spend of around £600m per year on energy and fuel.

Asked about the US general's private comments on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said the government is ""ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow including through a fully funded £242bn 10-year equipment plan"".

""The prime minister is clear that we have to do everything necessary to protect our people that's why the UK has the largest defence budget in Europe,"" the spokesman added.

Campaigners reveal areas most at risk of homes falling into sea in England;Tuesday 31 January 2023 02:50, UK;[];[];"Coastal homes worth a total of almost £600m could be lost and consumed by the sea in England by 2100, according to a climate action group.

One Home identified 21 at-risk villages and hamlets and estimated how much coast could be lost there.

Coastal erosion is the process by which land is worn away or displaced along the shoreline, through the repetitive motion of the waves, rocks smashing against land or chemical reactions in the water.

The value of property damage on land that could be hit by coastal erosion by 2100 was estimated at £584m, using average local authority values or site-specific values from Rightmove, One Home said.

It compiled a map highlighting what shoreline management plans are in place in different areas of the coast, and what the level of protection is.

It shows the coastal communities most at risk are:

• Cornwall

• Cumbria

• Dorset

• East Yorkshire

• Essex

• The Isle of Wight

• Kent

• Northumberland

• Norfolk

• Sussex

Angela Terry, chief executive of One Home, said: ""Sea levels are rising as global temperatures soar and so larger waves batter our coast during severe storms.

""These irreversible changes mean some cliff faces are crumbling fast.

""We can't turn the tide or build a wall around the entire coast so we urgently need to help seaside communities to prepare for the damage that will come.""

One Home added: ""Many homeowners don't know their properties are at risk or that decisions have been made about whether to protect them or not.

Mr Blobby costume buyer 'backs out of £62,000 bid';Tuesday 31 January 2023 05:53, UK;[];[];"The buyer of an original Mr Blobby costume - who was set to pay £62,000 for the item - has reportedly backed out of the sale.

An eBay auction for the piece of TV memorabilia, which is more than 25 years old, attracted huge interest last week.

The costume sold for £62,101 but it has now emerged the buyer pulled out of the sale within an hour of placing the large bid.

The anonymous seller told the BBC: ""I thought it would get to a level of £100 perhaps - and so I was shocked really that it reached the level it did.

""I think it was one of those things that was driven by social media.

""Ironically, it was being sold not to make money but to make space.""

The Mr Blobby suit was made by the BBC's costume supplier and was due to be used for Noel's House Party but the TV show was cancelled before it could be delivered.

Running from 1991 to 1999, Noel's House Party was a BAFTA-winning light entertainment show.

Earlier, the seller said the costume was in need of a new home after they claimed that neither the broadcaster nor the BBC's production team wanted it.

Police offer £10k reward in hunt for missing couple and newborn baby;Tuesday 31 January 2023 12:18, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"Detectives are offering a £10,000 reward for information that helps them find a missing couple and their newborn baby.

Police say they are ""extremely concerned"" about Mark Gordon and Constance Marten, who went missing after their car broke down in Bolton on 5 January.

Detectives say their baby has been exposed to sub-zero temperatures for almost a month and the couple were ""constantly moving and awake for at least a few days"" after the birth.

The couple were last seen in Newhaven, East Sussex, on 8 January carrying bags containing a two-man tent, sleeping bags and pillows that they had purchased from Argos the evening before.

The previous night they dumped a pushchair in Spitalfields, east London.

Police say the couple could still be camping somewhere in the UK.

Ms Marten, 35, who is from a wealthy family with connections to the royals, has lived an isolated life with Mr Gordon, a 48-year-old convicted sex offender, since they met in 2016.

Neither they nor their newborn have had any medical attention since they went missing.

Politics news latest: Downing Street's defence of Dominic Raab coming under scrutiny - as Labour focus on sleaze amid evidence of 'cut through' with public;;[];[];"Johnson says it would be 'game over' for Putin if Ukraine takes back land bridge

Former prime minister Boris Johnson is currently in the US.

He is stateside as part of a push to maintain the West's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.

The ex-PM has been speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC, this afternoon.

Mr Johnson said there is ""no conceivable grounds for delay"" from Western countries - days after Germany was criticised by some for appearing slow to decide on providing tanks to Ukraine.

Western allies should ""give the Ukrainians the support they need to finish this war"", Mr Johnson said, adding: ""Let's give them those tools now.""

He added that if Ukraine is able to take back the strip of land in southern Ukraine between Mariupol, the Donbas and Crimea, this will help to end the war.



""If they can take back Melitopol and Berdiansk and Mariupol, get back those areas, it's game over for Putin,"" he said.

Returning to his arguments later in the discussion, he said it would be a ""false economy to let Putin win"".

This, he said, would be ""burdening future generations with the massive expense of trying to protect the whole area"".

We reported earlier on comments from Mr Johnson to Fox News in the US, with the former PM calling for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Downing Street has said Mr Johnson's visit to Washington was ""not on behalf of the UK government"" and has distanced itself from the former leader's comments on fighter jets.

Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace.""

But he said Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity"".

On the possibility of sending jets, the official said: ""It's currently not practical to send UK jets.

""We will continue to work closely with the Ukrainians to understand their needs and how allies can further support them.

""Given the complexity of UK fighter jets and the length of time required to train them, we do not currently think it is practical to do so.""

Downing Street said the RAF's Typhoons and F-35s are ""extremely sophisticated"" pieces of equipment.

Half Moon Bay shootings: Farmworker accused of killing seven colleagues 'was angry over $100 repair bill';Tuesday 31 January 2023 12:49, UK;[];[];"A farmworker charged with killing seven people at two mushroom farms in California told police he carried out the shootings after his supervisor demanded he paid $100 (£81) to repair a damaged forklift truck.

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told the Bay Area News Group that Chunli Zhao was enraged by the equipment bill, saying that a co-worker was to blame for the collision between his forklift and their bulldozer.

Authorities say Zhao, 66, shot and killed four workers and wounded a fifth employee on 23 January at California Terra Garden in Half Moon Bay, a city around 30 miles south of San Francisco.

He is accused of then going to nearby Concord Farms, where he had worked previously, and shooting dead three former colleagues.

Zhao previously told NBC affiliate KNTV-TV in a courthouse interview that he committed the shootings.

He said he was bullied and worked long hours on the farms and his complaints were ignored, the station reported.

Zhao said he had reportedly vented to his supervisor about the bill, but that the supervisor insisted he needed to pay. Zhao then allegedly shot the supervisor and the co-worker, the news outlets reported.

Speaking in Mandarin, Zhao told the television station from a county jail in Redwood City that he had been in the US for 11 years and had a green card.

He said he had a 40-year-old daughter in China and lived with his wife in Half Moon Bay.

Business failures hit highest level since 2009 after end of pandemic support;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:21, UK;['gurpreet narwan', '@gurpreetnarwan'];[];"Corporate insolvencies have reached their highest level since the aftermath of the great financial crisis, official figures show.

There were 22,109 insolvencies in 2022, the highest figure since 2009 and an increase of 57% from 2021, when 14,059 businesses went bust.

Businesses are reeling from the end of the pandemic support packages, which provided a lifeline to small companies during the lockdowns.

The construction, retail, accommodation and food services sectors were the hardest hit, with businesses in these industries coming under severe strain from rising costs, staff shortages and weakening consumer demand.

The increase was driven by creditors' voluntary liquidations, which occur when directors choose to place a company into a liquidation process.

These hit 18,821, their highest level since records began in 1960.

Administrations, in which a struggling company has failed but can ultimately continue to trade as a going concern, rose by 54.6% to 1,231.

Image: Made.com was among well-known names to collapse last year, with Next picking up the brand from administrators

The findings suggest that the business landscape is undergoing a correction after the pandemic support packages kept many companies alive that may have collapsed earlier.

The number of company insolvencies rose sharply but this partly reflects the higher number of active businesses.

Meanwhile, the rate of company liquidations rose to 49.5 per 10,000 active companies. This is up from 32.9 from the previous year and the highest since 2015, but only around half the level seen in 2009.

Catherine Atkinson, director of restructuring and forensics at the professional services firm PwC, said: ""The Insolvency Service's report... is a stark reflection of the challenges businesses have been and will continue to face in the first quarter of 2023.

""Financial headwinds caused by trading costs, rent, interest rates and utility bills alongside other operational pressures are causing increasing amounts of drag on companies weathering working capital pressures as they wait for payments to come in for goods and services…The next few months will be a critical time for business resilience.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131132349/http://news.sky.com/story/business-failures-hit-highest-level-since-2009-after-end-of-pandemic-support-12799890;Category-2: business and economy

UK gets lowest ever score in corruption index after string of scandals;Tuesday 31 January 2023 15:53, UK;[];[];"The UK has fallen down the global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to its lowest ever score as a report warned ""slipping standards are being noticed on the world stage"".

Britain fell seven places to be ranked 18th in the world after a year marked by the controversy around PPE procurement and a series of breaches of the ministerial code.

It was one of only five countries to see their year-on-year scores drop by five or more points, along with Qatar, Myanmar, Azerbaijan and Oman.

The CPI is compiled by Transparency International which uses impartial surveys from experts and business leaders to rank countries by the perceived level of corruption in their public sectors.

Chief executive Daniel Bruce said the slump was a ""powerful indictment of a recent decline in standards in government"" that should ""set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street"".

""The underlying data clearly indicate that business executives and other experts are concerned about insufficient controls on the abuse of public office and increasingly view corruption and bribery as a real issue in Britain,"" he said.

""This is the strongest signal yet that slipping standards are being noticed on the world stage.""

The report comes days after Rishi Sunak sacked Nadhim Zahawi as chairman of the Conservative Party after a row over his tax affairs.

While this would not have been captured in the data, the report cites other scandals that could have informed the UK's ranking, including allegations of Conservative donors trading cash for seats in the House of Lords.

The UK now ranks 18th alongside Belgium and Japan and behind Uruguay, Iceland and Estonia.

Denmark tops the index, while South Sudan, Syria and Somalia, all of which are embroiled in protracted conflict, remain at the bottom.

Mr Bruce said reversing the UK's decline will demand ""comprehensive action"" to fulfil the prime minister's ""commitment to lead a government of integrity and accountability"".

Antony Blinken says US opposes anything that puts two-state solution 'further from reach' after violence in Jerusalem;Tuesday 31 January 2023 17:07, UK;[];[];"The United States will ""continue to oppose anything"" that puts a two-state solution ""further from reach"" after one of the bloodiest months in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in several years, the US secretary of state has said.

Antony Blinken said the US opposes Israeli settlement expansion and any moves towards the annexation of the West Bank.

The US secretary of state spoke in a news conference in Jerusalem on the second day of a two-day visit to Israel where he has met with the country's leader Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.

His comments come days after two shootings, one by a Palestinian gunman and another by a Palestinian teenager, left seven people dead and five wounded in Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, some 35 Palestinians have been killed in fighting, including 10 who were killed in an Israeli military raid in the flashpoint town of Jenin last Thursday.

Mr Blinken said today: ""The horrific terror attacks in Jerusalem, the escalating violence in the West Bank, have underscored the significant challenges to security and stability that the region faces and that we face.

""A rising tide of violence has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives on both sides... all sides must take steps to prevent further escalation of violence and restore calm.""

He continued: ""It's President Biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve (peace) is through preserving and then realising, the vision of two states for two peoples.

""The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach.

""We've been clear that this includes things like settlement expansion, the legalisation of outposts, demolitions and

evictions, disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites, and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.""

Mr Blinken also said that during his meetings in Israel and the occupied West Bank he had heard a ""deep concern about the current trajectory"".

Image: A man uses a slingshot during a clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank

However, he also said that he heard concrete ideas from both sides that, if pursued, could help defuse the current situation.

Mr Blinken's first visit since Mr Netanyahu returned to power this month at the head of one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history comes at a time of extreme tension between the two sides.

He said Palestinians were facing a ""shrinking horizon of hope"" that needed to change.

Amid rising anger at near-daily raids by Israeli forces in the West Bank, Abbas' Palestinian Authority (PA) suspended its security cooperation agreement with Israel last week after the largest incursion in years.

The operation saw Israeli forces penetrate deep into a refugee camp in the northern city of Jenin, setting off a gunfight in which 10 Palestinians died.

In January alone, 35 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops, in the bloodiest month since 2015, while officials say attacks on Palestinian property by Israeli settlers have also increased.

Blinken offered no concrete steps to calm the current tensions and right now its actions, not words, that are most needed Alistair Bunkall Middle East correspondent @AliBunkallSKY Mr Blinken's trip to the region was already planned but coincided with one of the worst periods of violence in years. In just 24-hours he met Israel's prime minister, foreign minister and the Palestinian president, regularly calling on ""all sides"" to do more to reverse the worrying trajectory that has seen 35 Palestinians and seven Israelis killed since the start of the year. He clearly grasps the severity of the situation but, as has become increasingly common with senior US diplomats visiting Israel and the West Bank, offered no concrete steps to change the dynamic. Speaking to journalists at the US embassy in Jerusalem he reiterated the view that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians. He's right, but the same words have been uttered by every US secretary of state since the signing of the Oslo accords 30 years ago. In the eyes of many observers the situation is worse now, and prospects for peace slimmer than ever. Perhaps the announcement that senior members of his team will stay on to work on easing tensions is meant to provide short-term respite. It won't be enough. Israel's new right-wing coalition government is trying to impose itself in the face of massive internal weekly protests against it. Palestinians in the West Bank are growing increasingly desperate under occupation and militancy is on the rise. The Palestinian leadership in Ramallah is incapable of providing the essentials to its people. These are worrying times in the Holy Land. Stern words without real action will do little to change that.

On Friday, a Palestinian gunman killed seven people outside a synagogue in an east Jerusalem settlement on Friday.

The next morning, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and wounded two Israelis elsewhere in east Jerusalem.

""The Israeli government is responsible for what is happening today, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements,"" Mr Abbas said during Mr Blinken's visit.

Mr Netanyahu has reinforced troops in the West Bank and promised measures to strengthen settlements there, but so far held off from more extreme steps.

On Tuesday, Mr Blinken met Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and discussed cooperation to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon as well the situation in the West Bank.

Hopes of achieving a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state based largely in the West Bank, have all but disappeared since the last round of US-sponsored talks stalled in 2014.

The Biden administration has said it would re-establish a consulate for Palestinians shuttered by former President Donald Trump, but has yet to say when or where it will be opened.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131172509/http://news.sky.com/story/antony-blinken-says-us-opposes-anything-that-puts-two-state-solution-further-from-reach-after-violence-in-jerusalem-12800043;Category-1: politics
New pictures released of missing couple and newborn baby as £10,000 reward offered for information;Tuesday 31 January 2023 19:38, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"New images of a missing couple and their newborn baby have been released by the Metropolitan Police which has offered a £10,000 reward for information.

Detectives say they are ""extremely concerned"" about aristocrat Constance Marten, 35, and her boyfriend Mark Gordon, 48, who went missing after their car broke down in Bolton on 5 January.

Police say their baby has been exposed to sub-zero temperatures for almost a month and the couple were ""constantly moving and awake for at least a few days"" after the birth.

The new pictures show the couple on the move on the evening of Saturday 8 January.

The images show them walking near Brick Lane, east London at around 11.45pm where they dumped a pushchair.

They then get a taxi to Haringey, north London, where they got into a second taxi just before 1.30am on Sunday morning.

The couple were then dropped off outside the port in Newhaven, East Sussex, just before 5am on Sunday morning, which was captured in a CCTV image.

They were carrying bags containing a two-man tent, sleeping bags and pillows that they had purchased from Argos the evening before.

The couple then walked to where the A259 crosses over the B2109 and were last seen sheltering from the rain under the overpass at around 6am. It is the last known sighting of the pair.

Police say the couple could still be camping somewhere in the UK.

Ms Marten, who is from a wealthy family, has lived an isolated life with Mr Gordon, a convicted sex offender, since they met in 2016.

The couple went missing after their vehicle caught fire near Bolton in early January. It is thought most of their belongings were destroyed in the blaze.

Police believe Ms Marten may have given birth just one or two days before the fire. Neither her nor their newborn have had any medical attention since they went missing.

'I killed her, she's under the floor': Moment man confessed to killing woman at his home recounted in court;Tuesday 31 January 2023 18:35, UK;[];[];"A police officer has told a court of the moment a man confessed to killing a woman and burying her body under his kitchen floor.

Andrew Innes, 52, denies murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her two-year-old daughter, Jellica, and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Innes is currently on trial for murder at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Police Scotland officers Gavin Burns, 33, and Rhianne Brogan, 29, were called to give evidence for the Crown on Tuesday.

The PCs told the court they were sent to Innes' home in Troon Avenue, Dundee, on 5 March 2021 to carry out a welfare check as part of a high-risk missing persons inquiry.

Avon and Somerset Police had been looking for Ms Burke and Jellica, and believed they may have travelled north of the border in Innes' car, which had been identified as having made a trip from Bristol to Dundee.

PC Burns told prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice KC that Innes was ""a bit reluctant"" when he opened the door, had claimed to have COVID and that he was shielding as he had a condition.

Innes allegedly said: ""I know Bennylyn but she's in Glasgow.""

The officers managed to get into the house.

PC Burns said it was ""in a bit of a disarray"", adding: ""There was a fair bit of disturbance to the house.""

The officer claimed kitchen cabinets were off the wall, the floor was partially tiled and there was concrete showing.

Innes admitted that Ms Burke had travelled to Dundee with him. The pair had met via an online dating site.

Speaking to PC Brogan, he said he saw ""dozens of WhatsApp messages from many different males"" to Ms Burke.

He reportedly said: ""She had a date arranged for Monday. That's when I realised I was one of the 50 men she was speaking to.""

Innes then claimed to have ended the relationship and left Ms Burke and Jellica at the Old Inns Cafe in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, in the company of another man.

After again being challenged by PC Burns, Innes allegedly confessed: ""I killed her, she's under the floor. We got into a fight and I killed her.""

He then queried what the jail sentence was for murder, before adding: ""It wasn't premeditated.""

The court had earlier heard that Mrs Burke, originally from the Philippines, had lived in Bristol after marrying Lexington Burke, 65, in August 2019.

Giving evidence to the court, Mr Burke said their relationship later broke down.

Mr Burke said he was due to pick up daughter Jellica on 19 February 2021 but was unable to reach Ms Burke.

Along with phone calls and text messages, he also posted a note through Ms Burke's door.

Image: Bennylyn Burke was buried under Andrew Innes' kitchen floor

Mr Burke said it was then he notified the police.

He said: ""My concern had reached the point of extreme concern.""

Ms Burke's disappearance was deemed ""out of character"".

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke, from Bristol, on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Innes is additionally accused of sexually assaulting Jellica. He denies a further charge of raping a primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

All the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes' house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.

The trial, before Lord Beckett, continues on Wednesday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131205842/http://news.sky.com/story/i-killed-her-shes-under-the-floor-moment-man-confessed-to-killing-woman-at-his-home-recounted-in-court-12800110;Category-5: entertainment and culture

Enzo Fernandez: Chelsea sign Argentina star for £106.8m, the biggest-ever British transfer fee;Wednesday 1 February 2023 00:41, UK;[];[];"Chelsea have signed Enzo Fernandez for £106.8m - breaking records for Britain's biggest-ever transfer fee.

The Argentinian midfielder played a key role in his country's 2022 World Cup win and scooped the competition's best young player award.

Fernandez, 22, will make the move from Portuguese side Benfica.

The deal breaks the previous record of £100m, paid by Manchester City to Aston Villa for England star Jack Grealish in August 2021.

It means Chelsea have now spent more than £300m on transfers in January, including securing an £88.5m deal for Ukrainian forward Mykhailo Mudryk.

Fernandez was left out of Benfica's squad for their game against Arouca on Tuesday night - and underwent a medical in Portugal ahead of his switch to Stamford Bridge.

According to Portuguese broadcaster SIC, Fernandez will fly to the UK this morning, with a private jet scheduled to leave Lisbon airport at 10.20am.

Fernandez will help to replace Jorginho, who joined Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal on Deadline Day in a £12m deal.

This is the biggest deal in the history of British football - and Chelsea have spent more money on transfers than all the other clubs in the major European leagues put together: Germany, Spain, Italy and France.

Revealed: Which chains put a 'massive' amount of caffeine in their coffees... and which don't;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:25, UK;[];[];"A new study has revealed the ""huge"" differences in the amount of caffeine in coffees from leading high street chains like Costa, Starbucks and Pret A Manger.

Which? found that a medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea and almost five times stronger than a Starbucks cappuccino.

While the variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains, nutritionists say you may be consuming ""significantly more or less caffeine than you bargained for"".

The study found that cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret A Manger contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, at 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.

When it comes to a single espresso, one from Starbucks contains a ""meagre"" 33mg of caffeine - meaning at 180mg, one from Pret contains almost six times more.

On filter coffee, Pret A Manger led the way with the most caffeine at 271mg - two-and-a-half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second containing 225mg.

The variations are also due to the type of coffee beans used, of which there are two main types - Arabica and Robusta.

Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two.

'Big variations in caffeine content'

Which? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said the research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for.

""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops.

""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""

The findings also show that buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.

The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.

A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: ""The amount of caffeine included within each coffee varies, depending on both the coffee and size of drink ordered by a customer.""

World Hijab Day and the women who are breaking boundaries and stereotypes;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:15, UK;[];[];"The hijab has long evoked strong feelings, both within Islam and among non-followers of the religion.

World Hijab Day was created in an effort to promote personal freedom of religious expression and improve cultural understanding by inviting women from all walks of life to experience the hijab for one day, on 1 February.

This year marks the 11th annual celebration and aims to encourage ""progression, not oppression"", supported by the #UnapologeticHijabi hashtag on social media.

Here, Sky News looks at the stories of four women - including the founder of the global campaign.

How it all began

Nazma Khan launched World Hijab Day in 2013 after realising she was far from alone in facing prejudice simply because she chose to cover her hair.

She travelled to the United States from Bangladesh with her family at the age of 11 and moved into her new home in the Bronx, New York.

She began to wear the hijab soon after moving, and said she had faced intolerance from some since that point.

""Women in different parts of the world were also subject to abuse and discrimination for wearing the hijab,"" she told Sky News.

""My parents came to America to give us a better education and I didn't want to disappoint them.""

As she began to build a life in a country that was foreign to her and her family, she said she was faced with many challenges and unwelcoming comments.

'Kids would wait for me outside of school to surround me and spit at me'

Describing her encounters and transitions into a new town and school, Ms Khan said students would often mock and insult her because of her hijab.

""They would call me names such as 'batman', 'ninja' and 'Mother Teresa',"" she said.

She said children ""would wait for me outside of school to surround me and spit at me"", and would often threaten to remove her hijab.

'I felt like someone had taken my identity'

Public life post-9/11 was difficult for many Muslims in the US and Ms Khan, who was attending college at the time, said it made her life much worse.

""I was chased down the streets of New York City and labelled as a terrorist for being a visibly Muslim woman,"" she said.

""I was so scared to step out of my home.""

The racist abuse and chants led her to remove her hijab.

""I thought maybe this would be easier, but it wasn't,"" she said.

""I walked into college, feeling uncomfortable, I clung onto my clothes and wanted to cover myself.""

Becoming tearful, Ms Khan said: ""I felt like someone had taken my identity away.""

After a day without the hijab, she said she decided that life without it was not what she wanted, and that she chose to challenge her strength in the face of racism and discrimination.

""After removing my hijab and wearing it again, it felt as though I was renewing my intentions with my hijab,"" she said.

She said the move felt empowering; the racist chants no longer discouraged her and instead became a source of strength.

The Facebook page that would become a global movement

In 2013, Ms Khan created a Facebook page titled ""World Hijab Day"".

It was designed as a platform where people could gather to tell their hijab stories and show support for one another.

Ms Khan said it also provided the opportunity for non-hijabis and non-Muslims to walk ""in my shoes for one day"".

""I wanted to help my sisters to ease their situation by bringing greater awareness of the hijab,"" she said.

""So, I asked women from every background and faith to wear a headscarf on February 1st in solidarity with Muslim women.""

She said that by 2014, the World Hijab Day page had reached more than 44 million people and that it became a trending topic on Twitter the following year.

Ever since its launch 10 years ago, the movement has had many milestones, including being recognised by the states of New York and Michigan and being featured on Meta's official Instagram page.

TIME Magazine recognised 1 February as World Hijab Day in 2016.

Non-muslim women now get involved in the event by wearing a hijab on 1 February, taking selfies and attending events.

Freedom of choice

While recognising the empowering benefits of the hijab to many, it is also important to acknowledge that it has taken on a very different symbolism in some parts of the world.

In Iran, women have been fighting for their freedom and the right to choose how they dress.

The death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 caused outrage across the country.

The 22-year-old had been arrested by Iran's so-called ""morality police"" for allegedly not wearing the hijab in accordance with the nation's strict laws.

Her death in custody prompted many Iranians to take to the streets to demonstrate against the government and their rules around hijabs.

In France, however, while hijabs themselves are not banned, regulations also govern how women are allowed to dress.

The country made it illegal to wear a face-covering veil or other masks in public spaces through a law passed in 2011.

And in 2022, a French court ruled that women in the city of Grenoble should not be allowed to wear full-body ""burkini"" swimsuits in public pools.

Understanding the hijab

The term hijab, in Arabic, refers to a partition or curtain - both in a literal and metaphorical sense.

It is also the name given to a garment worn by Muslim women to cover their hair, which many Muslims believe is obligatory in Islam for all females who have reached puberty.

The hijab is often worn as an act of worship in the Islamic faith.

It has become a sacred form of attire for many Muslim women and the piece is worn in various ways, in different styles and colours.

The hijab, for some, is a sign of resilience, hope and progress.

For many women and girls, it is a part of their identity and there has been significant change to the way the hijab and Islam are seen.

From the worlds of media to politics, the hijab and the women who wear it have made strides over the years to break down boundaries and re-write stereotypes associated with it.

Apsana Begum

Apsana Begum, 32, was the first hijab-wearing member of parliament, after being elected as a Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse in 2019.

Talking to Sky News about her journey, she recalled first entering the parliamentary chamber.

""It was a full house and I remember seeing heads turn from the opposite benches,"" she said.

""I stood out and realised the gravity of what we had achieved with me being elected.""

Ms Begum said she felt this paved a path for other hijabi women in the UK who also had ambitions in politics.

""It has been incredible to give people a sense of hope and a sense of aspiration,"" she said.

She also spoke about the specific challenges she faced when she was first elected.

""The context in which we were at the time with the election and with the former prime minister Boris Johnson's 'letterbox' comments... It was tough,"" she said.

The hijab, for Ms Begum, is a symbol of togetherness, and she said she felt it was at the ""core"" of who she is as an individual.

Fadumo Olow

Fadumo Olow, 27, is a sports reporter at Sky Sports who first started wearing the hijab around the age of 11.

She told Sky News her hijab journey was influenced by seeing her community members, family and friends wearing it.

Speaking on her connection to the hijab, she said that before the age of 16 she was ""very relaxed with it, maybe not understanding it too much"" but later ""made a conscious effort to understand the hijab"".

Ms Olow said that as she grew up, she learned about the ""importance of the hijab in Islam, but also the value it holds for Muslim Women around the world"".

""After the age of 16, I took it more seriously and it brought me closer to my faith,"" she said.

She says the hijab helps ""uplift"" her ""more than the average person probably thinks"", adding that it was the reason she started wearing it in the first place.

Ms Olow said the hijab made her feel ""a sense of empowerment, peace and comfort"".

When asked about the industry she works in, she said: ""It is rare to see women who wear the hijab on sports news.

""However, the steps taken towards visual representation in this industry show there is space for everyone and we are walking in the right direction.

""The hijab makes me more conscious and at ease and I hope to carry it in the best way.""

Furvah Shah

Furvah Shah is a 23-year-old journalist who started wearing the hijab at the age of 15.

She told Sky News that when she first started wearing the garment, she was faced with many difficulties.

""People I'd known for many years began to treat me differently,"" she said.

She also highlighted the abuse she dealt with as a result, experiencing Islamophobic comments and uncomfortable stares.

Choosing resilience over hatred, Ms Shah did not allow the negativity to feed into her hijab journey.

She said that she felt the hijab brought a ""sense of community"", and was a chance for her to represent her faith in a positive light and change the negative images people associate with Islam.

""The hijab, for me, is belonging and empowerment,"" she added.

So what next for Ms Khan and World Hijab Day?

Speaking about her future plans, Ms Khan said: ""We want to create a job training and mentorship program for those women who are struggling with their hijab.""

She and her team are working to create workshops within educational institutions and workplaces.

They will offer women the chance to seek help and guidance if they do feel their hijab is being threatened.

Ms Khan told Sky News that in order for people to understand Islam and the hijab, ""we need to have a dialogue to change the world, we need to bridge the gap, extending our heart and hand to others.

""It's our job to go out there and teach, so people can understand us"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201031632/https://news.sky.com/story/world-hijab-day-and-the-women-who-are-breaking-boundaries-and-stereotypes-12789502;Category-5: entertainment and culture
Firefighters at Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service 'photographed dead bodies of women in car accidents';Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:21, UK;[];[];"Police have been alerted amid claims that firefighters at Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service allegedly photographed dead bodies of women at the scene of car accidents.

ITV News reported that images were shared on a WhatsApp group in which male firefighters allegedly made degrading comments about victims.

In an interview with ITV, a female firefighter at the service said: ""There's explicit pictures, there's photos of accidents, sometimes you can even see the dead body in the accident.

""Retrieving the body of someone dead should tear you apart, not make you want to take photos of it, just to joke about it later because that's someone's loved one, isn't it? That's someone's relative.""

She also claimed she saw people ""say comments about the type of underwear the women are wearing in the car crash"".

Ben Ansell, chief fire officer of Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, said in a statement that the police have been alerted as allegations of criminal behaviour are involved.

The service is commissioning an independent investigation into the claims, during which all female staff will have the opportunity to speak to an independent organisation.

It has also set up a confidential helpline which staff can ring with any ""immediate issues"" as a result of these allegations.

Mr Ansell said: ""The matters that have been raised with us are deeply concerning and we take allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

""We are extremely shocked and appalled to hear about these allegations. We would ask that any individuals affected, provide us with further information to allow us to investigate these allegations and to enable us to offer our support to them.

""There is an expectation for our staff to work in line with our code of ethics which sets out high levels of expected behaviours. The vast majority of our staff are good people, working hard and doing a great job. But when and if those standards are not met, we will move quickly to address it.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201033805/https://news.sky.com/story/firefighters-at-dorset-and-wiltshire-fire-service-photographed-dead-bodies-of-women-in-car-accidents-12800385;Category-7: health
Revealed: Which chains put a 'massive' amount of caffeine in their coffees... and which don't;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:25, UK;[];[];"A new study has revealed the ""huge"" differences in the amount of caffeine in coffees from leading high street chains like Costa, Starbucks and Pret A Manger.

Which? found that a medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea and almost five times stronger than a Starbucks cappuccino.

While the variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains, nutritionists say you may be consuming ""significantly more or less caffeine than you bargained for"".

The study found that cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret A Manger contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, at 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.

When it comes to a single espresso, one from Starbucks contains a ""meagre"" 33mg of caffeine - meaning at 180mg, one from Pret contains almost six times more.

On filter coffee, Pret A Manger led the way with the most caffeine at 271mg - two-and-a-half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second containing 225mg.

The variations are also due to the type of coffee beans used, of which there are two main types - Arabica and Robusta.

Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two.

'Big variations in caffeine content'

Which? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said the research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for.

""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops.

""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""

The findings also show that buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.

The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.

A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: ""The amount of caffeine included within each coffee varies, depending on both the coffee and size of drink ordered by a customer.""

Enzo Fernandez: Chelsea sign Argentina star for £106.8m, the biggest-ever British transfer fee;Wednesday 1 February 2023 04:13, UK;[];[];"Chelsea have signed Enzo Fernandez for £106.8m - breaking records for Britain's biggest-ever transfer fee.

The Argentinian midfielder played a key role in his country's 2022 World Cup win and scooped the competition's best young player award.

Fernandez, 22, will make the move from Portuguese side Benfica.

The deal breaks the previous record of £100m, paid by Manchester City to Aston Villa for England star Jack Grealish in August 2021.

It means Chelsea have now spent more than £300m on transfers in January, including securing an £88.5m deal for Ukrainian forward Mykhailo Mudryk.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:02 Sky's Rob Harris explains where the cash is from, who’s getting rich and what the spending rules allow.

Fernandez was left out of Benfica's squad for their game against Arouca on Tuesday night - and underwent a medical in Portugal ahead of his switch to Stamford Bridge.

According to Portuguese broadcaster SIC, Fernandez will fly to the UK this morning, with a private jet scheduled to leave Lisbon airport at 10.20am.

Fernandez will help to replace Jorginho, who joined Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal on Deadline Day in a £12m deal.

The financial gulf between English and European football has never been more stark Rob Harris Sports correspondent @RobHarris The football financial gulf between England and the rest of Europe has been stark in the January transfer window. Premier League clubs spent about £650m combined on strengthening squads for the second half of the season. Teams in the next biggest leagues - Spain, Italy, Germany and France - spent less than £200m combined. It's an indicator of the wealth of English football, underpinned by television income (of which Sky News owner Comcast is a large contributor). Splashing the cash so freely reflects the desire for instant success. Particularly at Chelsea. No club has spent more in a year than the Blues - £600m. Half has been splurged in the January window - more than spending in the rest of Europe combined. Read full analysis here

This is the biggest deal in the history of British football - and Chelsea have spent more money on transfers than all the other clubs in the major European leagues put together: Germany, Spain, Italy and France.

Could the dodo be revived? US-based firm Colossal Biosciences announces project to bring back extinct flightless bird;Wednesday 1 February 2023 09:26, UK;[];[];"Scientists hoping to bring extinct species back to life have set their sights on reviving the dodo.

The flightless bird, native to Mauritius, infamously went extinct in the 1600s due to a combination of hunting by sailors and the destruction of its habitats by invasive species brought across to the Indian Ocean island by their ships.

But after more than 400 years since the last recorded sighting of the bird, scientists are hoping to spark a stunning Jurassic Park-style comeback.

US-based firm Colossal Biosciences, which two years ago announced plans to bring back the woolly mammoth, said it now wants to bring back the iconic bird as well.

The firm, based in Dallas, Texas, has already raised an additional $150m (£121m) to support the project.

The company hopes it can recreate the dodo through DNA - much like the fictional experts in the 1993 Steven Spielberg film.

In the Hollywood blockbuster, the scientists combined dinosaur DNA embedded in fossilised mosquitoes in amber combined with frog DNA to bring dinosaurs back to life.

In the real world, experts at Colossal Biosciences hope to take DNA from the dodo's closest living relative, the Nicobar pigeon, and edit them to resemble dodo cells.

It may be possible to put these tweaked cells into developing eggs of other birds, such as pigeons or chickens, to create offspring that may in turn naturally produce dodo eggs, according to Beth Shapiro, a molecular biologist on Colossal's scientific advisory board, who has been studying the dodo for two decades.

The concept is still in an early theoretical stage for dodos.

Ms Shaprio's team now plans to study DNA differences between the Nicobar pigeon and the dodo to understand ""what are the genes that really make a dodo a dodo"".

But Ms Shaprio warned ""it's not possible to recreate a 100% identical copy of something that's gone"".

That is because animals are a product of both their genetics and their environment - which has changed dramatically since the dodo was last sighted in the 1600s.

Other scientists, meanwhile, are sceptical about the idea of the project, warning that ""de-extinction"" efforts divert attention and money away from efforts to save species still on Earth.

Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm said: ""There's a real hazard in saying that if we destroy nature, we can just put it back together again - because we can't.

""And where on Earth would you put a woolly mammoth, other than in a cage?""

Boris Worm, a biologist at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Nova Scotia, added: ""Preventing species from going extinct in the first place should be our priority, and in most cases, it's a lot cheaper.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201093414/http://news.sky.com/story/could-the-dodo-be-revived-us-based-firm-colossal-biosciences-announces-project-to-bring-back-extinct-flightless-bird-12800424;Category-6: science and technology
British Steel draws up plan for 800 job losses amid government funding talks;Wednesday 1 February 2023 12:25, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Britain's second-biggest steel producer has been drawing up secret plans to axe hundreds of jobs even as it continues talks with ministers about £300m of taxpayer funding that would partly depend on decade-long employment guarantees.

Sky News has learnt that British Steel has been discussing launching a consultation on around 800 redundancies, principally focused on the Scunthorpe plant in north Lincolnshire where the company is based.

One industry insider said there was a possibility that trade union officials could be briefed on the proposals as early as Wednesday, although there remained a possibility that their disclosure could be delayed pending the outcome of negotiations with the government.

The planned cuts would arise from the closure of coke ovens, although Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces and other mills within the Chinese-owned group would continue to operate, the insider said.

Any redundancy proposals would be certain to draw a sharp response from the government given that its offer of £300m of state support is partly predicated upon providing job guarantees lasting for a decade.

A source suggested job cuts would ""complicate"" the talks between the two sides.

Last week, Sky News revealed that British Steel and larger rival Tata Steel would be required to guarantee thousands of jobs until 2033 in return for £600m of government support to help decarbonise the industry.

Grant Shapps, the business secretary, has told the companies that the proportion of their workforces that would need to be secured would be determined after further discussions.

A six-month moratorium on redundancies is another one of the conditions of the government offer.

The taxpayer funding is to be linked to the replacement of blast furnaces at the company's sites with greener electric arc furnaces.

Jingye Group, British Steel's owner, would be obliged to invest at least £1bn in the business by 2030, with Tata Steel expected to be asked for a similar commitment.

The decision to grant the state aid is not without controversy, given British Steel's Chinese ownership and doubts about its adherence to financial commitments made when it bought the business out of insolvency proceedings in 2020.

In a letter to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, in December, Grant Shapps and Michael Gove, the levelling-up secretary, warned that British Steel's demise could cost the government up to £1bn in decommissioning and other liabilities.

They cautioned Mr Hunt that British Steel ""does not have a viable business without government support"".

""Closing one blast furnace would be a stepping-stone to closure of the second blast furnace, resulting in a highly unstable business model dependent on Chinese steel imports,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""Given the magnitude of the liabilities due to fall on HMG in the event of blast furnace closure, and following the PM's steer, we would like officials to test whether net Government support in the region of £300m for British Steel could prevent closure, protect jobs and create a cleaner viable long-term future for steel production in the United Kingdom.""

They also argued that retaining sovereignty over steel production was critical to the UK economy.

""Every other G20 nation has maintained domestic steel production and, while we do not think that this should come at any cost, we do believe it is in HMG's interest to offer well-designed and targeted funding which unlocks private investment, achieves a good outcome for taxpayers, and enables transformed, decarbonised and viable domestic steel production to continue in the UK in the long-term,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""We do not want to become reliant on steel sources elsewhere in the same way that energy security has become self-evidently important.

The fate of British Steel, which was bought by Jingye out of an insolvency process just under three years ago, has become increasingly unclear in recent months as the current owners have indicated that they would not maintain its operations without taxpayer funding.

British Steel employs about 4,000 people, with thousands more jobs in its supply chain dependent upon the company.

Tata Steel employs substantially more people in the UK, including more than 4,000 at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.

According to last month's letter, British Steel had already informed the government that it could close one of the Scunthorpe blast furnaces as soon as next month, with the loss of 1,700 jobs.

This would be ""followed by the second blast furnace closing later in 2023, creating cumulative direct job losses of around 3,000"", Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

In May 2019, the Official Receiver was appointed to take control of the company after negotiations over an emergency £30m government loan fell apart.

British Steel had been formed in 2016 when India's Tata Steel sold the business for £1 to Greybull Capital, an investment firm.

As part of the deal that secured ownership of British Steel for Jingye, the Chinese group said it would invest £1.2bn in modernising the business during the following decade.

Jingye's purchase of the company, which completed in the spring of 2020, was hailed by Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, as assuring the future of steel production in Britain's industrial heartlands.

Lee Peacock sentenced to 39 years for murdering girlfriend and associate just weeks after release from jail;Wednesday 1 February 2023 12:43, UK;[];[];"A ""warped and angry"" killer who murdered his girlfriend and an associate within weeks of being released from jail has been sentenced to a minimum of 39 years.

Lee Peacock, 50, cut the throats of 46-year-old Sharon Pickles and 59-year-old Clinton Ashmore in London in August 2021.

Peacock, a self-confessed burglar and thief, had only been released from prison in June the same year.

The Old Bailey judge said the 39-year minimum term meant there was a ""strong possibility"" the killer would die in jail.

The murders took place over two days and Peacock tried to cut his own throat after a five-day manhunt led police to a houseboat where he was hiding.

During his trial, he admitted killing the pair but denied it was murder, claiming Ms Pickles' death was an accident and that Mr Ashmore had punched him in the head after he confessed to killing her.

But prosecutors described Peacock's actions as ""cold-blooded"" and ""determined"".

Jurors were told he turned up at his father's property with Ms Pickles' kitten in his rucksack on the evening of 19 August 2021.

His father alerted police and said Peacock had confessed to killing her.

Officers went to Ms Pickles' home in Marylebone, central London, and found her body wrapped up and hidden under a bed, with a signed confession nearby.

In the note, Peacock said that Ms Pickles was ""meant to live"" and he had sworn ""revenge"" against those who took advantage while he was in jail.

Later that day, Peacock was seen on CCTV walking with Mr Ashmore towards his Westminster flat, then leaving alone 15 minutes later.

Mr Ashmore was found dead by friends two hours later. Both victims died from similar knife wounds to the neck.

Peacock and the kitten were tracked down on 25 August and when officers arrived, he tried to turn the knife on himself being restrained.

More notes confessing to the murders and explaining the reasons for them were found in his pocket.

After being treated in hospital, Peacock gave a ""chilling"" account, saying he had used the same knife in both killings and the attempt on his own life.

Giving evidence, Peacock insisted he was ""not a monster"" and he never intended to harm either of his victims.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201123454/http://news.sky.com/story/lee-peacock-sentenced-to-39-years-for-murdering-girlfriend-and-associate-just-weeks-after-release-from-jail-12800643;Category-7: health
Bankside flat owners win privacy case over Tate Modern viewing platform as Supreme Court rules in their favour;Wednesday 1 February 2023 11:23, UK;[];[];"Owners of four luxury flats overlooked by the Tate Modern's public viewing platform have won their long-running privacy case at the Supreme Court.

Neo Bankside residents said ""hundreds of thousands"" of visitors to the world-famous London gallery were looking into their homes in a ""relentless"" invasion of privacy.

They wanted the gallery to cordon off parts of the platform or put up screens.

The High Court and Court of Appeal sided with the gallery, but the residents took the case to the Supreme Court and on Wednesday it ruled 3-2 in their favour.

It said a viewing gallery was not a ""normal"" use of the gallery's land and that it was a legal ""nuisance"" to the flat owners who couldn't properly enjoy their property.

The properties have floor-to-ceiling windows and the Supreme Court's Lord Leggatt likened it to ""being on display in a zoo"".

""Inviting members of the public to look out from a viewing gallery is manifestly a very particular and exceptional use of land,"" he said.

""It cannot even be said to be a necessary or ordinary incident of operating an art museum.""

Shortly after the platform opened in 2016, the gallery's former boss suggested owners simply put up blinds or curtains and claimed people buying flats were aware the platform was due to open.

But Lord Leggatt said residents ""cannot be obliged to live behind net curtains or with their blinds drawn all day"" to protect themselves from prying eyes.

He also said the Court of Appeal had made legal errors when dismissing a bid for injunction and damages.

Flat owners next to Tate Modern win privacy case over viewing platform as Supreme Court rules in their favour;Wednesday 1 February 2023 12:24, UK;[];[];"Owners of four luxury flats overlooked by the Tate Modern's public viewing platform have won their long-running privacy case at the Supreme Court.

Neo Bankside residents said ""hundreds of thousands"" of visitors to the world-famous London gallery were looking into their homes in a ""relentless"" invasion of privacy.

They wanted the gallery to cordon off parts of the platform or put up screens.

The High Court and Court of Appeal sided with the gallery, but the residents took the case to the Supreme Court and on Wednesday it ruled 3-2 in their favour.

It said a viewing gallery was not a normal use of the gallery's land and that it was a legal ""nuisance"" to the flat owners who couldn't properly enjoy their property.

The properties have floor-to-ceiling windows and the Supreme Court's Lord Leggatt likened it to ""being on display in a zoo"".

""Inviting members of the public to look out from a viewing gallery is manifestly a very particular and exceptional use of land,"" he said.

""It cannot even be said to be a necessary or ordinary incident of operating an art museum.""

Shortly after the platform opened in 2016, the gallery's former boss suggested owners simply put up blinds or curtains and claimed people buying flats were aware the platform was due to open.

But Lord Leggatt said residents ""cannot be obliged to live behind net curtains or with their blinds drawn all day"" to protect themselves from prying eyes.

He also said the Court of Appeal had made legal errors when dismissing a bid for injunction and damages.

Andrew Innes: Double murder suspect 'killed toddler during game of hide and seek', court hears;Wednesday 1 February 2023 15:22, UK;[];[];"A double murder suspect allegedly killed a toddler during a game of hide and seek at a house in Dundee, a court has heard.

Warning: This story contains graphic content and details of alleged sexual abuse

In video evidence shown to jurors, a primary school-aged child claimed they never saw two-year-old Jellica Burke again after the game with 52-year-old Andrew Innes.

Innes denies murdering Jellica and her mother Bennylyn Burke, 25, and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Innes is currently on trial for murder at the High Court in Edinburgh.

The child giving evidence, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Innes ""pretended"" Jellica was hiding but had ""killed"" her.

Image: Jellica Burke was two years old

The child believed the alleged killing happened in the bathroom as Innes shut her out of the room.

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Innes denies further charges of abducting and raping the primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

Andrew Innes told police officer: ""She's under the floor""

The court was closed to the public while video evidence recorded with the alleged rape victim was played to the jury.

The child described sexual acts they reportedly had been told to carry out by Innes and claimed they were paid money after each alleged assault.

The child told the court that Innes even presented them with a purse to keep their 'savings' in. They claimed that Innes also used handcuffs on them, describing that it felt ""terrible"".

Forensic scientist Barry Mitchell later took to the stand and said that Innes's DNA was found on the child's pyjama bottoms.

He said the child and Ms Burke's DNA were also found on Innes's dressing gown.

All of the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes's house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.

Earlier this week, the court heard that Mrs Burke, originally from the Philippines, had lived in Bristol after marrying Lexington Burke, 65, in August 2019. Their relationship later broke down.

Ms Burke and Innes were then said to have met via an online dating site. Innes reportedly confirmed to police that Ms Burke had travelled from Bristol to Dundee with him.

While giving evidence, PC Gavin Burns, 33, told the court that Innes admitted killing Ms Burke when Police Scotland officers visited his home as part of a high-risk missing persons inquiry.

After again being challenged by PC Burns on Ms Burke's whereabouts, Innes reportedly confessed: ""I killed her, she's under the floor. We got into a fight and I killed her.""

He then reportedly queried what the jail sentence was for murder, before allegedly adding: ""It wasn't premeditated.""

Another 1,500 patients of jailed breast surgeon Ian Paterson being recalled;Wednesday 1 February 2023 14:35, UK;[];[];"Around 1,500 more patients of convicted breast surgeon Ian Paterson are being recalled by health officials so their treatment can be investigated.

Spire Healthcare, which runs private hospitals, announced the move after revisiting ""historic legacy IT systems"" which had been thought to be ""inaccessible"".

Solicitors who have represented hundreds of Paterson's clients asked how so many people had been missed off earlier recalls ""due to a computer glitch"".

Paterson was jailed for 20 years in 2017 for 17 counts of wounding people with intent.

He subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging operations over 14 years.

A 2020 independent inquiry ruled he was free to perform harmful surgery in NHS and private hospitals because of ""a culture of avoidance and denial"".

The inquiry said all 11,000 patients Paterson treated should be recalled for review.

Between 1997 and 2011, Paterson is known to have treated thousands of patients at Spire Parkway hospital and Spire Little Aston hospital in the West Midlands.

This was alongside his work at NHS hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust.

In a statement, Spire said further checks were carried out to be ""certain that there were no outstanding patients who might require support, dating back to the earliest years of his practice"".

It added: ""To do this, (Spire) revisited historic legacy IT systems, in use between 1993 and the early 2000s, containing information about patients from over 20 years ago which had been thought to be inaccessible.

""However, following a further complex analysis of these legacy systems, Spire was able to identify the details of around 1,500 patients.""

Dr Cathy Cale, Spire's group medical director, said: ""We are very sorry for the significant distress and harm suffered by patients who were treated by Ian Paterson.

""We accepted the recommendations of the independent inquiry into Paterson in 2020 and are fully committed to implementing them.""

'Recall will bring back bitter memories'

Linda Millband, head of clinical negligence at Thompsons Solicitors, which has represented hundreds of Paterson's clients, said: ""The fact that 1,500 patients could have been missed off both previous recalls shows how extensively Spire enabled Paterson to practice.

""For patients who have suffered from his negligence and for those who have lost loved ones, this recall will bring back bitter memories. For those being alerted for the first time there will be shock and worry.

""You would have thought that after two recalls Spire would not have left any stone unturned, yet they missed at least 1,500 people due to a computer glitch. It begs the question - 'what next'?""

Politics news latest: Downing Street's defence of Dominic Raab coming under scrutiny - as Labour focus on sleaze amid evidence of 'cut through' with public;;[];[];"Johnson says it would be 'game over' for Putin if Ukraine takes back land bridge

Former prime minister Boris Johnson is currently in the US.

He is stateside as part of a push to maintain the West's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.

The ex-PM has been speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC, this afternoon.

Mr Johnson said there is ""no conceivable grounds for delay"" from Western countries - days after Germany was criticised by some for appearing slow to decide on providing tanks to Ukraine.

Western allies should ""give the Ukrainians the support they need to finish this war"", Mr Johnson said, adding: ""Let's give them those tools now.""

He added that if Ukraine is able to take back the strip of land in southern Ukraine between Mariupol, the Donbas and Crimea, this will help to end the war.



""If they can take back Melitopol and Berdiansk and Mariupol, get back those areas, it's game over for Putin,"" he said.

Returning to his arguments later in the discussion, he said it would be a ""false economy to let Putin win"".

This, he said, would be ""burdening future generations with the massive expense of trying to protect the whole area"".

We reported earlier on comments from Mr Johnson to Fox News in the US, with the former PM calling for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Downing Street has said Mr Johnson's visit to Washington was ""not on behalf of the UK government"" and has distanced itself from the former leader's comments on fighter jets.

Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace.""

But he said Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity"".

On the possibility of sending jets, the official said: ""It's currently not practical to send UK jets.

""We will continue to work closely with the Ukrainians to understand their needs and how allies can further support them.

""Given the complexity of UK fighter jets and the length of time required to train them, we do not currently think it is practical to do so.""

Downing Street said the RAF's Typhoons and F-35s are ""extremely sophisticated"" pieces of equipment.

Strikes take toll on economy as widespread disruption forces many to stay at home;Wednesday 1 February 2023 18:02, UK;['gurpreet narwan', '@gurpreetnarwan'];[];"Britain is experiencing its biggest day of industrial action for more than a decade, with up to half a million people walking out across the country.

Civil servants, train drivers, teachers and border force staff are all taking part in co-ordinated strike action to appeal against real-terms pay cuts - wage levels that fail to keep up with the rate of inflation.

It has led to widespread disruption across the country, with thousands of schools closing their doors and footfall plummeting across the country's high streets.

The strike action is expected to cost the economy close to £100m, according to economists at the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CEBR).

This figure includes £68m of direct costs linked to lost working days in the railway and education sectors, as well as the civil service.

Economists said that absences among those who cannot work from home and rely on the train network to commute to their place of work will cost the economy an additional £26m.

""These figures (together £94m) represent a lower bound estimate, as they do not capture impacts such as parents taking time off work during school closures, reduced retail/hospitality footfall, among others.

""It will, however, mark the costliest day of action across the whole of the eight-month current strike period,"" the CEBR said.

About 85% of the 23,000 state schools in England and Wales are closed or partially closed today, with parents forced to stay at home as a result.

Data submitted, by schools, to the Department for Education showed that 45.9% of all schools in England were estimated to be fully open.

Of the rest, 44.7% were open but restricting attendance.

High street businesses were also reeling from falling footfall.

According to the data company Springboard, footfall across retail centres across London was down 16.5% compared to last week and down 9.2% in other cities across the UK.

Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, said: ""Once again the rail strikes occurring across the UK today are having a significantly adverse impact on footfall across retail destinations, but particularly in high streets, with the most severe impact being felt in large cities which comprise the largest working populations where many have chosen to work from home.""

In a further sign of reduced economic activity, congestion on the roads fell significantly, with many parents staying at home instead of dropping their children to school or going to work.

The sat nav company TomTom said that traffic at the 9am peak was down 43% in Liverpool and Bristol, compared to the same time last Wednesday.

Traffic was down 40% in Cardiff, 31% in Sheffield, 27% in Manchester, 24% in London, 22% in Birmingham and 19% in Glasgow.

On the London tube network, the number of entries and exits up until 10am this morning was down 23% on last week to 1.39 million, while bus usage was down 18% to 1.12 million journeys.

Andy Marchant, a traffic Expert at TomTom, said: ""As half a million workers go on strike across the UK today, shutting down rail lines and schools, TomTom data has shown that congestion during this morning's rush hour has fallen significantly from its usual levels.

""Our data suggests that workers have become accustomed to the disruption and are planning their commute accordingly or are staying at home altogether, heeding the advice to avoid any unnecessary travel and brace for significant disruption to their daily lives.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201154157/http://news.sky.com/story/strikes-take-toll-on-economy-as-widespread-disruption-forces-many-to-stay-at-home-12800759;Category-2: business and economy

Strikes on course to expand and escalate this year without compromises;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:01, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Unions have been taking strike action for months but today the wave of strikes that began last summer finally broke at the entrance to Downing Street.

The biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade saw about 500,000 workers walk out across the country, led by hundreds of thousands of teachers.

The centrepiece was a march in central London led by the National Education Union (NEU), attended by tens of thousands of teachers, children and parents - not a bad turnout given a rail strike had been called in solidarity.

Widespread strikes hit UK - live updates

Gathering in the sun outside BBC Broadcasting House the mood was determinedly good-natured, with women in the majority, plenty of children along for the day out, and hundreds of home-made signs suggesting DT (design-technology) classes have been busy in the last week.

For all the good humour, this still amounted to a show of strength from the public sector, a signal as the government appears to dig in on multiple pay disputes, that they are here for the long haul too.

As the march wound through Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square there was a common theme; fairness.

""If bankers' pay has been uncapped, why can ours be held down?"" asked Rosell Rundell, a secondary school teacher from Pimlico Academy.

""We're not being paid in line with inflation, it used to increase year on year so we could afford to live but it's not happened for a long time,"" said Brickley Stuhrdent, an English teacher from Oasis Academy Shirley Park in Croydon. ""We are here because we absolutely love teaching and we want to be able to keep doing it.""

At the head of the march Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, was dismissive of the government position, articulated on a morning media round by the education secretary that there is no money to pay teachers more than the 5% on the table.

""I think the government doesn't know how to negotiate, it doesn't understand unions, it doesn't recognise our legitimate place and it doesn't know negotiation takes hard work, not an hour's meeting here or there, and compromise,"" she said.

Asked by Sky News if there was an acceptable pay offer between the 5% and the current inflation rate of 10%, Ms Bousted said: ""There might be but I'm not negotiating it with you. There's always a compromise to be struck but it has to be based on a real improvement in my members' wages.""

On Whitehall the teachers were met by members of the Public & Commercial Services (PCS) union picketing the Cabinet Office, some of the 100,000 civil servants who walked out of 124 government departments, including Border Force posts and Job Centres.

Mick Lynch of the RMT, the most recognisable of union bosses who has used the rail dispute as a platform to campaign for higher public sector pay, said the solidarity pointed to a protracted dispute.

""This turnout is sending a clear message, people are fed up with the way they are being treated,"" he said. ""Many of these workers have not had a proper pay rise for more than 10 years.

What the unions have in common is a demand that pay keeps up with inflation, currently running at more than 10%, and having existing offers of no more than 5%, and only half that in the case of the PCS.

The government line, made by education secretary Gillian Keegan, is that there is no money available for higher pay, and if there was, higher settlements risked fuelling inflation.

The notion of a wage-price spiral, in which higher pay entrenches inflation, is deeply contested economic territory, particularly when it comes to public servants whose pay is funded by the taxpayer, rather than customers.

Sky News understands there has been no private contact with unions indicating that a compromise may be imminent.

Jeremy Hunt has still not responded to an invitation to meet with union bosses despite offering to do so.

Individual ministers say they are ready to talk but Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said without a mandate from the top they are wasting their breath.

""The reality is that ministers are not empowered to negotiate properly so the prime minister needs to come out of hiding, put money on the table and deliver a fair pay settlement for public sector workers,"" he said.

Andrew Tate: Court upholds decision to extend controversial influencer's 30-day detention after appeal dismissed;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:20, UK;[];[];"A Romanian court has upheld the decision to extend the detention of controversial influencer Andrew Tate to 30 days.

The British-American national and his brother Tristan have been in custody since 29 December on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.

Andrew Tate, a professional kickboxer turned influencer, has lost his appeal at the Bucharest Court of Appeal against a judge's 20 January decision to extend his arrest a second time for 30 days, said Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania's anti-organized crime agency DIICOT.

The 36-year-old arrived at court handcuffed to his brother Tristan who is held in the same case along with two Romanian women.

It is alleged the Tates recruited their victims by seducing them and falsely claiming to want a relationship or marriage.

Prosecutors say the women were then forced to produce pornographic content under duress.

Andrew Tate is also accused of raping one of the victims in March 2022.

All four deny the allegations.

The court has rejected all four of their appeals against extending their arrests for 30 days and they will remain in custody until 27 February as prosecutors continue investigating the case.

As he left court on Wednesday, Andrew Tate said: ""Ask them for evidence and they will give you none, because it doesn't exist. You'll find out the truth of this case soon.""

A document seen by the Associated Press news agency explaining the 20 January decision said the judge took into account the ""particular dangerousness of the defendants"" and their capacity to identify victims ""with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities"".

Ioan Gliga, a lawyer representing the Tate brothers, said the defence presented ""solid arguments"" that the extended detention period ""is not necessary"".

Meanwhile, US lawyer Tina Glandian, who has joined the Tates' legal team, told a news conference on Wednesday there was a lack of evidence against the brothers.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:46 'Insufficient evidence against Andrew Tate'.

Both brothers took turns addressing the court during the latest hearing and were ""very forthcoming"", said Ms Glandian.

She said the lack of evidence was shown by the fact there were still no charges despite the brothers being in custody for a month and police investigating since April.

She called it a ""violation of international human rights and the due process of law"" and suggested ""outside pressures"" were keeping them locked up.

Ms Glandian said that Tristan Tate had also been unable to meet his new three-week-old child.

She also denied the brothers could flee Romania and suggested other measures such as removing passports or house arrest could be used.

Andrew Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

He has claimed there is ""zero evidence"" against him in the case and alleged it is instead a political attack to silence him.

""My case is not criminal, it's political. It's not about justice or fairness. It's about attacking my influence on the world,"" read a post that appeared on his Twitter account which was reinstated in November.

After the Tates and the two women were arrested, Romania's anti-organised crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.

The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love, and later intimidated, surveilled and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for substantial financial gains.

Earlier in January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest where they towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a blue Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche.

They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9m (£3.2m).

Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims.

Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/andrew-tate-court-upholds-decision-to-extend-controversial-influencers-30-day-detention-after-appeal-dismissed-12800798;Category-1: politics

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has been already visible through binoculars and telescopes, but will look so bright on Wednesday and Thursday night that you could be able to see it with the naked eye.

Here's how to make sure you have a spectacular view.

What time should you be on the lookout?

The first two nights of February were earmarked as the best time to see the comet because that's when it will be closest to the Earth - a mere 28 million miles away.

It means it will be visible from both the northern and southern hemisphere.

Dr Greg Brown, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, tells Sky News that those in the UK should wait until after midnight for the optimal view.

""In northern latitudes, like the UK, this part of the sky is low above the horizon early in the evening at this time, so waiting until after midnight, when it is much higher, is your best bet,"" he says.

""The comet is at its brightest about now and will quickly drop in brightness as it starts to move away from us.""

Where should you be looking?

The comet has travelled through the Corona Borealis, Bootes, Draco, and Ursa Minor constellations on its way to Camelopardalis the giraffe.

But you might be best served looking roughly halfway between Ursa Major and Minor, the two bears, Dr Brown says.

If that has you scratching your head, you might want to consider a stargazing app like Night Sky or SkyView to help locate the constellations.

By pointing your smartphone's camera up at the night sky, such apps will use augmented reality to tell you which constellations you're looking at and offer tips on how to spot comets.

As for your location on the ground, Dr Brown suggests a place with ""minimal light pollution"".

He adds: ""Beyond that, as long as your sky is clear and you have a view of the part of the sky the comet is in, you should have a good chance.""

And I don't need any extra equipment?

C/2022 E3 (ZTF) falls just below the brightness that all but guarantees its visibility with the naked eye, but there's a reasonable chance that it will be.

But Dr Brown says that a decent pair of binoculars or small telescope would of course make a difference.

Sky News reader John Short took the photo at the top of this article using a Vaonis Vespera smart telescope.

As for those aforementioned apps, some of them don't update regularly enough to include newly found objects like C/2022 E3 (ZTF), but the major ones at the top of your phone's app store search results should do.

And either way, they'll be useful for helping you find those constellations if you're unsure.

Dr Brown also recommends trying web-based resources like The Sky Live, which track new and popular interstellar objects and can help plan your observation.

What if I'm reading this on Friday - am I out of luck?

Not necessarily!

This comet was visible before Wednesday night, and it will be visible beyond Thursday - you'll just need equipment.

""It should still be a decent sight for a few weeks,"" says Dr Brown.

""Though it will rapidly stop being visible through binoculars, requiring a small-medium telescope as it fades.

""It will also be moving across the sky throughout this time, so be sure to check where it is before hunting for it.""

And sorry, I should have asked this earlier… why is the comet green?

This icy green comet gets its colour due to a reaction between its gases and the sun.

The carbon compounds in those gases coming from the comet interact with ultraviolet light from the sun, and that's what gives it its green glow.

It makes for a striking sight, and its orbital period - how long it takes to travel round the sun - means the last time it illuminated the night sky was back in the Stone Age.

So, if you're heading out to see it, the very best of luck.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/its-your-best-chance-to-spot-a-once-in-a-lifetime-green-comet-heres-how-12800772;Category-3: environment
Kaylea Titford: Father accused of allowing the death of his obese daughter admits he 'could have done more' to help her;Wednesday 1 February 2023 15:57, UK;['tom gillespie', '@tomgillespie1'];[];"A father accused of causing or allowing the death of his obese teenage daughter has admitted he could have done more to help her.

Kaylea Titford, 16, weighed 22st and 13lbs, with a body mass index of 70, when she died in October 2020 at her home in Newtown, Powys, Wales, where she was found lying in soiled clothing and bed linen.

Her father Alun Titford had messaged her the night before her death and told her to ""stop screaming"" if she had a bad chest, Mold Crown Court heard.

Titford, of Colwyn, Newtown, denies manslaughter by gross negligence and an alternative count of causing or allowing the death of a child.

Giving evidence on Wednesday, Titford was asked by David Elias KC, defending, if he could have done more to help Kaylea.

He replied: ""Yeah. I could just have done more.""

Titford, 45, was asked whether he was the best father he could have been to any of his six children.

He said: ""No. I'm just not very good.""

The removals worker said Kaylea was a ""lovely"" child.

He told the court he would take his daughter, who had spina bifida and used a wheelchair, to medical appointments and help with her care but as she got older he became less involved.

He said: ""I stepped back. I didn't do as much for her. She was getting older and I just didn't feel comfortable.""

He said Kaylea was looked after by her mother, Sarah Lloyd-Jones, who has pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter.

""I presumed everything was being done,"" he said.

Titford said Kaylea's weight became harder to manage as she got older.

The dietitian service dealing with Kaylea discharged her and social workers stopped visiting, the court heard.

Titford told the court ""most days"" Kaylea would scream if her siblings or parents went into her room and she did not want them there.

He added that she had a cold the night before her death and could not hear what was being said but could hear Kaylea screaming.

Titford said he thought one of her siblings was in her room with Kaylea not wanting them there.

The court heard he then messaged her just after 10.30pm and said: ""If you have a bad chest stop screaming.""

The next morning, he said he was woken by Lloyd-Jones who was crying and told him Kaylea was dead so he went to check her.

He said: ""I just touched her and I could tell.""

Titford said his mother was contacted and she phoned emergency services.

When paramedics arrived Titford was sitting on the stairs, the jury was told, and did not go back to Kaylea's room.

He said: ""I couldn't. I was too upset.""

Asked why Kaylea's bedroom was so cluttered, Titford said: ""We just didn't throw nothing away.""

Titford said Lloyd-Jones, who worked as a carer, had not discussed any problems or difficulties with Kaylea's hygiene.

Lloyd-Jones messaged Titford on 23 February 2020 saying ""I've had enough of everything, my life, the lot"", the court heard.

He replied: ""OK. I'll take the day off then, shall I?""

He said ""now and again"" there would be arguments about what was being done by others in the family and they would ""talk it through"".

The trial continues.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/kaylea-titford-father-accused-of-allowing-the-death-of-his-obese-daughter-admits-he-could-have-done-more-to-help-her-12800764;Category-7: health
RAF chief admits mistakes over 'discrimination' against white men;Wednesday 1 February 2023 20:51, UK;['deborah haynes', '@haynesdeborah'];[];"The head of the Royal Air Force admitted to mistakes and failings after it was claimed that the former head of recruitment had identified ""around 160 cases"" of discrimination against white men.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, appearing before a committee of MPs on Wednesday for the first time since the scandal broke last year, said it had been wrong for ""stretching aspirational"" goals - that he set to improve diversity in the RAF - to end up as ""unattainable"" recruitment targets for his recruitment teams.

""That put intolerable stress on them and that was a failing of the organisation - where an aspirational goal becomes an individual's target,"" he said.

Looking incredibly uncomfortable, the RAF chief, for the first time in public, also offered an apology to Group Captain Lizzy Nicholl for feeling as though she had no choice but to resign as head of recruitment.

However, he insisted that there had not been any ""active discrimination"" against white men.

The RAF chief came under heavy fire from the defence select committee over what happened to Group Captain Nicholl, who quit because she refused to implement what she deemed to be an ""unlawful order"" to favour women and ethnic minorities when selecting individuals for training courses.

Sky News first reported the resignation last August.

Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, said that he believed legal action was going to be taken against the RAF over the matter, which he called a ""blot on the copy book"" of the air force.

He said the order that the head of recruitment refused to implement had come down from her chain of command, noting that Air Chief Marshal Wigston sat at the top.

""My question today is: 'Did the wrong person resign?'"" Mr Ellwood asked.

Air Chief Marshal Wigston said that he was limited in what he could say about Group Captain Nicholl's case because it is the topic of an ongoing inquiry. It revolved around an order that was given to the officer last August and was never implemented because she quit.

Before this happened, though, Mr Ellwood said she had allegedly already discovered a recruitment practice that appeared to favour women and ethnic minority candidates over white men in a bid to improve the RAF's diversity targets.

""She determined that, I understand, about 160 cases of positive discrimination had taken place and she ended up having to resign not wishing to go through with this policy,"" Mr Ellwood said.

The RAF chief admitted that mistakes had been made ""historically"".

He said it hinged around how certain recruits - based on gender and ethnicity - had been accelerated onto courses ahead of white men, something that was only identified as an ""error"" at the start of last year.

""Prior to that a limited number of women and ethnic minority candidates who had passed through the recruiting system were allocated additional slots onto basic training,"" Air Chief Marshal Wigston said.

However, he stressed that no one had done anything intentionally wrong.

""Throughout all of this, I have seen nothing to indicate that people were giving directions that they believed to be unlawful.

""They were working under the assumption that what they were doing was lawful and it was all done under the best of intent to tackle this intractable challenge,"" he said, referring to the goal to recruit more women and ethnic minorities.

As for his own track record, the head of the air force said: ""I make no apologies for setting a challenging aspirational goal for the Royal Air Force for diversity.

""Those are challenging goals, those are stretching aspirational levels of ambition … One of the mistakes we have identified is that that aspirational goal … when it was translated into the strategy and then translated into our business plan and then trickled down into individual recruiting officers', recruiting sergeants' in-year personal objectives and was an unattainable target that put intolerable stress on them, and that was a failing of the organisation where an aspirational goal becomes an individual's target.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/raf-chief-admits-mistakes-over-discrimination-against-white-men-12800895;Category-1: politics

Andrew Innes: Double murder suspect told police his victims were 'three or four foot' under his kitchen floor, court hears;Wednesday 1 February 2023 19:15, UK;[];[];"A murder suspect who is accused of burying a woman and her two-year-old daughter under his kitchen floor reportedly told police: ""It's gonna take you some time. They are about three or four foot down.""

Warning: This story contains graphic content and details of alleged sexual abuse

Andrew Innes, 52, denies murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her daughter Jellica and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh on Wednesday, Police Scotland Sergeant Beverley Symon, 49, said she was called to Innes' house in Dundee on 5 March 2021.

It was there Innes reportedly admitted that Ms Burke was ""under the floor"".

When asked where Jellica was, Innes allegedly replied: ""She is with her mum.""

Sergeant Symon then claimed that Innes added: ""It's gonna take you some time. They are about three or four foot down.""

Detective Constable Paul Hardie, 43, later interviewed Innes at a Dundee police station.

While there he reportedly admitted that Ms Burke, from Bristol, had travelled north of the border so they could spend the weekend together but then he found out that she was talking to ""50 other men"".

Innes allegedly said: ""There was a fight and she came at me. I fought back and now she's dead. There was no premeditation. She came at me with a sushi knife.""

He claimed it took him ""a while"" to get through the concrete.

When asked where Jellica was, he reportedly replied: ""Under the floor with the mum. I could not look after a child. The child was screaming.""

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Innes denies further charges of abducting and raping a primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

The court was closed to the public while video evidence recorded with the alleged rape victim was played to the jury.

The child described sexual acts they reportedly had been told to carry out by Innes and claimed they were paid money after each alleged assault.

The child added that they last saw Jellica during a game of hide and seek with Innes.

The child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Innes ""pretended"" that Jellica was hiding but had ""killed"" her.

The child believed the alleged killing happened in the bathroom as Innes shut them out of the room.

All of the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes' house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/andrew-innes-double-murder-suspect-told-police-his-victims-were-three-or-four-foot-under-his-kitchen-floor-court-hears-12800854;Category-7: health

Facebook parent Meta reveals 55% drop in profits as mass layoffs help hurt bottom line;Wednesday 1 February 2023 21:34, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Facebook's parent firm recorded a 55% drop in profits during the final quarter of 2022 - the result of a $4.2bn restructuring charge that included the cost of thousands of job cuts.

Meta Platforms, which also includes WhatsApp and Instagram in its stable, said its net income profit measure slumped to $4.65bn between October and December.

That was down from a figure above $10bn during the same period in 2021.

However, its quarterly revenue, ad revenue and Facebook's daily active user measures all beat market expectations.

Users of its platforms, taken together, were 4% up with Facebook's alone hitting two billion.

Shares, down by around 60% from their September 2021 peak at the market close, were up by over 12% in after-hours trading.

That was explained, analysts suggested, by Meta's forecasts for first quarter revenue.

They came in above Wall Street estimates, signalling a rebound in demand for digital ads after months of weak sales.

Firms in the tech space suffered a rout in their market value last year as consumer and business spending became strained by high inflation and the wider economic slowdown.

Meta, along with rivals, moved to bolster profitability through aggressive cost-cutting.

It revealed 11,000 job cuts in November after coming under pressure from investors following two consecutive quarters of falling revenue.

Those costs were booked in the final quarter of 2022 and culminated in the slump in profits.

Meta said on Thursday it expected a further $1bn charge related to its ""efficiency"" programme over the course of 2023.

Greater competition from the likes of TikTok has also eaten into its space.

But Meta founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg stuck to his guns on one big bet - pledging to maintain investment in its virtual and augmented reality division Reality Labs despite shareholder unease over the prospects for metaverse applications.

The results statement revealed an operating loss of more than $4bn for Reality Labs over the three months to December alone. It took the figure for 2022 as a whole above $13.7bn.

Zuckerberg said of the performance: ""Our community continues to grow and I'm pleased with the strong engagement across our apps.

""Facebook just reached the milestone of 2 billion daily actives.

""The progress we're making on our AI discovery engine and Reels are major drivers of this.

""Beyond this, our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201230340/http://news.sky.com/story/facebook-parent-meta-reveals-55-drop-in-profits-as-mass-layoffs-hit-bottom-line-12800851;Category-2: business and economy
