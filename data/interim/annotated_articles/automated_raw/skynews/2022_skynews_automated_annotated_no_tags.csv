New Year Honours: 'Captain' Tobias Weller, 11, celebrates becoming youngest recipient;Friday 31 December 2021 22:33, UK;[];[];"An 11-year-old boy has become the youngest honours recipient on record after completing a series of fundraising challenges during the pandemic.

Tobias Weller is joined by Max Woosey, 12, who has become the second youngest person known to have been honoured.

Both boys have received the British Empire Medal (BEM) for charity fundraising work.

Tobias, who has cerebral palsy and autism, was nicknamed ""Captain"" after he was inspired by his hero Captain Sir Tom Moore to start raising money during the coronavirus lockdowns.

He said he was ""chuffed to bits"" to have been recognised by the Queen after raising £157,000 for the special educational needs Paces School, where he is a student, and The Children's Hospital Charity, in his home town of Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Tobias, who raised the money by completing sponsored walks and marathons, said he now cannot wait for a chance to meet the Queen at a royal garden party.

His most recent challenge involved an Ironman challenge, completed over the course of a year, involving 180km (111 miles) on his trike, a 4km (2.5 miles) swim and running the length of a full marathon.

Tobias was told about the honour just a month after his 11th birthday.

He told Sky News correspondent Charlotte Lomas: ""It feels absolutely amazing to be honoured by the Queen. My mum told me about the award on Christmas Day and I thought, 'wow! I am so excited'.

""It makes me feel magnificent. I love raising money for charity and knowing I have helped other children is a lovely feeling. I am so proud and privileged.""

Max, from Devon, has raised more than £570,000 for North Devon Hospice by spending every night in a tent since 28 March 2020.

He was inspired to help the hospice after staff cared for a close family friend, 74-year-old Rick Abbott, in the last days of his life.

Before he died, Mr Abbott, a keen camper and outdoor sports enthusiast, gave Max his tent, telling him: ""Promise me you'll have your own adventures in it.""

Tennis champion Emma Raducanu, who won the US Open aged 18 in September, joins Max and Tobias as one of the younger names on the list.

There is no official list of those honoured by age, but very few children have received honours since the modern system began.

Paralympic swimming sensation Ellie Simmonds hit the headlines in 2009 when she was made an MBE at the age of 14 and she remains the youngest recipient of that honour.

Higher up the honours ladder, no one under 18 has ever become a knight or dame.

The youngest person in modern times to achieve this honour is solo yachting hero Ellen MacArthur, who was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005, at the age of 28.

Knighthoods, CBEs, OBEs and MBEs: 11 people who have said no over the years;Friday 31 December 2021 22:35, UK;[];[];"For some, it's the icing on the cake, the pinnacle of their career, and a chance to be patriotic.

But every year, some celebrities and public figures turn down their New Year and birthday honours from the Queen, choosing to avoid the pomp and ceremony of a royal mention.

We've taken a look at some of those who've said no...

David Bowie

Image: David Bowie twice turned down an honour

The singer turned down an honour twice, once for a CBE in 2000 and again in 2003 when he was to be awarded a knighthood.

He told The Sun: ""I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that.

""I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for. It's not my place to make a judgement on Jagger, it's his decision. But it's just not for me.""

Bowie declined to discuss whether or not he was anti-monarchy, as he was living in the US at the time. He died there in 2016.

Danny Boyle

The filmmaker said he turned down a knighthood after working as creative director of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.

He told the Radio Times: ""It's just not me. I also thought it was wrong, actually.""

He added: ""I don't know whether I'll ever get invited back to the palace.""

Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders

The comedy duo refused OBEs in 2001, with Saunders saying: ""If I felt I deserved a damehood I'd accept it.

""At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn't seem right somehow.

""We didn't deserve a pat on the back. It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.""

John Cleese

The Monty Python actor has turned down a number of offers, including one of a peerage by the late Paddy Ashdown.

He first said no to a CBE in 1996, calling them ""silly"", and three years later told Mr Ashdown that staying in England during the winter was ""too much of a price to pay"" to sit in the Lords.

He told The Sunday Telegraph it had been offered ""not because I was such a wonderful human being, and because I'd helped them [Lib Dems] a lot"".

LS Lowry

The painter is believed to hold the record for the most refusals. He is said to have turned down five awards, including a knighthood, CBE and OBE.

He did accept an honorary masters of arts degree and a doctor of letters from the University of Manchester and was given freedom of the city of Salford.

His close friend Harold Riley later revealed that Lowry was a private and guarded person who would not have wanted to change his name, which contributed to his decision not to accept the honours.

Nigella Lawson

The food writer and TV cook turned down the offer of an OBE in 2001. She said: ""I'm not saving lives and I'm not doing anything other than something I absolutely love.""

George the Poet

Image: George the Poet turned down an MBE

The 28-year-old, real name George Mpanga, revealed in 2019 he turned down an MBE because of the ""pure evil"" of the British Empire.

He said while he ""deeply appreciated"" the gesture, he did not want to accept the honour because of ""the colonial trauma inflicted on the children of Africa"".

Mpanga, who was born in London but is of Ugandan heritage, added that the empire had committed ""rape"" against his homeland and that its conduct in the country was ""pure evil"".

Benjamin Zephaniah

Image: Poet Benjamin Zephaniah turned down an OBE

The poet turned down an OBE in 2003, writing: ""Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.""

He launched a scathing attack on the offer, saying he had begged Tony Blair to meet him to discuss crime in Britain and telling the Queen to stop ""going on about the empire"".

Ken Loach

Image: Ken Loach turned down an OBE

The director turned down an OBE in 1977.

He said: ""It's all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest.

""I turned down the OBE because it's not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who've got it.""

Howard Gayle

Liverpool's first black footballer turned down an MBE in 2016.

He was nominated for his work with Show Racism A Red Card, but turned it down because ""my ancestors would be turning in their graves after how empire and colonialism had enslaved them"".

And one who sent it back...

John Lennon

The Beatle accepted his MBE but returned it in 1969 in protest at Britain's foreign policy.

He wrote a letter which read: ""Your Majesty, I am returning this in protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts.

Boy becomes 30th teenage homicide victim in London this year - a new record;Friday 31 December 2021 16:43, UK;[];[];"A 16-year-old boy has died after being stabbed in Hillingdon, west London.

The killing is the 30th teenage homicide in the capital this year - a new record.

Police were called to Philpotts Farm Open Space in Yiewsley at 7.30pm on Thursday, where the boy was found suffering from a stab wound.

He was pronounced dead at the scene at 8.25pm.

Detectives say his next of kin have been informed. Formal identification has yet to take place and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course.

The stabbing occurred less than an hour after another in the south of the capital, which claimed the life of a 15-year-old boy.

Police were called to Ashburton Park, Croydon, shortly after 7pm and gave first aid to the boy before the ambulance service arrived. The teenager was pronounced dead at 7.36pm.

A boy, aged 15, has been arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to the Croydon attack.

The Metropolitan Police said it was too early to say whether the two killings, more than 20 miles apart, were linked.

Met Police Commander Alex Murray said: ""I am deeply saddened by every single homicide this year, and greatly concerned by those that have been teenage killings. Each one is a tragedy leaving behind heartbroken families and distressed communities.

""My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted. They are not statistics, not just numbers, they all have families, and they all should have had their lives ahead of them.

""They and their families have been robbed of something precious and we should all be doing everything we can to stop this,"" he said.

He added that the police were devoting ""huge resources"" to preventing homicides and said the Met was not ""complacent"" about knife crime.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Commander Murray insisted that tackling violence and youth violence is the Met Police's ""number one priority in London.""

He said the force has hundreds of police officers working in schools ""all trying really hard to tackle violence at its causes"".

Image: Police at the scene in Ashburton Park a teenage boy was killed on Thursday

He said there has been significant reductions in violence, knife crime and gun crime in recent years - but not for teenagers.

""With teenagers, we have seen an increase in homicides,"" he said.

""My message today, other than speaking to the families and friends of those that London has lost, is to say you cannot carry knives in London.

""This is what happens when knives are carried and we all have a role in relation to tackling knife crime.""

Image: Teenage homicides in London. Graphic: Met Police

Commander Murray also urged people to contact independent Crimestoppers to report individuals carrying knives.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the deaths of two teenage boys in London were ""devastating"" as she called for further action from the government to tackle the knife crime epidemic.

She said the country needs ""neighbourhood police back on the beat, stronger laws on the criminal exploitation that draws children and young people into drug and knife crime, and support for the youth services and early intervention work that keep young people safe"".

Community activist Anthony King told reporters that the community needs to ""partner with the Met Police and work hard and tirelessly to eradicate the issue of knife crime"" and urged all parents to search their children and their bags for knives.

He said children carry knives ""as a way to protect themselves"" and believes the pandemic has had an effect on young people with more broken homes and more children suffering from mental health issues due to the lockdowns.

Colorado wildfires: Hundreds of homes destroyed and tens of thousands evacuated;Friday 31 December 2021 10:46, UK;[];[];"Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and tens of thousands of residents evacuated as wildfires spread across part of the US state of Colorado.

At least one first responder and six others were injured after the flames took hold following an extremely dry autumn in the region and a winter that has so far not seen any snow.

More injuries and also deaths could be possible due to the intensity of the fires, Boulder County sheriff Joe Pelle acknowledged.

He said it was ""the kind of fire we can't fight head on"" and that in some areas, sheriffs and firefighters had to pull out ""because they just got overrun"".

The blaze, reported just after 11am on Thursday, local time, had ""ballooned and spread rapidly east"" to span 2.5 square miles, he added.

Some fires in the area were also sparked by downed power lines.

Authorities ordered the evacuation of the cities of Louisville and Superior, which are around 20 miles north west of Denver and home to a combined 34,000 people.

Surrounding them are towns filled with shopping centres, parks and schools.

The fires, fuelled by winds of up to 105mph, have already burned an estimated 580 homes, a hotel and a shopping centre.

Cars jammed in queues as they tried to flee the area waited for up to 45 minutes to move about half a mile.

Meanwhile, wind gusts caused the blaze to jump and spread, resulting in small fires taking hold in places such as a patch of grass or a car park.

Skies turned black amid the blare of emergency sirens as smoke spread.

A large plume of smoke from the fire was visible in Denver.

Leah Angstman, who was on a bus returning home to Louisville from Denver airport that was forced to stop due to poor visibility, described how it was buffeted by heavy winds.

""The wind rocked the bus so hard that I thought the bus would tip,"" she said.

""The sky was dark, dark brown, and the dirt was blowing in swirls across the sidewalk like snakes.""

Colorado governor Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, which allows the state to access disaster emergency funds.

Mr Polis said flames were consuming football field-lengths of land in seconds, describing the fires as a ""force of nature"".

A historic drought and heatwaves have made wildfires harder to fight in the western United States.

Nine-tenths of Boulder County is in severe or extreme drought and has not seen substantial rainfall since mid-summer.

Keith Musselman, a snow hydrologist who lives in the region, said: ""With any snow on the ground, this absolutely would not have happened in the way that it did.""

He said a severe fire risk would be expected in September and October but a lack of any rain or snow this late in the season was highly unusual.

A forecast for up to a foot of snow to arrive in the next day could help relieve the situation, he said.

Extreme weather has also been taking hold in other parts of the US, with heavy snowfall disrupting road travel in the Pacific west from Washington state to California and intense thunderstorms across the south damaging homes and buildings in Alabama.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000713/http://news.sky.com/story/colorado-wildfires-hundreds-of-homes-destroyed-and-tens-of-thousands-evacuated-12506670;Category-3: environment
Nicolas Cage: 'Don't call me an actor, call me a thespian', says 'pretentious' Oscar-winner;Friday 31 December 2021 10:50, UK;[];[];"Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage has revealed he does not like being called an ""actor"" and would prefer to be known as a ""thespian"" - despite admitting it risks him ""sounding like a pretentious a-hole"".

The 57-year-old, who was born Nicolas Cappola, compared his craft to ""shamanism"" by going into ""flights of imagination"".

""I really don't like the word actor because for me it always implies, 'Oh, he's a great actor, therefore he's a great liar, and (great at) lying,'"" Cage told Variety Awards Circuit Podcast.

""So with the risk of sounding like a pretentious a-hole, I like the word thespian because thespian means you're going into your heart.

""Or you're going into your imagination, or your memories or your dreams, and you're bringing something back to communicate with the audience.

""I think it's more like recruiting imagination. Dare I say it, it's more like a shamanism.

Cage, who won an Oscar for 1996 film Leaving Las Vegas, also addressed accusations of him being ""over the top"" with his performances.

""When they say that to me I say 'well you tell me where the top is and I'll tell you whether or not I'm over it,"" the Face Off and National Treasure star said.

He also recalled his first acting experience on the school bus when he was young, while he and a friend were being bullied.

""One day I said, 'I'm gonna have to have some attitude' and I put on some cowboy boots and a leather jacket and I started chewing gum,"" said Cage, whose 2021 film Pig was acclaimed by critics.

""I said, 'I'm not Nicky Coppola, I'm Roy Richardson and if you don't leave my friends alone I'm gonna kick your ass'.

COVID-19: 'Significant increases' in patients with coronavirus - as Northampton hospital suspends visitors;Friday 31 December 2021 15:22, UK;[];[];"The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 is increasing significantly, it has been warned, with another hospital suspending visitors ""due to health and safety concerns"".

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the council at the British Medical Association, told Sky News: ""What's concerning is that we are seeing significant increases in people in hospital.

""In fact, as of yesterday, the number of people admitted and also the number of patients in hospital is at a level as high as during the lockdown earlier this year in spring, in February-March.

""Now that is a significant number and it is increasing, so while the proportion of people who end up in hospital as a result of Omicron is smaller, we are definitely seeing significant increases.""

Dr Nagpaul said 25,000 patients were admitted with COVID-19 in the four-week period leading up to Christmas and he said those admissions have been preventing six million people on the NHS waiting list from being treated.

Asked whether those admissions were people taken to hospital because of coronavirus, or for other health reasons and ""happened to have COVID"", Dr Nagpaul replied: ""That's a very good question and, in fact, that's data I don't have and data it is really important is made available, because I absolutely agree, we need to differentiate between the two.""

Fresh NHS figures on hospitalisations in England are due to be published today.

Northampton General Hospital became the latest to suspend visitors on Friday, apart from in limited circumstances, amid concerns about rising COVID cases.

The health, wellbeing and safety of all our people, including patients and colleagues continues to be our top priority. We have therefore taken the difficult decision to suspend visiting at the hospital from today, Friday 31 December.



1 of 4 — Northampton General Hospital (@NGHnhstrust) December 31, 2021

In a series of Twitter posts, the hospital confirmed the move and apologised ""for having to take this step as we are fully aware of the impact suspending visiting has on our patients and those close to them"".

The hospital promised to put virtual visiting facilities in place.

Bath Royal United Hospital and Great Western Hospital in Swindon have also this week suspended visitors, apart from in exceptional circumstances, due to increasing coronavirus infections.

In total, more than a dozen hospitals across the country have temporarily banned visits in efforts to protect patients and staff.

There were also further signs of a squeeze on the NHS workforce due to COVID.

New figures from NHS England showed a total of 4,580 NHS staff at hospital trusts in London were absent for coronavirus reasons on Boxing Day, up 18% on the previous week (3,874) and nearly four times the number at the start of the month (1,174).

The number reached as high as 5,994 on 23 December. The total includes staff who were ill with coronavirus or who were having to self-isolate.

Across England as a whole, 24,632 NHS staff at hospital trusts were absent due to COVID reasons on 26 December, up 31% from 18,829 a week earlier and nearly double the number at the start of the month (12,508).

As the UK gears up for New Year's celebrations tonight - with parties allowed in England, but restrictions on gatherings in both Wales and Scotland - accessing lateral flow and PCR tests continues to be difficult.

A shortage of lateral flow tests means those wishing to mix with others at nightclubs, pubs and house parties face doing so without knowing if they are COVID positive.

Lateral flow tests are available to order on the government portal, but could take days to arrive and Health Secretary Sajid Javid yesterday warned that supplies may need to be ""constrained"" further because of demand.

PCR tests are available to book on the government's website, but results usually take around 24 hours.

Analysis by Ashish Joshi, health correspondent Staff absence is the single biggest challenge facing the NHS right now as it battles through the winter. These absences impact hospitals, ambulance services and all community health settings including mental health. It adds to the huge pressure the NHS is already under. The workload continues to increase with hospitalisations, emergency attendances and trying to tackle the growing waiting list for planned care. And all of this is before we factor in the most ambitious vaccination programme in the NHS’s history. There is better news with hospital patient discharge - more are being sent home when they are medically fit and bed occupancy is stable. But the next few weeks will be crucial in deciding the course of this stage of the pandemic. We are seeing record numbers of infections and these will translate into hospitalisations and deaths. The vaccine will help in keeping these numbers down but there will still be a rise. Plans are being put in place to cope with a surge, should it come, but beds need staff. That's why there are genuine concerns about tonight’s New Year's Eve celebrations and the potential for a new surge in infections.

Some in Scotland and Wales are planning to cross the border to England in order to avoid the stricter COVID rules in their countries as they celebrate New Year.

Mark Jones, the landlord at Stanton House Inn in Chirk, Wales, which is less than a mile from the English border, told Sky News that some of his regular customers have booked minibuses in order to celebrate in England.

And Margaret Straughan, landlady of the Brewers Arms in Berwick-upon-Tweed, 1.5 miles from the Scottish border in Northumberland, predicted a ""very busy"" evening with some of her customers coming from Scotland.

Ban on loyalty penalty for car and home insurance customers set to take effect;Friday 31 December 2021 11:30, UK;[];[];"New rules banning a loyalty penalty for car and home insurance customers take effect from 1 January.

The rules mean customers renewing their policy will have to be offered a price no higher than if they were a new customer.

They are designed to tackle the practice of ""price walking"", where firms offer below-cost deals to attract new customers but then ramp up the price on renewal each year.

Image: The rules apply to home insurance as well as car insurance

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which announced the changes earlier in 2021, believes they will save consumers £4.2bn over the next ten years.

But it is likely to mean that for people who do regularly shop around for a cheaper deal, the biggest discounts will no longer be available.

The new rules apply to renewal notices going out from 1 January.

If a consumer's renewal notice went out in December for a policy being renewed after 1 January, the rules do not apply.

The changes come after a study in 2018 found that customers who stuck with their existing insurance policies were paying £1.2bn a year too much.

Sheldon Mills, the FCA's executive director for consumers and competition, said: ""Our interventions will make the insurance market fairer and make it work better.

Image: The FCA expects the new rules to save consumers £4.2bn over ten years

""Insurers can no longer penalise consumers who stay with them.

""You can still shop around and negotiate a better deal, but you won't have to switch just to avoid being charged a loyalty premium.

""We are keeping a close eye on how insurers respond to our new rules, to ensure that the benefits of a better insurance market are delivered to consumers.""

The changes are part of a package of reforms taking effect which also include rules designed to make it easier for consumers to cancel automatic renewals and requirements for firms to show that their products deliver fair value for customers.

The Association of British Insurers (ABI), which represents the industry, said firms were still likely to be able to offer competitive deals to new customers but that prices could be higher for those who shop around regularly.

Spokesman Malcolm Tarling said there would be a ""re-balancing of premiums between new and existing customers"".

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has previously warned: ""In the short run this change could see a spike in price for switchers.""

The FCA said at the time that the rules were announced that it was ""likely that firms will no longer offer unsustainably low-priced deals to some customers"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000713/http://news.sky.com/story/ban-on-loyalty-penalty-for-car-and-home-insurance-customers-set-to-take-effect-12506719;Category-2: business and economy
COVID-positive woman self-isolates in plane loo for five hours to protect other passengers , and posts her ordeal on TikTok;Friday 31 December 2021 07:46, UK;[];[];"A woman who tested positive for COVID during a transatlantic flight self-isolated for five hours in the plane's toilet to protect other passengers.

Michigan schoolteacher Marisa Fotieo was travelling from Chicago to Reykjavik, Iceland on 20 December when her throat began to hurt.

She took a rapid COVID test she was carrying with her and within ""what felt like two seconds there were two lines"".

Ms Fotieo decided that to protect the other 150 passengers and crew on the Icelandair flight she would lock herself away in one of the toilets for the remainder of the journey.

And she captured her experience of confinement in the tiny loo in a TikTok video that has been viewed more than three million times.

""Shout out to @Icelandair for my VIP quarantine quarters,"" she wrote.

Speaking to NBC News' Steve Patterson, she described it as a ""crazy experience"".

She told him: ""I just took my rapid test and I brought it into the bathroom, and within what felt like two seconds there were two lines.""

""There's 150 people on the flight, and my biggest fear was giving it to them,"" she added.

She said the self-isolation was made bearable because of the care of flight attendant Ragnhildur ""Rocky"" Eiríksdóttir.

""She made sure I had everything I needed for the next five hours from food to drinks and constantly checked on me assuring me I would be all right,"" Marisa wrote in an email to NBC News.

2021: A year of some of the most extreme weather ever seen;;[];[];"Hurricane Ida left devastation in its wake as it passed across the United States at the start of September.

After it made landfall in Louisiana as a category 4, it worked its way up the Eastern Seaboard dumping huge amounts of rain on the way until it reached the coast again.

Anywhere between 12cm (5ins) and 38cm (15ins) of rain fell as the storm moved north from the Gulf of Mexico, leaving dozens dead.

By the time it reached New York and New Jersey, the National Weather Service declared it a ""PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION"", and ordered people to ""SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW"".

By the time it had passed over, rainfall records had been shattered all across the New York City area and its neighbouring conurbations, with several places seeing their highest single-hour rain totals ever, with more than 8cm (3.15ins) falling in the 60 minutes. Newark and LaGuardia, meanwhile, saw their wettest days on record.

October

The wet weather continued into October, when at the end of the month rainfall records were smashed all over California.

Downtown San Francisco, downtown Sacramento, Los Angeles International Airport and a number of hilly or mountainous areas saw unprecedented rain counts, with some areas receiving more than 26.4cm (10.4ins).

Experts said the storm that caused it - due to something called an atmospheric river - was worse than a 1-in-200 year event.

It came as North America experienced its second hottest October on record, which contributed to the Northern Hemisphere's land masses seeing their hottest October ever.

Atmospheric rivers continued to plague North America into November as the Canadian province of British Columbia was also hit, by a month's rain in two days.

The resulting floods and landslides cut road links to Vancouver, left several dead and sparked panic buying from fearful shoppers and concerns about the supply of Christmas trees, as the region is one of the major suppliers for Canada.

In the UK, Cumbria saw its wettest 27 October on record, with the county seeing its third wettest ever six-days - from 26-31 October. During that period, more than 400mm of rain fell on the wettest parts of the Lake District fells, something only previously recorded in 2009, and in 2015, when Storm Desmond resulted in the wettest six English days on record.

In 2021, although there was travel disruption and 40 homes were flooded, the county escaped the kind of flooding seen in earlier years because, the Met Office said, flood defences held.

November

In Australia, the area around Ayers Rock/Uluru saw its wettest November ever as more than 100mm of rain fell in Alice Springs. Large parts of Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were under a flood warning due to an ""explosion of rain"", with some towns seeing up to 46mm (1.8ins) of rain in 30 minutes, at the same time as other parts of the country were warned of the risk of wildfires, due to intense spring heat.

We are urging people across parts of #Qld, #NSW and #Vic to be prepared for severe weather over the next few days. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected with the potential for #flashflooding.

It resulted in one family becoming stuck on a remote outback campsite that turned into a quagmire, leaving them needing an emergency aid drop.

All in all, it was Australia's wettest November since records began in 1900.

The intense rain has led Australian meteorologists to state La Nina weather phenomenon is back for a second year in a row - something not uncommon but that has the potential to cause serious damage, as it did in 2010-12 when Cyclone Yasi hit. On the bright side, it means bushfires of the type seen in 2020 are less likely.

December

Records continued to be broken into December.

Honolulu airport saw a never-seen-before 201mm (7.92ins) of rain on the 6th and Patagonia had a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 37.3C (99.1F) in the northern Patagonian area of El Bolson, in the Andean foothills, on the 7th.

Then, acting perhaps as a portent of what was to come, exceptional unseasonably high temperatures across the US eastern seaboard hit the headlines in December.

As they did so, the movement of air across the States set off a chain reaction that resulted in a series of tornadoes that are among the worst ever seen in winter.

More than 100 were feared to have died across six states when a 250-mile long potentially record-setting twister barrelled across the Middle Mississippi region, tossing aside cars and trees, tearing through factories and knocking down long-standing brick landmarks.

It came the day before max temperature records for 11 December were set or equalled for 28 cities in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York State, North Carolina and several other states, including in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Washington DC, New York City and Philadelphia.

Scotland's ancient forests facing a 'biodiversity crisis' from non-native tree planting;Tuesday 28 December 2021 08:18, UK;['james matthews', '@jamesmatthewsky'];[];"Environmental campaigners have criticised the Scottish government's tree-planting policy as ""totally irresponsible"".

They say ancient woodland is being damaged by non-native species and that plans for large scale planting will make the problem worse.

They have been supported by the TV naturalist Chris Packham, who says that harming native trees risks aggravating a ""biodiversity crisis"".

In this Scottish forest trees are being cut down for the good of the planet

Scotland is the most wooded nation in the UK and its government plans to increase coverage from 19% to 21% of the country by 2032.

Most of the trees will be fast-growing, non-native species like Sitka Spruce, which are typical of US timber plantations.

Trees, including the imported species, help to combat climate change by soaking up harmful CO2 emissions. However, environmental campaigners question the type of trees being planted and their proximity to native woodland.

Audrey Baird from Rhu, Argyll and Bute, is among a group of campaigners who have lodged a petition with the Scottish parliament calling for the legal protection of native woodland.

She told Sky News: ""My big worry is that we're going to be covering our countryside with all of this monoculture, non-native forestry that's from North America mainly, and it just shouldn't be here in Scotland.

""They out-perform our ancient oak trees and other native trees, they just take over.

""The seeds get blown around on the wind, they get into our ancient and native woodland and they block out all of the light.

""They just kill everything. It is totally irresponsible and short-sighted.""

Image: Scottish forests are facing a 'biodiversity crisis', campaigners say

Broadcaster Chris Packham told Sky News the Scottish government's tree-planting strategy raises issues around biodiversity and the life of a forest.

He said: ""Ancient woodland doesn't necessarily mean old trees, it means trees being there for a long time - established, robust communities of plants and animals that will continue to flourish if we allow them to do so.

""It's not just about the trees, it's about all the fungi under the ground and the biodiversity that thrives because the trees are there.

""It's not just a climate crisis, we're in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, too. We lose all that life, we lose our life, so protecting these ancient woodlands is absolutely paramount.""

Scotland's 19% of forest and woodland coverage compares with 15% in Wales, 10% in England and 9% in Northern Ireland. The figures are beneath the average figure in European Union countries of 38%.

In response to the claims by environmentalists, the Scottish government questions the assertion that native woodland was being lost.

Image: Chris Packham says the Scottish government's tree-planting strategy raises issues around biodiversity and the life of a forest

A spokesperson for the government agency, Scottish forestry, told Sky News: ""Protecting ancient woodland is vital and there is work ongoing to do this.

""There is no evidence to suggest that ancient woodlands are being lost to non-native tree regeneration in the way described. The current, principal threat to our ancient woodlands is from selective browsing by deer, which tend to prefer broadleaves.

""To tackle the twin crises of climate change and nature loss we need to plant a balance of mixed woodlands. We need broadleaves to boost the environment and nature and we need conifers for climate change as they lock up carbon faster, provide jobs, and bring around £1 billion to Scotland's economy. We're planting 80% of all woodland in the UK according to this balance.

""Sitka spruce is just one of a range of species that are planted on woodland creation schemes in Scotland. We do not allow sites to be planted with only one species and proposals are approved to benefit a range of priorities, including people, nature and the economy.""

Stuart Goodall, chief executive of CONFOR (Confederation of Forest Industries), the membership organisation for forestry businesses, said: ""We're all concerned about ancient woodland, we all think it's incredible and very precious. At the same time, we need other types of forest to provide the wood products that we require for our everyday use.

""It will also help us de-carbonise, because if we're going to achieve net-zero, we need to be using wood more often. For example, to replace steel, concrete and brick in the construction sector.

""The important thing for ancient woodland is that they are managed. If there are trees which are being blown in, by actively managing them we take them out and we would absolutely support that, we want to see our ancient woodland protected.""

On biodiversity, he added: ""(On the basis of) the work that we've done to understand the biodiversity that exists in modern productive forestry, in terms of absolute numbers there's not a huge difference.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000713/http://news.sky.com/story/scotlands-ancient-forests-facing-a-biodiversity-crisis-from-non-native-tree-planting-12502002;Category-3: environment

London's New Year's Eve display lights up capital's skyline as UK ushers in 2022;Saturday 1 January 2022 01:02, UK;[];[];"A spectacular display in London has helped the UK usher in 2022, with people turning out to watch despite being encouraged to stay at home and enjoy the show on television.

Details of the location of the spectacle, which involved a light show, drones and fireworks, were not revealed in advance amid the continuing spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

The annual fireworks display on the banks of the River Thames, usually attended by up to 100,000 people, was cancelled by London Mayor Sadiq Khan earlier this year, with City Hall citing the ""uncertainty"" caused by the pandemic.

Speaking to Sky News ahead of the event, Mr Khan promised a ""live spectacular broadcast showing the defining moments of 2021 and showcasing some of the best things to come next year"".

Amid the backdrop of record daily case rates, leaders in all four nations of the UK urged people to celebrate cautiously and test themselves before heading out.

Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told Sky News that people should not meet in large groups and avoid risky behaviour.

Crowds were reported in Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square ahead of midnight, with fencing installed around the perimeter of the former tourist attraction to prevent crowds from gathering inside the landmark.

While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far held off on introducing further COVID restrictions on top of the current ""Plan B"" measures, the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have gone further.

Hogmanay celebrations were cancelled across Scotland, including in Edinburgh, with people urged to stay at home and limit how many people they met up with.

But despite this, around 1,000 people climbed to the top of Calton Hill to countdown the final seconds of 2021.

Violence is part of this London gang member's daily life - and now he's ready to talk about it;Thursday 23 December 2021 15:49, UK;[];[];"It's a cold, wintery day when I meet Mark and he's wearing a huge, blue puffa coat, with a furry hood.

He approaches where I'm sitting in the cafe in a stealthy manner, head down, eyes scanning the room, and takes a seat opposite.

I've deliberately picked a table that is close to the wall because I know he will want to sit with his back to it.

""Yo, Sar"" he says, smiling, as he sits down.

Mark is a gang 'older' meaning he has a level of seniority in a London gang.

He's 28 and has been 'on the streets' since he was fifteen.

But in Mark's terminology 'on the streets' doesn't mean homeless, it means that he is part of the criminal underworld that make money from the sale of crack, heroin, weed and any other 'hustle' he can spot.

Meaning violence - or a threat of it - is a part of his daily life. And it's this he's here to discuss.

I start off by asking him if he thinks life 'on road' is any different now than in 2008 when he was a fifteen year old 'new recruit'.

""It's 100% more violent"" is his emphatic response.

Image: The 28-year-old gang member says the level of violence on the UK's streets has increased

""As a kid now, you're jumping in the game, entry level, you need a knife. Kids are carrying weapons. Every single person on the streets right now - it's compulsory to walk around with a knife.""

And, he tells me, it's not just any knife.

""There's gotta be a connection between people dying and the weapons being used. People are using outrageous weapons to stab people. It's like Game Of Thrones. There's knives and they're that sharp… you wouldn't have to apply any pressure and you could cut a carrot - and everyone's got them.""

But he dismisses the boys that carry these types of knives as ""low-ranking criminals"" or ""soldiers"".

""Serious people are not running around the street with zombie knives. This is kids with local beef, local beef. I walk with a flicky [flick knife]. Let's be real - man needs a flicky.""

He says later, however, that he doesn't really want to carry a knife.

I've known Mark for 10 years now and we have a relationship built upon trust.

I learn about gang life from him and he learns about the TV news industry from me. I know there's no point in questioning him about the morality of carrying a knife, or pleading with him to stop.

I've done it a thousand times and he always gives me the same answer: ""A knife is your security.""

Young at risk from county lines exploitation if there's another lockdown, charity warns

He doesn't really like to discuss it with me because he knows I disapprove, but we both know my disapproval and my questioning of his behaviour is not going to change a thing.

He lost a friend to knife crime for the first time at the age of 15, and when I ask him ""how many friends have you lost since then?"" he pauses and starts to count on his fingers.

""Close friends? About four. Acquaintances? Double figures, I couldn't even count how many people that I personally know that have been stabbed and killed.

""People I've played football with. People I've gone youth club with. We're talking 13, 14 people. At least one person a year.""

He appears almost fatalistic about it. Not uncaring, but as if it's just a natural part of life. He describes attending his friend's funeral and thinking ""wow, you can really be gone"" and admits it made him more careful.

""It made me realise and be a bit more on point. I'm not going to go into an altercation without thinking that this person could have a weapon on him.""

He accepts that losing a friend at such a young age has a psychological impact, and says: ""It makes you more cold. When somebody close to you passes away, you almost feel like, well what else can be taken from me? You feel like you've got nothing to lose. And when someone has nothing to lose they become dangerous. What else is gonna frighten me? I've lost my friend.""

And as a result of this kind of traumatised thinking, another young man is likely to bleed to death on a street.

I've seen the videos Mark has on his phone. Footage of boys who have just been stabbed. They are writhing on cold pavements, calling for their mothers, with blood spurting out of them and terror on their faces.

Children and young teenagers who are being filmed as they die and then the footage is sent around on Snapchat. But their deaths, according to Mark, instead of being a deterrent, might only encourage more young men to pick up knives.

""That changes the game completely,"" he says.

""One killing can make 30, 40 people in that area start to carry knives, because that could have been them.""

Not only is social media being used to record the killings in 2021, Mark thinks that it's partly responsible for an increase in knife crime as well.

""People are getting killed because they are filming themselves walking down the road and their location is coming up. Someone sees it and says 'my man's on his own' which means man can get to him.""

But it's not just the ability to find someone quickly which is increasing the killings, Mark says, it's also the fact that people feel the need to respond to being humiliated on platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok.

""On the streets I can't tell you how many people have been robbed. Beaten up. Stabbed. This is what happens. The difference between now and then, back then, you had the option to leave it alone. You had the option to say, 'you know what, I got beaten up, but f*** it'.""

'There's no end to this because the police don't care and we don't care': Inside London's gang hotspot

He says when he was 15 ""violence would be quickly forgotten…but now the whole world will know about it, because they recorded you getting beaten up, 'we're not gonna let you forget about this, so every day you wake up we'll remind you that you got beaten up'. We (used to have) fights and lose. Nothing happened"".

He says that today everyone is watching.

""You're a victim to the whole world. You're not a victim within your community. You're not a victim between you and the perpetrator, you're a victim that actually everybody in the world, all up and down the country, can see"".

Even people like 'Ben from Shropshire' who he says, will be watching YouTube videos of gang ""beef"" in London and posting comments saying ""yeah it's because he slept with this person's girl"".

He points out that Ben from Shropshire ""hasn't got a f****** clue what's going on, but if you read that, it's embarrassing.""

""This causes a lot of violence on the streets,"" he continues.

""Human beings don't like embarrassment. Once they feel excluded because of embarrassment they will pretty do much anything to be let back in. And when you're living a certain type of life, or when you're portraying a certain type of life, the way back in might be more violence"".

He also believes that the COVID lockdown has inadvertently ramped up the violence in 2021.

""There's a lot of people that have problems but because of COVD they didn't run into each other,"" he says.

""A lot of stuff got locked off, school, college, football, parties. What happened in COVID is a lot of these guys went online and might be talking s*** at each other. We're arguing every day. But when we meet it's gonna come to a head. But they weren't out, they were locked down.""

Image: Gang members are often involved in dealing drugs

He says some of these arguments were brewing in prisons too, and explains: ""Most of these things start and continue in prison. Stuff can be settled in prison (but) a lot of things haven't been settled. The people that were beefing in 2019 are now settling it in 2021.""

Mark has his own ""war scars"" from knife attacks.

""It shows you been through the war. You've been in the trenches.""

He says he doesn't seek violence out and will avoid places which might be dangerous.

When I ask him if he would seek revenge for the death of a friend, he says: ""I wouldn't go out and look for someone who did that to my friend to try and stab them. But I would be prepared to know that if I met them that would be the level it could get to. So I'd go prepared…if this is the situation, it's the situation.""

A lot of the violence is disorganised, he says, with ""kids running around with zombie knives"".

""A mistake you make as a teenager could cost you your life in certain areas.""

He tells me about a ""younger"" he knows who went out armed with a machete looking for the boys who stole his scooter.

""Would he have stabbed him if he found him?"" I ask.

""100%"" Mark replies.

But where are all the knives coming from?

County lines gangs have changed tactics during COVID - and their victims are getting even younger

""They're getting them on the internet. And selling them on Snapchat. You make good money off it.""

He tells me that to get around a request for ID from websites that might make a knife traceable to the person using it, the gang members ask girls to purchase them online using their details.

""I can get a girl right now and get her to buy something. They might ask her for ID but she'll do it: and it doesn't come back to me... this is normal.""

When I ask if these boys are deliberately stabbing to kill he says, ""It's not good enough just to be prepared to stab someone, we're at a level where today people will laugh at you if you stab someone in the bum. You'd have to have an explanation for that.

""Because if you're telling me that this guy, who killed our friend, and you just stabbed him in the bum, you was better off not stabbing him. Because now I'm looking at you funny.

""You'd better stab him in the neck. That's what we rate on. Stab him in the chest or in the neck. People aren't gonna respect you if you're trying to stab them in the bum.""

When I express horror at this advice, his answer is, ""isn't that fair? I'm not saying that's the way to go about things. The reality is if someone hurts you, it's natural for you to want hurt them back.""

Mark says he has been stabbed more than once and always recovered fully. One of the lucky ones. And he knows it.

""For all of those deaths you talk about there will be another hundred with life-changing injuries... the truth of the matter is, you're probably gonna be f***** as an individual after that.

""Your life's not gonna be the same. For a long time. You know these people they've got to have bags? When they go toilet? I know maybe three or four people who've had bags.""

What he is talking about is colostomy bags that will have been fitted because a part of the anus or intestine will have been so damaged by a knife slashing through it that it just doesn't work any more.

""But you've gotta remember that being stabbed and surviving the stab can also be a positive. Someone's been stabbed a hundred times and they're still here to tell the story?""

He leaves the question hanging.

Image: West Midlands PCSO Rob Capella holds two examples of 'zombie knives'

And what about those who don't just stab someone, but kill them.

""If you're prepared to kill someone you're gonna carry a lot of weight… most people would say, 'if someone hurt my kids I'd kill them.'

""What if no one hurts your kids? What if someone stole your drink? Stood on your foot? Because these are all forms of disrespect on the street.""

He says the likelihood of boys talking to the police is almost zero because ""they don't trust the police, it's a stigma to deal with the police"" so instead ""they'll probably deal with it themselves"", which will mean more violence.

But he insists that it isn't just gang members who don't trust the police, but the majority of the black community.

""Remember when that white girl [Sarah Everard] got killed by the police officer? The country said 'oh my God, the police are corrupt.'

""We've been telling you the police are corrupt for 50 f****** years. Rest in peace, Sarah, don't get me wrong, rest in peace. But I'm not shocked that the police could do this.

""Not one f****** bit. How many police officers have killed people in a f****** police station? But people rather run with the narrative that it must be your fault. What did she [Everard] do wrong? But what did he do wrong?""

So why, I ask him, would anyone choose to enter this lifestyle, when, if you get to Mark's age in it, you will be unable to count the number of friends you've seen killed, because there's so many of them?

He tells me it's not always a simple choice about joining a gang. Some boys are affiliated without even choosing to be.

""What makes you gang-related in London, in certain areas, is you are in the science class with this guy. Of course you get on the 250 bus with him. It's the school bus. You're gang-related. He's in a gang. You're related to him. You've got an association. How can you grow up in an area that has a big gang influence without being gang-related?""

Image: Mark says humiliating videos on social media platforms are leading to an increase in violence

Other boys join in for a sense of ""belonging"".

""There's guys that go out and they don't feel loved by anyone. 100%. Especially in some of the communities we grow up in. Kids are having kids. Some people ain't got time to show empathy or love, because they're going through their own struggle as parents. Maybe their mum or dad is going through things.""

And then there's the money that gang life can bring.

""There is financial reward, but a lot of these kids are earning more than their parents, let's be real,"" he says.

Mark's story is slightly different - he did feel loved and ""accepted"" in his home and his mother, who was a single parent (Mark didn't know his dad) worked as a nurse and so they had a relatively stable income.

""I always came from a family of love and knew what was right and wrong,"" he says.

But then his mother died when he was 15 and, he says, it had ""the hugest effect on my life"".

""Because up until that point I had never done anything without the intention of impressing my mum. If I'm at school, the first thing I did when I came home and aced a test, [was say] 'mum I've aced a test'. Nothing else matters. If I win sports day, it's my mum I wanna tell. After my mum passed away it made me feel, 'well what's the point?' I had no purpose.

""I felt like I had no purpose. And so I went looking for a purpose. If I'd had a teacher who had said, 'I know what you're going through, let me help you' maybe that would have become my purpose.""

But nobody said to Mark ""I know what you're going through, let me help you"" and, after his grandmother died, he was left homeless by the age of 19.

He slept on night buses or on the floors and sofas of his friends, hustling for money by selling drugs.

Often I would try to assist him, by referring him to housing charities that looked as if they could help, but they would ask me: ""Is he an ex-offender?""

He wasn't, in the sense that he hadn't gone to prison then, but when I would tell them ""no, not yet"" their reply would be ""we're sorry we can't help him"".

The council told him there was no duty to house him as he wasn't deemed ""vulnerable"", and offered him a hostel which had rival gang members in it.

They gave him housing benefit, which was capped, so he couldn't afford a room in London and every landlord he tried to get a room with anywhere would tell him ""no DSS"" - a reference to the now defunct Department for Social Security, and the term widely used to describe tenants who receive housing benefits to pay their rent.

It was a terrible thing to see. An intelligent young man who had recently lost his mother, his grandmother and his home, struggling to find real help, and getting sucked deeper into the gang.

Watching it happen taught me how little support and help there is available for people like Mark, and I ask him if he felt anyone had ever given him any real help since his mother died.

He shrugs.

StoryCast '21: 'Planes falling out of the sky and nuclear reactors shutting down' - how the Y2K bug spread fear across the world;Thursday 30 December 2021 05:12, UK;[];[];"In the months leading up to the year 2000, excitement about the new millennium was mixed with fears about the impact of the dreaded ""Y2K bug"".

People were anxious the world was on the brink of catastrophe - with it feared planes might fall out of the sky, cardiac pacemakers would stop, and nuclear reactors could shut down.

Those were just a handful of the potential scenarios it was feared would play out after the clock struck midnight, as many people rushed to take money out of cash machines in case banking systems collapsed.

The Y2K bug problem was a simple one. Since the early 1950s, dates in computer data had been abbreviated.

The century was omitted to speed up processing, so January 1900 was written as 01/00 and December 1999 was 12/99.

This was a system that worked when all the dates were in the same century, but as a new millennium beckoned, governments around the world found themselves having to take urgent steps to prevent widespread computer failures.

Image: The Y2K bug sparked fears computer systems would collapse across the world

In Western Australia, the department of justice feared the bug could cause problems in maximum security prisons, with inmates potentially able to overrun the facilities or escape if the technology controlling the doors and gates failed.

Matthew Hackling, a security engineer who was hired to carry out the testing in the prisons, said: ""In an Australian prison there aren't really that many prison officers on the facility. They use technology to detect people breaking in and people breaking out. You wouldn't really want the doors of a secure facility to pop open after New Year's Eve.

""The worst case scenario for a maximum security prison was someone breaking in to break out prisoners, or prisoners organising a prison break.""

Matthew and his colleagues went through hundreds of systems in the prisons, identified the technology with problems, and then carried out the necessary upgrades so things would work smoothly in the year 2000.

Nowadays, many people feel the Y2K bug was a myth and never really presented a serious problem, but in January 2000 there were many computer failures across the world.

Some bank customers received bills for 100 years worth of interest and many credit card systems and cash machines failed.

Across the world, 15 nuclear reactors shut down, and in New York, a customer at a state video rental store was handed a bill for $91,250 (£68,013) - the cost of renting the film The General's Daughter for 100 years.

COVID-19: Christmas Day on a coronavirus ward at the Royal Preston Hospital;Sunday 26 December 2021 05:04, UK;['inzamam rashid', '@inzyrashid'];[];"Just because it's Christmas, doesn't mean life on a COVID ward is any easier. Like hospitals across the land, the Royal Preston is feeling the pressures of the pandemic, once again.

There wasn't the usual hustle and bustle at the entrance of the hospital, the car park was satisfyingly empty, but as you walk onto the respiratory ward, dominated with COVID-19 patients, the tempo completely switches.

Staff are constantly on the move, tending to very sick patients who are struggling to breathe because of the virus.

Image: NHS staff at the Royal Preston Hospital on Christmas Day

The ward itself had small but significant reminders that it was Christmas Day; a nurse sporting reindeer antlers, tubs of sweets on the sides and at lunchtime the waft of Christmas lunch making its way to occupied beds.

Professor Mohammed Munavvar led us through this ward just after his morning round. We met several members of staff who were working when they weren't supposed to be.

Nurses, doctors, cleaners and porters in the NHS are catching COVID and with the rapid spread of Omicron, this was a huge added pressure for Dr Munavvar.

""It's been a massive challenge for us in the last few days and even today we've had people who've tested positive and are now having to isolate,"" he said.

""We've had to pull staff away from their Christmas celebrations to help us in the last minute. But how long can we continue like this? It's the same number of colleagues we're calling upon.""

As we walk down the corridor, Dr Munavvar points out the red zone, where there are a number of suspected COVID patients, and the blue zone where the beds are occupied with people who've tested positive for the virus.

Looking through the windows into the bays, it's clear these people are very unwell and are struggling. But the doctor tells me they have one thing in common.

""In this COVID ward and in the critical care unit, people who are very seriously ill and in danger of dying are those who've not had their full dose of vaccination,"" he said.

""A large number of those have not had any vaccination at all. And those who have had the vaccines, have only mild illness.""

This was a clear message from Dr Munavvar, from someone who's worked on the frontline since the beginning of the pandemic.

""Working here, we understand the gravity of the situation and how things can go horribly wrong.

""That's why sometimes when I finish duties here on the COVID ward, I step out and I feel like I'm living in two different parallel universes because people are going about their business they don't seem to care or understand what's happening in here.

""They don't realise COVID is still around.""

Fans now allowed to stand at four 'early adopter' Premier League games;Saturday 1 January 2022 04:13, UK;['tom parmenter', '@tomskynews'];[];"After almost three decades fans will now be allowed to stand while watching Premier League games - a move designed to prevent another stadium disaster according to a top safety expert.

The New Year rule change means that clubs that have been approved as ""early adopters"" and have installed rail seating in some parts of their grounds can finally permit fans to use them.

COVID-19 may have thrown the festive football schedule into turmoil but Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are all ready to start allowing fans to stand in designated areas.

All seater stadiums became the norm in top-flight English football after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 in which 97 Liverpool fans were killed.

The Taylor report in 1994 concluded a failure of police control led to the disaster and recommended converting major stadiums to all seater arenas.

The ban on standing though has been consistently flouted by sections of fans at some clubs particularly during big games.

Ken Scott from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority told Sky News: ""What we can't have is another disaster happening and the risks arising from people persistently standing in seated areas that aren't designed for those people to stand is a real one.

""This (rail seating) is designed now to prevent the risk of what we call a progressive crowd collapse so it manages that risk but at the same time gives the fans the choice that they are expressing.

""It is really good that we have something in place now that hasn't been as a result of a disaster or a tragedy occurring.""

Some Hillsborough campaigners and relatives had been against the idea but Liverpool fan Gareth Roberts from The Anfield Wrap podcast said he believes attitudes have evolved given the way safe standing has worked in other European stadiums and at Celtic in Scotland.

He told Sky News: ""While I understand the sensitivities we need to move on now and accept that this is actually making grounds safer.

""The Spirit of Shankly (supporter group) has done surveys, families have even been up to Celtic and have seen how it's worked. I think some of the more hardened campaigners who were against it for so long they have had a change of mind now and they can see that it is safe.""

Celtic have had rail seating for the past five years in one section of Celtic Park and have a code of conduct for fans who stand in it.

It's something Mr Roberts has tried out himself and was hugely impressed by the atmosphere it created in the stadium. He said: ""Straight away I felt much safer…you are standing up but you have got your space - you can't fall backwards, you can't fall forwards there is no domino effect.""

""You are giving fans the choice and that's what fans have been asking for for years,"" he added.

Chief Constable Mark Roberts, who leads football policing in Britain, told Sky News he wasn't against the concept but said clubs have to make sure that fans stay in their designated spaces and don't congregate in dangerous numbers in particular areas.

He said that standing can also make policing at football more difficult. He said: ""We made recommendations that you shouldn't have standing areas home and away fans adjacent to each other because that is a flashpoint.""

""It is harder to identify people shouting abuse, racist abuse,"" he added.

""If people are stood up, it's harder to identify if they are throwing missiles, pyrotechnics and again it presents challenges for policing if you are going into potentially overcrowded areas to try and arrest someone in the middle of it.""

Over 12,000 safe standing spaces have been created at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium which is over a quarter of the total capacity of 41,000.

Most are at the famous Shed End which used to house thousands of fans on open terraces behind one of the goals and will now see home and away fans given the option to stand.

Cardiff City also have ""early adopter"" status in the Championship but the temporary ban on supporters at games in Wales, due to COVID19 cases, means they are facing a delay in implementing the project.

A club spokesperson told Sky News it was frustrating but added: ""We are hopeful of getting under way in our first home league fixture of 2022 - against Blackburn on January 15th.""

Kevin Miles of the Football Supporters Association said that it was now in the hands of the fans and the clubs as to whether safe standing is introduced to the other Premier League grounds: ""I think people have waited for so long for this to happen that nobody wants to do anything to jeopardise it continuing"" he said.

""Fans are probably the people most interested in safety in football grounds because we are the ones who suffer when it goes wrong so fans have a vested interest in making sure this works.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101070714/http://news.sky.com/story/fans-now-allowed-to-stand-at-four-early-adopter-premier-league-games-12502046;Category-4: sports

Archbishop Tutu 'lit up the world': Tributes paid at funeral for anti-apartheid hero;Saturday 1 January 2022 09:24, UK;[];[];"South Africa is saying farewell to Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the state funeral of the anti-apartheid hero.

Tutu, who died aged 90 on 26 December, helped spearhead the fight against white minority rule and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in recognition of his non-violent opposition to the regime.

His funeral service, taking place in St George's Cathedral in Cape Town, follows days of mourning in which hundreds paid their respects by singing and laying flowers.

In a video message at ceremony, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described how people globally had been inspired by Tutu.

Rev Welby said: ""Archbishop Tutu lit up the world... that light has lit up countries globally that were struggling with fear, conflict, persecution, oppression, where the marginalised suffered.

""He never ceased to shed light. His light was the light of Christ, and that is why his light will go on shining.""

He described Tutu and the former South African president Nelson Mandela as ""two giant figures that towered over the world"".

At the cathedral, the archbishop's daughter, Reverend Nontombi Naomi Tutu, said: ""Thank you daddy for the many ways you showed us love, for the many times you challenged us, for the many times you comforted us.""

Tutu, who was South Africa's first black archbishop, requested ""no lavish spending"" on his funeral and even ""asked that the coffin be the cheapest available"", his foundation said.

His body is expected to be aquamated after the funeral - a process which involves dissolving the remains in a solution that is considered to be a more environmentally friendly alternative to cremation.

Church bells have been rung every day in the archbishop's honour since his death and tributes and prayers have poured in from around the world.

Tutu's death came eight years after that of Mandela, who became president of the new ""rainbow nation"" in 1994 following his release from decades behind bars under the apartheid regime.

A pioneering career which began before the Second World War

White, who was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1922, started her entertainment career in radio in the late 1930s.

She made her TV debut singing on an experimental channel in Los Angeles in 1939.

After serving in the American Women's Voluntary Service, which helped the US effort during World War Two, she was a regular on Hollywood on Television, a daily five-hour live variety show, in 1949.

A few years later she became a pioneering woman in television by co-founding a production company and serving as a co-creator, producer and star of the 1950s sitcom Life With Elizabeth.

Through the 1960s and early 1970s White was seen regularly on television, hosting coverage of the annual Tournament of Rose Parade and appearing on game shows such as ""Match Game"" and ""Password"".

White reached a new level of success on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, playing the host of a home-making television show, the snide, lusty Sue Ann Nivens, whose credo was ""a woman who does a good job in the kitchen is sure to reap her rewards in other parts of the house"".

The actress won best-supporting actress Emmys for the role in 1975 and 1976.

She won another Emmy in 1986 for The Golden Girls, a sitcom about four older women living together in Miami that featured an age demographic rarely highlighted on American television.

White also was nominated for an Emmy six other times for her portrayal of the widowed Rose Nylund, a sweet, naive and ditzy Midwesterner, on the show, which ran from 1985 to 1992 and was one of the top-rated series of its time.

After a less successful sequel to The Golden Girls came a series of small movie parts, talk-show appearances and one-off television roles, including one that won her an Emmy for a guest appearance on The John Larroquette Show.

By 2009 she was becoming ubiquitous with more frequent television appearances and a role in the Sandra Bullock film The Proposal.

In 2010, she appeared as the slightly unhinged professor June Bauer in the popular US sitcom Community.

White also worked for animal causes.

She once turned down a role in the Hollywood movie As Good as It Gets because of a scene in which a dog was thrown in a garbage chute.

Paramedics attended the scene but she was pronounced dead just before 5.30pm and her family have been notified.

A 39-year-old man was held at the scene and was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving while under the influence of drugs.

He remained in police custody on New Year's Day morning.

India's prime minister Narendra Modi offered condolences in a message on Twitter, saying he was ""extremely saddened by the loss of lives"".

Initial reports suggested an altercation between a group of devotees had led to the crush.

One eyewitness, who gave the name Mahesh, said: ""Something happened near one of the gates and I found myself under a crush of people.

""I suffocated and fell but somehow managed to stand up.

Hangover cures: Feeling rough after New Year's Eve? These 'remedies' won't help;Saturday 1 January 2022 13:26, UK;[];[];"Those feeling the effects of the night before on New Year's Day will be disheartened after a new study revealed that so-called hangover cures showed no convincing signs of working.

Researchers from King's College London and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust assessed 21 placebo-controlled trials of 23 treatments thought to alleviate hangovers.

These included red ginseng, Korean pear juice and vitamin supplements, among others.

Only a few of the so-called cures appeared to improve hangover symptoms, which the NHS lists as headaches, sickness, dizziness and dehydration.

However, proponents of Dry January will be pleased by the study's finding that ""the surest way of preventing hangover symptoms is to abstain from alcohol or drink in moderation"".

Each trial examined the effects of a different type of so-called remedy on groups of drinkers who took part in ""alcohol challenges"" across the world.

In the trials, 386 participants aged between 18 and 65 from across the world were given alcohol followed by an ""intervention substance"".

The trials were limited in their reporting of the nature and timing of drinking, and there were also differences in alcohol type across the trials, and whether alcohol was given alongside food.

Of the total 21 trials, eight were conducted exclusively with male participants.

Whisky, vodka, wine and beer were among the drinks consumed by participants from countries including the UK, US, Australia, India and Finland.

Only seven of the 23 substances tested showed any signs of improving symptoms, but even this was deemed ""low-quality"" and unconvincing scientific evidence by the researchers.

These included Korean pear juice, red ginseng, Pyritinol, a vitamin supplement, HDE, L-cysteine/B and C vitamins, Tolfenamic acid and clove extract.

Clove extract, Tolfenamic acid and Pyritinol were the ""top three"" that showed the strongest evidence of working to combat a hangover, according to the scientists.

Twelve of the substances, including Rapid Recovery, prickly pear, Naproxen, Propanolol and artichoke were found to have had no effect on symptoms in comparison with the placebo.

The outcome of the tests on the remaining four substances, including Morning Fit and curcumin, were not reported.

The lead author, Dr Emmert Roberts, said: ""Hangover symptoms can cause significant distress and affect people's employment and academic performance.

""Given the continuing speculation in the media as to which hangover remedies work or not, the question around the effectiveness of substances that claim to treat or prevent a hangover appears to be one with considerable public interest.

""Our study has found that evidence on these hangover remedies is of very low quality and there is a need to provide more rigorous assessment.

""For now, the surest way of preventing hangover symptoms is to abstain from alcohol or drink in moderation.""

Image: Adults are recommended to not drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis

The NHS website states that dealing with a hangover and its painful symptoms involves rehydrating your body, for which the best time is before going to sleep after drinking,

Painkillers are advised for helping with headaches and muscle cramps, while sugary foods ""may help you feel less trembly"" although, in some cases, ""an antacid may be needed to settle your stomach first"".

The NHS also recommends bouillon soup (a thin, vegetable-based broth) as a means of replenishing depleted resources and for fragile stomachs.

""You can replace lost fluids by drinking bland liquids that are gentle on your digestive system, such as water, soda water and isotonic drinks,"" the NHS website adds.

However, drinking more alcohol - known as ""hair of the dog"" - is not said to help and may only delay the appearance of symptoms until the alcohol wears off.

Adults are recommended to not drink more than 14 units a week - six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine - on a regular basis.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101150719/http://news.sky.com/story/hangover-cures-feeling-rough-after-new-years-eve-these-remedies-wont-help-12507117;Category-7: health

Tycoon Hands plots £9bn sale of Ministry of Defence landlord Annington Homes;Saturday 1 January 2022 09:58, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Guy Hands, the billionaire financier, is plotting the sale of the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) biggest landlord in what could be one of Britain's biggest private equity deals of 2022.

Sky News has learnt that Mr Hands' Terra Firma Capital Partners has begun talks with investment banks about overseeing an auction of Annington Homes.

City sources said this weekend that any deal could value Annington at more than £9bn, including debts of more than £4bn.

At that level, it would result in one of the biggest paydays of Mr Hands' long career.

The Terra Firma founder is thought to own roughly a third of Annington's equity, meaning he could earn more than £1.5bn personally from a transaction.

Mr Hands has effectively turned Terra Firma - once one of Britain's biggest private equity investors - into a family office after years of controversy which resulted in him losing control of the music giant EMI and then Four Seasons Health Care, a major player in the UK care homes sector.

People close to Mr Hands said the Annington process was ""in preparation"" but cautioned that a timetable and outcome remained uncertain.

Nevertheless, when it does take place, it would be the largest deal that he has presided over for years, even as Terra Firma's stable of investments has been gradually dismantled.

Annington owns more than 40,000 homes, and describes its property portfolio as ""unique in the privately rented sector"".

More than 95% of the portfolio is leased to the MoD on a 200-year contract, and the company says it has helped more than 17,000 people purchase their own home, with many of them first-time buyers, service personnel and key workers.

An auction of the company was expected to take place in the next couple of years, but has been accelerated by a settlement reached between Annington and the MoD ten days before Christmas.

In a stock exchange announcement issued by Annington Funding plc, it said that a deal on the rent payable by the MoD on the Married Quarters Estate meant a further arbitration process would not be required.

The company said the MoD would ""continue to pay rent at the current prevailing downward adjustment of 58% from open market rental levels until the dates on which the new rents become payable, which fall between 2021 and 2024"".

""Upon these dates the MoD will pay rent with a downward adjustment of 49.6% from open market rental levels until the next Site Review.""

Annington added that the next Site Review due in 15 years' time would adhere to the same rent payment formula, meaning that the next full review would not kick off until 2051.

The long-term visibility over Annington's income is likely to appeal to infrastructure and pension funds, which could team up to bid for Annington.

Sources said the business could be sold as a single entity or broken into two separate chunks.

Terra Firma acquired Annington in 2012 from Nomura, the Japanese bank where Mr Hands previously worked on a series of pioneering deals, for a reported £3.2bn.

It was one of a string of property-related purchases that the tycoon has made, generating huge rewards for his family and, on many occasions, his external investors.

Despite his enormous wealth, he told The Daily Telegraph in a recent interview that he had found happiness an elusive commodity and said he had in part been driven by a need ""to be accepted"".

Although his efforts to raise a new buyout fund faltered in the wake of the EMI debacle, where he unsuccessfully tried to sue Citi, the bank advising on the deal, Mr Hands has returned to the acquisition trail.

Last year, he bought Kier Living, which he has rebranded as Tilia, and Sky News revealed in November that he was planning a £300m bid for Hopkins Homes, East Anglia's biggest private housebuilder.

Terra Firma and Annington both declined to comment this weekend.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220101150719/http://news.sky.com/story/tycoon-hands-plots-9bn-sale-of-ministry-of-defence-landlord-annington-homes-12507044;Category-2: business and economy

The teenager died at the scene of the attack in Ashburton Park after being stabbed in the heart, the Metropolitan Police said.

Officers were made aware of the assault shortly after 7pm and gave Zaian first aid before the London Ambulance Service arrived.

Despite their efforts, the boy was pronounced dead at around 7:36pm.

A 15-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail to a date in late January.

Police have said Zaian was from the local area in south London.

His family are being supported by specialist officers.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for any witnesses of the attack to come forward.

There are medal prospects in previously profitable events like curling and bobsleigh, but the big stories might come in winter sport's equivalents of BMX biking which brought success in the Tokyo Summer games.

So watch for the likes of snowboarders Charlotte Bankes and Katie Ormerod.

Extra hankies at the ready if Ormerod fulfils her dream: she fractured her heel on the eve of the opening ceremony in 2018.

World Cup

Tears of despair have been the norm for British teams at the World Cup for so long. Now, after Gareth Southgate's England finished their last three tournaments fourth, third and second, optimism abounds for Qatar.

Semi-finals again would be an achievement. Brazil and France feel the likeliest winners in the pre-Christmas desert heat.

Getting there at all would be a triumph for Wales or Scotland, who are on course to meet in the spring playoffs. Wales would be favourites; momentum might just carry Scotland through.

At the women's Euros in July, England look nailed on to progress on home soil from a group that includes Northern Ireland.

Image: Optimism for a good performance in Qatar will be high after England's run to the final of Euro 2020

Spain or Germany would probably be the quarter-final opponents. Win that, and we could start checking whether England's Dutch head coach Sarina Wiegman is eligible to be made a dame.

Domestically: take Arsenal to win the Women's Super League and Chelsea the FA Cup.

Coronavirus has its tentacles firmly around the Premier League. Fixtures will pile up. All the more reason to suspect the strength of Pep Guardiola's squad will take Manchester City to another title.

New German boss Ralf Rangnick can lead Manchester United to the FA Cup and Liverpool look a decent bet for the League Cup, allowing manager Jurgen Klopp to reveal his full dental magnificence.

In Scotland, Celtic's revival perhaps won't be enough to stop Rangers winning the Premiership again and quite possibly the Scottish Cup too.

Cricket T20 World Cup

The cricketing year will likely begin with extended Ashes misery in Australia, which is also the venue for the sport's highest profile event of 2022, the T20 World Cup.

Despite a slight fear that Eoin Morgan's England might have peaked, they may still go one better than their 2021 semi-final.

Take hosts Australia to retain their trophy, however - and to win the Women's World Cup in New Zealand in February.

Raducanu's return to Wimbledon

By then we'll have already seen Emma Raducanu's first attempt to add a second Grand Slam success to September's US Open fairytale.

It's not being churlish, or negative, merely realistic to suggest that winning any further Grand Slam in the next two years would be a significant achievement.

Image: Emma Raducanu was awarded an MBE after making history by winning the US Open

So would retaining her current ranking in the world's top 20, not to mention keeping her feet on the ground amid the inevitable Wimbledon hype come summer.

And that other quiet, unassuming British sporting champion?

Expect Tyson Fury to be punching (and very likely singing) his way to more success. Boxing politics make it harder to predict who will fight whom when, than to say Fury will carry on making money, friends, enemies and headlines.

Women's Rugby World Cup

Ranked number one in the world are England's women's rugby team, heading into October's World Cup. They could certainly win it, but don't be surprised if home advantage helps New Zealand to the trophy.

England should win the Women's Six Nations, despite a French challenge, while the men's version really is too tight to call. France are favourites but face stiff challenges. If you wanted a bet, Wales might be worth a punt at around 6-1.

The main hope for the Rugby League World Cup in this country is that it actually takes place, after falling victim to COVID in 2021.

Australia are worthy hot favourites, while England would do well to get past New Zealand.

Image: Tiger Woods could attempt to play at the 150th Open Championship at St Andrew's

For horse racing, just to get through the year without a major scandal would be something.

Rachel Blackmore cut through the gloom in 2021 as the first woman to ride a Grand National winner, and she may well be a big part of more Irish domination at the Cheltenham Festival in March.

There is talk of Tiger Roll going for an historic third National at Aintree. It would be a surprise if he does, and a bigger one if he turns up and wins again.

Talking of Tiger talk, as it were, golfer Woods has voiced his hopes of competing (or at least teeing off) at the 150th Open Championship at St Andrew's. With his car crash still less than a year behind him, that sounds decidedly optimistic.

Hamilton v Verstappen

Which brings us to another former world champion.

Can Lewis Hamilton wrest the Formula 1 championship back from Max Verstappen? Does he even want to try?

Image: Verstappen won the F1 world championship after beating Hamilton in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

We head into the New Year with no guarantee from Mercedes that their star driver has the appetite for it; and the momentum seems to be with Verstappen and Red Bull.

However, Hamilton is a true racer, a fighter. If he feels Mercedes have a car that gives him a chance of a record-breaking eighth title, I think he'll go for it. And get it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220102060732/http://news.sky.com/story/world-cups-winter-olympics-and-the-rise-of-raducanu-2022s-sporting-predictions-12501034;Category-4: sports
COVID-19: NHS leaders warn of intensifying 'health emergency' as coronavirus hospital admissions rise;Saturday 1 January 2022 22:20, UK;[];[];"The NHS faces intensifying strain over coming weeks as a ""health emergency"" created by pressures such as surging hospital admissions and staff absences build further, it has been warned.

Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations in the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, acknowledged the current Omicron-driven wave of COVID cases looked ""less bad"" than previous waves, with apparently milder symptoms.

But he suggested that if a doubling in hospital admissions seen over the last two or three weeks continues over coming weeks, the stress on the system would build further.

""We would then be a situation where it would be just very hard for the health service to do anything else than deal with coronavirus,"" Mr Taylor told Sky News.

Hospital admissions in England have risen to their highest level since January 2021, while the number of NHS hospital staff absent due to the virus nearly doubled in a month.

And in Wales, one hospital has told people to stay away from A&E.;

Swansea Bay NHS trust tweeted: ""A staff shortage worsened by COVID means we can only provide a limited service at Morriston ED over the bank holiday weekend. ED is for life-threatening illness or serious injury ONLY. Please use alternatives whenever possible.""

Government figures show there were 12,395 people in hospital with COVID in England on New Year's Eve - the highest number since 25 February last year, when there were 12,449 hospitalisations.

Another top health official, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson, told Sky News that the NHS was already ""beyond full stretch"" and warned that the knock-on effects of different generations mixing over Christmas could see it come under ""extreme pressure"".

Mr Hopson stressed that if hospital admissions reach a point where the NHS ""is not going to be able to treat the people who need to be treated then obviously the issue of further restrictions will need to come back on the agenda"".

The comments from the NHS leaders came after Health Secretary Sajid Javid said in a newspaper article that further restrictions triggered by the pandemic must be an ""absolute last resort"" and that the UK would have to ""live alongside"" the virus in 2022.

His remarks were published a day after figures showed rising infection numbers across the UK, with the rate of infection at one in 25 in England and one in 15 in London, in the week to 23 December.

Mr Taylor echoed Mr Javid by saying that ""in the medium term we should be very hopeful"" and that this year should reach a stage where COVID is no longer ""something which has to disrupt our day to day lives"".

But he added: ""That doesn't take away from the really acute challenges facing the health service now, challenges which are absolutely bound to continue for several weeks to come.""

Mr Taylor said the NHS was heading for its traditional mid-January peak while facing the added strain of waiting lists that have been building over the last couple of years as well as the latest coronavirus surge - causing higher admissions while also adding to staff absences.

Such pressures have created a situation where some hospital managers have been cancelling visiting, itself a last resort for the health service, he added.

""I don't think anyone is denying that we are in anything other than a health emergency right now,"" Mr Taylor said.

""We cope in difficult circumstances and we'll carry on doing that.

""But if these numbers continue to rise then every day that becomes more difficult to do.""

Mr Hopson said that the NHS was currently ""absolutely flat out"" with emergency cases, surgery that cannot be delayed any longer, and the vaccine booster programme.

He said that in London, which has borne the brunt of the Omicron wave, growth in COVID-19 hospital admissions had slowed over the last few days.

""But what we are very worried about is that if we see the effect of intergenerational mixing over Christmas you could see those rates go back up again - and if they go back up again the NHS really will come under extreme pressure,"" Mr Hopson added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220102060732/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-nhs-leaders-warn-of-intensifying-health-emergency-as-coronavirus-hospital-admissions-rise-12507204;Category-7: health

Bereavement leave campaign: Scottish MP urges UK government to change law to guarantee workers paid time off after death of a loved one;Monday 3 January 2022 12:14, UK;[];[];"A Scottish MP has proposed changes to employment law which would guarantee all workers two weeks of paid leave after losing a loved one.

SNP member Patricia Gibson said relying on an employer's goodwill to grant bereavement leave is ""unfair"" and ""clearly doesn't work"".

Currently, bosses are not legally required to pay for time off due to the death of a loved one unless it is a child but campaigners have called for this to be extended to cover the deaths of partners and other close relatives.

Nadia Popovici was in the stands behind the Vancouver Canuck's assistant equipment manager, Brian Hamilton, to watch their game against the Seattle Kraken back in October when she spotted the mole.

The hockey fan, who is preparing to study at medical school, alerted Mr Hamilton to the growth by writing a message on her phone and pressing it against the glass that separates supporters and team members.

As a result, he got a doctor to take a look at the mole, which was subsequently removed and found to be cancerous.

Who's who in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal;;[];[];"The Duke of York, third child of the Queen

Prince Andrew met Epstein in 1999, after his marriage to Sarah Ferguson broke up. He was drawn into the scandal after a picture emerged of him with one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), said to have been taken at Epstein's London address.

Further claims were made by a witness in one of Ms Giuffre's legal actions. Andrew has since said he saw Epstein once or twice a year and stayed ""in a number of his residences"", but cut ties with him in 2011 after a photo of the pair walking together attracted criticism.

The duke says in a statement: ""At no stage... did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction"". A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: ""The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.""

In August 2021, Ms Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in New York accusing Andrew of sexually assaulting her as a teenager on Epstein's private island Little St James, London and New York.

The civil action made under the Child Victims Act alleges Andrew knew she was underage and she did not give consent. In October, a Manhattan judge ordered that the royal must have been questioned under oath by 14 July 2022.

Scorpions, rats, playground equipment and lawnmowers: Why thousands of people needed hospital treatment last year;Monday 3 January 2022 08:17, UK;[];[];"Thousands of people needed hospital treatment after being injured doing popular lockdown activities, figures suggest.

As the country faced repeated restrictions, people turned their attention to DIY, new pets, and playing in the garden.

However, hospital admissions for England showed thousands ended up needing treatment as a result of their chosen activity.

DIY and playing outside

The data, from NHS Digital for 2020/21, showed more than 5,600 people were admitted to hospital after coming into contact with a powered hand tool and more than 2,700 were taken in after an accident with tools such as a hammer or a saw.

More than 5,300 people suffered injuries after falling from playground equipment, with dozens over the age of 30 and eight people over the age of 90.

A total of 962 people needed to be admitted after hurting themselves climbing a tree and 349 injured themselves with a lawnmower.

Animal-related injuries

Pets also seemed to be at the root of many injuries during lockdown, with 7,386 people going to hospital after being bitten or struck by a dog.

Rat bites caused 47 people to seek medical attention, along with 60 cases of people coming into contact with a venomous spider.

Four people needed help after coming into contact with a scorpion.

Meanwhile, a 90-year-old woman was admitted to hospital after being bitten or struck by a crocodile or alligator.

Cooking, sunburn, and lightning strikes

Across England, 2,243 people were admitted after coming into contact with hot drinks, food, fats, and cooking oils.

Although many headed out to enjoy the sunny weather during the first lockdown, 153 people were taken to hospital with sunburn.

Meanwhile, ""overexertion, strenuous or repetitive movements"" made up 12,355 admissions.

The number of people who needed help after being struck by lightning rose from three cases in 2019/20 to 18 in 2020/21.

There are some 'worrying trends'

Lloyds to take minority stake in banking loyalty app Bink;Monday 3 January 2022 13:46, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Britain's biggest high street bank is finalising plans to buy a stake in Bink, a fintech business which allows customers to ditch their plastic loyalty cards.

Sky News understands that Lloyds Banking Group is close to investing millions of pounds in return for a minority stake in Bink, which was set up in 2015.

Bink has signed up a number of retail partners, including Harvey Nichols, Iceland and the Japanese food chain Wasabi, since its launch.

It works by linking consumers' payment cards with the loyalty schemes of participating retailers, and struck its first major banking partnership with Barclays in 2019.

Barclays reportedly invested approximately £10m in Bink at the time, giving seven million UK retail banking customers access to the app.

It was unclear on Monday how much Lloyds planned to invest in the business, or at what valuation.

Their partnership is expected to launch in the first half of the year.

Bink is also thought to be raising additional capital from existing shareholders alongside the injection from Lloyds.

While modest in size, Lloyds' investment in Bink will underline the continuing boom in the British fintech sector, with billions of pounds raised by companies last year.

Bink is chaired by Bob Wigley, who also chairs UK Finance, the banking industry's most influential trade association.

Cold weather warning as temperatures set to plummet from record-breaking New Year highs;Monday 3 January 2022 15:58, UK;[];[];"The UK Health Security Agency is urging members of the public to check in on older neighbours ahead of freezing temperatures hitting parts of the country.

A cold weather alert has been put in place for most of northern England, with icy conditions and potentially heavy snow possible from midnight on Tuesday until lunchtime on Thursday.

There are also snow, ice and wind warnings in parts of northern Scotland.

It follows what Met Office chief meteorologist described as ""an exceptionally mild spell"" that saw the warmest New Year's Day in the UK since records began.

Agostinho Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine as UKHSA, warned: ""Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.

""It's important to check on those who are more vulnerable to cold weather, including older neighbours or relatives – especially those living alone or those who have serious illness.

""Remind them to heat their home to at least 18 Celsius (64.4 F) and to keep up to date with the forecast.""

Temperatures are forecast to drop to -1C in London on Wednesday night - with 0C in Belfast, 1C in Cardiff and -3C in Edinburgh.

The call to keep homes heated comes as energy bills continue to rocket, something which has been described as a ""nationwide crisis"" that has led several suppliers to collapse.

The Met Office said the drop in temperatures began in the north of England late on Monday and would spread further south later on Tuesday.

Mr Armstrong explained: ""This change is being brought on by a cold northerly flow, which brings with it the risk of some wintry showers in places in northern England, especially over high ground.""

""Minimum temperatures over the next few days are expected to drop below freezing, heightening the risk of some ice formation,"" he added.

UKHSA said that for people struggling to afford heating bills, Simple Energy Advice provides ""free advice on energy efficiency and national grants that are available to help keep you warm this winter"".

""If people can't heat all the rooms they use, it's important to heat the living room during the day and the bedroom just before going to sleep.

""Wearing a few thin layers is better at trapping heat than wearing one thick layer. Having plenty of hot food and drinks is also effective for keeping warm,"" it added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220103165812/https://news.sky.com/story/cold-weather-warning-as-temperatures-set-to-plummet-from-record-breaking-new-year-highs-12508332;Category-3: environment
COVID-19: Bins 'overflowing' with waste in parts of England due to coronavirus staff shortages;Monday 3 January 2022 20:09, UK;[];[];"Bins are ""overflowing"" with waste in parts of England as COVID-related staff shortages have resulted in ""terrible"" delays to collections, local politicians have warned.

Councillors in London, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Buckinghamshire say bin collection services have been scaled back as workers with the virus isolate.

Chelmsford City Council in Essex confirmed 23 members of staff were absent and it had cancelled three days' worth of food waste collections.

North Somerset Council said it had been unable to pick up 1,000 recycling bins on New Year's Eve as crews remain ""stretched due to staff sickness"".

Image: A recycling point in Ashford, Kent, was overflowing on Monday

Stephanos Ioannou, a Conservative councillor in Enfield, north London, said the number of complaints about missed bin collections was roughly double the average for this time of year.

He said: ""I've been driving round my ward and seeing bins overflowing and Christmas trees are left outside.

""Over the Christmas period, usually I get on average 30 emails a week on waste services.

""I checked my inbox yesterday... and had about 50 or 60.""

Gloucester has been hit with ""terrible problems"" as bin collectors work in close-knit teams and quickly pass the virus on to one another, Liberal Democrat councillor Declan Wilson said.

Mr Wilson said recycling collections were stopped altogether over Christmas, caused by a combination of COVID-related absences and driver shortages.

Several London boroughs have announced there may be future delays to services, with Haringey Council warning the ""uniquely challenging times"" had impacted its workforce.

Newham Council has temporarily suspended the collection of bulky waste items due to ""higher than normal levels of staff absence"".

And green food and garden recycling bin collections have been cancelled ""until further notice"" by Manchester City Council due to the number of staff in isolation.

Image: Several councils said bin collection services have been scaled back

Residents are being told to put food waste into ""grey general waste bins"" and store garden waste until normal collections resume.

Meanwhile Birmingham City Council apologised for missed collections over the festive period, saying crews had been affected by COVID in the week leading up to 30 December.

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, said crews have been badly impacted by the spread of the Omicron variant and called for workers be prioritised for COVID tests.

An LGA spokesman said: ""As cases of COVID-19 rise in light of the Omicron variant, councils are concerned that these existing staffing issues may get worse.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220103210745/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-bins-overflowing-with-waste-in-parts-of-england-due-to-coronavirus-staff-shortages-12508422;Category-3: environment
David Bowie back catalogue sells for 'hundreds of millions of dollars';Monday 3 January 2022 16:32, UK;[];[];"David Bowie's back catalogue has been sold to Warner Music Group in a deal reported to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The deal covers songs from the 26 studio albums released within the star's life as well as the posthumous album Toy, and two he made with the band Tin Machine.

It spans six decades of work and includes classics such as Heroes, Changes, Space Oddity, Let's Dance and Rebel Rebel.

Why are so many huge stars suddenly selling their music rights?

Image: Bowie was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century

David Bowie, born David Jones in 1947, became one of the most influential and revered musicians of the 20th century. He died with liver cancer on 10 January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday.

According to entertainment magazine Variety, the deal between Warner Music Group and the Bowie estate was worth more than $250m (£185m).

It follows the two parties announcing a global partnership last year that brought Bowie's vast catalogue - from 1968 to 2016 - under Warner's umbrella.

Bowie is the latest star whose entire catalogue has been snapped up for hundreds of millions.

Bob Dylan's entire back catalogue was acquired by Universal Music Group for a reported $300m (£223m) while artists including Bruce Springsteen and Tina Turner have also sold interests in their music.

Chief executive of Warner's publishing arm, Guy Moot, said: ""All of us... are immensely proud that the David Bowie estate has chosen us to be the caretakers of one of the most groundbreaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history.

""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever.

""Bowie's vision and creative genius drove him to push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture.

""His work spanned massive pop hits and experimental adventures that have inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media.

""We are looking forward to tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care as we strive to build on the legacy of this most extraordinary human being.""

Entertainment lawyer Allen Grubman, representing the Bowie estate, added: ""We are truly gratified that David Bowie's body of music will now be in the capable hands of Warner Chappell Music Publishing.

""We are sure they will cherish it and take care of it with the greatest level of dignity.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220103210745/https://news.sky.com/story/david-bowie-back-catalogue-sells-for-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-12508373;Category-5: entertainment and culture
Commuters facing reduced rail services as they return to work after break;Monday 3 January 2022 19:37, UK;[];[];"Commuters returning to the railways after the Christmas break face cancelled or reduced services on some routes thanks to staff shortages caused by a wave of Omicron cases.

Tuesday is the first day back for many employees as well as schools after the holidays - though office staff are still advised to work from home if they can.

Operators have been running condensed timetables to try to improve reliability in the face of about one in ten staff being absent across the industry.

Image: Rail services have been disrupted due to staff being off sick with COVID-19

But they have still been seeing an average of about one in 20 services cancelled over the last fortnight, according to the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents Britain's train companies.

Southern Railway, which runs routes through Sussex, Surrey, and parts of Kent and Hampshire said last week that it would be running no trains to or from London Victoria - normally one of the UK's busiest stations - until 10 January.

That also affects services to south London stops such as Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common and Battersea Park.

Elsewhere, Greater Anglia lists 68 cancellations for Tuesday including on services connecting London Liverpool Street with stations such as Southend Victoria, Ipswich and Colchester as well as the Cambridge-Ipswich and Norwich-Great Yarmouth lines.

South Western Railway - which plans to operate a reduced timetable from 17 January - has withdrawn services between Bristol Temple Meads and Salisbury and reduced services from London Waterloo towards stations such as Portsmouth Harbour, Basingstoke and Poole.

ScotRail said it will introduce a temporary week-day timetable from Tuesday until 28 January

Image: Office workers are still being advised to work from home if they can

More than 150 daily services will be cut, including on routes such as Glasgow to Edinburgh via Airdrie/Bathgate; Glasgow Central to Lanark; Edinburgh to North Berwick; and Edinburgh to Tweedbank.

Great Northern, Thameslink and Hull Trains have also unveiled reduced timetables.

CrossCountry has removed around 50 trains from its timetables between Mondays and Saturdays from 27 December until 8 January.

Latest RDG figures show staff absences running at 9.9% across the industry.

The average rate of cancellations over the last fortnight was 4.9%.

A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group said: ""We are working hard to provide the most reliable service possible and so that passengers can travel with confidence when fewer rail staff can work, a number of operators are introducing amended timetables.

""There are also some short-notice cancellations so our advice to anyone travelling is to check online before they set out.""

Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, a watchdog for transport users, said: ""What the train companies and Network Rail are doing at the moment is very sensible, they're actually reducing the number of trains they're trying to run and as long as that's temporary, that's okay because it means a more reliable timetable.

""Until rules change about isolation I think we're going to be looking at a patchy situation, over the next two to three weeks.

""So I think passengers need to be really vigilant and keep checking ahead, keep making sure your service is running.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220103210745/https://news.sky.com/story/commuters-facing-reduced-rail-services-as-they-return-to-work-after-break-12508409;Category-2: business and economy

New haircut and new tie, has the PM made a New Year's resolution to be less chaotic?;Monday 3 January 2022 19:56, UK;['jon craig', '@joncraig'];[];"After being ambushed by his Cabinet and suffering a rebellion by 100 Conservative MPs, the prime minister fears a further Tory mutiny.

New haircut and new tie, has the PM made a New Year's resolution to be less chaotic?

Boris Johnson was sporting a new haircut and tie. Can we expect his actions to be similarly tidy this year? Pic: Reuters

The first thing that was apparent as Boris Johnson made his first public appearance of 2022 was that he has a New Year haircut and was wearing a new tie that we haven’t seen before. Christmas present from Carrie?

More importantly, could the prime minister's neat new haircut - the untidy, dishevelled blond mop of pre-Christmas has gone - be a signal that he has made a New Year's resolution to be less chaotic and erratic in his approach to governing in the coming year than he was in 2021?

His message during his interview at a COVID-19 vaccination centre at the Stoke Mandeville Stadium, Aylesbury, was certainly uncharacteristically disciplined. During a six-minute interview he spoke of sticking to Plan B no fewer than six times.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:53 'Absolute folly' to say pandemic is over

He stressed the need to ""continue with Plan B"", ""use the Plan B measures"", ""make sure we follow Plan B"" and ended his interview by saying ""we have got to remain with Plan B"". The message could not have been clearer.

We know why, of course. After being ambushed by his Cabinet, who insisted ""Plan B and no further"" in the week before Christmas and suffering a rebellion by 100 Conservative MPs in a Commons vote on Plan B earlier in December, he doesn't want to risk a further Tory mutiny.

Even before the PM's interview, the government's position was already clear. At the weekend Health Secretary Sajid Javid said further restrictions should be ""a last resort"" and Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay and Health Minister Ed Argar both said the data didn't support new restrictions.

Ministers are hoping the data will confirm that Omicron numbers in London have peaked, patients who are admitted to hospital are spending less time there and fewer people are on ventilators, because - as the PM said - ""Omicron is much milder, considerably milder"" than previous variants and more people have had a booster jab.

So the prime minister intends to hold his nerve and tough it out - for now. But there is already a backlash from the medical community against what some NHS bosses, doctors and nursing staff regard as a reckless gamble by the PM.

Chris Hopson, head of NHS Providers, which represent trust bosses, claims rising numbers of hospital admissions, staff absences due to Covid and an already overstretched NHS are becoming ""unsustainable"".

And the Royal College of Nursing has written to Mr Javid demanding ""a more cautious approach for England without further delay"" and highlighting the different approach taken by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But these pleas will go unanswered in 10 Downing Street and the Department of Health until Wednesday at the earliest. That's when the Cabinet next meets and when Mr Javid will make a Commons statement announcing the outcome of the government's latest review of Covid restrictions in England.

But the prime minister has made it clear - no fewer than six times, for the avoidance of doubt - that whatever Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do he is determined to stick to Plan B and - barring an unforeseen crisis in the weeks ahead - avoid further Covid restrictions in England.

Who knows? If the PM maintains his new disciplined approach, he may even get his hair cut more regularly this year.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220103210745/https://news.sky.com/story/new-haircut-and-new-tie-has-the-pm-made-a-new-years-resolution-to-be-less-chaotic-12508517;Category-1: politics

Elizabeth Holmes: Former chief executive of blood-testing startup Theranos found guilty of fraud;Tuesday 4 January 2022 03:49, UK;[];[];"The founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, has been convicted of fraud.

The 37-year-old was found guilty of turning her company into a sophisticated sham that duped investors and patients into backing revolutionary finger-prick blood-testing technology that never actually worked.

A jury convicted her on two counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud after seven days of deliberation following a three-month trial.

Holmes faced 11 charges in total and was found not guilty of four felony charges, with the jury deadlocked on the remaining three.

Image: Holmes left the court and went to a nearby hotel after the trial

She now faces up to 20 years in prison for each count, although legal experts say she is unlikely to receive anything close to the maximum sentence.

From revolutionary technology to felony charges

The fallen Silicon Valley star founded Theranos when she was just 19 and by 2015 the company had been valued at $9bn.

Holmes set out to create a less painful, more convenient, and cheaper way to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems by taking just a few drops of blood with a finger prick instead of inserting a needle in a vein.

She aimed to set up ""mini-labs"" in Walgreens and Safeway stores across the US that would use a small Theranos device called the Edison to run faster, less intrusive blood tests.

Image: Former US president Bill Clinton speaks with Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, and Elizabeth Holmes

The concept - and the way Holmes presented it - enthralled wealthy investors and helped Theranos raise more than $900m from billionaires such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch and software magnate Larry Ellison.

But a month after the company's $9bn valuation, the Wall Street Journal published a front-page story that claimed the company's blood-testing technology was so flawed Theranos was actually using equipment made by other businesses to carry out tests in its laboratories.

In 2018, after an investigation by medical and financial regulators, criminal charges were filed against Holmes and Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani, her former boyfriend and the president and chief operating officer of Theranos, accusing them of fraud.

Image: Former Theranos president Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani

What happened in the trial?

During her trial, federal prosecutors presented evidence to depict Holmes as a charlatan obsessed with fame and fortune.

But she claimed she was emotionally and sexually abused by Mr Balwani and cast herself in court as a visionary trailblazer in male-dominated Silicon Valley.

Mr Balwani denies the allegations made against him.

Image: Holmes expressed no emotion when the verdicts were read out

Holmes also told the court that she initially believed her company's revolutionary blood tests were not the fake technology they ultimately proved to be.

The former entrepreneur remained seated and expressed no emotion as the verdicts were read out.

She did not respond to questions about the verdicts during a walk from the courthouse to a nearby hotel when she has stayed during jury deliberations.

She is to remain free on bond while awaiting sentencing, which will be determined by the judge at a later date.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220104070745/http://news.sky.com/story/elizabeth-holmes-former-chief-executive-of-blood-testing-startup-theranos-found-guilty-of-fraud-12508609;Category-2: business and economy
BlackBerry: End of an era as company pulls plug on iconic handsets;Tuesday 4 January 2022 10:07, UK;[];[];"BlackBerry phones - once the pinnacle of a mobile handset with their trademark physical keyboard - are effectively dead from today as the Canadian company behind them pulls its support.

As the company warned on its website, the iconic devices - which it has not made since 2016 - ""will no longer reliably function"" from 4 January, including for calls and texts.

The fall of the once ubiquitous boardroom device has been a long time coming. By 2013, as the mobile world changed with iOS and Android, BlackBerry was posting billion-dollar losses.

Image: The devices were popular due to their physical keyboards and security features

As recently as the beginning of 2013 a resurrection was touted for the company which even bought an advertising slot during the Super Bowl.

But BlackBerry shipped just 5.9 million phones in the second quarter of that year, far less than the nine million new iPhones Apple managed to sell in the first few days after its launch.

Another nail was hammered into BlackBerry's coffin when WhatsApp dropped its support for older phones in 2016.

In a blog post the company said: ""When we started WhatsApp in 2009, people's use of mobile devices looked very different from today.

""The Apple App Store was only a few months old. About 70% of smartphones sold at the time had operating systems offered by BlackBerry and Nokia.""

By then, BlackBerry had less than 1% market share and Apple and Samsung dominated worldwide phone sales.

The company itself had completed its transition to a security software business by 2016, which is when it stopped making its own smartphones.

However it decided to continue maintaining the software ""as an expression of thanks"" to loyal partners and customers who appreciated its physical keyboard as well as its security features.

Those features may emerge again, but the old phones are now fit for little better than recycling.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220104130745/http://news.sky.com/story/blackberry-end-of-an-era-as-company-pulls-plug-on-iconic-handsets-12508731;Category-6: science and technology

Travel stocks help FTSE rally on first day of new year trading;Tuesday 4 January 2022 11:32, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Travel stocks have helped London's stock market start the year on a high amid signs that the Omicron variant does not cause such serious illness as other incarnations of COVID-19.

The FTSE 100 climbed by as much as 100 points in early trading, hitting levels last seen in February 2020 before shares were hit by a steep slump as the pandemic advanced globally.

It followed a rally seen across other global indices which opened a day earlier this week, and builds on a 14.3% upturn over the course of 2021 - the FTSE's best annual performance since 2016

Image: The FTSE 100 enjoyed its best year since 2016 last year

By mid-morning, the index was up 95 points, or 1.3%, at 7480 while the second-string, more domestically focused FTSE 250 added 1.7%.

Leading the way on the FTSE 100 was British Airways and Aer Lingus owner International Airlines Group - up 10%.

Outside the UK top-flight, IAG's smaller rivals were also soaring: easyJet climbed 10%, Wizz Air rose 11%, Tui climbed 8% and Ryanair rose 9%.

Aviation engine maker Rolls-Royce rose by more than 3%.

Optimism has been fuelled by the hopes that restrictions on industries such as travel will not need to be tightened further - and that an economic outlook darkened by the arrival of Omicron at the end of 2021 may see improvement this year.

On Monday, prime minister Boris Johnson acknowledged pressures facing the NHS amid the spread of Omicron but said it was ""plainly milder"" than other variants and that while current rules would be kept under review the current plan B regime was ""the right one"".

Image: Cineworld has suffered a torrid time during the pandemic Pic: AP

Wider hopes for global demand have helped lift the oil price too with Brent crude climbing close to $80 a barrel over recent days, helping boost the likes of Shell and BP.

Some stocks in the hospitality and leisure sectors, which has remained open but hit by consumers staying away amid Omicron fears, were also winners as the markets reopened on Tuesday.

Premier Inn owner Whitbread added 3% while pub chain Fullers added 6% and the Restaurant Group, owner of Wagamama, rose by 2% - with similar rises seen for All Bar One owner Mitchells & Butlers and Young's, another pub operator.

Cineworld, which has suffered a torrid time during the pandemic, rose 5%.

Banks too were on the front foot, with NatWest, HSBC, Lloyds and Barclays all adding more than 3%.

Among the FTSE 100's biggest fallers were online grocery retailer Ocado - a company that proved a winner during lockdowns but lost 4% of its value on Tuesday.

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The FTSE 100 has set off on a sprint of New Year optimism.

""Stocks reliant on international travel are powering ahead.

""With yet more indications that Omicron, though highly infectious, does not cause such serious illness, a wave of relief is pushing up companies which have been hit by worries about tighter restrictions.

""There is clearly expectation that bookings will have got a rocket boost from hopes that this latest spike of infection will flatten relatively quickly.

Serbian cable-TV tycoon snaps up Southampton FC in £100m deal;Tuesday 4 January 2022 16:27, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"A Serbian-born cable television tycoon has become the latest entrant to the Premier League's eclectic roster of club-owners after striking a £100m deal to buy Southampton.

Sky News has learnt that Dragan Solak, founder of United Group, has invested a chunk of his fortune in a controlling stake in the Saints, who sit 14th in the table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.

Mr Solak is understood to be behind a new holding company which will examine offers for clubs in other international leagues, replicating a strategy employed by the owners of Manchester City.

Rasmus Ankersen, the former Brentford co-director of football, and Henrik Kraft, a London-based investor, are also involved in the Southampton takeover.

The deal will bring an end to the majority ownership of Gao Jisheng, a Chinese businessman who bought an 80% stake in the club in 2017.

Southampton has been seeking a new owner for months.

His move follows that of another premier league club, after Czech tycoon Daniel Kretinsky bought 27% of West Ham United for a reported £150m in November.

However, it is the first to have been approved by the Premier League since a government-commissioned report by the former sports minister, Tracey Crouch, called for more rigorous scrutiny of club takeovers.

Her inquiry was initiated after the furious reaction to six English clubs' decision to join a European Super League early last year.

It acquired additional impetus after the Premier League approved the takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.

The Magpies' acquisition by one of the world's wealthiest investors infuriated a number of Premier League clubs, triggering the resignation of the league's chairman, Gary Hoffman.

London Zoo: Arya the lioness and a sloth named Terry among new animals in annual stocktake;Tuesday 4 January 2022 16:13, UK;[];[];"A newborn tiger cub, an Asiatic lioness, and a baby sloth named Terry have joined over 400 species at London Zoo during its annual animal stocktake.

Zookeepers armed with clipboards and cameras began the week-long count on Tuesday morning as they worked to tally the animals at the famous Regent's Park attraction.

Dan Simmonds, head zookeeper, said it was a ""special"" but ""challenging"" task.

""It can be really tough when you have a little squirrel monkey bouncing around, and we've got 14 or 15 of them, but the keepers do an amazing job of identifying them,"" he said.

The stocktake occurs every January after New Year and is a condition of the zoo's licence.

Supercomputers could help prevent millions of deaths caused by antibiotic resistance;Tuesday 4 January 2022 15:23, UK;[];[];"Supercomputers could help prevent millions of deaths caused by antibiotic resistance, a study has found.

Each year, around 700,000 people worldwide die due to antibiotic resistant bacteria, with this number expected to increase to millions in the coming years.

Without effective antibiotics, human life expectancy is predicted to fall by 20 years.

Researchers at the University of Portsmouth are now using powerful supercomputers to redesign antibiotics before diseases mutate.

One of the drugs developed has been found to be 56 times more effective at killing the tested bacterial strains than erythromycin and clarithromycin - two antibiotics on the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential medicines.

In addition to the tested targets, it has also shown promise against the three top ranked bacteria from the WHO Priority List.

Dr Gerhard Koenig, a computational chemist who is leading the study, said: ""Antibiotics are the pillars of modern medicine and resistance is one of the biggest threats to human health.""

'Hidden pandemic': Experts warn of surge in antibiotic-resistance infections after COVID

He added that developing new antibiotics is usually ""extremely difficult"" because it involves finding a ""new target that is essential for the survival of a wide range of different bacteria"".

However, his team have found a ""simpler approach"" by starting from an existing antibiotic which is ineffective against resistant strains, and using technology to modify the drug so that it can kill strains.

With computers becoming faster every year, Dr Koenig is hopeful they will be able to ""turn the tide"".

""If computers can beat the world champion in chess, I don't see why they should not also be able to defeat bacteria,"" he said.

Dr Koenig says it is only a matter of time before bacteria become resistant to the new antibiotics again, which means scientists will have to continue to study bacterial resistance and develop derivatives accordingly.

His team's pioneering research will be published in the Journal PNSA.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220104184657/https://news.sky.com/story/supercomputers-could-help-prevent-millions-of-deaths-caused-by-antibiotic-resistance-12508796;Category-6: science and technology
John Sillett: Former Olympic showjumping coach sexually abused teenage girl over seven-year period, court told;Tuesday 4 January 2022 20:55, UK;[];[];"An ex-Olympic showjumping coach raped and sexually abused a teenage girl over a seven-year period, a court has heard.

John Sillett, who trained riders for the Rio Games in 2016, faces five counts of rape, five of assault by penetration and two of sexual assault.

The defendant, who was based at the Wellington Riding Centre on the Duke of Wellington's estate in Hook, Hampshire, denies the charges.

Warning: This article contains details of an alleged sexual assault of a child.

The alleged assaults started when the complainant was aged between 12 and 13, Winchester Crown Court was told.

Prosecutor Kerry Maylin said Sillett, 55, started by groping the girl before he raped and sexually assaulted her on several other occasions.

Ms Maylin said the girl confronted him after the first alleged assault.

The prosecutor said: ""His response to that little girl was 'I am sorry, do not tell anyone'. She didn't, and life moved on.""

In a video interview with the alleged victim shown in court, she said: ""I was so scared, I didn't want to move, I didn't know what to do.""

The prosecutor said that on another occasion, Sillett, of Farley Hill, Wokingham, in Berkshire, took off her dressing gown and touched her chest.

Ms Maylin said: ""He told her: 'You know what you want, you know you want this'.

""She said: 'No' and 'Why are you doing this to me?'

His remarks have been condemned by his political opponents who said the language used was ""unworthy"" of the presidential office.

Last year, France introduced a health pass that prevents people without a PCR test, or proof of vaccination, from entering restaurants, cafes and other venues.

The government now wants to turn into a vaccine passport, which means only the fully vaccinated will have access.

The 36-year-old partnered with Hollywood stars including Kristen Wiig, Will Ferrell, Natalie Portman and Jamie Dornan for the stunt - which saw the stars each sing a line from John Lennon's 1971 Imagine.

Gadot captioned the post: ""We are in this together, we will get through it together.""

Image: Gal Gadot, Natalie Portman and Zoe Kravitz all took part in the celebrity stunt

But the video - posted in March 2020, shortly before the UK went into lockdown for the first time - was branded tone deaf on social media, with people calling out the celebrities for saying ""we are all in this together"" from their upscale houses and large mansions.

Others criticised some of the wealthiest people in the world for singing the line ""imagine no possessions"" and it was seen as an empty gesture as millions faced losing their jobs, homes and loved ones in the face of the virus.

The Wonder Woman star told InStyle magazine with hindsight the video, which was viewed more than two million times on Instagram, was ""premature"".

She said: ""The pandemic was in Europe and Israel before it came (to the US) in the same way.

""I was seeing where everything was headed. But (the video) was premature. It wasn't the right timing, and it wasn't the right thing. It was in poor taste.

""All pure intentions, but sometimes you don't hit the bullseye.""

The Israeli actress said she had been in isolation for six days at the time, and the global crisis had left her feeling ""philosophical"".

Following the backlash, Gadot sought to play down the incident - breaking into a rendition of Imagine while accepting a prize at the Elle Women In Hollywood awards.

Elizabeth Holmes: The spectacular fall of the darling of Silicon Valley is a story that continues to intoxicate audiences;Wednesday 5 January 2022 04:17, UK;['greg milam', '@gregmilamsky'];[];"It will be months before Elizabeth Holmes learns her punishment after being convicted of fraud over the goings-on at her blood-testing startup Theranos.

The 38-year-old entrepreneur, once the darling of Silicon Valley, could face 20 years in prison for each of the four counts on which she was convicted. The sentence is likely to be much lighter.

But the inquest into what the case says about Silicon Valley and the way it does business - and whether they need to change - had begun even before her trial.

Image: Elizabeth Holmes, seen in 2019, faces up to 20 years in prison

The story of Theranos was a textbook tech fairy tale: a dropout from Stanford University with an idea that would change the world and investors pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in the hope they were backing the latest billion-dollar ""unicorn"".

But when the reality of the technology failed to match up with the promises, Holmes maintained a lie to those investors.

The collapse and its consequences were spectacular.

The reality of operating in Silicon Valley is that founders like Holmes have to raise money from investors to get their companies off the ground. To do that, they sell their vision of what the world could look like.

""There is almost endemic to the system a need to, I don't want to say exaggerate, but to tell a narrative that's compelling to investors,"" said Eric Jackson, a startup founder and author of The PayPal Wars.

""At a certain point hype does have to be in line with credibility, if not you're in an instance of good old-fashioned fraud.""

The jury decided that Holmes had ended up on the wrong side of the line and, analysts say, could prompt some investors to look more closely at the promises being made.

""What Theranos managed to do was raise a surprisingly large amount of money without really taking the lid off their technology. I don't think that will fly anymore even in Silicon Valley, where money is lying on the ground,"" said Shona Ghosh, senior tech editor at Business Insider.

Image: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and her family leave the federal court after a US jury found Holmes guilty

The Holmes story - once a feature of magazine covers, red carpets, and White House receptions - continues to intoxicate.

A new Hulu drama, with Amanda Seyfried playing Holmes, promises ""money, romance, tragedy, and deception"".

Whatever reassessment her fall forces on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, as billions pour into new ventures, analysts say it is unlikely to signal long-lasting change.

""The sense of bravado and hype and 'fake it til you make it' will continue,"" said Jackson. ""The pressure to do better due diligence will likely increase but I don't see it being a large cultural shift or even a major shift in business practices in Silicon Valley.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220105042942/https://news.sky.com/story/elizabeth-holmes-the-spectacular-fall-of-the-darling-of-silicon-valley-is-a-story-that-continues-to-intoxicate-audiences-12509252;Category-5: entertainment and culture

David Lean was 11 when he met the former Crewe Alexandra coach during a visit to the resort in Pwllheli, northwest Wales, in 1979.

Mr Lean, now 53, said Bennell ""worked his charm"" on him and his father and they exchanged addresses and became pen pals, returning for another trip later in the year.

Mr Lean said: ""While my sexual abuse never took place at Butlin's, they gave my abuser the gateway to groom both myself and my parents into later access of me when I was abused.""

Bennell is serving 34 years in prison after being found guilty in 2018 of a string of child sexual offences carried out between 1979 and 1991.

A civil case was brought on behalf of Mr Lean by law firm Slater and Gordon against Hard Rock Cafe (Edinburgh) Limited, formerly known as Butlin's Limited, which alleged the company was vicariously responsible for the abuse.

Mr Lean said: ""I have fought for many years to seek justice for what happened to me as a child by that monster.

""Lessons must be learnt to prevent the abuse of further generations; nobody should have the right to turn a blind eye and not face the consequences.""

The number-one ranked player has repeatedly refused to say whether he has been jabbed against COVID-19, and his participation in the Australian Open was in doubt owing to the country's strict vaccination requirements.

But in a social media post, Djokovic said: ""I've spent fantastic quality time with loved ones over break & today I'm heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let's go 2022!""

Happy New Year! Wishing you all health, love & joy in every moment & may you feel love & respect towards all beings on this wonderful planet.

The news has not gone down well in Australia, which has endured some of the lengthiest and strictest lockdowns in the world during the pandemic. The country's borders were only reopened in November - the first time in 20 months.

Sports journalist Andy Maher wrote on Twitter: ""Australians have been denied for two years, but this bloke - who's taken extraordinary liberties in the face of the coronavirus - gets his exemption.

""Novak Djokovic is an all-time great, but he ain't essential.""

Several Australians responded to Djokovic on Twitter, with one saying the exemption had gone down ""like a lead balloon"".

One added: ""A medical exemption? Very few people have medical reasons not to be vaccinated. Don't expect a good reception when you get here.""

Another said: ""This is insensitive to us locals, Novak. I've just had my third shot, after spending most of last year working & schooling from home, for myself, my fam & community. Victorians have done it tough. Maybe if you empathised, you'd have some support, but expect a hostile reception.""

The Victoria state government had mandated that all players, staff and fans attending the Open must be fully vaccinated unless there is a genuine reason for exemption.

British tennis player Jamie Murray said: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.""

Organisers issued a statement that confirmed Djokovic will be allowed to compete in the tournament, which starts on 17 January.

Image: The number-one ranked player has repeatedly refused to say whether he has been jabbed against COVID-19

""Djokovic applied for a medical exemption which was granted following a rigorous review process involving two separate independent panels of medical experts,"" the statement said.

Tennis Australia said the process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy for all applicants.

Djokovic is not obliged to make his exemption public.

Local authority-backed Together Energy latest to face collapse;Wednesday 5 January 2022 10:48, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"A local authority-backed energy supplier with 170,000 customers faces collapsing within weeks as a last-ditch search for new funding nears its end.

Sky News has learned that Together Energy, which is 50%-owned by Warrington Borough Council, is likely to run out of money later in January without an emergency capital injection.

A source close to a process run by advisers to Together Energy said that Alvarez & Marsal (A&M;), the professional services firm, was close to concluding its hunt for new funding for the business and that the prospect of a solvent deal was now remote.

Image: The supplier is 50% owned by Warrington borough council

A spokeswoman for the company insisted on Wednesday that it was ""still in active conversations"".

A rescue deal would be at odds with the industry trend, which has seen dozens of unhedged suppliers unable to withstand the pressures created by turbulent global energy markets.

If it does collapse, Together Energy would be the 26th energy supplier to cease trading since August, as spikes in wholesale prices have left businesses hamstrung by the industry price cap.

It would be placed into Ofgem's Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR) process, with other suppliers asked to bid to take on its customer base.

Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is due to hold further talks with energy sector executives amid appeals for the price cap to be scrapped, or for the industry to be granted help in the form of emergency tax reliefs.

To date, the biggest supplier to collapse during the current crisis was Bulb, which went bust in November.

It was placed into a special administration regime, with taxpayers funding the company's ongoing operations until a buyer can be found.

Together Energy, which has 350,000 accounts, insisted in November that it was ""looking to source strategic long-term funding for growth, not short-term [capital]"", although this account was rejected by multiple industry sources.

Its failure would raise further questions about the wisdom of local authorities investing in potentially volatile sectors such as energy and commercial property.

Warrington Borough Council initially invested £18m in Together Energy in September 2019, arguing that the partnership was ""an important part of the council's work to address the climate emergency, tackle fuel poverty and create new job opportunities for local people"".

Last year, the local authority boasted that the supplier's organic growth model projected that the company would have 850,000 customer accounts within three years.

One source said that Warrington Borough Council had informed Together Energy that it would not provide any additional funding to the company.

Two other council-backed suppliers have already lost their independence: Bristol Energy, which was sold to Together Energy in September 2020 for £14m, and Robin Hood Energy, which received millions of pounds in funding from Nottingham City Council, collapsed in 2019, with its customers transferred to British Gas.

Together Energy's public relations firm said on Wednesday that ""there's nothing more to add since before Christmas [and] the company is still in active conversations"".

The company says that 100% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, and that it is ""working towards offsetting 100% of our carbon gas by August 2023"".

It is thought to employ about 250 people.

How many have died from Omicron? Where has flu gone? Should I wipe my groceries? And should I go to the football? Your questions answered;;[];[];"Thomas Moore, science correspondent:

This doesn't constitute medical advice Jeff, but these are the things you need to weigh up.

First the booster is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Omicron. Or flip it round: if they get infected they run slightly more than a one in 10 risk of going to hospital.

There is no evidence yet that the protection from the booster against serious disease is waning, so that shouldn't be a problem.

Even if you are admitted to hospital you are likely to be less sick than if you had been infected with Delta back in the summer when you had only two doses of the vaccine.

Consider also the environment of the stadium. You'll be watching the games outside, which reduces the risk, though there is obviously a crowd and you'll have to go through more confined spaces to get to your seat. You can reduce your risk by wearing an FFP2 or FFP3 mask, which filters out almost all viruses in the air you breathe.

Against those risks you have to consider the benefits. There is a huge psychological boost to being at a game – particularly, in your case, with the Hammers having a great season.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220105110727/http://news.sky.com/story/ask-a-question-on-omicron-and-covid-to-expert-panel-now-12495443;Category-7: health
COVID: Pre-departure tests for travellers returning to the UK to be scrapped;Wednesday 5 January 2022 09:43, UK;[];[];"Pre-departure testing will no longer be required for travellers returning to the UK, the government is expected to announce later.

Sky News understands that the review of travel restrictions today will result in the removal of the restriction put in place a month ago to tackle the spread of the Omicron variant.

It comes after trade body Airlines UK and Manchester Airports Group called for the removal of all COVID testing restrictions, saying it would have no real impact on Omicron numbers in the UK.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:33 Javid: All countries to be removed from red list

Recent figures showed one in 25 people in England had COVID-19 just before Christmas.

Currently, fully vaccinated travellers into the UK must take a pre-departure test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a post-arrival test.

Those who are not fully vaccinated must self-isolate for 10 days after they arrive.

Last month, the government removed all 11 countries on its travel ""red list"", partly reversing the tightening of restrictions in order to contain the spread of Omicron from abroad.

Airlines UK said at the time that costly testing and isolation measures imposed on travellers ought to be removed too for the same reason and has now reiterated that plea.

The trade body and MAG - which operates Manchester, London Stanstead and East Midlands airports - cited research they had commissioned from consultancy Oxera and analytics firm Edge Health to make the latest call.

Image: Shares in the owner of British Airways rose at the start of this week

They said the research showed the removal of all testing requirements on international travel this month would not impact the spread of Omicron in the UK.

It also found that the introduction of pre-departure and day two PCR testing in late November and early December respectively had little impact on the spread of Omicron in the UK, compared to a scenario where the policy of a single day two antigen test remained the same.

The companies said the tightening of travel restrictions hurt the sector last month, with MAG estimating a 30% hit to its recovery in passenger numbers.

They said separate research commissioned by Oxera at the time showed that extra testing in response to Omicron reduced the UK aviation sector's contribution to the economy by £60m a week.

MAG chief executive Charlie Cornish and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said in a joint statement that the health secretary had already acknowledged that the value of any form of restrictions was significantly reduced once Omicron became dominant.

""This latest research by Oxera and Edge Health clearly supports the position that travel testing requirements can be removed in full without impacting overall case rates and hospitalisations in the UK,"" they said.

""It should give the UK government confidence to press ahead with the immediate removal of these emergency restrictions, giving people back the freedom to travel internationally to see loved ones, explore new places and generate new business opportunities.

""Travel restrictions come at huge cost to the travel industry, and to the UK economy as a whole, placing jobs at risk and holding back the recovery of one of our most important sectors.

""It is therefore vital they do not remain in place a day longer than is necessary.""

Fears over the Omicron variant and tighter restrictions imposed before Christmas have already been revealed to have had an impact on demand for Tui and Ryanair.

But hopes that conditions will ease - in the light of suggestions that Omicron will be cause less serious illness than other variants - have in recent days created a more optimistic outlook for the aviation sector.

Shoppers' monthly grocery bills were £15 higher this Christmas;Wednesday 5 January 2022 10:54, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Shoppers' monthly grocery bills were nearly £15 higher in December than a year earlier according to industry data - adding to evidence of growing pressure on the cost of living over Christmas.

Figures from data company Kantar showed supermarket price inflation climbed to 3.5% in the four weeks to 26 December, its highest since June 2020.

Kantar said that, over the last few months, prices were rising fastest in products such as fresh beef, savoury snacks and skincare while falling in fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits.

Stripping out that period early in the pandemic - when inflation was distorted by retailers scrapping promotions in order to discourage stockpiling - the monthly measure of grocery price inflation has not been higher since January 2018.

The figures chime with a British Retail Consortium (BRC) report a day earlier also pointing to rising shop prices - blaming the impact of factors such as labour shortage in the supply chain.

Wider inflation, which is also being driven by surging energy bills and fuel prices, is already running at a ten-year high and is expected to hit 6% this spring, a level not seen since the 1990s.

Kantar's figures showed grocery sales in December at £11.7bn, just 0.2% lower than record levels a year earlier when restrictions stopped people eating out.

Last month, the survey revealed that the price of a Christmas dinner in 2021 would be about 89p higher than a year earlier.

Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""People seized the chance to enjoy Christmas with friends and family after last year's muted festivities

""The data suggests that while there weren't formal rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to Omicron.""

Kantar said mince pie sales of £62m were 7% up on last year with Christmas chocolates climbing 21% and sparkling wine by 22% - and indigestion remedies saw an increase of 8%.

Less popular was the Brussels sprout, with sales of the festive staple down 3%.

Meanwhile, in-store visits were the highest since March 2020.

Kantar said 23 December was the busiest day for food and drink shopping, mainly driven by in-store visits. For December, these were the highest they have been since March 2020.

The figures showed that Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, outperformed its major rivals over the 12 weeks to Boxing Day.

Though, like them, its sales fell, the retailer's market share rose to its highest level since January 2018 at 27.9%.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220105130755/http://news.sky.com/story/shoppers-monthly-grocery-bills-were-15-higher-this-christmas-12509410;Category-2: business and economy

Sony takes gamble on electric cars as it seeks to 'redefine mobility';Wednesday 5 January 2022 14:59, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"Sky's Ian King takes a look at what the Playstation maker is up against as Sony takes aim at the electric car market after a strong 2021 for all its core businesses.

The 'Vision-S02' electric car is the second concept vehicle that Sony has produced. Pic: AP

It is instructive that, on news that Sony is setting up a unit to examine going into the electric vehicle market, its shares jumped by more than 4% on the Tokyo stock market.

That response accentuates the faith investors have in Japan's second-biggest company to deliver on something when it puts its mind to it.

And it is particularly pertinent given how crowded the electric vehicle market is becoming.

That market is already dominated by Tesla, which currently accounts for more than one in six electric vehicles sold worldwide, while all of the globe's biggest established carmakers - Volkswagen, Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Daimler, BMW and Honda - are ploughing billions into electrification.

Image: Tesla is the biggest player in a growing electric car market

So, too, are SAIC and BYD, two of China's biggest carmakers, which are respectively the third and fourth largest players (behind Tesla and Volkswagen) in the global electric vehicle market.

To them can be added Rivian, the electric vehicle start-up backed by Amazon and Ford, whose stock market valuation overtook that of Volkswagen and Toyota when it came to the stock market in November last year.

There is Polestar, the luxury electric vehicles maker backed by Volvo Cars of Sweden and Geely Automotive of China and Lucid, the luxury electric vehicle maker run by the former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson. Then there is Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle specialist whose stock market valuation already exceeds the likes of Honda, while it is also an open secret that Apple is working on various electric vehicle projects.

So, despite Sony's established excellence in consumer electronics and entertainment, there is no guarantee it will be able to crack the electric vehicle market.

But judging from the company's comments at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas - the global technology sector's biggest annual get-together - Sony is clearly thinking hard about it.

Image: Sony's 'Vision-S02' electric car at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Pic: AP

Unveiling a prototype electric SUV, named the Vision-S02, Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony's chief executive, said the company had been encouraged by a positive response to an earlier prototype, Vision-S01, unveiled two years ago.

He said: ""The excitement we received after the announcement… encouraged us to further consider how we can bring creativity and technology to change the experience of moving from one place to another.""

His comments suggest Sony is contemplating launching a car under its own brand name. When it unveiled its earlier prototype, it was with the specific aim of showcasing its sensor technology, which it had been looking at selling to other carmakers and particularly those looking to launch autonomous vehicles.

Investors are also hopeful that Sony, unlike some other entrants to the electric vehicle market, will be able to succeed because of its existing strengths in the consumer electronics market and in fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics.

Image: The company is best known for its audio-visual products including TVs and PlayStation 5. Pic: Sony

It set up a subsidiary called Sony AI in April 2020 and has built an AI-powered robot dog, Aibo, which has been involved in the EV project. The prototype unveiled in Las Vegas also showcased the company's existing electronics products, including a fully integrated digital video service called Bravia Core for Vision-S, which promises shared or individual video playback on the front panoramic screen and individual rear-seat displays. The car would also allow passengers to play PlayStation games through a remote connection to a console at home or play streaming games through the cloud.

Mr Yoshida added: ""We believe Sony is well-positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility.""

Those comments, however, will confirm to some Sony-watchers that the company is merely looking into electric vehicles as a way of showcasing its existing entertainment products - a music and computer games provider on wheels.

Nonetheless, news of the new division, to be called Sony Mobility, comes at a time when the company has its tail up. Sony shares have risen by 50% during the last year, dramatically outperforming the Nikkei 225 index, which has only risen by 8% during the same period. Its shares have also outperformed those of sector peers such as Canon, Panasonic and Nintendo during the last 12 months.

Recent optimism has been driven by Sony's entertainment businesses which, traditionally, were regarded internally in a business dominated by engineers as playing second fiddle to consumer electronics.

But the company has made a much better fist in recent years of explaining to investors the merit of a business bringing together both hardware and content, as typified by PlayStation, the world's best-selling games console.

And those businesses have raised their performance. Sony Music Entertainment is, alongside Universal Music and Warner Music, one of the world's three biggest players in recorded music - a sector that is thriving thanks to the boom in music streaming. So, too, is Sony/ATV, the world's biggest music publishing business, whose worth has been reappraised by investors at a time when there is a boom in the value of song catalogues.

Sony, whose catalogue already includes hits by the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, has been an active player in the consolidation taking place in the sector, as shown just before Christmas, when it paid a reported $500m for Bruce Springsteen's entire recorded music and songwriting catalogues.

Meanwhile Sony Pictures, which was bought by Sony 32 years ago when it was still known as Columbia Pictures, also has wind in its sails. One of the big five Hollywood studios, it is currently celebrating the most successful post-pandemic film launch in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is already one of the 10 biggest-grossing films of all time in the US.

Image: Sony's interests also extend to music and movies such as Spider-Man: No Way Home. Pic: Sony Pictures

So this is a company not lacking in confidence and it will have some advantages if it does move into electric vehicles under its own steam. The most obvious of these, as with Tesla, is that it will be starting from scratch. It will not, unlike the likes of Ford and Volkswagen, have a legacy internal combustion business to protect in the short-term. Another is that, with its expertise in consumer electronics, it will be well-placed to compete in a product that includes more software and fewer moving parts than conventional cars.

Yet the decision by Dyson in October 2019 to discontinue its interest in electric vehicles shows that even companies with an impeccable record for electronic products and an expertise in technology can find this particular market a tough one. There is still plenty of scope for disappointment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220105170721/http://news.sky.com/story/sony-takes-gamble-on-electric-cars-as-it-seeks-to-redefine-mobility-12509624;Category-6: science and technology
Nazir Ahmed: Former Labour peer found guilty of trying to rape young girl and sexual assaulting boy in 1970s;Wednesday 5 January 2022 16:43, UK;[];[];"A 64-year-old former Labour peer has been found guilty of attempting to rape a young girl and sexually assaulting a boy under 11 in the early 1970s.

A woman told Sheffield Crown Court that Nazir Ahmed, formerly Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, attacked her when he was 16 or 17 but she was much younger.

He also assaulted a boy during the same period, and was found guilty of two counts of attempted rape and one of buggery.

After the woman went to the police in 2016, she spoke to the male victim on the phone.

The jury heard a recording of their conversation, which happened after the man emailed to say he had ""evidence against that paedophile"".

Ahmed was charged along with his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both were deemed unfit to stand trial.

Farouq and Tariq faced charges of indecent assault in relation to the same boy Ahmed abused, and the jury found they did indeed commit those acts alleged.

An earlier trial was stopped in March because of problems over the disclosure of evidence.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC noted that some of the then alleged incidents happened in the late 1960s, and took the unusual step of ordering a permanent stay on proceedings.

But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appealed and the decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal in June, paving the way for the new trial.

Ahmed resigned from the House of Lords in November 2020 after reading the contents of a conduct committee report which found he sexually assaulted a vulnerable woman who sought his help.

It meant he was the first peer to be recommended for expulsion but he resigned before it could be implemented.

""By these verdicts the jury has clearly decided that no matter the delay between the offences and the trial, and the defences raised, they could be sure that the accounts of the victims were credible and true,"" said Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS's special crime division.

""One of these defendants held a position of power, influence and responsibility for some time in the House of Lords but this case clearly illustrates that where there is sufficient evidence, even in challenging cases, the CPS will bring a prosecution, put evidence before a jury and see rightful convictions.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220105170721/http://news.sky.com/story/nazir-ahmed-former-labour-peer-found-guilty-of-trying-to-rape-girl-and-sexual-assaulting-boy-in-1970s-12509660;Category-7: health

Sales of new electric cars 'only bright spark' for UK industry in flat 2021;Thursday 6 January 2022 03:17, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The UK car industry says growing demand for electric cars was the only ""bright spot"" for the sector last year as a string of coronavirus crisis-related challenges combined to knock sales.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported a rise of just 1% in overall new car sales during 2021 compared to the previous 12 months.

Industry figures released later on Thursday are expected to show that 1.65 million vehicles were registered - up from 1.63 million in 2020 when COVID pandemic disruption first began, shuttering showrooms as drivers were forced to stay at home during lockdowns.

Image: A Volvo electric car plugged into an Ubitricity lamppost EV charging point in central London. Picture date: Friday March 5, 2021.

A consequence of the public health emergency has been a hit to microchip production globally as factories were shut down.

It has meant that supply has failed to keep up with demand from semiconductor-intensive industries such as automakers to gaming system producers.

According to consulting firm AlixPartners, the chip shortage was tipped to have cost the world's automotive industry $60bn (£45bn) in lost sales alone during the year.

The SMMT has previously forecast that the shortfall will continue to be felt at UK factories throughout 2022.

Data from Susquehanna Financial Group released this week, covering the time between a chip order and delivery, suggested lead times deteriorated by six days in December to almost 26 weeks.

The report blamed electricity restrictions in China coupled with outbreaks of the Omicron COVID variant for the longer lead times.

The affect in the UK to date has seen car production volumes in 2021 at levels last seen in the 1950s.

SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said of the resulting picture for car sales: ""The first half of the year was in lockdown and, despite online click and collect, and the industry really stepping up to deliver that, it was still a tough start to the year.""

He said things ""didn't improve significantly"" in the latter six months ""because of shortages in terms of supply"".

Because of the scarcity of new cars, demand for used vehicles has been soaring - driving up prices significantly and therefore contributing to the surge in inflation.

The consumer prices index measure hit its highest level for a decade in November.

Mr Hawes said the increased popularity of electric cars was ""the one very strong and bright spot on the horizon"".

The Tesla Model 3 was expected to be confirmed as the most popular electric vehicle when the full figures were released - second in the entire rankings for the most popular new cars behind the Vauxhall Corsa.

It was the best year on record for plug-in cars, both battery electrics and plug-in hybrids, with 305,000 registered, accounting for around one in six of all new cars bought.

More battery electric vehicles were registered last year than between 2016 and 2020 combined as the clock ticks down to the 2030 ban on the sale of new cars powered by petrol and diesel engines.

Mr Hawes stressed the importance of ""continued investment"" in electric vehicles, saying it ""doesn't help"" when cuts are made to government grants.

The latest, last month, saw the maximum amount of cash motorists can claim towards a plug-in car fall £1,000 to £1,500.

Brittany Daniel: Sweet Valley High twin reveals baby daughter Hope was conceived using sister Cynthia's donor egg;Thursday 6 January 2022 10:11, UK;[];[];"Sweet Valley High star Brittany Daniel has revealed she became a mother thanks to her twin, Cynthia - who donated her eggs as cancer had left her sister struggling to get pregnant.

The twins, 45, who rose to fame as Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield in the 1990s TV adaption of the Francine Pascal books, have shared Brittany's ""modern day journey to parenthood"" in a new interview with People in the US.

After undergoing treatment for stage four non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Brittany was told that, due to the intense chemotherapy she had received, conceiving on her own would likely be impossible.

So Cynthia donated her eggs.

After three unsuccessful IVF attempts, Brittany and her husband Adam Touni, a real estate broker, went down the surrogacy route, again using one of Cynthia's eggs - and baby daughter Hope was born in October.

Sharing a picture of the article on Instagram, Brittany said Cynthia had ""helped make my dream come true of becoming a mom"".

She continued: ""My husband and I couldn't be more grateful to you sis. You're an angel. Thank you @people for sharing our modern day journey to parenthood.""

Cynthia, who is now a photographer, told People: ""I saw it as such a simple gift I could give to her.

""I know Brittany would do it in a split second for me. And we've always shared everything, so why not this?""

The twins found fame in Sweet Valley High, with Brittany playing the rebellious and outgoing Jessica, Cynthia the sensible and studious Elizabeth, but also starred in The Basketball Diaries together alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

Brittany, who went on to appear in shows including Dawson's Creek and films such as White Chicks, told People about Hope's first meeting with Cynthia, saying: ""It was so cool to see my sister with Hope for the first time because I'm like, she's your baby, too.""

Cynthia said she wasn't sure how she would feel meeting Hope and wondered if ""all these emotions [would] come up for me"", but added that she feels just like her aunt.

Brittany was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma - a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, part of the immune system - in 2011, so Hope's birth has come after years of trying.

Arnold takes reins at Old Trafford as Woodward leaves role as Manchester United chief;Thursday 6 January 2022 12:23, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Manchester United Football Club has finally confirmed the appointment of Richard Arnold as its new boss more than eight months after announcing the departure of veteran chief Ed Woodward.

The Premier League side said on Thursday that Mr Arnold, its group managing director, would become chief executive on 1 February.

Mr Woodward, who announced that he would leave Old Trafford in the aftermath of the European Super League (ESL) debacle last year, will continue to attend board meetings relating to footballing aspects of the club until June, although an expected consultancy arrangement has been abandoned.

Image: The team is now being led by interim manager Ralf Rangnick

The leadership transition will see Mr Arnold become the first person to hold the CEO title at Old Trafford since David Gill stepped down in 2013.

""I am honoured to have the chance to serve this great club and its fans,"" Mr Arnold said.

Advertisement

""I am determined to return that honour in any way I can.""

It comes at a crucial time for the club, with several players reported to be unhappy with the approach taken by interim manager Ralf Rangnick.

United's form has stuttered in the last three months, resulting in the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November following a 4-1 defeat at Watford.

Mr Woodward has held the title of executive vice-chairman since 2012, and has worked for the club since soon after the Glazer family bought it in 2005 in a £790m debt-funded deal.

His successor's elevation to the chief executive's job will make him one of the most powerful figures in British sport.

A former executive at InterVoice, a Nasdaq-listed technology company, Mr Arnold was previously United's commercial director.

His appointment comes as little surprise, given his status as the frontrunner to succeed Mr Woodward since the latter announced his departure in April.

Sky News reported shortly before Christmas that an announcement was imminent, and that it would be accompanied by a number of changes to the way the company is run.

Insiders said on Thursday that this would involve a move towards ""decentralised leadership"", with football decisions being led by John Murtough, the recently appointed director of football.

""Both the football director and manager will report to Richard, but he won't try and be hands-on with everything,"" the source said.

""It's likely that Richard and Joel [Glazer, the co-chairman] will have lower day-to-day involvement on the football side.""

Manchester United announced that Mr Woodward would step down at the end of 2021 in the wake of the ESL crisis which engulfed the Premier League's top clubs.

Image: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November

The abrupt withdrawal of six English sides from the ESL was sparked by a wave of fan protests against some of their owners - the most vociferous of which came at Old Trafford, forcing a Premier League match against Liverpool in early May to be postponed.

Many United supporters have been mistrustful of the Glazers since their takeover of the club.

The family floated the company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, but retained control through a separate class of shares.

Sky News revealed in November that the Glazers were close to finalising the terms of a fan ownership scheme with the Manchester United Supporters Trust, although it has yet to be formally unveiled.

Its mixed on-field results have come despite the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus, and substantial sums spent on other players, including Jadon Sancho, the England winger, from Borussia Dortmund.

Bird flu discovered in a person in South West England, UKHSA confirms;Thursday 6 January 2022 15:26, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A person in the South West of England has been confirmed as having contracted bird flu, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.

In a statement, the agency said it is ""extremely rare"" for strains of avian influenza to pass from birds to humans.

It added: ""The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time.

""All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating.""

The case was detected by officials swabbing people who had close contact with infected flocks, and they discovered ""low levels of flu"" in the patient.

Laboratory analysis revealed the virus was the 'H5' type found in birds, but it has not yet been possible to confirm it is a H5N1 infection - the strain currently circulating in birds in the UK.

The World Health Organisation has been notified.

Professor Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UKHSA, said: ""While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that's why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action.

""Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.

""We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread.

""It remains critical that people do not touch sick or dead birds, and that they follow the DEFRA advice about reporting.""

Prof Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at the University of Liverpool, said: ""Whilst avian influenza has the potential to be transmitted from poultry to humans it is very rare and, as in this case, usually due to close and long-term contact with infected birds.

""Avian influenza such as the H5 serotype is largely adapted to infect birds and so is very unlikely to be transmitted from person-to-person.

""The advice given by APHA and UKHSA over contact with infected birds is sensible and should be followed. The risk of wider infection in the general public remains low.""

In December, poultry keepers were urged to help stop the spread of avian flu after several small outbreaks over recent months.

The UK's ""largest ever"" outbreak was reported in Northern Ireland last month after two further suspected cases were identified, one in a commercial poultry flock of 14,000 birds near Markethill in County Armagh and a commercial duck flock of 22,000 in Coagh, County Tyrone.

1921 census released online reveals life in post-World War One Britain;Thursday 6 January 2022 18:39, UK;[];[];"The lives of the 38 million people living in England and Wales in 1921 have been revealed in a census newly released online, which records figures such as a young Captain Sir Tom Moore, Beatrix Potter and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The census - locked away in vaults for a century - was taken on 19 June 1921 and shows similarities with our own post-COVID world.

From the grand abode of Windsor Castle to prisons, hospitals and cramped family houses, each resident was asked to complete a survey, including questions about their age, birthplace and job.

Image: Peter Rabbit writer Beatrix Potter recorded herself as a farmer rather than an author

Some 38,000 staff were sent to knock on the doors of more than 8.5 million households for the census - at the time the most detailed ever.

The digitised version - available online at findmypast.co.uk after three years of work - gives the first glimpse at the individual records.

Census showed devastating toll of WWI

The census also highlights the awful toll of the First World War as it shows about 1.7 million more women than men, the largest difference ever seen in a census.

For the first time, people were also able to put their marital status as ""divorced"", with more than 16,000 people doing so.

Jeff James, chief executive at the National Archives, said: ""The 1921 census allows a snapshot of life 100 years ago, at a time when individuals and communities were embarking on a new era where everyday rights and roles were changing.""

He said the records reveal ""what has changed over time but also provide familiarity with our lives today"".

In an echo of 2021, Britain in 1921 was recovering from the Spanish Flu pandemic while also experiencing economic turmoil.

One-year-old Thomas Moore was in census

Prominent figures such as writers Beatrix Potter, J R R Tolkien and Sherlock Holmes' author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are among the handwritten entries.

There is even an entry recording a one-year-old Thomas Moore, who went on to raise millions for the NHS nearly a century after his birth.

Illustrating fears of the Spanish Flu, some of the pages are stained with disinfectant, and anger over poor living conditions and poverty is also clear.

Image: Arthur Vince, a tax officer, defaced his form with a cartoon of officials 'counting cannon fodder' for the 'next war'

James Bartley, a gas fitter in Hove, wrote on his record that his family of five was living in one room, adding ""stop talking about your homes for heroes and start building some"".

Some unhappiness at doing the survey

Retired army officer Harold Orpen, 46, apologised to officials for his typed response rather than the required handwritten one, adding: ""I lost half my right hand in the late war and cannot write properly.""

Some were also unhappy at having to fill out the survey at all.

Alice Underwood, 53, from Buckinghamshire, wrote: ""What a wicked waste of taxpayers' money at this time of unemployment.""

A census has been done every decade since 1801 but documents are legally required to remain secret for 100 years.

COVID-19: Jobs that offer hybrid working and flexible hours are on the rise;Friday 7 January 2022 00:56, UK;[];[];"Lots of us are working from home at the moment - indeed, the government's advice is currently to work from home if you can.

The last few years have proved that working from home - and so-called ""hybrid working"" - is both possible and productive.

It is not for everyone: for many, working from home is the same as living at work, and in some jobs it is impossible. Nonetheless, new figures show it is becoming more popular.

Image: 'I'm a better version of myself, I'm a better employee, a better mum,' Yez Ibrahim says

Research from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and labour market analysts Emsi Burning Glass show that 25% of jobs advertised in December last year mentioned hybrid or flexible working, which also includes job shares and working irregular hours. That's up from 19% before the pandemic.

Insurance giant Zurich is one company that has been offering flexible working for all its roles since 2019. It was originally introduced to encourage more women to apply for senior positions, which were not traditionally seen as flexible.

It's been a success: over the past 12 months, 23% of new female hires have been part-time, compared with 10% in 2019. And the number of applications from both men and women has increased by more than two-thirds since it launched the initiative.

One of them, Yez Ibrahim, started last summer. She mostly works from home on a flexible, part-time basis, which allows her to spend more time with her family. It was after having her second child that she knew ""work on a full-time basis just wasn't an option. I just couldn't juggle that anymore"".

She told Sky News: ""It's just an all-round better setup for me. And it works. I'm a better version of myself, I'm a better employee, a better mum.

""It's just benefit after benefit really, when you look at it.""

Zurich UK is now calling on the government to change the law, so that all large companies make all vacancies available on a part-time, job-share and flexible basis - unless there are specific business reasons why this is not possible.

The company's HR director Steve Collinson said: ""We've certainly seen a very strong demand from employees and from candidates.

""If we think about the fact that there are over a million unfilled vacancies in the UK, if there's this very strong demand from candidates for flexibility, for access to things like part time and job share opportunities, if employers don't have flexibility, then we're missing out on whole swathes of potential candidates.""

Mumsnet CEO and founder Justine Roberts said this flexibility is exactly what mothers have been calling for: ""I think we need to acknowledge that flexible working, hybrid working is something that women in particular mothers have been desperate for, for years.

""What the pandemic has done is allowed us to test this, experiment with this, and the world hasn't fallen in. The thing that mums want most from work is flexibility.

""There is a risk I suppose that as we move to sort of more established patterns that the women end up being the remote workers and the men go back to the office. And because they're in the office, they have more influence. But I strongly feel that it's up to employers to counter that and make time for all their employees.

""So it's very much up to employers to work out how to make hybrid working work for everyone.""

Working from home has unexpected side effects as well. As people stay away from the office, businesses in city centres that relied on them are suffering.

Whether everyone chooses to take up the option of flexible or hybrid working remains to be seen. There will be challenges to make sure no one misses out on support, mentorship, or opportunities out of the office.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220107020711/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-jobs-that-offer-hybrid-working-and-flexible-hours-are-on-the-rise-12510591;Category-2: business and economy
Peter Bogdanovich, director of The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon, dies aged 82;Thursday 6 January 2022 20:47, UK;[];[];"Peter Bogdanovich, who directed movies including The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon, has died at the age of 82.

His daughter, Antonia, said he died of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles.

Born in New York in 1939, Bogdanovich started as a film journalist and critic.

He also organised a series of retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, where his father had taken him at the age of five to see Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton movies.

Image: Bogdanovich started as a film journalist and critic

Known as one of the ""New Hollywood"" directors, he helped out on The Wild Angels in 1966, directed by Roger Corman, and starring Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra.

After that was a success, he directed a project of his own, Targets, in 1968, and the critics praised it.

The Last Picture Show - starring Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd among others - is a coming-of-age drama about high school pupils.

Released in 1971, it was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director.

Paper Moon - a comedy drama released in 1973 - starred father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, whose performance made her the youngest winner in the history of the Academy Awards when she took the Oscar for best supporting actress at the age of 10.

Bogdanovich's personal life contained drama too: he had an affair with Cybill Shepherd that began during the making of The Last Picture Show while he was married to a close collaborator, Polly Platt.

Another girlfriend, Dorothy Stratten, was murdered, after which he married her younger sister, Louise, who was 29 years his junior.

Fellow director Francis Ford Coppola said he was ""devastated"" to hear of Bogdanovich's death, describing him as a ""wonderful and great artist"".

Coppola said he will never forget attending a premiere for The Last Picture Show, after which the audience burst into applause ""lasting easily 15 minutes"".

Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro tweeted that Bogdanovich was a ""champion of cinema"" who ""birthed masterpieces"" and was a ""most genial human"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220107020711/https://news.sky.com/story/peter-bogdanovich-director-of-the-last-picture-show-and-paper-moon-dies-aged-82-12510483;Category-5: entertainment and culture

""She loved to travel and anyone who met her loved her. She will be missed more than words can say by family and friends.""

Despite further emergency services being despatched, including an air ambulance, Ms Clark died at the scene.

Her two colleagues were taken to hospital. A male paramedic who suffered serious multiple injuries was airlifted to Kings College Hospital in London.

A student paramedic, travelling in the rear of the vehicle, was treated for a head injury.

The ambulance had been on its way to an incident at the time but there were no patients on board, while the lorry driver suffered minor injuries.

Demands for COVID wage uplift to reduce gulf between workers and executives;Friday 7 January 2022 00:45, UK;[];[];"Unions and fair pay campaigners are demanding a recognition of UK workers' contribution to the UK during the coronavirus pandemic as the annual 'high pay day' arrives - albeit a day later than usual.

The High Pay Centre said 9am on Friday would mark the time when the median FTSE 100 chief executive (CEO) would have earned the median UK worker's annual salary of £31,285.

The think-tank said that for the first time since it was founded a decade ago, its research had found that CEOs had needed to work into a fourth day of a new year to make the same amount.

That was because bosses' pay fell by 17% to £2.7m in 2020 from £3.25m the previous year.

2020 - the last year for which full pay data is available - saw many CEOs take temporary pay cuts and cancel or curb bonuses as the public health emergency took hold.

Unions joined the think-tank in proposing a fairer model as household budgets come under greater pressure from the highest level of inflation for a decade, that is tipped to be driven even higher by surging energy bills from April.

The High Pay Centre said the findings of a survey it conducted shot out of the water the justification for big awards on pay committees; that an executive's role was more important than the person at the bottom of the ladder.

High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said: ""Some of the lowest-paying jobs have played the most important role to keep society functioning through the pandemic.

""With the value of the UK economy reduced, there's also greater pressure to share what we do have more evenly.

""In this context, vast CEO-to-worker pay differences may be harder to justify. It will be interesting to see whether the still very substantial pay gap between top earners and the wider workforce continues to narrow in future, or reverts to previous levels.""

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The pandemic has shown us all who keeps the country going during a crisis. There are millions of hardworking people in Britain - from carers, to delivery drivers, to shop floor staff - who give more than they get back, but greedy executives are taking home millions while ordinary workers face yet another year of pay squeezes.

""As we emerge from the pandemic, we need to redesign the economy to make it fair, and that means big reforms to bring CEO pay back down to earth.

""Executive pay committees have to change. They should be required to include workforce representatives who can speak up for a fair balance of pay with ordinary workers.

""Incentive schemes for company directors should be replaced by profit-share schemes that include the whole workforce.

Global shipping operations have been severely affected by the impact of pandemic lockdowns as well as rapid recovery in demand - in addition to extreme weather.

Meanwhile car makers are being held back by supplies of another rather more sophisticated type of chip - with COVID-19 stoppages at semiconductor makers in the Far East causing assembly lines in the UK and around the world to come to a halt.

In Britain, supply problems are further complicated by labour shortages in areas such as lorry driving and food processing, partly attributed to Brexit as well as the pandemic.

Astronomers spot dying star just before it explodes and record supernova;Friday 7 January 2022 11:22, UK;[];[];"Astronomers have for the first time imaged the last moments in the life of a red supergiant star.

It was spotted just 130 days before exploding using two telescopes in Hawaii, allowing a team of researchers to survey it before it detonated in an enormous supernova.

""This is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,"" said Dr Wynn Jacobson-Galán, lead author of the study.

""Direct detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova.

""For the first time, we watched a red supergiant star explode!"" added Dr Jacobson-Galán.

Scientists figure out when red supergiant Betelgeuse will go supernova

What did we learn?

The discovery, which took place in the summer of 2020 before the supergiant exploded that autumn, has been detailed in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal.

Using the Keck Observatory's Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) the team found dense circumstellar material surrounding the star at the time it exploded.

The researchers believe this is the same gas that had initially alerted them to the red supergiant with a blast of bright radiation in the summer.

They say the discovery reveals new details about how red supergiants evolve just before going supernova - as previously observed supergiants didn't show any evidence of violent eruptions (such as the one that alerted them to this star's existence) before exploding.

As the team was able to observe this star for so long they have learned that red supergiants ""undergo significant changes in their internal structure that then results in the tumultuous ejection of gas moments before they collapse"".

The discovery means that other telescopes conducting transient surveys will be able to hunt for similar types of luminous radiation which could signal other imminent supernovas.

""I am most excited by all of the new 'unknowns' that have been unlocked by this discovery,"" said Dr Jacobson-Galán.

""Detecting more events like [this] will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution, uniting observers and theorists in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives.""

What are red supergiants?

Red supergiants are the biggest stars in the universe in terms of volume although they are not the most dense nor the brightest stars in the sky.

They are created when a moderately massive star has burned through the hydrogen at its core and begins to undergo helium fusion, which is where heavier elements such as carbon and iron originate from.

However hydrogen fusion continues in the outer shells causing the star to expand - and as it surface area grows it ends up getting cooler.

Heavier and heavier elements begin to fuse within the core of a red supergiant until, astronomers believe, it builds up a core of iron which cannot sustainably undergo nuclear fusion - causing the star to explode.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220107120719/http://news.sky.com/story/astronomers-spot-dying-star-just-before-it-explodes-and-record-supernova-12510823;Category-6: science and technology

The increase was the biggest since July 2007, according to the lender, as prices rose month-on-month by 1.1%.

It is the latest confirmation of a buoyant housing market in 2021 as a lack of homes for sale combined with historically low mortgage rates drove prices higher.

But interest rate hikes and wider cost of living increases could put the brakes on the surge.

Halifax said the average price for a property now stands at £276,091, an increase of more than £24,500 on December 2020 - the biggest in cash terms since March 2003.

Quarter-on-quarter growth of 3.5% was again the strongest since 2006, the lender said.

Halifax said Wales was the strongest region for house price growth, with a rise of 14.5% to an average £205,579.

Greater London saw the slowest growth, of 2.1%, though average prices of £525,351 in the capital were still well ahead of other parts of the country.

""The housing market defied expectations in 2021,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley.

""In 2021 we saw the average house price reach new record highs on eight occasions, despite the UK being subject to 'lockdown' for much of the first six months of the year.""

Mr Galley pointed to the lack of spending opportunities created by COVID restrictions helped to boost households' cash reserves.

""This factor, alongside the stamp duty holiday and the race for space as a result of homeworking, will have encouraged buyers to bring forward home purchases that may have been planned for this year,"" he added.

Meanwhile, government support for jobs and incomes during the crisis ""may have given some households the confidence to proceed with purchases"".

""Looking ahead, the prospect that interest rates may rise further this year to tackle rising inflation, and increasing pressures on household budgets, suggests house price growth will slow considerably,"" Mr Galley said.

""However, there are many variables which could push house prices either way, depending on how the pandemic continues to impact the economic environment.""

Hunterston B: After 46 years, Scottish nuclear power plant shuts down;Saturday 8 January 2022 00:49, UK;[];[];"One of Scotland's two nuclear power plants has shut down after almost 46 years of generating electricity.

Over its lifetime, Hunterston B had produced enough energy to power every home in Scotland for nearly 31 years.

The plant was originally scheduled to only be in operation for 25 years, but investment meant its lifespan could be extended.

WWF Scotland's Lang Banks said its closure was ""inevitable"" - and growth in renewable energy means nuclear power is no longer required.

Station director Paul Forrest explained: ""We don't just switch off the power station, close the gates and walk away. It will take time to defuel and decommission the site and we will continue to need skilled people to do this.""

Ben Affleck, Jamie Dornan and the Golden Globes controversy - our weekly Backstage entertainment interviews and news;;[];[];"A New Year in Hollywood usually means the likes of Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler getting ready to take down the great and the good of Tinseltown for the first and most raucous show of awards season.

But that's not the case for the Golden Globes in 2022.

The ceremony that kick-starts the awards race, usually the biggest in the run-up to the Oscars, is going to look very different after making headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2021, with criticism over diversity among its membership and allegations of inappropriate freebies being given to influence votes.

Ricky Gervais has hosted several Golden Globes ceremonies over the past few years Ricky Gervais has hosted several Golden Globes ceremonies over the past few years

Despite the nominations being announced in December, the event is being held in private and few details have been released beforehand.

Front-runners include Kenneth Branagh's Belfast, Jane Campion's Power Of The Dog and Steven Spielberg's West Side Story in the film categories, while Succession, The Morning Show and Ted Lasso are all nominated in several TV categories.

And Denzel Washington, Lady Gaga, Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman, Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kristen Stewart, Jason Sudeikis, Brian Cox and Jennifer Aniston are just some of the stars nominated in the acting categories.

But will the winners accept their awards, virtually at least if not in person? Here's what happened in 2021 - and what has changed for 2022.

Steven Spielberg's West Side Story is among the film nominees Steven Spielberg's West Side Story is among the film nominees

Membership criticism

In February 2021, The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - the organisation behind the Golden Globes - faced significant criticism after it emerged none of its members were black.

At the time, the voting body was made up of around 80 members, none of whom were black, a report in the Los Angeles Times found.

The HFPA quickly issued a statement to say it was working on ""an action plan"" to recruit black members and the ceremony went ahead in March rather than its usual January date, with the delay caused by the pandemic.

The Emily In Paris controversy

As well as diversity, questions were also raised around alleged discriminatory practices and whether relationships with Hollywood studios influenced the choice of nominees and winners.

The Los Angeles Times exposé reported on a ""culture of corruption"" at the HFPA, which included members ""exchanging votes for perks and access [to celebrities]"".

When it was revealed that the somewhat criticised Lily Collins series Emily In Paris - widely regarded as fun but lightweight - had scored two major nods, while Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed I May Destroy You had been snubbed, there was outcry on social media - even an Emily In Paris writer had something to say about it, writing an opinion piece for the Guardian.

In its report, the LA Times claimed that the Paramount Network, which produces Emily In Paris, had treated several Golden Globes voters to a lavish set visit that included a five-star hotel stay, with rooms costing about $1,400 (about £1,033) a night.

Tom Cruise reportedly handed his three Golden Globes back following the controversy in 2021 Tom Cruise reportedly handed his three Golden Globes back following the controversy in 2021

The backlash

In May 2021, the Globes' broadcast network, NBC - which had aired the awards for several years - said it would not be showing the ceremony in 2022.

Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise reportedly returned his three Golden Globe awards for his roles in Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born On The Fourth Of July in protest.

And Scarlett Johansson said she would no longer work with the HFPA unless it made significant changes, while platforms including Netflix, Amazon Studios, WarnerMedia and dozens of Hollywood's top publicity companies also called for reform.

Sky News understands that Netflix still does not believe the HFPA has gone far enough in its reforms, and that it did not enter any of its content for submission, despite the numerous nominations.

HFPA member Husam Asi gave a rare interview to Sky News, admitting a need for reform and saying bosses should be held accountable for the lack of diversity in the organisation.

Audience numbers for the ceremony had plummeted to less than six million US viewers - down from 18.4 million in 2020 - following a difficult year for the industry caused by COVID restrictions.

After particularly scathing take-downs by host Gervais in 2020, and the poor viewing figures in 2021, could the controversial history of the HFPA be the final nail in the coffin? Is real change in Hollywood on the horizon? Or will this be a one-off?

What's changed?

The HFPA says it had worked ""tirelessly"" to make change and has ""completely overhauled its bylaws, implementing sweeping changes from top to bottom addressing ethics and code of conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, membership and more"".

The organisation said it admitted its largest and most diverse class to date in October, with 21 new and ""predominantly diverse"" journalists joining as members, and almost half its members are women.

""There are now people of colour involved in decision-making throughout the organisation - from major board decisions, to credentialing and selecting new members,"" it has said.

It has also brought in a ban on gift-giving from studios to its membership, in an effort to stop them apparently trying to influence the board.

Where and when does the ceremony take place?

Despite the backlash this year, the HFPA has pressed ahead with the awards and the ceremony will be held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, starting at 6pm local time on Sunday (2am on Monday in the UK).

Who's hosting?

That, we don't know. Details are yet to be released, if there is even a host at all.

How can I watch?

Sorry, you can't. Even if you're in the US. After being dropped by NBC, the 2022 event will take place behind closed doors, with no broadcast or live-stream. An HFPA spokesperson said the ceremony would be a private event but real-time updates on winners will be posted on the Golden Globes website and social media channels.

Which celebs will be there?

You might be sensing a pattern here... we don't know. Hollywood stars have been largely silent on the nominations this year, and the HFPA - usually keen to highlight in advance the vast array of celebs confirmed for the red carpet - has not provided details.

However, it has confirmed there will be no red carpet this year, which gives the impression it's going to be a low-key night.

Sky News has contacted several nominees to see if they will be accepting their awards, even if only through social media.

Succession is a favourite in the TV categories Succession is a favourite in the TV categories

But we do know who's nominated!

This, we can tell you. The films up for best drama are Belfast, CODA, Dune, King Richard and Power Of The Dog, while Cyrano, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, tick, tick... BOOM! and West Side Story are in the running for best musical or comedy.

In the TV categories, Lupin, The Morning Show, Pose, Squid Game and Succession are nominated for best drama, while The Great, Hacks, Only Murders In The Building, Ted Lasso and Reservation Dogs make up the shortlist for best musical/ comedy series, and Dopesick, Impeachment: American Crime Story, Maid, Mare Of Easttown and The Underground Railroad all have nods for best motion picture.

For more on the nominees, see our complete list here.

What about COVID?

The rise of the Omicron variant has spoiled the party even more. The HFPA has said there will be no audience at the ceremony, with precautions being taken for ""select members and grantees"" who will be in the room.

They will need proof of vaccination and booster shot, along with a negative PCR test within 48 hours, and all guests will have to wear masks and be socially distanced.

What else has the HFPA said?

Not much. In a statement confirming when the winners will be announced, it said that in addition to the awards the ceremony ""will shine a light on the long-established philanthropy work of the HFPA"".

The organisation has donated $50 million (about £37 million) to more than 70 entertainment-related charities, film restoration, scholarship programs and humanitarian efforts over the past 25 years, ""many of whom were hit hard over the last two years as a result of the pandemic"", it said.

During the event, Kyle Bowser, senior vice president of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) Hollywood Bureau, will discuss the Reimagine Coalition - a joint five-year initiative to increase diversity, equity and inclusion across the global entertainment industry.

""Each year the HFPA and the NAACP Hollywood Bureau will collaborate on, fund, and support a series of trailblazing initiatives, with the overall goals of ensuring visibility of projects from artists of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; increasing diverse representation in the industry; and building pathways to inclusion for young artists and journalists of colour,"" the HFPA said.

Firearms and hundreds of knives among weapons seized at crown courts during pandemic;Saturday 8 January 2022 01:22, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];[];"Weapons including firearms and hundreds of knives have been seized at crown courts during the pandemic, Sky News can reveal.

More than 1,000 knives and other blades have been confiscated at the buildings - which deal with the most serious criminal cases - since April 2020, according to official data.

A total of 73 ""other weapons"" and two firearms were also discovered - but Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) declined to provide further details about those weapons.

Image: Firearms were confiscated at crown courts during the pandemic

The actual number of dangerous items seized is likely to be much higher as the figures do not include combined court centres, such as those in Oxford, Leeds and Derby.

Details of the seized weapons follow concerns about court security after the death of a criminal who managed to sneak acid into a dock before swallowing it.

Conman Mark Marshall drank the corrosive substance while being sentenced at Inner London Crown Court in April 2019, and died two months later.

An inquest jury ruled in December that security failings ""probably contributed"" to Mr Marshall's death after he was not adequately checked as he entered the court, and a dock officer failed to confiscate a metal bottle which contained the acid.

What does the data show? HMCTS revealed the number of weapons seized at crown courts in England and Wales between April 2020 and October 2021

During that period, 42 large knives (with blades over three inches long) were confiscated

A further 359 small knives (with blades under three inches long) were recovered

A total of 660 'other blades' were seized

Two firearms were confiscated

Some 73 'other weapons' were found. Further details about those weapons were not provided

Sky News submitted a freedom of information request asking for details of weapons seized at crown courts since 2018.

However, HMCTS refused to reveal how many weapons had been seized before April 2020, saying retrieving the data would exceed the cost limit set out by the Freedom of Information Act.

It also said it could not breakdown the figures to reveal how many weapons were found at each crown court.

Small knives seized at courts can be returned to their owners on written request but HMCTS would not reveal how many had been posted back, saying it did not hold the data.

Number of weapons seized at courts 'beggars belief'

Labour's shadow minister for courts and sentencing, Alex Cunningham, told Sky News: ""It beggars belief that in just 18 months more than a thousand people tried to get dangerous weapons into our courts to do who knows what.

""This is symptomatic of the Tory government's utter failure to deal with serious violent crime across the country which has soared over the last decade.

""Our courts and tribunals are already buckling under the joint pressure of a decade of Tory cuts and the impact of the pandemic.""

The seized weapons were recovered during a period of turmoil for the court system which is facing a huge backlog cases as a result of the pandemic.

Fewer than half of courts in England and Wales were kept open during the first lockdown.

'It feels so wrong': For the first time ever, people in the UAE work on a Friday;Saturday 8 January 2022 03:26, UK;['connor sephton', '@connorsephton'];[];"Thursday night usually marks the start of the weekend for workers in the United Arab Emirates - but not anymore.

For years, the UAE has joined many Islamic countries in having Friday and Saturday as days off.

But as a new year begins, the country has officially introduced a Western-style working week that will run from Monday to Friday.

Image: State employees only need to work for a half a day on Fridays - the Muslim holy day - so they can attend prayers

Some workers were left feeling a little short-changed upon realising they would have to set their alarms for an early start on Friday.

""It just feels so wrong,"" one tweet read.

Rachel King, a British 22-year-old who lives in Dubai, told the AFP news agency: ""I'd rather take (Friday) off.

""That is what we all know and love, having a Friday off and going to certain places that are open and we could do things. But now it is going to be Saturday.""

There are pros and cons to the switch.

State employees only need to work for a half a day on Fridays - the Muslim holy day - so they can attend prayers.

The government says this makes the UAE ""the first nation in the world to introduce a national working week shorter than the global five-day week"".

It could also be a boost for businesses based in Abu Dhabi and Dubai - both home to big multinational firms - because their opening times will be better aligned with economies around the world.

Djokovic 'told he met travel requirements'

The application says he received a document from the Department of Home Affairs on 1 January telling him he met the requirements for quarantine-free travel into Australia.

Djokovic's lawyers said he received an exemption certificate from Tennis Australia, which was ""provided by an Independent Expert Medical Review panel"" whose decision was endorsed by the Victorian state government's own medical exemptions panel.

Reports say Tennis Australia told unvaccinated players they may be able to obtain a temporary exemption if they had recovered from COVID in the past six months, according to a leaked letter.

Tennis Australia said it had not knowingly misled players and had always urged players to get vaccinated.

The guidance issued was based on information on a national government website to which it had been referred by the federal health minister, the association said.

""We have always been consistent in our communications to players that vaccination is the best course of action - not just as the right thing to do to protect themselves and others, but also as the best course of action to ensure they could arrive in Australia,"" Tennis Australia said in a statement quoted by local media.

The health service is urging people to bend their knees loosely, point their feet out slightly, extend their arms at their sides, walk flat-footed - taking short steps, and to keep their centre of gravity over their feet in order to avoid falling.

Linda de Caestecker, director for Public Health at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: ""While it might seem silly to walk or waddle like a penguin, in the context of the wintery conditions we're seeing today, penguins know best.

""If you find yourself out and about in icy conditions, adopting the penguin stance is a really effective way to move without falling.""

Wind and rain, heavy in places, will spread eastwards on Saturday, with temporary snow on northern hills. Sunny spells and blustery showers will follow, with hail, thunder and hill snow possible. It will be milder than today but may not feel it https://t.co/f0MOgixoYV pic.twitter.com/Vohphhsv91 — Sky News Weather (@SkyNewsWeather) January 7, 2022

Women and girls face ADHD misdiagnosis due to misconceptions around symptoms;Saturday 8 January 2022 17:32, UK;[];[];"Women and girls with ADHD are struggling to get diagnosed, or are being misdiagnosed because of a misconception about the symptoms.

The stereotype of hyperactivity, or disrupting classes with fidgeting, just doesn't apply for lots of children. Girls especially are more likely to have symptoms such as inattentiveness or introversion, which can overlooked, or dismissed as daydreaming.

Boys are five times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls, although in later life, case numbers of ADHD are roughly similar for men and women.

Image: Boys are five times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls

That's partly because most of the studies, which inform diagnosis, are done with boys. But girls may be better at masking their symptoms as well, says consultant psychiatrist and ADHD specialist Dr Pablo Jeczmien.

""ADHD is under-recognised in girls and in women because the symptoms of ADHD we associate with hyperactivity and impulsivity are usually not present in girls and women,"" he said.

""Because there is this cultural expectation that you should behave in this certain way. That is the starting point, then this diagnosis is relegated.""

Katherine Mengardon, who has a son and a daughter both with ADHD, says it was a battle to get her children's schools to accept the diagnosis when they didn't display the normal disruptive behaviours.

It was especially hard for the school to accept that her 13-year-old daughter, whose main symptom is trouble sleeping, but who struggles to pay attention in classes she finds boring, had ADHD. But, it was important.

""The main reason to get them diagnosed is because at school it means you can get some support and accommodation,"" Ms Mengardon said.

Image: Katherine Mengardon's son and daughter both have ADHD

""You really have to make a bit of a fight with the schools to get them to understand it's not about being wilful or lazy. It's properly difficult.""

If it isn't diagnosed, it can have a devastating effect on young women struggling to live with ADHD without support.

Dr Jeczmien said: ""It is incredibly important to recognise this [ADHD] because of the long-term effects ADHD has when it's not [recognised.]

""The issue with girls and women later on is because it's not recognised it has this huge impact on their lives, with sometimes severe mental health conditions. Because of the consequences later on in life: frustration, anger, feeling low self-confidence or low self-esteem, and thinking you are either lazy or you're not intelligent enough, which is incredibly painful.

""This is usually the experience that women have, they become overwhelmed, they become stressed, they become anxious, they become depressed.

""And they are treated for such a thing, when in fact the treatment should be to address the very roots of the problem. On many occasions when you treat ADHD the other symptoms will simply disappear.

""And this is why it is incredibly important in my view to try to identify this as early as possible.""

That is exactly what happened to Leanne, who was only diagnosed when she was 25 years old, having spiralled through anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.

""I was really, really unhappy as a child and teenager, throughout school. I couldn't concentrate in class like at all and was actually often going out clubbing and drinking - because I was always thinking so much and over-thinking, over-analysing, and I figured out quite early on that like drinking helped me calm down the thoughts.

""It just felt like everyone else was on an escalator that I had no idea I didn't even know existed. It felt like I was going completely insane because I knew that I kept self-sabotaging my life. I knew that what I was doing was not normal.""

Image: Leanne was only diagnosed with ADHD when she was 25 years old

Although she sought help it took years for her ADHD to be identified.

""I just felt like I lost 25 years of my life, like the first 25 years from constantly kind of being controlled by things that weren't my own brain, whether that was like looking for alcohol or feeling suicidal, like just not being able to actually relax and enjoy my life at all, and just always feeling in a constant state of stress, and feeling like there's a problem with you, and there's something wrong with you.""

Leanne's now coaching businesses to help others recognise the symptoms earlier. More training for teachers and GPs, about the variation in ADHD symptoms, will be crucial to helping the next generation of girls cope with the disorder.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220108175800/https://news.sky.com/story/women-and-girls-face-adhd-misdiagnosis-due-to-misconceptions-around-symptoms-12511672;Category-7: health

FA Cup: Newcastle knocked out by Cambridge as third round sees cup upsets;Saturday 8 January 2022 18:16, UK;[];[];"League One side Cambridge United have dramatically knocked Premiership team Newcastle out of the FA Cup, after a 1-0 win at St James' Park.

The FA Cup's third round is traditionally seen one of the most exciting weekends of football, which sees lower league sides often get drawn against top flight teams.

Newcastle, which recently became the richest club in the world when it was bought by the Saudi Arabian government for an estimated £305 million, has only won one game so far this season, beating Burnley on 4 December.

Cambridge said its win was ""the magic of the cup"" on Twitter as the full time whistle went.

Championship side Reading were also dumped out the competition by Kidderminster Harriers, who play in the sixth tier of English football, after losing 2-1.

The Harriers came from 1-0 in the first half to mount a sensational comeback and move into the fourth round of the competition.

Elsewhere, Championship side Huddersfield beat Premier League strugglers Burnley 2-1 at Turf Moor - a good omen as it comes 100 years after the Yorkshire side won the same fixture - and in fact the entire competition - in 1922.

However, most of the afternoon and early kick-offs followed the script, with Middlesbrough beating Mansfield 3-2 and Man City, Brentford and Leicester all thrashing their opponents Swindon, Port Vale and Watford 4-1.

There was added drama in west London as Championship side QPR beat League One leaders Rotherham 8-7 on penalties after it ended 1-1 at the final whistle.

Marilyn Bergman: Oscar-winning lyricist who co-wrote The Way We Were, dies aged 93;Saturday 8 January 2022 21:39, UK;[];[];"Oscar-winning composer Marilyn Bergman has died at her home in Los Angeles at age of 93.

The lyricist, who teamed with her husband Alan Bergman, on the song The Way We Were and hundreds of others, died of respiratory failure not related to COVID-19.

Mr Bergman was at her bedside when she passed away, her representative Jason Lee said.

The couple, who married in 1958, were among the most successful songwriting partnerships, specialising in introspective ballads for film television and the stage.

From Brooklyn to Los Angeles

The Bergmans were Jews that started life from lower-middle-class families in Brooklyn.

Born in the same hospital, Alan four years earlier than Marilyn, they were raised in the same neighbourhood and were fans of music and movies as children.

They both moved to Los Angeles in 1950 but did not meet until a few years later, when they were working for the same composer.

They share a daughter, named Julie Bergman.

A long successful career

During her long career, she worked with the likes of Marvin Hamlisch, Cy Coleman, and Michel Legrand.

The duo's works were also recorded by some of the world's biggest singers, including Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson.

Image: Marilyn and Alan Bergman pose at their piano in their Beverly Hills home on March 17, 1980. Pic: AP

Some of their songs included Streisand's and Neil Diamond's duet You Don't Bring Me Flowers and Sinatra's Nice 'n' Easy.

""If one really is serious about wanting to write songs that are original, that really speak to people, you have to feel like you created something that wasn't there before - which is the ultimate accomplishment, isn't it?"" Marilyn Bergman told The Huffington Post in 2013.

""And to make something that wasn't there before, you have to know what came before you.""

But they were best known for their contributions to films, with their peak being The Way We Were from the romantic drama of the same name, featuring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford.

Set to Hamlisch's moody, pensive melody with Streisand's voice, it was the top-selling song of 1974.

The Bergmans won three Oscars - for The Way We Were, Windmills Of Your Mind and the soundtrack to Streisand's Yentl - and received 16 nominations, three of them in 1983 alone.

They also won two Grammys and four Emmys and were placed into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Her career spanned into TV as well, with Mr and Mrs Bergman helping to write the themes to 1970s sitcoms Maude and Good Times.

Bergman and Streisand

Streisand worked with the couple throughout her career, recording more than 60 of their songs and dedicating an entire album, What Matters Most, to their work.

The Bergmans met her when she was 18 and working as a nightclub singer and soon became close friends.

""I just love their words, I love the sentiment, I love their exploration of love and relationships,"" Streisand told The Associated Press in 2011.

From paper cuts to eating mouldy tomato: Some of the ridiculous reasons people phoned 999 last year;Sunday 9 January 2022 17:14, UK;[];[];"Someone who had eaten a mouldy tomato and a person with a paper cut are among the most ridiculous 999 calls made to the emergency services last year.

Another caller phoned 999 because they got their plaster cast wet, while one person phoned emergency services because their mum had diarrhoea.

The Welsh Ambulance Service said of the 470,653 incidents recorded by the service in the last 12 months, nearly a quarter were non-essential - including someone inquiring about their medication.

In the face of unprecedented demand, the ambulance service is reminding people only to call 999 in a serious or life-threatening emergency.

Ambulance service asks patients to get lift to hospital due to pressure on staff

Chief executive Jason Killens said: ""Our ambulance service exists to help people who are seriously ill or injured, or where there is an immediate threat to their life.

""That's people who've stopped breathing, people with chest pain or breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness, choking, severe allergic reactions, catastrophic bleeding or someone who is having a stroke.

""People with something stuck in their ear still have a clinical need, but calling 999 for that is ill-judged when there are so many other ways to access more appropriate help.

""Non-essential calls represent nearly a quarter of our total 999 calls, and time spent dealing with these could be time spent helping someone in a life or death situation.""

What's your emergency? Here are some of the non-essential calls made to 999 last year. The earring Caller: Basically, I had a piercing a few weeks ago in my ear. Everything's been fine but last night I woke up and the piercing had gone. I can't find the piercing and it feels like it might be in my ear drum. Operator: Right, OK. Caller: Normally I would go to A&E; myself but I don't actually have any money. A lift to A&E; would be amazing. The mouldy tomato Caller: My neighbour came here and she gave me a sandwich, cheese and tomato. Anyway, I feel quite sick now. I looked at the tomatoes and there's mildew on them. Operator: OK, is that why you're requiring an ambulance? The plaster cast Caller: Oh, hi there. Basically, I've got my hand in a cast. It's been in there for three weeks and I've got it wet. Operator: OK. Caller: It's not an actual emergency, I just need to get to hospital. The paper cut Caller: I cut my arm, my arm's cut. Operator: How did you do that? Caller: I sliced it on a piece of paper. Operator: When did this happen? Caller: About half an hour ago. Operator: Is there any serious bleeding? Caller: No. A case of diarrhoea Operator: Tell me exactly what's happened. Caller: Basically, my mum drank apple vinegar but mixed it with water and lemon. Now she has diarrhoea.

As COVID-19 tightens its grip, the ambulance trust is asking the public to think about the many alternatives to 999.

Director of operations Lee Brooks added: ""Winter is traditionally our busiest period, and we also have a global pandemic to contend with.

""It's easy to make fun of the people who call 999 foolishly, but actually, these people do have a legitimate clinical need - they just don't know where to turn for it.

""We're asking the public to educate themselves on the NHS services available in their area, of which there are many.

Morrisons to scrap 'use by' dates on milk to help reduce food waste;Sunday 9 January 2022 18:36, UK;[];[];"Supermarket chain Morrisons will no longer feature a ""use by"" dates on most of its milk in a bid to reduce food waste.

From the end of January, the retailer will instead place ""best before"" dates on 90% of its own-brand milk and will encourage customers to use a sniff test to check quality.

The company believes the move will stop millions of pints of its own-brand milk from being thrown away every year.

Recycling charity Wrap says Morrisons is the first supermarket to announce the move.

Ian Goode, senior milk buyer at Morrisons, said: ""Wasted milk means wasted effort by our farmers and unnecessary carbon being released into the atmosphere.

Third most wasted product in UK

""Good quality well-kept milk has a good few days life after normal 'use by' dates - and we think it should be consumed, not tipped down the sink.

""So, we're taking a bold step today and asking customers to decide whether their milk is still good to drink.

""Generations before us have always used the sniff test - and I believe we can too.""

A sour aroma or curdled consistency is a sign the milk has been spoiled.

Milk is the third most wasted food and drink product in the UK, after potatoes and bread, with around 490 million pints tipped away every year, according to Wrap.

It also estimates 85 million pints of milk waste may be due to customers following ""use by"" labels despite research showing it can be used days after the date.

Marcus Gover, of Wrap, said: ""I am delighted that Morrisons is the first UK supermarket to take this important step to help reduce household food waste - it shows real leadership and we look forward to more retailers reviewing date labels on their products and taking action.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220109190724/http://news.sky.com/story/morrisons-to-scrap-use-by-dates-on-milk-to-help-reduce-food-waste-12512588;Category-3: environment
No-fly zone could be placed over Windsor Castle as security measures are reviewed;Sunday 9 January 2022 10:49, UK;['tom gillespie', '@tomgillespie1'];[];"A ""no-fly zone"" could be placed over Windsor Castle as police review security arrangements at the Queen's home in Berkshire.

An application for the restricted airspace order has been made and, if successful, would prevent aircrafts from flying up to 2,500ft above and 1.5 nautical miles around Windsor Castle.

The Metropolitan Police said the order would ""further enhance the security at what is an iconic location and keep the community living nearby safe"".

The force added that the order was applied for as part of its ongoing review into security arrangements and not because of any specific threat or intelligence.

On Christmas Day, a 19-year-old man was arrested while allegedly in possession of a crossbow at Windsor Castle. The Metropolitan Police said he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Officers are also reviewing a video that appears to show a masked figure in a dark hoodie holding a crossbow and addressing the camera with a distorted voice, saying they wanted to ""assassinate the Queen"" in a ""revenge"" mission.

The incident caused Home Secretary Priti Patel to order the Home Office to look at strengthening controls on the ownership of crossbows.

Photos posted online showing a rescue ladder extended up to the eighth floor, multiple limp children being given oxygen after being carried from the building, and evacuees with their faces covered in soot.

Firefighters ""found victims on every floor and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest"", Mr Nigro said.

""That is unprecedented in our city. We expect there to be numerous fatalities.""

He added that the fire originated in a duplex apartment, spanning the second and third floors.

Firefighters then found the door to the apartment open, which apparently allowed the flames to accelerate and spread smoke quickly.

Mr Nigro went on to describe the blaze as one of the worst fires to hit the city in recent memory, comparing it to the Happy Land social club incident in 1990, which killed 89 people.

Inspectors from the New York City Department of Buildings were also called to the scene, where they have been carrying out structural stability inspections and assisting firefighters.

People in the nearby area have been advised to close their windows to avoid smoke inhalation by the New York City Emergency Management department.

The fire is not believed to be suspicious in origin but the cause is under investigation.

Sarah Everard inquiry will inform government on policing and protection of women issues;Monday 10 January 2022 12:49, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];[];"An inquiry into Sarah Everard's murder by a serving police officer will inform the government on what policing issues need to be addressed and how the protection of women should be considered.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has revealed the terms of reference for the first phase of the inquiry investigating how serving Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was able to abduct, rape and murder the 33-year-old marketing executive in March last year.

The first phase of the inquiry will begin ""shortly"", the Home Office said, and it intends to finish it this year ""to ensure the Everard family get the answers they need"".

Image: The investigation will look into how Couzens was vetted by multiple police forces

It will look at:

• A timeline of Couzens' career and relevant incidents, including prior allegations of criminal behaviour and/or misconduct

Advertisement

• The circumstances and decision-making relating to his vetting and re-vetting, including whether any potential risks and/or red flags were missed

• Any other relevant matters arising from his transfers between forces

• His overall conduct - including non-disciplinary matters, his performance and training

• The extent to which any issues relating to his behaviour, particularly in relation to women, were known and raised by colleagues, (including professional standards and senior leaders)

• Any abuse of his police powers.

Ms Patel will use the findings of part one to consider what further, broader issues for policing need to be addressed as well as the protection of women that should be considered in the second part of the inquiry.

In November, Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini QC was appointed to chair the inquiry following consultation with Ms Everard's family.

The Home Office said the inquiry will analyse documentation from police forces Couzens was linked to, including the Met Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Kent Police, look at interviews and witness statements and also findings from investigations by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

Part one will be non-statutory so it can be established and carried out ""as swiftly and flexibly as possible"" to give Ms Everard's family answers quickly.

But Dame Elish will be able to convert it to a statutory inquiry if she needs to fulfil the terms of reference set out on Monday.

The Home Secretary said: ""I am determined to understand the failings that enabled a serving officer to commit such heinous crimes - we owe an explanation to Sarah's family and loved ones, and we need to do all in our power to prevent something like this from ever happening again.



""The terms of reference agreed today for the Angiolini Inquiry are vital and will produce learning and recommendations for policing and others.

Researchers hail new 'supermolecule' which has 'the potential to revolutionise science';Monday 10 January 2022 11:37, UK;['alexander martin', '@alexmartin'];[];"Researchers have created a ""powerful supermolecule"" in a ""tremendous"" interdisciplinary study, which they say has the potential to revolutionise science.

The new molecule has been described as a marriage between two crucial biomolecules that underpin life: DNA and peptides - despite these molecules rarely interacting in nature.

As a molecular tool, the discovery could be used for multiple purposes, including creating new medicines and artificial proteins that are less vulnerable than natural ones to being degraded.

Image: The research was published in the journal Nature Communication. Pic: Nature Communication

DNA and peptides

DNA is the basic structure for storing humanity's genetic information, while peptides are chains of amino acids. Both molecules are essential to life, but in nature they are rarely linked because they have opposite chirality.

Explaining chirality, co-author Professor Hanbin Mao, of Kent State University in the US, said: ""Imagine you want to stack your two hands by matching each finger while both palms face the same direction.

""You will find out it is impossible to do it. You can only do this if you can trick your two hands into having the same chirality.""

DNA and peptides usually don't interact because peptides are left-handed while DNA is right-handed in terms of their chirality.

But the new research has managed to change the chirality of peptides, unlocking a ""very powerful molecular tool,"" according to Dr Chenguang Lou, corresponding author and associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark.

""We're living in a chiral world,"" Dr Lou explained to Sky News, ""which means every biomolecule has its own chirality. We have proved that these two chiralities can interact, which has never been discovered before at the larger molecule level.""

The discovery ""may lead to the next generation of nanotechnology"", added Dr Lou, potentially empowering researchers to better detect and treat diseases.

By reshaping peptides, the team believes it could replace the amino acid skeleton that many proteins use.

""One of the possible directions following this half DNA, half peptide hybrid technology is to basically try to replace those peptide skeleton structures using only the nucleic acids,"" he added.

In doing so, these new proteins could be more robust to ultraviolet light, heat, and chemical reagents, and help scientists ""understand how we can create artificial enzymes as efficient as the natural ones"", Dr Lou said.

""Our next step will be to investigate whether it can be used to explain the cause of Alzheimer's disease in which malfunction peptides are culprits,"" added Professor Mao.

Dr Lou said the research was an interdisciplinary study due to his team's specialism in chemistry and the American team's expertise in biophysics.

""To push the research activity forward within the past one year and half, from my point of view, is quite tremendous,"" he added.

""In terms of the forthcoming applications, we would try to create more powerful molecular machines combining these two nano-world Lego bricks.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220110130752/http://news.sky.com/story/scientists-hail-new-supermolecule-which-has-the-potential-to-revolutionise-science-12512975;Category-6: science and technology

The men, now in their 40s and 50s, said Bennell, now 68, abused them when they were playing schoolboy football for teams he coached in North West England between 1979 and 1985.

They claimed that Bennell, who became a coach at Crewe Alexandra in 1985, was a scout for City during that time and argued the relationship between Bennell and City was ""one of employment or one akin to employment"".

All eight claimed damages for psychiatric injuries and six of them also claimed damages for loss of potential football earnings.

But Mr Justice Johnson ruled on Monday that the connection between the abuse and Bennell's relationship with City (referred to as MCFC) was insufficient to give rise to vicarious liability.

The judge said: ""The relationship gave Bennell the opportunity to commit the abuse, but MCFC had not entrusted the welfare of the claimants to Bennell.

""It follows that it has not been shown that MCFC is legally responsible for Bennell's acts of abuse. Each claim is therefore dismissed.""

Bennell is serving 34 years in prison after being found guilty in 2018 of a string of child sexual offences carried out between 1979 and 1991.

He gave evidence via video link from HMP Littlehey, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.

He told the judge that he had been a ""local scout"" for City between 1975 and 1979, but not between 1979 and 1985.

Rutland ichthyosaur: 10m-long 'sea dragon' skeleton is one of UK's 'greatest' dinosaur-era finds, experts say;Monday 10 January 2022 13:46, UK;[];[];"The skeleton of a dinosaur-era reptile found in the Midlands is being described by experts as ""one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history"".

Discovered at Rutland Water Nature Reserve, scientists estimate the fossil of the ichthyosaur - which are sometimes called sea dragons - is about 180 million years old.

Measuring around 10m (33ft) in length and with a skull weighing approximately one tonne, it is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind ever found in the UK.

It was discovered by Joe Davis of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust during the routine draining of a lagoon at Rutland Water, a reservoir, in February 2021.

Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: ""Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK.

""It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.""

Ichthyosaurs, which were marine reptiles, first appeared around 250 million years ago and went extinct 90 million years ago.

First discovered by Many Anning

Called sea dragons because they tended to have very large teeth and eyes, they were first discovered in the early 19th century by fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning, the subject of the recent Netflix film Ammonite.

Similar in shape to dolphins, the reptiles varied in size from 1-25m (3-82ft).

The remains of the creature were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September.

Two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s. However, the latest discovery is the first complete skeleton.

Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: ""I've been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over 20 years.

Four different COVID death tolls: How bad was mortality in 2021 compared to 2020?;Monday 10 January 2022 17:44, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Let's begin with a multiple choice question.

In the year 2021, a year in which the UK faced wave after wave of COVID-19, was mortality in England and Wales:

a) similar to the 2020 toll?

b) less bad than in 2020?

c) on a par with a severe flu epidemic or extremely cold winter?

Advertisement

d) one of the worst years in a century?

Before we get to the answer, let's go through some of the numbers. There are, you may recall, various different ways of measuring the mortality impact of COVID-19.

Going through this data is not an especially enjoyable task, but thankfully we have statisticians and actuaries who deal with such things on a regular basis.

And since we now have pretty much all the data we need to look at how 2021 compared with 2020, this feels like an opportune moment.

Four different death tolls

The numbers being produced by these statisticians and actuaries can sometimes look very different - consider the total death toll from COVID-19. There are actually at least four different, legitimate tolls.

The first is the official toll you hear about each day from the government, which it gets from the UK Health Security Agency. Technically speaking, this number counts anyone who has died within 28 days of a positive test as a COVID death. You probably heard it recently surpassed 150,000 people.

Image: There are four different, legitimate, death tolls

However, the Office for National Statistics has an entirely different estimate for the death toll. Its measure counts any death certificates where COVID is mentioned as a factor. This number now stands at 175,000.

Now, not all of these deaths are directly due to COVID. However, the ONS reckons that roughly 90% of them tend to be (with the remaining 10% being people who died primarily from other causes but with COVID-19 as an additional factor). On that basis, that suggests the overall toll is around 157,000.

Then there's another measure altogether, one which eschews the vagaries of diagnoses and PCR tests. This is to look at the total number of deaths across the country (from all causes) and compare this number to a ""normal"" period, which typically means the previous five-year average.

Excess deaths a 'more definitive measure'

This number - excess deaths - is often considered a more definitive measure of mortality over a given period and over the pandemic it is running at 151,000 - very close to the official death toll.

However, the complexity doesn't end there because there are also some shortcomings to excess death statistics too. One problem is that such numbers make no adjustment for the fact that as each year goes on this country gets bigger and its population ages - and the older and bigger a country's population, all else equal the more deaths one can expect in any given year - pandemic or not.

This is why actuaries prefer to age- and population-adjust this number, to come up with a standardised mortality rate.

This adjustment actually makes quite a big difference. For instance, age-adjusted excess deaths during the pandemic are not 151,000 but 120,000. And while the latest ONS numbers suggest quite high levels of excess deaths, there's good reason to believe this is in part because the numbers are not age-adjusted: do this adjustment and many of those apparent excess deaths fall away.

Each death toll differs

You see the issue here: one person's death toll can look quite different from another's. Except that pretty much every measure of mortality looks unusually high right now - at least compared with recent history.

So, back to that question at the start. Let's take the first multiple-choice answers: was 2021 similar or worse than 2020? It depends on which dataset you're looking at. If you're looking at the official death toll courtesy of the government dashboard, there were 74,000 deaths in 2021, which is not far short of 2020 (76,000).

But now let's look at age-adjusted excess deaths, as calculated by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and you get a very different picture: 47,000 deaths in 2021 versus 73,000 in 2020.

So it turns out both a) and b) are correct - depending on which numbers you're looking at.

Why the difference?

The most likely explanation is that the official government toll missed a lot of deaths in the early period of the pandemic; these deaths, many of them in care homes, were picked up by the excess death measure. In 2021 excess deaths were a lot lower than the official toll, in part because there was lower generalised mortality from other causes, such as flu.

How about c) and d)? Surely they couldn't both be correct too?

Well, let's have a look back through time, at changes in the age- and population-adjusted standardised mortality rate.

There is no definitive prism for this. Like gross domestic product, age-adjusted mortality tends to improve every year (or, to put it another way, people live a bit longer than they would have), so comparing absolute levels only tells you so much.

Image: This has been one of the worst periods for mortality in modern history

For instance, in 2021 about 1% of the population died (adjusted for age and population growth). That compares to 1.06% in 2020 and 0.94% in 2019. But, as recently as 2015, the mortality rate was 1.01% (in other words worse than 2021) and in 2008 it was 1.12%. So technically, mortality during the pandemic was actually lower than only a few years ago.

Except that this is not an especially meaningful statistic when you consider that such deteriorations are very, very rare. It's a little like saying we shouldn't pay any attention to recessions because, say, the absolute level of the economy following a recession like the one we had in 2008/9 only dropped back to the level it was a few years ago. It's technically true, but what matters here is not so much the level but the change.

The previous five-year average

So a better way of comparing mortality over time is to look at how the mortality rate compares to the previous five-year average.

Here we start to see that the current pandemic sticks out like a sore thumb. In 2020, the standardised mortality rate was 8.3% higher than in the preceding five years. That was the single biggest annual increase since 1940 - a year defined by WWII and the Blitz.

But how about 2021? In that year mortality increased by 1.8%. How unusual is that? Put it this way: in the past 50 years there were, save for this pandemic period, only two years when the mortality rate exceeded the previous five year average: in 2015 when it rose 0.4% and 1976 when it rose by 0.3%.

So while 2021 was less bad than 2020, it was still worse than any other year going back a long time. That said, there were a few other years in the post-war period where mortality increased more: the terrible winter of 1963 where temperatures dropped to the lowest levels in 200 years (2.5%) and the 1951 flu pandemic (8%), for instance.

So: on this basis 2021 was very bad, but not quite as bad as the 1951 flu or the blizzards of 1963. Except that, again, we're oversimplifying. For remember, the average against which 2021 is being measured is the previous five years; and since those five years include 2020, a very bad year for mortality, that means this number probably understates the comparable abnormality of death levels in 2021.

For instance, compare last year with the 2015-19 period and the increase in mortality is closer to 2.7%. So answer c) is sort of correct.

But still, it seems odd to look at 2021 in isolation given it followed such a severe year for deaths, so if we want a view of the death toll with more perspective we might do better to look at both 2020 and 2021, and here the verdict is quite clear.

Take an average of the mortality rate over these two years and we have never seen as big a deterioration since 1940/41. And you have to go back to WWI and the Spanish Flu to find another period of two or more years which were all far worse the preceding five-year average.

All answers correct

By now you've probably twigged that all of the answers are correct.

This has been one of the worst periods for mortality in modern history, but the scale of the tragedy depends on which numbers you choose.

But no numbers can do justice to the hundreds of thousands of tales of personal loss and misery across the country.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220110180731/http://news.sky.com/story/four-different-covid-death-tolls-how-bad-was-mortality-in-2021-compared-to-2020-12513215;Category-7: health
Energy bills: Windfall taxes have been tried before - but could such a move backfire?;Monday 10 January 2022 15:32, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"A Tory chancellor first saw the attraction of raiding North Sea profits more than 40 years ago but more recent experiences show the dangers and difficulties that might be associated with such a policy.

Energy bills: Windfall taxes have been tried before - but could such a move backfire?

The sector is already being taxed at twice the rate of a typical business

Windfall taxes are in the spotlight after Labour's call for one on North Sea oil and gas producers to support relief for hard-pressed households with their energy bills.

The proposal has been treated with scepticism because, with North Sea oil production already in decline, it would risk deterring investment in the sector.

Oil and Gas UK, the industry body, has pointed out the Treasury is already looking forward to an extra £3.5bn in taxes from the sector during the two years from last April as a result of higher oil and gas prices.

It also points out that oil and gas companies already pay an elevated rate of corporation tax at 30% on their upstream profits, compared with 19% for most other companies, while they also pay a ""supplementary charge"" of 10% - the latter measure being introduced by Gordon Brown, the former chancellor, 20 years ago.

So the sector is already being taxed at more than twice the rate that a typical business is.

There are also concerns that, should a windfall tax further deter investment in the North Sea, it would leave the UK even more heavily dependent on oil and gas imports from overseas at a time when greater self-sufficiency in energy is seen as desirable.

Nonetheless, there is a history of levying windfall taxes on businesses in this country.

And, although the latest proposal for one comes from Labour, it may surprise some people to know that some of the most prominent uses of the levy were by Margaret Thatcher's government.

Windfall tax raids from Sir Geoffrey Howe to Gordon Brown

Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mrs Thatcher's first chancellor, raised taxes on North Sea oil and gas producers in November 1980 in a move that was seen in some quarters at the time as a windfall tax.

The following spring, in his 1981 budget, Sir Geoffrey also, controversially, levied a windfall tax on the banks.

It was seen at the time as a move that risked leaving banks as under-capitalised and weakening their ability to lend.

But Sir Geoffrey argued that the tax was reasonable because, with interest rates having risen to 17% in 1979, the banks were benefiting (the spread between what a bank charges borrowers and pays depositors typically increases as interest rates rise).

As Mrs Thatcher herself noted in her memoir, the Downing Street Years: ""Naturally, the banks strongly opposed this, but the fact remained that they had made their large profits as a result of our policy of high interest rates rather than because of increased efficiency or better service to the customer.""

Sir Geoffrey ordered the banks to pay 2.5% of the money in their non-interest-bearing current account deposits, a move that raised £400m at the time, getting on for almost £2bn in today's money.

Image: Sir Geoffrey Howe levied a windfall tax on banks in 1981

The banks were furious, as indeed were some Conservative MPs, as it accounted for nearly a fifth of their annual profits.

However, when the banks subsequently raised their dividends by roughly a fifth, their argument was somewhat weakened.

The biggest windfall tax of all time, though, was announced by Mr Brown in the first budget of Tony Blair's government in 1997.

This was levied on more than 30 water, telecoms and energy companies, as well as the airport operator BAA, all of which had been privatised by the Conservatives during the previous 18 years and raised £5.2bn.

The justification at the time was that these businesses had been undervalued at the time they were sold by ministers.

That was almost unarguable - but there were criticisms at the time that the tax was still an inefficient instrument in terms of how it had been levied.

As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in a research paper later that year: ""As a tax on companies rather than on individuals, it can only capture some of those windfall gains: some of those who received windfall gains will bear the tax, while others who sold their shares before it was suggested will not, and the tax will also be borne by later investors who made no windfall gains at all.""

Image: The biggest windfall tax was announced by Gordon Brown in 1997

Since then, no government has sought to impose windfall taxes again, for good reason.

First is the fact that windfall taxes primarily hurt ordinary people.

Why governments have been wary of windfall taxes

Either those taxes are borne by the shareholders - which, via pensions, savings and insurance policies, will be all of us - or, if the company responds to a windfall tax by putting up its prices, by its customers.

Alternatively, they hit investment, as funds earmarked for capital expenditure projects are instead diverted into paying taxes.

In the case of a windfall tax on the North Sea, that might have an impact on the transition to net zero, since both BP and Shell - which still have interests in the UK Continental Shelf - are both seeking to deploy large sums in renewable and electrification projects.

There is also an argument that windfall taxes ultimately hurt consumers because they have the effect of reducing competition.

A company hit with a windfall tax on a particular activity has no option, in the short term, but to pay it.

Image: Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez imposed a windfall tax on power utilities last year

Another company that had been thinking of moving into that activity does not. So that hurts consumers.

Such taxes are also difficult to impose.

The latest to learn this is Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish prime minister, who in September last year imposed a windfall tax on power utilities - including Scottish Power's parent company Iberdrola - worth billions of euros because, he claimed, generators and suppliers were enjoying ""extraordinary benefits"" from higher wholesale prices.

The energy companies responded by warning customers that they would have to put up their prices as a result, prompting at least one steelmaker to warn that they would have to shut down.

The government subsequently rowed back on the proposal.

The episode highlighted the dangers and difficulties involved in trying to intervene in a market where prices are determined by global, not local, supply and demand.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220110180731/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-bills-windfall-taxes-have-been-tried-before-but-could-such-a-move-backfire-12513132;Category-2: business and economy
Deadly smoke spread in NYC apartment block fire due to open door, official reveals;Monday 10 January 2022 18:05, UK;[];[];"A New York City apartment block fire was more deadly because an open door allowed smoke to spread, the city's fire commissioner has said.

The blaze on the morning of 9 January in the Bronx was caused by a faulty electric heater, but fire chief Daniel Nigro said many of the victims were killed by smoke.

The heater had been in a second-storey unit but as the unit's residents fled the fire, a door was left open, Mr Nigro said, adding that this allowed the smoke to spread.

Image: Dozens of people were taken to hospital after the fire

He said the door had either been left open by residents or had failed to close automatically.

The flames damaged only a small part of the building but the smoke swept through the stairwells which, in the absence of fire escapes, meant many residents were cut off from their only means of escape.

Some were trapped in their homes, while many who did try to flee ""could not escape because of the volume of the smoke"", Mr Nigro said.

Firefighters found victims on every floor, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest, he added.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams told Good Morning America: ""There may have been a maintenance issue with this door and that is going to be part of the... ongoing investigation.""

Image: Some 200 firefighters battled the flames. Pic: AP

Some 17 people, including eight children, died in what has become the city's deadliest fire in three decades. The death toll was revised downwards by officials, who had previously reported it to be 19, including nine children.

Sixty-two people were injured and 30 of them were being treated in hospital on Monday, many in critical condition.

Large new apartment buildings in the city are required to have sprinkler systems and interior doors that close automatically to contain smoke.

It is not clear whether the same rules applied to the 120-unit Twin Parks North West building, which was constructed in 1972.

But Mr Adams confirmed the building's doors were meant to be self-closing.

The building had smoke alarms but several residents, including Luis Rosa, said they had initially ignored them because false alarms were so common.

Mr Rosa said that, by the time he opened the door of his 13th-floor apartment, the smoke was so thick he could not see down the hallway.

""So I said, OK, we can't run down the stairs because if we run down the stairs, we're going to end up suffocating,"" he said.

""All we could do was wait.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220110180731/http://news.sky.com/story/deadly-smoke-spread-in-nyc-apartment-block-fire-due-to-open-door-official-reveals-12513212;Category-3: environment
Bitcoin slides to five-month low amid wider sell-off;Monday 10 January 2022 16:43, UK;[];[];"Bitcoin has fallen below $40,000 (£29,480) to hit its lowest level since August amid a wider sell off in risk assets - including some of the tech sector's top names.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency briefly dipped to as low as $39,558 (£29,154) as it fell by more than 5% on Monday, adding to a slide seen last week.

Bitcoin had surged last year amid growing demand from mainstream investors, and hit a record high of $69,000 (£50,854) in November.

Image: Bitcoin one-day price chart 10/1/22

That was despite regulatory curbs, particularly from China, and continuing warnings from authorities globally about the risks involved in such investments.

But cryptocurrencies have been caught up in selling pressure on risk assets at the start of this year, which is linked to expectations about the pace of interest rate rises in the US.

Bitcoin's recent downturn has also partly been linked to unrest in Kazakhstan, which is the world's second-biggest location for so-called Bitcoin ""mining"", the energy-sapping computer process by which the tokens can be harvested.

Wider stock markets were also down on Monday, notably among US-listed tech firms - with the Nasdaq off by more than 2%.

Apple was off by 2% and Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, fell nearly 5%.

Amazon was down by more than 3%, with electric carmaker Tesla off 2%.

Boris Johnson and Carrie Johnson attended 'bring your own booze' event in No 10 garden during first coronavirus lockdown;Monday 10 January 2022 20:19, UK;['greg heffer', '@gregheffer'];[];"The prime minister and his wife Carrie were among around 40 people to attend a drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the UK's first national COVID lockdown, Sky News understands.

In what has been revealed to have been a ""bring your own booze"" event on 20 May 2020, a Downing Street figure said both Mr Johnson and his then fiancee were present.

The families of those who have died during the coronavirus pandemic reacted with fury at the latest revelations in the Number 10 ""partygate"" row, with one woman describing how the gathering was held on the same day her father's death cerfiticate was signed.

She also described how she ""feels sick"" that Mr Johnson later told her in person that he had ""done everything he could"" to protect people such as her father during the COVID crisis.

Image: Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie, pictured during last year's G7 summit, both attended a Downing Street drinks event in May 2020

A Whitehall investigation is already underway into multiple allegations of coronavirus rule-breaking in both Number 10 and other government buildings, which was prompted by initial claims of Christmas parties in Downing Street in 2020.

Advertisement

The inquiry has since been widened to include two alleged events on 15 and 20 May, the latter of which was initially revealed by Dominic Cummings - the prime minister's estranged former chief adviser.

Leaked email reveals 'socially distanced drinks' invite

A leaked email has now emerged from Martin Reynolds - a key aide to Boris Johnson - inviting staff to ""make the most of the lovely weather"" with ""some socially distanced drinks"".

According to ITV News, who obtained the email, Mr Reynolds' message on 20 May was sent to more than 100 employees in Number 10, including the prime minister's advisers, speechwriters and door staff.

The around 40 attendees are reported to have gathered in the garden that evening to eat picnic food and drink.

At the time, Britons had only recently been allowed to meet with one person from another household outside as long as they remained two metres apart.

Mixing with multiple households was still banned.

On 20 May 2020, 363 more people were announced to have died after testing positive for coronavirus.

Oliver Dowden, then culture secretary, used a Downing Street news conference that day to tell the public that ""the vast majority of people"" should be ""staying at home as much as possible"".

""Normal life as we have known it is still a long way off, and the path to get there is a narrow one,"" he said.

On the same day, the Metropolitan Police posted a tweet to urge people to ""stay alert"" to the threat of COVID.

The force reminded people they could only enjoy being outside if they were on their own, with people they live with, or on their own with one other person from a different household.

'Bring your own booze!'

The leaked email from Mr Reynolds to Number 10 staff states: ""Hi all,

""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of this lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening.

""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!

""Martin.""

Using his nickname of ""the trolley"" for Mr Johnson, Mr Cummings on Monday posted on Twitter that the prime minister ""was there"" at the 20 May event.

Mr Cummings has previously claimed, in a blogpost last week, that a photograph of himself, the prime minister, Mrs Johnson with the couple's newborn baby, and Mr Reynolds from 15 May 2020 - another alleged Number 10 social event - was not an example of rule breaking but was instead the continuation of a Number 10 meeting.

The image, published by the Guardian last month, appears to show the group enjoying wine and cheese as they sit at a table, while other groups are pictured also seemingly enjoying drinks in the Downing Street garden.

However, Mr Cummings also suggested in his blogpost that the 20 May event was against COVID rules and should be investigated.

PM's key aide 'has to be held accountable'

Doubts had already been cast over Mr Reynolds' position in Number 10 following the initial claims of an event on 20 May.

Weekend newspaper reports suggested Mr Reynolds, the prime minister's principal private secretary, was being lined up as a ""fall guy"" amid the ""partygate"" row.

A senior government source told Sky News: ""Reynolds job was to protect staff who were looking to him to lead them through something nobody had ever done before. This is just a perfect example of how he failed at it.

""The public are right to be outraged at the 'one rule for them, one rule for us'.

""Some people in Number 10 felt uncomfortable about it at the time. But the truth is nobody ever got to grips with working in Number 10 while the rest of the country were made to work from home.

""Reynolds didn't protect people from the spread of COVID in the building and he and others didn't think through the consequences of those actions.

""He was in charge of it all, he has to be held accountable for it.""

'It makes me feel sick to think about it', says daughter of COVID victim

Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, revealed how her 55-year-old father - a ""fit and healthy key worker"" - died four days before the 20 May drinks event in Downing Street.

""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was ok?,"" she said.

""Could there be a more disgraceful example of 'one rule for them, and another rule for the rest of us'?

To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime Mminister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died.

""He told me he had 'done everything he could' to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed.

""It makes me feel sick to think about it.""

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us.

""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates.

""At the time this party took place, key workers on the frontline were working round the clock to keep us all safe, people suffered loneliness and loss in unimaginably tough circumstances and for the majority of the country our freedom was limited to a daily walk.""

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This is yet more evidence that while the vast majority of people were sticking to the rules, those in Number 10 were breaking them.



""It is a kick in the teeth for everyone who has sacrificed so much during the pandemic, from those who weren't able to visit loved ones in hospital to nurses left wearing binbags as PPE.""

No comment from Number 10 as inquiry continues

Number 10 would not comment on the leaked email at a time when the inquiry into multiple allegations of COVID rule-breaking in Downing Street and other government buildings is still ongoing.

The investigation is being led by senior civil servant Sue Gray.

Earlier on Monday, the prime minister refused to answer a question about whether he and his wife attended a Downing Street party on 20 May.

The company, which employs more than 10,000 people in the UK, said that unvaccinated employees who test positive will receive full company sick pay, which is higher than the statutory level.

But staff who are vaccinated - or unvaccinated due to mitigating circumstances which could include pregnancy or other medical grounds - will receive full pay if they are off for COVID-related reasons.

A spokesperson said: ""We know this is a highly emotive topic and we appreciate there are many unique circumstances.

""As such, all will be considered on a case by case basis.""

The policy, which took effect in September, was first reported by the Mail on Sunday.

It comes as Wessex Water revealed that it was taking a similar approach from this week.

The company said that any employee who has not had at least one COVID-19 vaccination - without a valid medical reason - or does not have a confirmed appointment for a jab would only receive statutory sick pay if required to self-isolate due to contact with a person who has tested positive.

Wessex Water, which serves 2.8 million customers across the south west of England, employs more than 2,500 people.

A spokesperson said: ""The vast majority of our workforce has been vaccinated and it's important as a company providing essential services with key worker employees, the remainder get vaccinated to protect themselves.""

The company said absences due to COVID had doubled with almost 4% of the workforce affected last week.

Robert Durst: Infamous murderer and millionaire real estate heir who featured in The Jinx documentary dies in prison;Monday 10 January 2022 20:08, UK;[];[];"Robert Durst, the convicted murderer, suspected serial killer and wealthy real estate heir, has died in prison.

The 78-year-old was serving a life sentence.

Durst died in a state prison hospital facility in Stockton, his lawyer Chip Lewis said.

Image: Durst's trial was put on hold for 14 months due to the pandemic

He said it was from natural causes due to a number of health issues.

Durst was convicted in September of shooting Susan Berman at point-blank range in 2000 at her Los Angeles home, before being sentenced to life in prison last October.

He was admitted to hospital with COVID two days later, his trial attorney Dick DeGuerin said.

Caught confessing on tape

Durst's trial - which began in March 2020 but was adjourned for 14 months due to the coronavirus pandemic - came six years after Durst's apparent confession to multiple killings in the HBO TV series The Jinx.

Durst had still been wearing a live microphone after his interview and was heard saying to himself in the bathroom: ""What the hell did I do? ... Killed them all, of course"".

Although these quotes were later revealed to have been manipulated for dramatic effect, he was arrested on the eve of the final episode.

Image: Durst was charged only with the murder of his friend Susan Berman in 2000. Pic: AP

While Durst was only on trial for killing Ms Berman, prosecutors believe he murdered two others - his wife, Kathleen McCormack in 1982, and a neighbour in Texas who discovered his identity while he was hiding from police.

On the run

Durst met Kathie in 1971 and the two married on his 30th birthday in 1973.

In January 1982, she went missing after receiving a call from Durst to return to their home in South Salem. He claimed he had last seen her the previous day and would divorce her eight years later, claiming spousal abandonment.

He went on the run in late 2000 after police re-opened the investigation into his wife's disappearance, renting an apartment in Galveston, and disguising himself as a mute woman.

In 2001, the body parts of neighbour Morris Black began washing up in Galveston Bay.

He was never charged in the disappearance of his wife, a 29-year-old medical student, but was tried and acquitted for the murder of Texas neighbour Morris Black in 2001, claiming it had been self-defense.

He served three years in prison for violating his bail and ""evidence tampering"" in relation to the dismemberment of Mr Black's body.

2020 murder trial

At his trial, prosecutors claimed Ms Berman had given him a false alibi in relation to the disappearance of his wife.

They alleged he killed Ms Berman to prevent her revealing this to the police.

He was suffering from bladder cancer and his health deteriorated during the trial. He was escorted into court in a wheelchair wearing prison clothing because, his attorneys said, he was unable to change.

Believed to be worth $100m (£73m), Durst is the grandson of Joseph Durst, who founded the Durst Organisation, one of Manhattan's largest commercial property firms.

He became a developer in the family business, but his father made his younger brother, and rival, Douglas head of the Durst Organisation in 1992.

In October last year, while serving life without parole, he was finally charged with the murder of Kathie.

""Our priority is the safety of those involved which includes residents who live within the cordon's perimeter.""

One resident, who lives 10 doors down from the property, told Sky News about 20 armed police arrived at the scene at 8am on Monday morning.

COVID-19: Restrictions on outdoor events in Scotland to be lifted from Monday;Tuesday 11 January 2022 14:48, UK;[];[];"COVID restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland will be lifted from Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.

Since Boxing Day there has been a limit of 500 people at outdoor events.

Lifting the cap will allow football fans to return to Scottish Premiership matches next week, while Six Nations fixtures at Murrayfield will go ahead with full attendance next month.

Ms Sturgeon said it was ""reasonable and right to be hopeful"" about the country's latest COVID data, but added it was ""prudent to remain careful and cautious"".

The first minister said the COVID certification scheme will remain in place for these and other events and venues previously covered, but with two important changes:

Organisers of large events of 1,000 or more people should check the certification status of at least 50% of attendees rather than the current 20%

From Monday, the requirement to be fully vaccinated for the purposes of corporate certification will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago

Ms Sturgeon added that it will also be possible to order updated paper and PDF copies of vaccination status, which are valid for three months.

And it will still be possible to gain admission to events and venues covered by the certification scheme by providing proof of a recent negative lateral flow test.

""I hope this will allow us to lift the other protective measures limits on indoor live events, table service and hospitality, and distancing in indoor public places from 24 January,"" she said, adding she would confirm this in a statement next week.

She also said that the Scottish government would continue to consider if the vaccine passport scheme should be extended to include other venues.

Limiting social interaction

On current measures, Ms Sturgeon said that the requirement to face coverings in indoor public places and to work from home when possible ""will remain in place for now"".

She said that while the Scottish government is not urging people to cut all social interaction due to mental health and wellbeing reasons, trying to limit it is a ""sensible step at this stage"".

""We will be advising the general public to try to limit contact with people in other households and in particular to limit the number of households in any indoor gathering to a maximum of three.""

The measures were imposed by the Scottish government in a bid to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220111160707/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-restrictions-on-outdoor-events-in-scotland-to-be-lifted-from-monday-12513696;Category-3: environment

Regulator investigates £1.9bn National Express-Stagecoach merger;Wednesday 26 January 2022 09:09, UK;[];[];"The National Express takeover of Stagecoach is facing an investigation by the competition regulator, it has been announced.

The all-share deal, which would value the combined business at about £1.9bn, was confirmed last month.

It would bring together the country's biggest bus and coach operator in Stagecoach, which includes the Megabus brand in its stable, and National Express which is best known for its long-distance UK coach services.

It also has operations abroad in the US, Spain and Germany.

The pair indicated the tie-up would result in cost savings and provide new growth opportunities as they recover from the huge hit to business inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic that saw demand for travel collapse.

But they also anticipated at the time of the deal that the merger would attract the interest of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

The watchdog said on Wednesday that it had served a so-called initial enforcement order, which stops the companies from fully combining while it considers whether the deal would be harmful.

Stagecoach said the CMA's action would delay the planned sale of the marketing, retail and customer service operations of its inter-city coach businesses to ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited.

It added that the merger partners continued to believe that the sell-off would be a ""comprehensive solution to any competition concerns that might arise"" from their overlapping coach operations.

Syria: US-backed forces take control of prison attacked by IS militants;Wednesday 26 January 2022 14:46, UK;[];[];"Kurdish-led forces have taken full control of al-Sina'a prison in Syria's north-eastern city of Hasaka, ending a week-long assault by extremists on the detention facility.

Spokesman Farhad Shami said all Islamic State militants had surrendered hours after 500 had given themselves up following clashes in some buildings.

It comes a week after a breakout by Islamic State prisoners left dozens dead, as IS fighters used vehicles and explosives to ram through the prison walls before entering the building with heavy machine guns.

There has been no update yet on the 850 children and minors - who lived alongside the nearly 5,000 prisoners in the overcrowded jail - that have been caught in the crossfire.

The UN and international aid organisations have expressed concern for their lives.

""It's very hard to even imagine what atrocities these children are witnessing,"" Juliette Touma, from UNICEF, said previously.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), aided by US troops, began to storm the prison on Monday.

British Special Forces and the US military had been involved in the operation to retake the prison, sources told Sky earlier this week.

Al-Sina'a is the largest prison facility where the SDF has kept thousands of detainees. The relatives of many say they were arrested on flimsy charges for resisting the SDF's forced conscription.

The Kurdish-led militia denies this.

COVID-19: US hospital rejects man for heart transplant because he is not vaccinated;Wednesday 26 January 2022 12:23, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"An American hospital has rejected a patient for a heart transplant because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, his family has said.

DJ Ferguson, 31, has spent almost 50 days in hospital, and is now in end-stage heart failure and needs a transplant to survive.

Brigham and Women's Hospital policy states he is no longer eligible because he hasn't received a coronavirus vaccination - something his family said he refuses to do.

COVID live updates: New variant could prolong current wave, experts warn

Image: Mr Ferguson has spent 50 days in the hospital

""The transplant board will not actively list him due to his vaccination status,"" Mr Ferguson's family said on a GoFundMe charity fundraising page.

His family is concerned the vaccine could cause his heart to swell, and put him at ""extremely high risk of sudden death"".

""We're being pressured to choose a shot that could kill him. This is not just a political issue,"" they added.

""People need to have a choice! People need to realize that there ARE others out there that are at high risk while receiving this shot, and it COULD kill them.""

The father-of-two, who has another child on the way, suffers from a hereditary heart issue and was first taken to hospital on Thanksgiving weekend in November with suspected pneumonia.

""Brigham told us he has to have the vaccine to accept a heart,"" his mother Tracey Ferguson said.

""He is not an anti-vaxx person. He has all of his vaccines, but there are some adverse reactions given his condition, and he is a man, he made his decision.""

She added: ""He said to the doctor, 'Are you really going to let me die over a shot?'

""All of my children, they are all vaccinated, he did his own homework, and made his own decision.""

His family has looked at transporting him to another hospital but said he is currently too sick to be moved.

Brigham and Women's Hospital said it couldn't comment on individual patients due to US laws.

""Our Mass General Brigham healthcare system requires several CDC-recommended vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine, and lifestyle behaviours for transplant candidates to create both the best chance for a successful operation and to optimize the patient's survival after transplantation, given that their immune system is drastically suppressed,"" the hospital said in a statement.

Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS News the vaccine was necessary for this kind of procedure.

""Post any transplant, kidney, heart, whatever, your immune system is shut off,"" he said.

""The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, COVID could kill you. The organs are scarce, we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126150924/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-us-hospital-rejects-man-for-heart-transplant-because-he-is-not-vaccinated-12525614;Category-7: health

Big vote of confidence in the City of London as Citi dismisses Brexit threat;Wednesday 26 January 2022 14:22, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"They are the twin questions with which City executives have been grappling for some time.

The first concerns the extent to which Brexit might reduce London's influence and status as a global financial services centre.

The second, raised during the pandemic, concerns the extent to which employees in the financial services sector will want to return to the office once life returns to normal.

Wednesday morning saw Citi, one of the world's biggest banks, give its answers to those questions.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:12 Citi backs City's future with major investment

In an emphatic vote of confidence in both London as a financial centre and in the future of office working, the Wall Street giant - which employs 9,000 people in the capital and a further 3,200 in Belfast - announced a major refurbishment of its headquarters in Canary Wharf.

Advertisement

The amount it is spending has not been disclosed but is expected to run into nine figures.

The lender bought the 200-metre high, 42-storey tower at 25 Canada Square in Canary Wharf for £1.2bn in 2019 which, at the time, it said was a demonstration of its commitment to London as its headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

David Livingstone, Citi's EMEA chief executive, told Sky News the latest investment underlined the bank's confidence that London would remain one of the world's preeminent international financial centres.

He said: ""There are some background elements which never go away. London's time zone position between Asia and the Americas.

""The rule of law, as well as English law, which is a very important component to international commerce.

""But there's also the regulatory environment which is remains a strong principles-based environment which we think, post-Brexit, will forge its own particular way which will be positive for the UK.

""But the thing you can't get away from is the talent - and it's the talent which is home-grown, it's the talent that wants to come to work in London, and we only see that as being a continuing element of why London is such a fantastic place to build not just a major operation, but also our headquarters for the entire region.""

Image: Mr Livingstone was adamant that Brexit had not made recruitment more difficult

Mr Livingstone said Citi had not had difficulties, since the UK left the EU, in trying to persuade people from continental Europe to work in London or in overcoming tougher restrictions around migration and work permits.

He added: ""It's a good question and one that we ask - and have been asked by the UK authorities - what can we do to make sure that those processes are as smooth as possible?

""But no, we haven't seen a major deterioration in our ability to move people from the UK, to the EU, or in the other way.""

Mr Livingstone, who took charge of Citi's EMEA operations in February 2019, said the bank had only moved a few hundred roles to Europe following Brexit but stressed Citi was currently increasing its UK headcount.

He added: ""There have been some roles which have moved, but it's been more that we have grown new roles in Paris, in Frankfurt, in Dublin as part of building the capabilities in our European operations that we need.""

As important to Mr Livingstone, who worked in mergers and acquisitions for Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Credit Suisse in Sydney, Singapore and New York as well as London before joining Citi, are the sustainability credentials of the refurbishment.

The entire tower will be gutted, requiring Citi's employees to temporarily relocate to neighbouring offices in Canary Wharf, so that it can be refitted both to the latest environmental standards and in a way that incorporates changing working practices.

Image: Citi envisages the refit of its Canary Wharf tower will better reflect the needs of workers and the planet

Refurbishing rather than demolishing the 21-year old tower, which is the UK's 11th-tallest building, will avoid the release of some 100,000 tonnes of embedded carbon - the equivalent of running 21,739 family cars for a year.

The new tower will consume substantially less energy and water and is envisaged as being zero carbon.

Mr Livingstone said the refurbishment would involve the creation of more shared spaces where colleagues could come together and would also include flexible working areas - employees are thought unlikely to want to work in the office for five days a week in future - and well-being zones.

He added: ""We're a business of energy and ideas and we thrive on bringing people physically together.""

Citi's vote of confidence in London can be seen in the broader context of what the bank is doing at group level.

Under its Scottish-born chief executive, Jane Fraser, Citi has been streamlining its operations around the world and particularly in the field of consumer banking. Last week it said it would exit consumer banking in Mexico and recently announced the sale of its retail operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, having five months ago sold its retail banking operations in Mr Livingstone's native Australia for A$1.2bn (£637m) to National Australia Bank.

It followed this just before Christmas with the sale of its consumer banking arm in the Philippines to local lender UnionBank for PHP45.3bn (£673m).

As Citi retrenches from consumer banking operations, the aim is to free up capital that can be deployed in other areas, such as wealth management and in wholesale banking. That would appear to place greater emphasis on Citi's EMEA operations, which were already largely focused on those activities.

Mr Livingstone said: ""Primarily in the Europe, Middle East Africa region, we were already [focused on] wholesale activities, so our markets, our banking, our treasury trade services, private banking, and so on, so that was the predominant mix of our activities and footprint.

""We're happy with the choices that we're making with regard to the to the strategy. One of the important components that we have increased is our presence in wealth, and wealth management generally - that's an area that we…are very focused on here.""

Citi is the latest Wall Street banking giant to announce ambitious office plans in London.

JP Morgan kicked things off when, in 2012, it spent £495m on the former Lehman Brothers European headquarters at 25 Bank Street in Canary Wharf.

Then, in 2019, Goldman Sachs completed its new £1.1bn home in Plumtree Court, in Farringdon, as it relocated from its two former sites on nearby Fleet Street.

These moves have highlighted the evolving nature of the financial services sector - and the buildings that house them - in London.

They also, hopefully, go some way to showing that talk of London's decline, post-Brexit, was exaggerated.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126170817/http://news.sky.com/story/big-vote-of-confidence-in-the-city-of-london-as-citi-dismisses-brexit-threat-12525845;Category-2: business and economy
Walker rescued from cliff face was 'finger's grip' away from plunging to his death in Scotland;Wednesday 26 January 2022 16:08, UK;[];[];"A walker who was rescued from the side of a steep and crumbling cliff was a ""finger's grip"" away from plunging to almost certain death, according to the coastguard.

The man was clinging on in darkness about 10 metres (32ft) from the top at Seaton Cliffs, Arbroath, and in a precarious position as he was slipping with a ""long way to fall"".

His companion called 999 and coastguard teams from Arbroath, Dundee and Stonehaven along with RNLI lifeboats and a helicopter were sent to the scene at Dickmont's Den.

Image: The man was about 10 metres (32ft) from the top of the cliff and slipping when he was rescued

The crews found the walker cold and tired and in a ""desperate situation"".

However, a helicopter rescue was deemed too dangerous due to the downdraft, which could have dislodged the man from his position.

So the teams carried out the successful but ""tough"" rescue from the cliff top using ropes in what was a ""close call"".

The man had been out on a ""nice winter walk"" which ""turned sour"" as he found himself gripping on for his life on Sunday.

But he and his companion had been ""well prepared with the right gear"" and fully charged mobile phones.

Cliffs in the area are 'particularly loose'

David Kerr, senior coastal operations officer at Angus and Dundee coastguard, said: ""It was a close call - he was struggling to hold on, and it was a long way to fall. The teams knew they had to get to him and quickly.

""It was a tough rope rescue in darkness on a steep and crumbling cliff.

""It goes to show how quickly a nice winter walk can turn sour, one decision and suddenly the man found himself gripping on for life. It really can happen that easily and to anyone.

""They were well prepared with the right gear and fully charged mobile phones - they did the right thing in calling for help.""

He warned: ""The cliffs in that area are particularly loose and it can be very easy to end up in a difficult situation.

Cost of living: Oil hits $90 a barrel for first time since October 2014;Wednesday 26 January 2022 17:16, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Oil has hit $90 a barrel for the first time since October 2014 on latest worries about tight supply and tensions in Europe in the Middle East.

The Brent crude benchmark was up by 2% on Wednesday - with the increase likely to add to the cost of living headache facing UK consumers as it feeds through to petrol and diesel prices.

Demand for oil plunged during lockdowns leading the price to slump below $20 a barrel in 2020 but it has since rallied sharply with the return of economic activity.

Image: The oil price has bounced back after a pandemic-induced slump in 2020

Now, tensions over Russia and Ukraine, and the threat of sanctions should conflict break out, are adding to worries over supply.

A new attack by Houthi rebels on the United Arab Emirates this week, adding to turmoil in that country, has also contributed.

Meanwhile, the US is more than a million barrels short of its record level of daily oil output and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, is struggling to meet monthly production targets that were hiked following sharp cuts in 2020.

At the same time, wholesale gas prices have been hovering above 200p a therm in recent days - well below the record highs of more than 400p set last December but several times higher than the typical level of around 50p over recent years.

The gas price surge is likely to feed through to another sharp rise in household energy bills in the spring, adding to UK inflation already running at a near-30 year high.

An increase in petrol prices to record levels have also been part of the sharp increase in the cost of living for British households.

The latest oil rally will not immediately change prices at the pumps but increases do tend to filter through to motorists.

Brent crude's bounce on Wednesday delivered a share price boost for London-listed energy giants BP and Shell - staple holdings of many UK pension funds - as they climbed by 3.8% and 5.4% respectively.

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Consumers are belting up and bracing themselves for a fresh squeeze in the cost of living as a jump in the oil price is set to see forecourt prices ticking up again.

""With price rises coming from all directions, the prospect of filling up at the pumps becoming yet more expensive will be hard to swallow, especially for commuters steeling themselves for the return to the office as plan B restrictions are lifted.

""Fresh financial pain in terms of rising prices at the pumps could still be to come, with forecasts piling up that oil will go above $100 dollars a barrel this year, and reach as much as $120 dollars.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126190904/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-oil-hits-90-a-barrel-for-first-time-since-october-2014-12525977;Category-2: business and economy
Cost of living: Food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe welcomes inflation data shake-up;Wednesday 26 January 2022 19:13, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Official statisticians are to shake up the way they collect and widen how they present inflation data amid concerns that cost of living headlines fail to reflect the squeeze being felt by the worst off.

The announcement by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) comes as food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe has been drawing attention to the impact of price rises on poorer families.

From later this week, the ONS will resume the publication of a breakdown of how inflation affects different income groups.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 Why are your bills going up?

In the longer term, it said it was also developing ""radical new plans"" to increase the number of price points it measures each month from 180,000 to hundreds of millions.

Ms Monroe tweeted: ""Delighted to be able to tell you that the ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances.""

Latest official figures showed inflation hit 5.4%, the highest level since March 1992, in December.

But Ms Monroe took to social media last week to express anger that the measure ""grossly underestimates the real cost of inflation as it happens to people with the least"".

She gave examples of the prices of some of the cheapest available staple products such as pasta, rice and peanut butter at her local supermarket being in some cases more than double what they were last year.

Mike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, acknowledged in a blog post that ""everyone has their own personal inflation rate"", with some, for example, spending a larger proportion of their income on gas and electricity and others on petrol.

He said that in the past, analysis by the agency breaking down the impact of inflation in different ways, such as by income group or whether people own or rent their properties, had shown only small differences - though this has not always been the case.

During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, inflation was higher for low income households, he said.

This detailed analysis was suspended during the pandemic because many items were temporarily available but ""given the level of interest in the cost of living and inflation"" the ONS will restart the data series from this Friday, Mr Hardie said.

In the future, it will widen the number of price points measured using data sent directly from supermarket checkouts, he added.

""This will mean we won't just include one apple in a shop - picked to be representative based on shelf space and market intelligence - but how much every apple costs, and how many of each type were purchased, in many more shops in every area of the country.

""While it will not show us what each consumer has bought… it will show exactly what has been sold and for how much, giving us even more detail on how inflation is affecting UK households.""

An ONS spokesperson said: ""We will continue to produce our headline inflation statistics, which are long running and follow international best practice.

""We are committed to ensuring that our statistics are relevant and continue to meet user needs.

""As part of this we are restarting publication of inflation broken down according to how much income you earn.

""We are continuing with longer-term plans to improve our inflation figures by including data from supermarket checkouts which will help us understand people's experience of inflation in a much more detailed way.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126200848/https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-food-poverty-campaigner-jack-monroe-welcomes-inflation-data-shake-up-12526054;Category-2: business and economy
UK car production hits 65-year low as chip shortages pile pressure on COVID-battered sector;Thursday 27 January 2022 03:05, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"UK car production plunged to its lowest level since 1956 last year as a shortage of semiconductor chips piled further pressure on an industry battered by the pandemic, new figures show.

The impact of the shortages - which is being experienced by manufacturers worldwide - is expected to reduce later this year but continue to have some effect even into 2023.

If that is resolved the industry still faces a growing challenge from a surge in energy costs of up to 70%, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)

Image: Mike Hawes said it was a dismal year for the sector

Just 859,575 vehicles rolled off UK production lines in 2021, down by about 60,000 or 6.7% from 2020 and 34% below pre-pandemic levels, the SMMT said

Mike Hawes, the industry body's chief executive, said it was ""a dismal year"".

""The impact of the semiconductors really hit home in the last quarter of last year,"" he said.

""However there is more optimism about 2022, that things will improve.""

The chip shortage will continue to make life ""tough"" in the first half of 2022 but should then ease, Mr Hawes added.

A lack of chips, thanks to pandemic-related shutdowns in the Far East, meant factories had to slow down or even stop production.

The chips form a critical part of modern car making, with each vehicle typically having 1,500 to 3,000 - but there was also disruption to the import of other components.

Staff shortages due to COVID-19 self-isolation and showroom closures during lockdowns took their toll too, as did the permanent shutdown of the Honda car plant in Swindon during the summer, which accounted for about a quarter of the annual decline.

The semiconductor shortage is thought to have knocked 100,000 off total volumes and early estimates suggest it could mean a smaller but still significant 50,000 hit for this year.

Car manufacturing numbers are however expected to see a recovery overall and hit over a million units in 2022.

But it is a far cry from the 1.5 million plus total seen in 2017, a high water mark for the industry in recent years - and a number that the SMMT admitted was unlikely to be reached again any time soon unless a major new factory opens or existing plants bump up production.

Its own forecasts suggest a 1.1 million vehicles being made in the UK by 2025.

Mr Hawes said it was ""not all doom and gloom"" with investment announcements - including at Nissan in Sunderland and Ford at Halewood - totalling £4.9bn last year, the highest since 2013 as the industry plays ""catch back"" after several years of uncertainty blamed on Brexit, according to Mr Hawes.

There was also an uptick for hybrid and electric production, now representing a quarter of the total.

Some manufacturers bucked the overall UK decline, with production of BMW-owned Mini in Oxford and the Toyota Corolla in Burnaston increasing compared with 2020.

But car makers, like other sectors, face additional challenges from surging energy costs - which could rise by 70%, with the industry not currently eligible for discounts given to so-called ""energy intensive users"" such as the steel sector.

If the semiconductor challenge can be resolved, energy prices will become ""the most immediate, pressing one"", Mr Hawes said.

Meanwhile Brexit has added to paperwork and could complicate the transition to battery electric vehicles because of complex ""rules of origin"" criteria applied to trade deals.

The vast majority of UK vehicles are built for export with Europe the biggest customer.

Mr Hawes admitted that if surging costs continue it ""will flow through to prices"" adding to pressure on consumers already struggling with inflation at a near-30 year high.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127044522/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-car-production-hits-65-year-low-as-chip-shortages-pile-pressure-on-covid-battered-sector-12525904;Category-2: business and economy
COVID-19: Limits on care home visitors removed as social care restrictions eased;Thursday 27 January 2022 07:24, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Limits on visitors in care homes will be lifted as restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the Omicron COVID variant in adult social care are eased.

From Monday 31 January, care home residents will be able to receive unlimited visitors while self-isolation periods will be cut from 14 days to 10 for those who do test positive for the virus.

Care homes will have to follow outbreak management rules for 14, rather than 28, days.

By Wednesday 16 February, care workers will be asked to take lateral flow tests before their shifts, replacing the current system of weekly PCR tests.

The move comes as government data shows 86.5% of care home residents have had their booster jab.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make, which is why we continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures.

""Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further allowing residents to see more of their loved ones.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127090742/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-limits-on-care-home-visitors-removed-as-social-care-restrictions-eased-12526296;Category-7: health
COVID crisis - are care homes now safer?;;[];[];"As coronavirus infections surged across the UK in early March, Mr Johnson laid bare the threat to the country in a sombre Downing Street news conference.

""Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,"" the prime minister said on 12 March.

A week later, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) authorised thousands of patients to be discharged from hospitals into care homes.

Guidance issued on 19 March urged NHS trusts to discharge patients from hospitals as soon as clinically possible. The idea was to free up 15,000 beds.

""Unless required to be in hospital… patients must not remain in an NHS bed,"" the guidance stated.

The trusts were told they could do this without testing the patients to see if they had coronavirus. Further guidance on 2 April said:

""Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home.""

But Sky News also learned at this time that care homes were being asked to take in people who had tested positive for coronavirus. The guidance added:

""Residents may also be admitted to a care home from a home setting. Some of these patients may have COVID-19 whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. All of these patients can be safely cared for in a care home if this guidance is followed.""

People working in the system were not convinced.

Care homes quickly expressed grave concerns over the policy. Many were already desperately overstretched and struggling with staff and equipment shortages.

Warberries Care Home in Devon was asked to take in coronavirus patients in April Warberries Care Home in Devon was asked to take in coronavirus patients in April

""Asking us to take COVID-19 positive patients is asking us to basically make out a suicide note for people in care,"" said Graham Greenway, the owner of one care home in Torquay.

Several councils threatened to withhold funding to help care homes deal with the coronavirus outbreak if they did not agree to take in COVID-19 patients.

Between mid-March and mid-April, about 25,000 patients were discharged from hospitals into care homes in England, the National Audit Office reported.

The House of Commons' own spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), would later describe the policy as ""an appalling error"".

It was not until 15 April that the government said all patients discharged from hospitals would be tested for coronavirus.

Many families of care home residents who died with COVID-19 believe the discharge policy cost lives.

Dr Cathy Gardner has launched a High Court challenge against the DHSC and NHS England. She alleges that the failure to introduce adequate measures to protect care home residents from coronavirus was ""one of the most egregious and devastating policy failures of recent times"".

Her 88-year-old father Michael Gibson died from ""probable COVID-19"" in an Oxfordshire care home on 3 April. The home had readmitted a former resident who had been in hospital and had not been tested for coronavirus.

""To know that this might have played a factor and the government might have contributed directly to my father's death is almost unbelievable,"" Dr Gardner said.

""It's so difficult to get my head around it. It makes me extremely angry.""

Sir James Eadie QC, representing the government, told a High Court hearing in November that the aim of the ""discharge requirement"" introduced in March was ""to ensure those who were medically fit to be discharged were being discharged to avoid that overwhelming"" the NHS.

""It is wrong to suggest it was being done without a care for the risk in care homes,"" he said.

""These risks were being subjected to continuing care and consideration.""

Kathleen Keenan, 84, died with COVID-19 after she went back to her care home following a positive test in hospital.

Her daughter Helen said: ""They were like fodder on the infantry line - 'just get rid of all of those, we're not saving them because we haven't got enough resources or time'.

""I can't do anything for my mum except honour her memory and ask for an apology for what happened to her, because she deserved far better than she got, and I don't want any other family to be in the same situation as we are and other families are. It's atrocious.""

A spokesperson for the NHS trust which runs Walsall Manor Hospital, where Ms Keenan had been discharged from, said it had contacted the care home to advise of her COVID-19 positive status ""and the home was happy for her to return, supporting her self-isolation"".



""At the time of Mrs Keenan's treatment there were no bed capacity issues within the trust,” the spokesperson added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127090742/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-crisis-are-care-homes-now-safer-12212234;Category-7: health

Global stock markets sink as sustained action to target inflation looms large;Thursday 27 January 2022 07:44, UK;[];[];"Stock market values have taken fright globally after the US central bank indicated it was to launch a concerted effort to tackle a surge in COVID-linked inflation.

The Federal Reserve placed financial markets - which have relied on its cheap stimulus cash for almost two years - on notice that interest rates were likely to start rising in a sustained fashion from March.

It also reaffirmed that its bond purchase programme was to end that month as attention turns from COVID crisis support to taming the pace of price rises.

US inflation, at 7% in December, is at its highest level for 40 years. It has surged globally, including in the UK, on the back of unprecedented spikes in energy costs and supply chain disruption.

While US markets had little time to react following the conclusion of Fed chair Jay Powell's news conference on Wednesday, futures were down by more than 1.5% on Thursday to build on late losses.

Stocks plunged in Asia overnight to a 15-month low with Japan's Nikkei diving by 3%.

European markets were tipped to slide by 3% at the open though IG Index forecast the FTSE 100 - which is less exposed to inflation risk stocks - to see a decline of 1.3%.

The prospect of rising US rates has driven Wall Street stocks from record highs so far this year with tech shares, seen as a greater risk in a higher inflationary environment, enduring the worst pain.

Amazon 'shuts down' scheme that paid warehouse workers for positive tweets;Thursday 27 January 2022 10:33, UK;[];[];"Amazon has reportedly closed down a scheme that paid staff ""ambassadors"" to paint a positive image of working in its warehouses on social media.

The campaign, which began in 2018 as the online retailer faced hostility over safety and conditions at its so-called fulfilment centres, was quietly stopped and all traces erased at the end of last year, according to the Financial Times.

The paper said that a number of sources at the company had confirmed the move though Amazon had refused to comment.

Senior executives, the newspaper said, were apparently unhappy with the scheme's poor reach.

It had also been the target of a number of spoof accounts which, the FT said, had given a false impression that ambassadors had gone rogue.

According to The Intercept, fulfilment centre ambassadors received training on how to leave ""no lie unchallenged"" and reply in a ""blunt"" but ""polite"" manner to what the company considered untruths posted by individuals on various platforms including Twitter.

Sky News has contacted Amazon for comment.

Amazon has faced allegations of poor working conditions at its warehouses since their conception and is currently facing a battle in the US over union rights.

In the UK, the GMB union has led a campaign against the company's treatment of workers, claiming last month that one thousand have been ""seriously injured"" at its sites since 2016.

Aldi has said face masks are now a ""personal choice"" when shopping in-store, but perspex screens and sanitising stations will remain in use.

Lidl said now face masks are no longer a legal requirement it would ""have signage in place"" remind customers that ""the government recommends that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces"". Staff will be allowed to individually decide if they wish to keep wearing a mask.

Music streaming investigation will examine market 'from creator to consumer';Thursday 27 January 2022 09:40, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The competition watchdog has launched a wide-ranging investigation into the music streaming market.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed last October an intention to examine the sector but was yet to determine the full scope of its inquiry.

It followed hot on the heels of a report by MPs the previous month that raised ""deep concerns"" about the position of major music companies in the streaming area - dominated by the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube - and ""meagre returns"" for artists.

The CMA said on Thursday that its study would ""examine the music streaming market, from creator to consumer, paying particular attention to the roles played by record labels and music streaming services.

""Streaming has changed the way we listen to music. In the UK, more than 80% of recorded music is now listened to via a streaming service rather than using traditional physical media like CDs and vinyl.

""Linking the creators making the music and the fans listening to it through a streaming service is a complex network of companies that help make, promote and distribute recorded music,"" it said.

The CMA said that part of its assessment of how well the market is working for audiences, it would consider whether innovation was being stifled and if any firms held excessive power.

""While focussing on potential harm to consumers, the CMA will also assess whether any lack of competition between music companies could affect the musicians, singers and songwriters whose interests are intertwined with those of music lovers.""

Last December the prime minister dismissed claims made by a former Foreign Office official that the government prioritised animals over people as ""complete nonsense"".

But new emails released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Afghanistan crisis, suggest Mr Johnson did personally authorise rescue efforts for pets and animals.

Moths

In his much-told moth joke, Cryer told the story of an unfaithful wife who hides her lover in the bedroom when her husband returns early from a business trip.

When the man is discovered naked, clapping the air in a cupboard, he claims to have been sent by the council to deal with a moth problem, suggesting they have eaten his clothes.

The 'ultimate' parrot joke

Cryer claimed his ultimate parrot joke was published in 2020 in The Oldie magazine. The joke describes a woman who purchases a parrot for only £5.

""Well, I must confess, it was brought up in a brothel,"" says the shopkeeper. ""And, to put it politely, it has quite an extensive vocabulary.""

""Never mind,"" says the woman. ""At that price, I'll take it.""

So she takes the parrot home, puts its cage in the living room and takes the cover off.

""New place - very nice,"" says the parrot.

Then the woman's two daughters walk in.

""New place, new girls - very nice,"" says the parrot.

Then the woman's husband walks in, and the parrot says, ""Oh hello, Keith!""

The cockerel

One of Cryer's first jokes told on-stage was about a man driving down a country lane who runs over a cockerel.

He goes to the farmhouse and knocks on the door.

A woman opens it and he says: ""I appear to have killed your cockerel. I'd like to replace him.'

She replies: ""Please yourself, the hens are round the back.""'";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127170957/http://news.sky.com/story/barry-cryers-best-jokes-throughout-the-years-12526687;Category-5: entertainment and culture

Apple shrugs off chip shortage hit to notch up record $124bn sales over Christmas quarter;Thursday 27 January 2022 23:01, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Apple has shrugged off the impact of chip shortages to deliver record quarterly sales of $123.9bn (£92.6bn) and said the constraints will start to ease.

The iPhone maker's revenues for the three months to Christmas were 11% higher than a year ago even though the shortages put a $6bn dent in the figure - something the company had previously warned about.

Apple said the shortages had affected mainly older models of its products and that it expected the impact on the current quarter to be lower than $6bn.

The California-based tech giant - which briefly became the first company to be valued at more than $3trn earlier this year - reported a profit of $34.6bn for the Christmas period, 20% up on 2020.

Its profit and sales figures beat Wall Street expectations, helping lift shares by more than 3% in after-hours trading.

Apple, which started shipping its new iPhone 13 model days before the quarter began, said phone sales were 9% ahead year-on-year at $71.6bn.

It was the iPad that seemed to bear the brunt of chip shortages, with sales down 14% at $7.2bn.

Industry data earlier this week showed the iPhone growing market share in China to become the top-selling handset in that market for the first time in six years.

Sales in Apple's wearable, home and accessories category, which include AirPods and Apple Watch, climbed by 13% to $14.7bn.

On the impact of supply chain strains, finance director Luca Maestri told the Reuters news agency: ""The level of constraint will depend a lot on other companies, what will be the demand for chips from other companies and other industries.

""It's difficult for us to predict, so we try to focus on the short term.""

Demand for Apple's hi-tech computers, accessories and tablets has boomed over the period when people have been forced to stay at home because of the pandemic.

It is also growing its services arm, covering the likes of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Fitness, which posted growth of 24% to $19.5bn in the latest quarter.

The company now has 785 million paying subscribers, an increase from 620 million a year ago and 745 million last quarter.

Parents of baby who died with more than 60 broken bones to be sentenced;Friday 28 January 2022 01:35, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];[];"A couple are facing jail terms today after their eight-week-old baby died with more than 60 broken bones in her body following ""the most despicable abuse"".

Naomi Johnson, 24, and Benjamin O'Shea, 26, claimed paramedics caused the fractures suffered by their daughter Amina - but they were found guilty of causing or allowing her to suffer physical harm.

In total, the little girl had 41 fractures to her ribs and 24 fractures to her limbs - with doctors concluding the injuries were ""highly indicative that Amina had suffered continued physical abuse"", police said.

Johnson and O'Shea, from Southwark in London, were also found guilty of cruelty to another child who is known to the pair.

Their sentencing at Inner London Crown Court on Friday comes amid concerns about an increase in child cruelty cases in the UK.

Here, Sky News looks at what happened to Amina, why reports of child cruelty are on the rise, and the early signs that can be spotted to prevent serious harm.

What happened to baby Amina?

Johnson and O'Shea - a former army reservist - called 999 on the morning of 26 April 2019 after Amina stopped breathing.

Paramedics arrived within minutes and tried to save her life, but she died at the scene.

The Metropolitan Police said there were no visible signs of injury and Amina was initially thought to have suffered a sudden unexplained death - but X-rays later identified her broken bones.

Some fractures were recent while others had started to heal, suggesting Amina had been repeatedly abused, the force added.

However, no cause of death was established.

Due to the level of Amina's injuries, a police investigation was launched and Johnson and O'Shea were arrested.

The couple claimed their daughter's death was the result of a visit to the GP - reportedly blaming her inoculation - and that her bone fractures were caused by the paramedics.

A medical expert concluded the baby's limb bone fractures were caused on at least seven separate occasions and the rib fractures were the result of at least two incidents, while the spread of the injuries meant they could not have been caused accidentally.

There was also evidence of past bleeding inside Amina's head, which had healed.

'A catalogue of the most despicable abuse'

Police found O'Shea made several calls to NHS 111 between 2016 and 2019 referring to his self-diagnosed PTSD and aggression issues.

In one incident, O'Shea called - about three weeks before Amina's death - to report that she was coughing blood, but he failed to act on a doctor's advice to take her to hospital.

Detectives also found texts that showed Johnson and O'Shea admitting to slapping and mistreating the other child for whom they were convicted.

They were convicted on 30 November following a four-week trial at Inner London Crown Court.

Both Southwark Council and the Met Police told Sky News that no previous safeguarding concerns were reported to them before Amina's death.

A serious case review was conducted, but the findings have not been published due to court restrictions relating to the protection of another child, Southwark Council said.

Detective Inspector Melanie Pressley, who led the police investigation, said Johnson and O'Shea had committed ""monstrous crimes"" and their baby daughter had suffered an ""unimaginable number of injuries"".

""The trauma she endured in her short life is impossible to comprehend, her injuries are a catalogue of the most despicable abuse,"" DI Pressley added.

""The cruelty and callousness with which the pair discussed the treatment of the other child in this case is shocking.

""Children depend on adults, and the children in this case were sorely betrayed by Johnson and O'Shea in the most tragic of ways.""

Why have child cruelty cases increased?

Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, described the Amina case as ""tragic"" and said the country was ""still reeling from the shock"" of the recent murders of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and toddler Star Hobson.

More than 27,300 cases of cruelty to children and young people were recorded by police in England and Wales from July 2020 to June 2021 - a 23% increase on the previous year.

There were also 536 cases of deaths or serious harm to a child where abuse or neglect was known or suspected in 2020/21 - a 19% rise on the previous 12 months.

Ms Westerman said the coronavirus lockdowns over the past two years meant some victims of child cruelty had been hidden.

She told Sky News: ""If we look back to the beginning of the lockdown, everything changed. Children weren't in school, children were behind closed doors and for some of those children, home wasn't a safe space.

""If you were a parent who wanted to hide what was going on at home, it became easier to do that.""

The NSPCC helpline was contacted nearly 85,000 times in 2020/21 - a 23% increase on the previous year and a record level for the charity.

""That was a big jump for us,"" Ms Westerman said.

""Do we know the full outcome of the effects of lockdown on children and families? Probably not yet.

""We know from our conversations with schools, we're seeing more children coming back with mental health issues exacerbated - or new mental health issues - that really need and support right now.""

What are the early signs of child cruelty?

Ms Westerman said cases of child cruelty are often picked up by workers in close contact with children including health visitors, midwives, teachers, youth workers and nursery staff, as well as by family members and neighbours.

Early signs of child cruelty can include witnessing a change in a youngster's demeanour, she added.

""They may seem nervous or not as happy around their usual caregiver,"" Ms Westerman said.

""They may have bruising or marks on their body. They may start bed-wetting. Their diet or routine to eat may go out of the window.

""For older children, they may become more withdrawn. Their online activity may be different.

""Neighbours may hear more shouting, or see children outside without suitable clothes.

""They may see children left out on their own or out when it may not be suitable.

""There are lots of early signs that things aren't quite right.""

The chilling parallels between the murders of Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes

Ms Westerman, who is head of local campaigns at the NSPCC, said the charity was calling on the government to ""really invest"" in children's social care.

She said there were ""ongoing concerns"" about how much children's social care will receive of the £4.8bn in new grant funding to local authorities over the next three years.

There is also a need to address a national shortfall of health visitors - estimated to be about 5,000 in England, she added.

Ms Westerman said: ""The child protection system isn't broken, but it is under immense strain, and it has been for many years, particularly for the last decade.

""The chair of the independent care review has described the care system as a Jenga tower held together by Sellotape. Obviously that's really, really not good enough.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128050718/https://news.sky.com/story/parents-of-baby-who-died-with-more-than-60-broken-bones-to-be-sentenced-12525972;Category-7: health
Regulator targets 'crippling' insurance bills for residents of flats after Grenfell tragedy;Friday 28 January 2022 09:00, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The City watchdog has urged insurance firms and brokers to work with it to ensure bills are fair after communities secretary Michael Gove said residents of almost all flats were facing ""crippling"" premiums in the wake of the Grenfell fire tragedy.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday that it wanted to establish that bills ""fairly and accurately reflect risk"" amid fears leaseholders in buildings with cladding that has been deemed unsafe are being ripped off.

Many such people have also suffered through an inability to move home since the Grenfell blaze, which left 72 people dead in 2017, threw a spotlight on the safety of exterior building materials.

Efforts to solve the cladding issue have dragged on but Mr Gove sought to ""reset"" the government's approach by removing the financial burden from residents of lower-rise buildings earlier this month when he confirmed builders would have to foot the bill.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also dented demand for flats - further suppressing their value.

The FCA said it had written to insurance industry chief executives amid Mr Gove's call for an investigation into the insurance costs which, he said, had seen bills double year-on-year in some cases.

""The letters outline the work which includes examining firms' approaches to pricing for multi-occupancy buildings and whether elements unrelated to risk such as commissions are driving up costs,"" the regulator's statement said.

""The letters also remind firms of their obligations under our rules, including to consider the costs borne by leaseholders when determining whether a product is fair value.

""We are asking firms to consider what actions they can take to help leaseholders, whether individually or by identifying collective solutions as an industry.

""This work will be done with the Competition and Markets Authority where appropriate.""

Mr Gove said he had asked for the review to establish within six months any underlying causes for the price increases and figure out why insurance options are limited for customers in multi-occupancy buildings.

He spoke of worries that cover was even being denied to leaseholders in some situations.

Mr Gove added: ""I have been particularly concerned to hear of cases where insurance premiums have escalated by over 100% year-on-year, leaving residents with crippling costs.

""It is clear to me that the insurance market is failing some leaseholders.

""Understandably, many policyholders do not view the market as effectively delivering accessibly priced, widely available insurance. I share that view, and do not consider this an acceptable situation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128090827/http://news.sky.com/story/regulator-targets-crippling-insurance-bills-for-residents-of-flats-after-grenfell-tragedy-12527030;Category-3: environment
MPs support bill backed by Strictly Come Dancing star to give British Sign Language legal status;Friday 28 January 2022 16:23, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];[];"MPs have backed a proposal to give British Sign Language (BSL) legal recognition and to ensure it is used more in public services.

Labour MP Rosie Cooper, who put forward the private member's bill, said making BSL a legally recognised language would send a clear message to every deaf person that ""their language is equal and should be treated as equal"".

The legislation has the backing of EastEnders actress Rose Ayling-Ellis, who made history as the first deaf contestant on Strictly Come Dancing when she won the show last year.

Image: British Sign Language campaigners show their support for the bill outside parliament

Although BSL was recognised as a language in its own right by the government in 2003, it has no legal protection.

The British Sign Language Bill, which aims to improve accessibility for deaf people and would see the promotion of BSL when making public service announcements, was given an unopposed second reading in the Commons after securing the government's support.

The bill will now undergo further parliamentary scrutiny at a later date.

The National Deaf Children's Society said the backing of the bill was ""another big step towards a society"" where deaf people are ""truly included"".

Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: ""This is an historic day for British Sign Language users everywhere. With their language now well on the way to being recognised in law, they can feel jubilant, valued and optimistic about the future.""

Introducing her bill, Ms Cooper made an emotional speech recalling her experience of growing up as a child of deaf parents.

""Growing up, I saw first-hand the difficulties deaf people face every day. The huge challenges my parents had to overcome, to be heard, to be listened to,"" the MP for West Lancashire said.

Image: Rosie Cooper said making BSL a legally-recognised language would send a clear message to every deaf person

Explaining the aims of her bill, Ms Cooper said: ""I want to finally recognise BSL in statute, not just a gesture, but a law which requires positive action from the government, with real progress putting deaf people on an equal footing with those of us who hear.""

Ms Cooper thanked Ms Alyling-Ellis for backing the legislation.

""Clearly, much of the awareness is due to Rose Ayling-Ellis in Strictly, she proved what my dad always says 'deaf people can do anything, even the impossible', such as winning Strictly when you can't hear the music.

""That 10-second glimpse she gave the hearing world into deafness when the music stopped was truly momentous.""

Image: The bill was given an unopposed second reading in the Commons after securing government support

Speaking before the bill's second reading, Ms Ayling-Ellis told The Big Issue: ""If it becomes an official language, which we've been fighting for all these years, it will be so emotional for us.

""Because of the massive interest in BSL recently, a lot of people don't realise how much of a fight the deaf community have had.""

Drawing her remarks to a close, Ms Cooper used BSL in the chamber as she said: ""So, in closing, I'd like to say to the minister, thank you for supporting this bill. Thank you.""

Image: Although BSL was recognised as a language in its own right by the government in 2003, it has no legal protection

The government gave the bill its support, with Department for Work and Pensions minister Chloe Smith agreeing ""legally recognising British Sign Language in Great Britain is a significant step towards ensuring that deaf people are not excluded from reaching their potential"".

""Passing the bill will see (the) government commit to improving the lives of deaf people, and will encourage organisations across the nation to take up the BSL mantle, benefitting both themselves and the deaf community,"" she said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128170951/http://news.sky.com/story/british-sign-language-to-get-legal-status-as-part-of-bill-backed-by-strictly-come-dancing-star-12527291;Category-3: environment
Alijah Thomas: Martina Madarova jailed for killing young daughter in west London;Friday 28 January 2022 16:49, UK;['tom gillespie', '@tomgillespie1'];[];"A mother who strangled her five-year-old daughter to death cried in the dock after being jailed for her manslaughter.

Martina Madarova, 41, admitted killing Alijah Thomas at their family home in Ealing, west London, in September 2021.

Madarova denied murder but admitted manslaughter, which was accepted by the prosecution after medical reports showed she suffered from severe depression during the pandemic.

Judge Richard Marks noted she had previously been an ""exemplary mother"" when he jailed her for five years at the Old Bailey today.

In a victim impact statement, Alijah's father, David Thomas, said: ""I am blessed that I have other children but the fact that I have lost one is devastating.

""Martina is not a bad person, she was the best mum.

""I still believe that she was not well and would not have intentionally done anything to harm our daughter.""

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said the defendant had suffered a ""significant deterioration"" in her mental state during the COVID pandemic and was severely depressed at the time of the killing.

Image: Martina Madarova has been jailed for five years

Madarova, a Slovakian national, had called Mr Thomas on the morning of 14 September last year and told him Alijah had died.

The mother was later found lying on the sofa with her daughter tucked under a blanket as if to go to sleep, Mr Atkinson said.

Madarova went on to tell medics that she felt she had ""failed"" her daughter and had consumed two bottles of wine.

A post-mortem examination found Alijah died from compression of the neck.

Judge Marks noted the killing involved a ""breach of trust"" of a ""vulnerable"" victim when he jailed Madarova.

The defendant's drinking and the fact that she had not sought medical help were aggravating factors.

But the judge also acknowledged she will have to live with what she did for the rest of her life.

Mike Lynch loses $5bn fraud case over sale of Autonomy to HP in 2011;Friday 28 January 2022 14:35, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch has lost a multi-billion pound fraud action brought over the sale of software company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011.

The High Court judge found that HP had ""substantially"" succeeded in its bitter civil case but indicated that the US firm would get considerably less than the $5bn (£3.7bn) it had sought in damages.

The summary ruling by Mr Justice Hildyard follows years of bitter wrangling over Autonomy's value, which HP marked down by almost $9bn after buying the firm for $11bn (£8.4bn).

It claimed it had been hoodwinked over Autonomy's true financial performance and prospects when going over its accounts in advance of the takeover.

Autonomy founder Dr Lynch, who made an estimated $800m from the deal, has always denied any wrongdoing and argued he was being made a ""scapegoat"" for mismanagement by HP.

But the judge found Autonomy had concealed the sales of hardware products and engaged in convoluted reselling schemes to mask a shortfall in its key software products.

His lawyers indicated he planned to appeal though a further blow could come Dr Lynch's way later on Friday.

He is also due to learn whether Home Secretary Priti Patel has approved an extradition request to the US where he faces criminal charges, including wire fraud and securities fraud, relating to the deal.

His Autonomy colleague, former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain, was convicted in the US in 2019 and jailed for five years. He has subsequently lost an appeal against that conviction.

US authorities claim that Dr Lynch, who denies all charges against him, deliberately overstated the value of his business, which specialised in software to sort through large data sets.

Dr Lynch has opposed extradition on the grounds that the alleged criminal offences should come under the jurisdiction of the UK and not the US. He is expected to appeal any decision by Ms Patel which allows the US request.

Image: Mr Lynch is seen outside the High Court in 2021

His High Court legal team was yet to comment on the summary judgment.

He had launched a counter-claim for at least £95m in damages against HP for ""a series of false, misleading and unfair public statements"" about his alleged responsibility for supposed accounting irregularities and misrepresentations at Autonomy.

An HP spokesperson said of the findings: ""Dr Lynch and Mr Hussain defrauded and deliberately misled the market and Hewlett-Packard.

""HP is pleased that the judge has held them accountable.""

Kelwin Nicholls, of law firm Clifford Chance who represented the tycoon in the case, said: ""Today's outcome is disappointing and Dr Lynch intends to appeal.

Afghanistan: Hazara group that worked with foreigners now on the run and in hiding from Taliban 'who want revenge';Friday 28 January 2022 20:23, UK;['alex crawford', '@alexcrawfordsky'];[];"The five children are all now orphans - and still very much in shock when we meet them.

Their two-roomed home is silent apart from their weeping which is interspersed with stunned silences.

Propped up in front of them is a photograph of their mother who was killed in a car bomb a few days before we meet the youngsters.

They are the latest victims of what many believe is a concerted and systemic persecution of the Hazara ethnic group in Afghanistan.

Image: These children were orphaned after their mother was killed in a car bomb

The bomb was planted in the centre of the Hazara community in Herat City, a few yards away from the Hazara community office.

The message couldn't be more clear: the Hazaras are not wanted here.

Half of those who used to live in this area - that's thousands of them - have already upped and fled since the Taliban came to power.

Many streamed across the border to nearby Iran intending to try to make their way to Europe or any other safe haven.

Although the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) said they'd planted the latest bomb in Herat City, the Hazaras around the area believe it could just as easily have been left by the Taliban.

""They don't like us either,"" one Hazara woman told us.

The orphaned children had been at home waiting for their mother to come home.

Their father died of illness three years ago so they relied solely on their mother to earn enough to feed all six of the remaining family.

Nearly six months ago, their already hard lives got a whole lot harder when the Taliban came to power.

Their mother headed out to her job despite the danger of angering the new rulers who frown on women working.

She had no choice.

Her eldest child is a girl who's just 18 and she's been looking after her younger siblings since she was 15.

Now with her mother killed, this young woman is going to have to find a way to earn cash in a country which doesn't automatically recognise her right to either work or study.

Her 16-year-old sister sobs angrily: ""There's a lack of everything in Afghanistan. My mother was so kind and she cared for us but there wasn't even an ambulance to take her to hospital. I cannot believe she's gone.""

The youngest - a girl of seven - looks on, wiping her eyes with her headscarf. Her sisters tell us she hasn't slept since the bombing.

""She's awake until morning, asking us where our mother is,"" the eldest says, ""she's very young and scared"".

If truth be told, they all are - and every Hazara we spoke to in this community in Herat said the same.

Image: Some members of the Hazara community have been in hiding since the Taliban takeover

We meet a group of about 15 - both men and women - again all Hazaras, who are on the run.

They're all in hiding from Taliban fighters they're convinced are bent on revenge.

Their crime is working for the foreigners who rapidly pulled out last August.

All of them have either been trained or worked with the foreigners.

Many are former police officers; some served in the Afghan army and at least one ran a needlework class teaching handicraft skills to women and advising them of their rights.

Many have letters of commendation from their former foreign friends.

We see a range of flags of the coalition partners across the masthead of the many certificates applauding their success at completing the various courses run by the foreigners. And there are photographs of them alongside their former friends.

But now they're all terrified because of their association with the international groups that stayed here for more than two decades.

Image: Millions of Afghans depend on aid to survive through the winter

One women says she hides her ID cards and portfolio of achievements linking her to her past, buried in the ground.

""I only got it out to show you,"" she says. A former police officer says of the foreign troops: ""They left us behind and now we're not safe so I ask the international community to please help us - either with our security here - or get us out of here.""

Another, a young woman has graphic pictures of an army vehicle which has been the target of a shooting.

The photographs show bloodstained seats in the front of the vehicle.

""This is where my mother was shot,"" the young woman says.

Her mother was a soldier.

She somehow survived but is paralysed and now the rest of her family is worried they're next.

The promises by the Taliban of an amnesty for those who worked with the foreigners has come to nothing.

""They lie. There is no amnesty. The Taliban lie,"" several of them say.

Image: Taliban fighters oversee security at an aid distribution point in Herat

The daughter of the female soldier shot in the army vehicle speaks for them all when she says: ""We are nervous about our security and our families,"" she says, ""We don't want to go to another country…we want to live in a safe situation in our country but this is not possible for us.""

Among the group is the son of Alia Azizi, the female governor of Herat's women's prison.

She was given a Taliban amnesty letter, days after the Taliban took power at the end of August.

But she never returned home after going to work at the beginning of October.

Her family haven't seen her since and human rights groups like Amnesty International have been calling for a proper investigation into her disappearance.

Her family are convinced she's been taken by the Taliban despite their denials.

Our meeting with those on the run is broken up suddenly.

They feel they've been talking to us for too long and they don't want to be exposed. They swiftly disperse and go back into hiding.

They are a desperate, terrified group and we're told there are so many more, too scared to even talk to us.

In the midst of this fear and uncertainty, Afghanistan is a country which is fast turning into the world's worst humanitarian disaster and getting aid to those who most need it, is complicated and contentious.

There are widespread claims that the Taliban is misappropriating what aid there is.

With billions of dollars in assets frozen in overseas banks and international aid mostly halted since the Taliban took over last August, the economy's been teetering on collapse.

The new rulers told Sky News last week they'd drawn up their first budget.

But the regime is immensely strapped for hard cash with most public sector workers - including the Taliban soldiers we spoke to, telling us they're receiving no salaries.

The Taliban quickly announced in October a programme of ""food-for-work"" by using food aid as payment instead of salaries.

But there are growing concerns this has led to most of the aid going to Taliban supporters.

Image: A family collects an aid package in Herat

And ethnic groups like the Hazaras have been badly impacted with several telling us they were not getting enough access to aid.

The United Nations is attempting to ensure aid is sent to and distributed only by approved groups but there are lingering worries over the effectiveness of this.

The international community is wrestling with how to balance providing humanitarian funds which will ease the suffering - whilst also ensuring the aid doesn't end up funding terror networks or rewarding a regime who took power at the end of the gun and many claim aren't upholding human rights.

Seriously ill children at risk due to drastic cuts to care support, charity warns;Friday 28 January 2022 17:59, UK;['katerina vittozzi', '@kvittozzi'];[];"Seriously ill children who are being cared for at home by their families are being put at risk due to ""drastic cuts to care support"", a charity has warned.

Research by national charity WellChild found that staff shortages were leaving parents exhausted and vulnerable, with one mother saying the situation was ""an accident waiting to happen"".

Data, shared exclusively with Sky News, found 80% of affected families were not receiving the state-funded care support to which they are entitled.

88% said there was an expectation from care providers that parents would cover the ever-more frequent staff shortages.

""It is unsustainable to us to expect families to take on that care responsibility all by themselves,"" Matt James, director of communications and engagement at WellChild, told Sky News.

""Ultimately, these parents won't be able to sustain this level of care for much longer and those children will end up back in hospital, living long term in hospital which places increasing pressure on the NHS, and that's not good for anybody.""

There are an estimated 100,000 families across the UK with a sick or disabled child at home.

Jill Evans' son, Noah, 10, has a rare lung disease and requires 24-hour ""awake"" care.

Due to a lack of care staff, Ms Evans has had to cover 33 out of the past 35 nightshifts.

""It's just a nightmare, on so many levels,"" Ms Evans told Sky News.

""I mean not even someone working on a ward would do more than four nights. Heaven forbid if I missed something and it was on my watch, you know if Noah's tracheotomy tube blocks and I miss that because I've fallen asleep.

""That's Iife threatening.""

Image: Jessica's mother says care staff absences mean she is now like a 'full-on' nurse

Existing staff shortages within the social care sector have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Department of Health and Social Care told Sky News that ""carers play a vital role in our communities and we owe them a debt of gratitude"".

""We are supporting the care sector with a £462.5m recruitment fund.""

But that funding is to cover recruitment across the whole social care spectrum, and the current funding deficit just within disabled children's social care is more than that alone.

""I worry so much about the future,"" Alison Ruston says.

She gave up working full-time to care at home for her daughter Jessica, 15, who was born with a chromosomal abnormality.

""It's not even just about what will happen with Jess but about what happens now for all families.""

Image: Mrs Ruston's daughter needs two people with her day and night

Jessica has complex medical needs and is now receiving end-of-life care.

She requires two people with her, day and night, and Mrs Ruston says she is more frequently being asked to fill in for staff absence.

""I know I'm Jess's mum and parental responsibility and all that, but what we're being asked to do it beyond parental responsibility. We're full-on nurses.""

""We have a very small team and I'm acutely aware that if anyone goes off, that'll be it - there's no one else.""

Mrs Ruston says calls for help to local authorities or care providers go unheard.

""It's 'oh, we haven't got any cover', and however you say 'I don't think I can do this, I am exhausted', it doesn't matter, you've got to.

""And as a parent of course you do it, don't you.

Mike Lynch: Home secretary approves extradition of UK tech tycoon to US but his lawyers vow to fight order;Friday 28 January 2022 23:57, UK;[];[];"Home Secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition of a British entrepreneur to the US to answer criminal fraud charges.

But Mike Lynch's lawyers say they will file an appeal at the High Court as they fight the order which was earlier signed by Ms Patel following a midnight deadline.

It comes on the day that the technology tycoon lost a multi-billion pound fraud action brought over the sale of his software company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011.

In what was believed to be the UK's biggest civil fraud trial, a High Court judge found HP had ""substantially"" succeeded in its lawsuit but indicated the US firm would get considerably less than the $5bn (£3.7bn) it had sought in damages.

Image: Dr Lynch has always denied any wrongdoing

HP said it was hoodwinked in the deal

Dr Lynch, who founded Autonomy, is accused of deliberately overstating the value of his business before it was acquired by HP more than a decade ago.

The American technology giant marked down the company's value by nearly $9bn after buying it for $11.1bn (£8.3bn) and there have been years of bitter wrangling.

HP claimed it had been hoodwinked over Autonomy's true financial performance and prospects when going over its accounts in advance of the takeover.

In its lawsuit, the company accused Dr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, of artificially inflating the company's revenues and committing a ""deliberate fraud over a sustained period of time"".

Lynch denies any wrongdoing

Autonomy founder Dr Lynch, who made an estimated $800m from the deal, has always denied any wrongdoing and argued he was being made a ""scapegoat"" for mismanagement by HP.

But Mr Justice Hildyard, the judge in the civil trial, which was heard over nine months in 2019, found Autonomy had concealed the sales of hardware products and engaged in convoluted reselling schemes to mask a shortfall in its key software products.

On Wednesday this week, Ms Patel was given until midnight on Friday to decide on his extradition after a High Court judge ruled against Dr Lynch's legal challenge over a previously set deadline.

Ms Patel had wanted to consider Mr Justice Hildyard's ruling on the High Court civil claim before making an extradition decision.

The home secretary has now approved the extradition request to the US where the Briton faces criminal charges, including wire fraud and securities fraud, relating to the deal.

But his lawyers will challenge this order.

'This is not the end of the battle'

""Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the US and will continue to fight to establish his innocence,"" Chris Morvillo of Clifford Chance said.

""This is not the end of the battle - far from it. Dr Lynch will now file an appeal to the High Court in London.""

US authorities claim that Dr Lynch deliberately overstated the value of his business, which specialised in software to sort through large data sets.

Dr Lynch, from Suffolk, has opposed extradition on the grounds that the alleged criminal offences should come under the jurisdiction of the UK and not the US.

His Autonomy colleague, Sushovan Hussain, was convicted in the US in 2019 and jailed for five years. He has subsequently lost an appeal against that conviction.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129021204/http://news.sky.com/story/mike-lynch-home-secretary-approves-extradition-of-uk-tech-tycoon-to-us-but-his-lawyers-vow-to-fight-order-12527824;Category-6: science and technology
Alan Carr's husband Paul Drayton cries in dock after being spared prison for drink-driving;Friday 28 January 2022 18:43, UK;[];[];"The husband of comedian Alan Carr, Paul Drayton, broke down in tears in the dock after successfully appealing against his prison sentence for drink-driving.

Drayton was handed a 14-week jail term on Wednesday for reversing a 4X4 into a police car before registering an alcohol test reading that was ""off the scale"".

However, the 50-year-old was released after two nights in custody on Friday after a judge told him he should be given the opportunity to turn his life around and would receive a 12-week prison sentence suspended for two years.

Drayton, who cares for rescue horses, had pleaded guilty to a single count of ""driving a motor vehicle when alcohol level above limit"".

A breath alcohol test had returned a reading of 153 micrograms in 100 millilitres of breath - four times the legal limit.

Drayton recently announced his split from stand-up comedian Carr, his partner of 13 years, with the pair still married, and also underwent brain surgery just over two weeks ago.

He wore a blue suit to Brighton Crown Court on Friday as his barrister sought to have him released from custody.

John Dye, representing Drayton, told the court: ""This is a very serious drink-driving offence.

""It crosses the custody threshold. I think to say anything other than that would be absurd.""

However, he emphasised Drayton's previous good character, mental health struggles and problems with alcohol.

""The two nights in custody have been extremely difficult for someone who has poor mental health,"" he added.

At the mention of his two nights in prison since being jailed on Wednesday, Drayton broke down in silent tears in the dock.

Judge Shani Barnes responded: ""I am sure they have been harrowing.""

After briefly retiring to discuss the case with her magistrate colleague, she returned to the courtroom and told Drayton that he had led an ""exemplary life"".

Image: Paul Drayton walked from court on Friday

Addressing the question of whether the sentence could be suspended, she said the answer was ""quite clearly... yes"".

""Yes, of course, it is right that we give you an opportunity to make amends and turn your life around,"" Judge Barnes said.

Drayton, who had been visibly emotional in the dock throughout the hearing, broke down in fresh tears as the decision was announced.

At his sentencing hearing on Wednesday, the court heard that worried members of the public had called police on 9 October last year when they saw Drayton driving in Broadbridge Heath, West Sussex, shortly before 3pm.

Prosecutor Suzanne Soros said officers tracked him down and saw his vehicle ""swerving from side to side"".

Suspecting he was over the alcohol limit, they signalled for him to pull over and he complied.

""The defendant then reverses into the police vehicle,"" Ms Soros said.

Drayton was then boxed in by other police vehicles to prevent him making a getaway.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129021204/http://news.sky.com/story/alan-carrs-husband-paul-drayton-cries-in-dock-after-being-spared-prison-for-drink-driving-12527601;Category-5: entertainment and culture
Pittsburgh bridge collapse: Human chain formed to help people from dangling bus;Friday 28 January 2022 18:20, UK;[];[];"A two-lane bridge has collapsed in Pittsburgh just hours before US President Joe Biden was expected to visit to discuss his infrastructure bill.

Rescuers had to rappel nearly 150ft (46 metres) while others formed a human chain to help rescue people from a dangling bus.

There were minor injuries but no fatalities reported, although drones are being flown to make sure no one is under the rubble.

Police said the bridge - on Forbes Avenue over Fern Hollow Creek in Frick Park - came down just before 7am local time on Friday.

A photo from the scene showed a commuter bus upright on a section of the structure.

City officials said the collapse caused a gas leak, which prompted the temporary evacuation of some nearby homes, but the gas supply has now been shut off.

Pittsburgh fire chief Darryl Jones said three or four vehicles were involved in the collapse and there were 10 minor injuries with three people taken to hospital.

None of the injuries are life-threatening, he added.

The White House said Mr Biden will still visit the city.

""Our team is in touch with state and local officials on the ground as they continue to gather information about the cause of the collapse,"" the statement said.

""The president is grateful to the first responders who rushed to assist the drivers who were on the bridge at the time.""

The collapse is an example of how dilapidated many of the country's bridges are - Pennsylvania has 3,198 bridges rated as being in poor condition, according to the US Department of Transportation.

Lynn McPaul: Police 'increasingly concerned' for woman missing since Sunday night;Friday 28 January 2022 18:48, UK;[];[];"Police have said they are becoming increasingly concerned for the welfare of a woman who has been missing since last weekend.

Lynn McPaul, 45, was last seen around 11.40pm on Sunday 23 January in Dundee on Perth Road near to Strawberry Bank.

Detectives have released a photo of a jacket similar to the one she was wearing when she was last seen - it is black, with a Nike logo on the front and back.

She was also wearing white Nike Air Force One trainers.

Ms McPaul is described as white, around 4ft 11in tall, and of slim build with shoulder length dark brown hair.

Inspector Keith Anderson, of Downfield police station, said: ""It is completely out of character for her to be out of touch with her family for this length of time.

""We are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare the longer she remains missing.

""Search activity is continuing and we will have a number of specialist police resources dedicated to helping find her.

""As part of this, I would urge anyone who lives around Strawberry Bank, Richmond Terrace and Magdalen Green or the surrounding area, who may have a shed or outbuilding where someone could seek shelter, to check this and report anything of note to us.

""Alongside the search activity, we are continuing with conventional police enquiries to try and establish Lynn's movements since she was last seen on Sunday.

""I would please ask anyone with information which has not yet been passed to police to get in touch urgently. Even if you feel your information may not be of note, it may help us piece together Lynn's movements.

""I would also reiterate our appeal to anyone who lives around the Strawberry Bank, Richmond Terrace and Magdalen Green area who may have dashcam, private CCTV or doorbell camera footage to review this and pass on anything of note to us.""

Cardboard could be a game-changer as film and TV industry looks to clean up its act;Saturday 29 January 2022 02:27, UK;['frazer maude', '@frazeratsky'];[];"A visit to Greater Manchester film studio The Vectar Project is an eye-opening experience. But as is so often the case in the film and TV business, all is not as it may first appear to be, even to the industry insider.

The film sets on display here play a double trick on the eye. Buildings with no backs, steel doors that aren't made of steel, and train carriages that are going nowhere are established tricks of the trade for the set designer.

But what makes these sets different is that they're not made out of the usual wood, MDF and plastic. They're all made from cardboard.

Image: In an industry that in recent years has been encouraged to reduce its environmental impact, cardboard could be a game-changer

Cardboard is 100% recyclable

And in an industry that in recent years has been encouraged to reduce its environmental impact, cardboard could be a game-changer. It's 80% cheaper than a traditional wood or MDF set, it has a carbon footprint that's 90% lower, and it's 100% recyclable.

""Our industry does amazing work in increasing awareness of the climate crisis, but often has no alternative but to add to the damage,"" says Tom Henderson, from The Vectar Project.

""Every year we build thousands of studio sets from wood and MDF, then dump them the moment the shoot is over. It makes me and others in the industry sick to see how much we waste, but now there is another solution.""

A cardboard Aston Martin DB5 and The Beatles guitars - complete with strings

Tom had his cardboard Eureka! moment during a shoot in the Caribbean for a TV commercial. The carbon footprint of the project was huge, so Tom decided there had to be another way.

He teamed up with cardboard artist Chris Gilmour, who has been working with the material for over 20 years and can pretty much make anything from it.

Image: Buildings with no backs, steel doors that aren't made of steel, and train carriages that are going nowhere are established tricks of the trade for the set designer

His previous works have included full-size replicas of an Aston Martin DB5 (complete with ejector seat and spoked wheels), a dentist's chair, and The Beatles guitars (complete with strings), all made completely from cardboard.

So a jail cell door or the wooden beams of a Tudor house are comfortably within his abilities.

""It's such a versatile medium,"" Chris says. ""And the Vectar board that we use is really strong too. So, we can build lightweight sets, that can also be load-bearing, which is something we couldn't do before.""

The wood used for the cardboard is sourced in Sweden and comes from trees that are harvested for their branches, rather than chopped down entirely. The company says it's a completely sustainable method that provides 100% recyclable materials.

The sets are not only cheaper and less environmentally harmful, they also help save time during production. The fact they can be moved easily by one or two people, unlike much heavier wooden sets, means that they can be repositioned much more quickly, saving time and money.

Image: The door to No 10 - made of cardboard

'I imagine there could be all kinds of benefits'

Environmental groups are keen to see the impact the cardboard innovations can have.

Mike Berners-Lee, from Carbon Footprinting UK, says: ""You know, I can imagine that cardboard film sets could be easy to make, easy to take down, easy to store away afterward, reused for other purposes, I can imagine there could be all kinds of benefits, and it's just taking a bit of creativity from someone to get it off the ground.""

The good news for Vectar, and its hopes of cleaning up the industry, is that many companies are getting on (card) board.

In just six months, Tom and Chris' work has generated interest and support from ITV, BBC, BAFTA, Creative England, The National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. They are also working with the Berlin Film School and German TV channels, as well as companies in Canada, Australia and throughout Europe.

Remarkable to think that the environmental sustainability of film production may soon owe a debt to a company, based on an industrial estate in Greater Manchester, that can make humble cardboard look like anything you want it to.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129030935/http://news.sky.com/story/cardboard-could-be-a-game-changer-as-film-and-tv-industry-looks-to-clean-up-its-act-12527779;Category-3: environment
Pam & Tommy, Flag Day, Station Eleven - Backstage on three films and TV shows to watch this week;;[];[];"Rather than a wedding band, Pamela Anderson had Tommy Lee's name tattooed on her ring finger, the inking marking a commitment made just 96 hours into their wild romance.

It was February 1995 when the nuptials took place, the ultimate Baywatch babe swapping her famous red swimsuit for a white string bikini to marry the Motley Crue rocker on a beach in Cancun, Mexico.

Anderson and Lee very quickly became a 1990s tabloid dream; the Playboy pin-up and the tattooed bad boy, a couple who couldn't keep their hands off each other - and weren't afraid to let people (journalists and photographers included) know about it.

Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, pictured in 1995. Pic: Reuters Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, pictured in 1995. Pic: Reuters

By the end of the year, Anderson was pregnant with their first child and details of the sex tape that would soon become infamous had emerged. The theft of the private tape, filmed during the couple's honeymoon and stolen from their home in Malibu, California, by a disgruntled contractor, left the Baywatch star ""devastated"".

Despite the couple's efforts to curtail it once they found it was gone, the tape snowballed. Coinciding with the early days of the internet, the footage went from underground bootleg-VHS curiosity to full-blown global headline-maker, the first celebrity sex tape to go viral.

When sex tapes featuring Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian came out in later years, the narrative was the same: the women were laughed at, vilified; the men were deemed sex gods.

Given the fame it brought them, questions were raised about whether the footage had been leaked by the subjects themselves. And the videos became known as the Pamela Anderson sex tape, the Paris Hilton sex tape, the Kim Kardashian sex tape; in Hilton and Kardashian's cases, do you even remember the names of the men involved? (Bizarrely, Rick Salomon, who made the tape with Hilton, later went on to marry Anderson).

Years later, the subject of her own tape inevitably comes up whenever Anderson is interviewed. She has never watched it, never made any money off it herself - despite others reportedly making millions - she tells interviewers, sometimes laughing off their jokes about it. She was an actress and model who had posed naked and spoken openly about her sex life; for years, she was fair game.

The leaking of a tape like this now would be considered revenge porn. Watching some of those clips in 2022 brings about a similar sense of unease evoked by the footage of inappropriate questioning in old Britney Spears interviews, which came to the fore as her conservatorship fight made headlines last year.

Post #MeToo, the world views stories such as this very differently now. And yet, Anderson and Lee's story is being dramatised in the new series Pam & Tommy, starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan and billed as ""a love story, crime caper and cautionary tale rolled into one"".

Anderson has had no involvement in the series. Which begs the question: why is the story being retold for entertainment, almost 30 years later?

""I FELT LIKE WE WERE DOING A REALLY EMPATHETIC PORTRAYAL OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING... AND JUST HOW HEINOUS IT WAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE""

Pam & Tommy director Craig Gillespie

James, who is usually associated with ""English rose"" roles in shows and films such as Downton Abbey and Rebecca, has been transformed beyond recognition to become the all-American (well, Canadian) bombshell. In interviews, she has spoken of the ""misogyny"" Anderson was faced with and how women have always been held to much higher standards than men.

But after making tabloid headlines herself in 2020, when she was linked to her married The Pursuit Of Love co-star Dominic West, she must know all too well what it is like having your personal life gossiped about by the world.

Director Craig Gillespie, known for films including I, Tonya and Cruella, says the aim was to change the narrative, to shine a spotlight on how Anderson and Lee (to a much lesser extent), were treated at the time and present the story in ""a much kinder"" way.

""[People] don't realise what victims they were,"" he tells Sky News. ""This was a deeply personal tape. It wasn't [just] a sex tape, it was an hour-and-a half-long, like all of their relationship and some beautiful moments and happened to have [a few] minutes of explicit stuff on there that was in a safe, in a garage, at their home. And then this happens and with no accountability from anyone.""

James, star of films and series including Downton Abbey, Rebecca and Mamma Mia, has been transformed to play Anderson. Pic: AP James, star of films and series including Downton Abbey, Rebecca and Mamma Mia, has been transformed to play Anderson. Pic: AP

On Anderson not being involved, he says: ""I just have to respect however she wants to feel about it... In my heart, I felt like we were doing a really empathetic portrayal of what was happening and the victimisation that had happened with them and just how heinous it was, so I thought it was something that was a real opportunity to change the narrative and the perspective of what happened back then... Looking at it through today's lens was a really unique opportunity.""

Gillespie also says Anderson and Lee's story ""colliding"" with the rise of the internet makes for a ""powerful commentary"" on society and how the way we consume news and information has changed.

""[It was] like the beginning of this obsession with the internet and how we're so complicit. It's like there's no accountability for how we consume this, you know, almost like the internet is our get out of jail free card. So it was fascinating. And the way that we get to come into this story with preconceived notions...

James has spoken of the ""misogyny"" Anderson faced. Pic: Disney+ James has spoken of the ""misogyny"" Anderson faced. Pic: Disney+

""We have those judgements as we come into the show, we think we know what we thought we knew from what we saw back then, and we see how sort of incredibly wrong we were, and so quick to judge and to consume these soundbites and formulate an opinion that destroyed people's lives.""

The series does address the misogyny. ""I'm on that tape, same as you,"" Stan's Lee tells James's Anderson in one scene. ""No, not like me you're not,"" she replies.

But is it enough to warrant bringing it all back? Like the tape itself, no doubt millions will be watching.

Lee's representatives declined to comment when contacted by Sky News. Anderson's representatives did not respond to requests for comment, although according to sources quoted in US reports she has said she won't be watching and finds the idea of the series ""painful"".

It will be interesting to see if the ""kinder"" approach changes her mind - but once again, the story is out there without her consent.

Partygate: Boris Johnson to receive report in 'coming hours or days' as Metropolitan Police denies delaying publication;Saturday 29 January 2022 06:43, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];[];"Boris Johnson will receive the long-awaited report into parties in Downing Street and Whitehall in ""the coming hours or days"", Sky News understands - as police denied trying to delay publication.

It is understood the report - compiled by senior civil servant Sue Gray - will be sent to Number 10 shortly, as opposed to in a matter of weeks or months.

But it is not expected to be made public until ""in all likelihood next week"", when MPs return to the Commons after the weekend.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:29 Will PM weather the partygate storm?

The version made public will be redacted to ensure it complies with the Metropolitan Police's earlier request that nothing jeopardises its inquiry, it is believed.

It comes after the Met said on Friday evening that it had received the information to support its investigation and denied trying to delay the report.

Commander Catherine Roper said: ""We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team.""

She said the Special Enquiry Team was examining the Cabinet Office material ""to establish whether individuals attending the events in question may have breached the regulations"".

Earlier, the Met had called for ""minimal reference"" in the report to the events it is investigating - raising new doubts over when it would be published.

Its statement on Friday morning said: ""The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation.""

When the police investigation into partygate began on Tuesday, the force said it did not believe there was a risk of prejudice.

It said it was investigating a ""number of"" gatherings in 2020 and 2021 for potential breaches of coronavirus rules.

Met request 'absolute nonsense'

Lawyers have questioned the Met's request, but Commander Roper said it was normal ""to protect the integrity of the police investigation... and to be as fair as possible to those who are subject to it"".

""This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events,"" she added.

Commander Roper said a fixed fine would be the normal result if the lockdown-breaking offences under investigation were proven.

Image: Sue Gray has been investigating allegations of parties in Downing Street and across Whitehall

Some have questioned how the Met's investigation could be prejudiced if only lesser offences were being considered.

Publication of reports and other inquiries can often be delayed until a police investigation and any court case is concluded, typically to avoid prejudicing a jury.

However, if police investigate under coronavirus laws there would be little risk as the penalty for breaking lockdown rules is a fine and highly unlikely to result in a prosecution.

Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor for the North West, tweeted: ""This is absolute nonsense from the Met Police.

""A purely factual report by Sue Gray cannot possibly prejudice a police investigation. They just have to follow the evidence, of which the report will be a part.""

Former Supreme Court Justice Lord Sumption told BBC Newsnight there was ""something very strange going on"" and that there was ""no legal rule"" stating that a factual report cannot be published ahead of the police investigation.

The Met, he said, had ""effectively obstructed or delayed"" MPs from holding the government to account by asking Sue Gray not to publish key details.

Staycation frenzy spurs Center Parcs owner to prepare £4bn sale;Saturday 29 January 2022 11:36, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"The owner of Britain's biggest chain of upmarket holiday villages is to launch a £4bn auction of the business after recording the most profitable half-year in its history in spite of pandemic-related operating constraints.

Sky News has learnt that Brookfield Property Partners, the Canadian property giant, is paving the way to sell Center Parcs UK potentially as soon as this year.

City sources said this weekend that Brookfield had engaged the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to assist with preparations for a sale process.

Investment banks have yet to be formally appointed to handle an auction, and one person close to the process said it was possible that Brookfield would decide to retain the business for a longer period if it did not secure a sufficiently attractive offer.

Center Parcs is one of the most famous brands in the British leisure industry, drawing millions of visitors annually to its five UK sites and the latest addition to its portfolio, at Longford Forest in Ireland.

Its locations offer a mixture of adventure and leisure activities for families, such as watersports and horse riding, as well as spa packages.

The company opened its first site in the UK in 1987 at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire.

Last year, it announced plans to spend up to £400m on developing another village at Oldhouse Warren in West Sussex.

In the company's latest financial results for the 24 weeks ended 7 October, Center Parcs said it had recorded record earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of almost £120m ""despite operating to self-imposed reduced capacity limits"".

Its other UK locations are at Elveden Forest in Suffolk; Longleat Forest in Wiltshire; Whinfell Forest in Cumbria; and Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire.

Center Parcs has been a public company in the past, being floated on London's junior AIM market in 2003 before moving to a main market listing two years later.

It was then taken over by Blackstone, the private equity firm, in 2006, before being sold to Brookfield in 2015 in a deal reported to have been worth £2.4bn.

Brookfield briefly explored plans to put Center Parcs up for sale before the pandemic but has only recently revived internal discussions about running a formal process, according to insiders.

Large private equity and real estate investors, as well as pension funds are likely to be to among those who examine bids for the business.

Center Parcs' UK and Ireland operations are owned separately to the European business that also trades under the brand.

The brand dates back to 1968, when the first village opened in the Netherlands.

Run by Martin Dalby, its chief executive for more than 20 years, Center Parcs' shareholders have received hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends since Brookfield bought the business.

An auction of the business, which may not formally kick off for some months, will come amid a deluge of corporate activity in the UK holiday sector, fuelled by a surge in domestic demand during the pandemic.

Park Holidays recently changed hands in a £950m deal after being sold to Sun Communities of the US.

The UK's largest operator, Parkdean Resorts, is expected to trade in the coming months, while CVC Capital Partners acquired Away Resorts, another big player in the sector, last year.

Butlin's, one of the most famous names in the industry, is also up for sale, with Bourne Leisure, its parent company, due to kick off a process shortly.

This week, Sky News revealed that Forest Holidays was also being put up for sale for about £250m - a deal that would land a windfall for the Forestry Commission, which is a shareholder in the business.

Brookfield and Center Parcs declined to comment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129121032/http://news.sky.com/story/staycation-frenzy-spurs-center-parcs-owner-to-prepare-4bn-sale-12527982;Category-2: business and economy

Tom Brady: NFL legend appears set to retire after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowl wins;Saturday 29 January 2022 21:22, UK;[];[];"NFL legend Tom Brady appears set to retire after a remarkable 22-year career which saw him win seven Super Bowl titles.

Brady's company TB12sports tweeted to thank the 44-year-old for his career, honouring some of his most notable achievements and seemingly confirming his retirement after it was first reported by ESPN.

However, the tweet has since been deleted and Brady's agent, Don Yee, suggested fans would have to wait a little longer to hear from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback himself.

""Without getting into the accuracy or inaccuracy of what's being reported, Tom will be the only person to express his plans with complete accuracy,"" he told ESPN.

Brady's apparent retirement plans were also acknowledged by the official NFL Twitter account, and have been reported by news and sports media outlets around the world.

According to US media reports, Tampa Bay had asked Brady to stay on for one more season, but had turned down the opportunity to spend more time with his three children and wife Gisele Bundchen.

He signed for the Buccaneers in March 2020, winning his seventh Super Bowl there on home turf.

Brady, who has previously said he wants to still be playing at the age of 45, is considered the greatest quarterback in NFL history, having made his name during a history-making 20-year spell with the New England Patriots.

He was selected by the Patriots in the year 2000, in the sixth round of that season's draft in position 199.

Brady went on to seal his place in Gridiron history in his 22-year career, leading the NFL in most yards passed (84,250) and in most touchdown passes (624).

Brady has also bagged the most NFL career wins ever, with 243.

Putin's oligarchs will have 'nowhere to hide' with widened sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine - as UK 'rules nothing out';Sunday 30 January 2022 14:46, UK;['greg heffer', '@gregheffer'];[];"Vladimir Putin's oligarchs will have ""nowhere to hide"" under toughened UK sanctions, and British weapons and cash could be sent to Ukraine if Russia invades, the foreign secretary has said.

Speaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips On Sunday - amid growing tensions between the West and Moscow over Russia's build-up of troops on Ukraine's border - Liz Truss said: ""The number one priority is deterring Vladimir Putin from taking that action.

""That's why we are offering to deploy extra troops into Estonia, we are providing more air support across the Black Sea, and we are supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine to make sure they are in the best possible position should Vladimir Putin try to stage an incursion.

""What I'll be announcing later this week is improved legislation on sanctions so we can target more Russian interests that are of direct relevance to the Kremlin.

""Because we absolutely need to stop this happening, that is our number one priority.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Sunday of an ""increasingly concerning"" situation over Ukraine, after he received briefings this week from defence chiefs.

""I continue to urge Russia to engage in negotiations and avoid a reckless and catastrophic invasion,"" he posted on Twitter.

Mr Johnson is looking at doubling the number of UK troops deployed to strengthen Europe's borders in a new offer to NATO, as well as sending fast jets, warships and military specialists.

UK 'ruling absolutely nothing out' in assisting Ukraine - but British troops 'unlikely'

In her appearance on Sky News, Ms Truss said she was ""ruling absolutely nothing out"" when it comes to the UK's support for Ukraine, as she was asked if Britain might supply money and weapons to Ukrainian forces in the event of a Russian invasion.

However, the foreign secretary has deemed it ""very unlikely"" that British troops could be sent to fight alongside Ukrainians against Russia.

NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has also said there are ""no plans"" to deploy NATO combat troops to Ukraine, in the event of a Russian invasion.

He noted there was ""a difference"" between being a full NATO member, with a mutual defence obligation between countries within the alliance, and a ""strong and highly valued partner"" such as Ukraine.

Ukraine's plans for future membership of NATO has been cited as one of the key reasons behind the current tensions between Moscow and the West.

Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Sunday claimed NATO wants to pull Ukraine into the alliance, telling his country's state television that NATO ""has already come close to Ukraine"".

""They also want to drag this country there,"" he added. ""Although everyone understands that Ukraine is not ready and could make no contribution to strengthening NATO security.""

Meanwhile, the head of Russia's security council, Nikolai Patrushev, rejected Western warnings about a planned invasion of Ukraine.

""At this time, they're saying that Russia threatens Ukraine - that's completely ridiculous,"" he was quoted as saying by state news agency Tass.

""We don't want war and we don't need it at all.""

Earlier this week, I was briefed by our defence chiefs on the situation on Ukraine’s border.

Russian oligarchs warned over London property under new sanctions

In a warning to those close to Mr Putin, Ms Truss said of the widening of UK sanctions laws: ""Any company of interest to the Kremlin and the regime in Russia would be able to be targeted.

""So there would be nowhere to hide for Putin's oligarchs or Russian companies involved in propping up the Russian state.

""That is what we are looking at doing this week.""

Ms Truss did not rule out the possibility that tougher sanctions, expected to be outlined in parliament on Monday, could include the seizure of London property of Russian oligarchs in the UK.

""Nothing is off the table,"" the foreign secretary said. ""We're not going to go into the details of exactly who and how we would target the sanctions.

""What the legislation enables us to do is hit a much wider variety of targets, so there can nobody who thinks they would be immune to those sanctions.""

Germany challenged over Nord Stream 2 project

Ms Truss said the UK was working ""very closely"" with allies such as the US and EU on a ""severe"" package of sanctions to make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia.

And, in a message to Berlin, Ms Truss also said that a new gas pipeline between Russia and Germany should be halted in the event of Mr Putin invading Ukraine.

""We cannot favour short-term economic interests over the long-term survival of freedom and democracy in Europe,"" she said.

""That's the tough decision all of us have got to make.""

Asked whether the UK's view was that the Nord Stream 2 project should stop completely in such a scenario, Ms Truss replied: ""Completely.""

Putin facing 'quagmire' in Ukraine

The foreign secretary also told Russia that it faced ""a quagmire"" like the Kremlin's previous conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya, as she warned that ""the Ukrainians will fight hard, they are not going to give up easily"".

She said the UK's role was to ""make sure"" that a military invasion of Ukraine would not be ""simple"" for Russia.

Ms Truss will be visiting Ukraine this week before heading to Moscow next week for talks.

Meanwhile, the prime minister is expected to hold a call with Mr Putin this week and to travel to eastern Europe in the coming days before a meeting with NATO allies.

Labour accuse ministers' of 'completely contradictory' foreign policy

Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy accused the government of a ""completely contradictory"" approach in its foreign policy.

She compared the UK's desire to work with EU allies over Russia with ministers' continuing row with Brussels over Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland.

Ms Nandy told Sky News the government ""really ought to reassess"" its approach to issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol ""in the light of this very serious situation that's developing on the border of Ukraine"".

'Putin values his money more than human life'

Bill Browder, the campaigner who was one of the architect's of the UK's existing sanctions legislation, backed the seizure of Russian oligarchs' assets as ""the cleanest, safest and simplest way"" of deterring an invasion of Ukraine.

He told Sky News that Mr Putin had ""stolen an enormous amount of money"" during his two decades in power in Russia.

""That money he [Putin] doesn't keep in his own name, he keeps in the name of trustees - I call them 'oligarch trustees',"" Mr Browder said.

""And those oligarch trustees don't keep that money in Russia, they keep that money in the West.

""We see it in London, we see it in New York, we see it in the south of France.

""Putin values that money more than human life - he's killed a lot of people to get that money.

""So, in my mind, the cleanest, safest and simplest way of deterring Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine is to go after his money.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220130152028/https://news.sky.com/story/putins-oligarchs-will-have-nowhere-to-hide-with-widened-sanctions-if-russia-invades-ukraine-as-uk-rules-nothing-out-12528608;Category-1: politics
Rafael Nadal wins Australian Open to become most successful man in tennis history;Sunday 30 January 2022 14:43, UK;[];[];"Rafael Nadal has become the most successful man in tennis history by winning the Australian Open and his 21st Grand Slam title.

He took on Daniil Medvedev in a gruelling five-hour and 24-minute marathon - the second-longest in the tournament's history - to clinch the trophy.

At the winning moment, Nadal dropped his racket to the court in disbelief, before pumping his fists and celebrating with his support team.

The victory also makes him only the second man in the Open era after Djokovic to win each of the four titles at least twice, with Nadal finally adding a second Australia Open crown to the one he claimed in 2009.

It is a remarkable achievement, given Nadal feared a couple of months ago he may have to retire due to a chronic foot problem.

Image: Supporters cheered for Nadal throughout the five-hour-long match. Pic: AP

Reaching the final had already exceeded expectations of what Nadal could achieve and at first, it appeared he would fall short after Medvedev moved two sets ahead.

Most of the build-up focused on the historic significance of the Spaniard bidding for his 21st Grand Slam but he found himself under pressure from the start.

He saved two break points in a long third game but was then broken to love in the fifth as Medvedev, who was booed onto court by a section of the crowd, proved the steadier from the baseline.

Successive double faults then contributed to a second straight break and Medvedev served out the set 6-2.

Nadal began to play more offensively in the second set and twice managed to break the Medvedev serve.

The match was temporarily halted when an intruder made their way onto the court, waving a banner highlighting refugee detention and jumping down from the crowd.

He was only metres away from Medvedev but was tackled by security men and hauled out of the arena.

Medvedev - who is rapidly becoming the sport's favourite villain - was greeted by boos as he entered the Rod Laver Arena.

He became increasingly wound up by the crowd, with appeals to the umpire to control the ""idiots"", but kept a handle on his emotions a lot better than he had during his semi-final victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas, when he screamed at umpire Jaume Campistol.

His mood was not improved when he double-faulted to drop serve in the third game of the fourth set and, although he got back on terms immediately, Nadal took his seventh break point in the next game.

Earlier this week, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young announced they would remove their music from the streaming giant due to the spread of misinformation on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

A statement from Duke and Duchess was shared online by journalist Omid Scobie, the author of Finding Freedom, a much-contested biography of the couple.

The statement said: ""Since the inception of Archewell, we have worked to address the real-time global misinformation crisis. Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day.

""Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all too real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis.

""We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.""

Sky News has contacted the Archewell Foundation for comment.

In 2020 Meghan and Harry signed a multi-year partnership with Spotify, under their brand Archewell Audio for an undisclosed sum - thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds - in which they agreed to host and produce podcasts.

However, apart from a ""holiday special"" on 29 December 2020, they have failed to release any other material.

Now it appears Gimlet Projects, Spotify's podcast development team, is taking production in-house.

A job advert posted by Gimlet said: ""We're currently assembling a show team that will build and launch a new original show with Archewell featuring the voices of high profile women.""

After Neil Young removed his music from Spotify, the platform said it hoped it could ""welcome him back soon"" and regretted his decision to remove tracks.

In response to Young's concerns, Spotify said it aimed to balance ""both safety for listeners and freedom for creators"" and had removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic.

It acquired The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2020, reportedly for more than $100m (£77m). Since then, it has grown to be the top-rated podcast on the platform.

The force launched an investigation after being made aware of the images and footage earlier today.

It comes after United announced that Greenwood would not return to training or play any matches ""until further notice"" after he was accused of assaulting a woman.

The allegations were released on Instagram on Sunday morning and included video, photographs, and a voice note claimed to be a conversation between Greenwood and the woman.

They have since been deleted.

Manchester United said in an earlier statement: ""We are aware of images and allegations circulating on social media.

""We will not make any further comment until the facts have been established.

""Manchester United does not condone violence of any kind.""

The striker, 20, from Bradford, made his debut in 2019 and has since clocked up 129 appearances for the club.

Greenwood made his senior England debut in 2020.

Sportswear giant Nike, which sponsors Greenwood, said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220130200948/http://news.sky.com/story/mason-greenwood-arrested-on-suspicion-of-rape-and-assault-after-manchester-united-suspend-him-over-womans-allegations-12528951;Category-7: health

'I had to re-mortgage my home but I still gambled every day': Women encouraged to seek help for addiction;Monday 31 January 2022 00:52, UK;[];[];"A recovering compulsive gambler who ended up homeless with her young children after winning £127,000 playing poker is urging other women to seek help.

Lisa Walker, from Rainham in Essex, won the jackpot at a casino in Southend 20 years ago.

But what should have changed her life forever ended up fuelling her gambling until it became an uncontrollable addiction.

In all, she lost half a million pounds.

""My mortgage was £65,000 at the time,"" she said.

""I should have paid that off but I didn't because my gambling escalated.

""I'd drop the children off at school and I'd be going straight into the bookmakers as soon as it opened and writing out bets.""

Ms Walker, who first started betting for pennies as an eight-year-old, playing three card brag with her father, said: ""I'd be going to the bingo halls at 12 o'clock during the day to play on the fruit machines.""

The 49-year-old re-mortgaged her home and eventually lost it, ending up homeless with her children, then aged 10 and 11.

""I got rehoused but I still continued to gamble because every single day - that's all I could think about morning, noon and night.""

A new campaign by GambleAware aims to raise awareness of the signs that a person's gambling is getting out of control.

It also highlights where people can get help.

Image: Lisa Walker won £127,000 two decades years ago but it just encouraged her to gamble more

Research has revealed that up to a million women are at risk of harm due to gambling and the number gambling online has risen by 54% over the past four years, compared to a 28% increase for men.

But two in every five women suffering high levels of harm may not be getting help due to stigma or shame.

Four years ago, not long after spending her wedding night gambling in a Las Vegas casino, Ms Walker decided she needed to take action and went to her first Gamblers Anonymous meeting.

She was one of just two women in a room of nearly 40 people.

""I remember looking around the room thinking there's all these men, and I told my story and I said: 'I need help' and they gave me all the help I needed.""

She hasn't gambled since and is now a peer support worker about to set up a women's support group with the charity BetKnowMore.

""What I'm trying to do is to raise awareness and to make women feel like they can come out, and that it's safe for them to talk about it,"" she said.

Image: A new campaign by GambleAware aims to raise awareness of the signs that a person's gambling is getting out of control

Zoe Osmond, chief executive of GambleAware, said part of the problem is that it can be hard to tell when a person's gambling is getting out of hand.

She said: ""A lot of them see what they're doing as quite an innocent social fun activity and we need to make sure that they're aware of managing the amount of time they spend on it, the amount of money, and make sure that they don't hide their gambling from others.""

Many adverts about betting are directed at women and Ms Walker said it doesn't help that online gambling means ""you've got a 24-hour casino on your phone"".

She added: ""There's so much pressure on women now, you know, with jobs and children and what with COVID and mental health, and I just think women have been sitting indoors gambling.

""And I think also a lot of women don't want to come out. They don't want to admit that they've got a gambling problem because they feel ashamed.""

But Ms Walker is proof a new start is possible.

""I was that woman,"" she said. ""I was homeless. I had nothing. And I've changed my life around completely.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131010949/http://news.sky.com/story/i-had-to-re-mortgage-my-home-but-i-still-gambled-every-day-women-encouraged-to-seek-help-for-addiction-12529165;Category-7: health
Thousands of households still without power after weekend storms Malik and Corrie;Monday 31 January 2022 05:58, UK;[];[];"Power companies have said they hope to have reconnected power to all but 11,500 households overnight following two weekend storms.

Northern Powergrid, which supplies northern England, said around 80,000 customers were affected by Storm Malik, which brought winds of more than 90mph on Saturday.

Some 7,000 were still without power at 6.30pm on Sunday, although the company said that it hoped to cut that to 4,000 during the night.

Schools in Aberdeenshire are among those expected to delay opening or remain closed on Monday due to a lack of power or heating.

A nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen died after trees came down during Storm Malik on Saturday.

Storm Corrie hit on Sunday but its gusts are expected to slowly move away on Monday morning.

COVID-19: Ryanair warns of more turbulence ahead after Omicron 'hysteria' hit bookings;Monday 31 January 2022 07:43, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Ryanair has warned of more COVID-19 turbulence ahead as it blamed ""hysteria"" over the Omicron variant for a collapse in bookings over Christmas and reported a quarterly loss of €96m.

The airline said demand had improved since the recent lifting of travel restrictions but prices were having to be cut to fill up planes over the next couple of months after the recent slump.

However finance director Neil Sorahan told the Reuters news agency said there ""absolutely could be upward pressure on fares"" over the summer after rivals cut capacity.

Image: Mr O'Leary said the Omicron variant had generated ""media hysteria""

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""We would caution all shareholders to expect further COVID disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the world can finally declare that the COVID crisis is behind us.""

The carrier had warned last month of a hit to bookings and cut flights in January by a third.

Commenting on the latest results, Mr O'Leary pointed to ""the sudden emergence of the Omicron variant and the media hysteria it generated in December"" which he said ""forced European governments to reimpose travel restrictions in the run-up to Christmas"".

He said this had ""significantly weakened"" peak last-minute bookings and fares over Christmas and new year, cutting December traffic and load factors - a measure of how full planes are.

""While recent bookings have improved, following easing of travel restrictions… Q4 traffic requires significant price stimulation at lower prices to quickly recover load factors which suffered steep declines due to the Omicron collapse in bookings over the Christmas/New Year period,"" he added.

Ryanair expects to have carried just under 100 million passengers for its full-year to the end of March - at a loss of €250m-€450m.

The Dublin-based carrier hopes the roll-out of booster jabs and evidence about Omicron being less virulent than other variants will see more restrictions ease and restore consumer confidence ahead of Easter.

It sees capacity this summer topping pre-pandemic levels.

But Mr O'Leary cautioned that the outlook was ""hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow"".

The airline's loss of €96m for the third quarter to the end of December is narrower than the €321m loss it suffered a year earlier.

Customer numbers, at 31.1 million, were more than three times higher, and revenues of €1.47bn were 331% up on 2020 levels.

But the emergence of the Omicron variant meant it was a weaker than hoped for quarter after a promising start to the period when UK ""traffic light"" travel restrictions were scrapped in October.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131100903/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-ryanair-warns-of-more-turbulence-ahead-after-omicron-hysteria-hit-bookings-12529276;Category-2: business and economy
Dear Friend: Sir Paul McCartney reveals why song from 1971 album still makes him emotional;Monday 31 January 2022 06:17, UK;[];[];"Sir Paul McCartney has revealed that he still feels emotional listening to a song he wrote for fellow Beatle John Lennon after the famous band broke up.

Sir Paul, 79, was speaking about the track Dear Friend, which features on Wild Life, the debut album from Paul McCartney And Wings, a band formed in 1971 after The Beatles had split.

In a Q&A; featured on PaulMcCartney.com, Sir Paul said of the song: ""That's sort of me talking to John after we'd had all the sort of disputes about The Beatles break up.

""I find it very emotional when I listen to it now.

""I have to sort of choke it back.""

""This was me reaching out""

He added: ""I remember when I heard the song recently, listening to the roughs (remastering works-in-progress) in the car. And I thought, 'Oh God'. That lyric: 'Really truly, young and newly wed'.

""Listening to that was like, 'Oh my God, it's true'. I'm trying to say to John: 'Look, you know, it's all cool. Have a glass of wine. Let's be cool'.

""And luckily we did get it back together, which was like a great source of joy because it would have been terrible if he'd been killed as things were at that point and I'd never got to straighten it out with him.

""This was me reaching out. So, I think it's very powerful in some very simple way. But it was certainly heartfelt.""

Lennon was shot dead in 1980 at the age of 40.

A reissue of Wild Life as a limited edition half-speed mastered vinyl pressing will be released on 4 February just over 50 years since the original album.

Wild Life had eight tracks, including Mumbo, and Bip Bop, and Sir Paul said it was recorded in ""barely more than a week"", with most of the songs captured in a single take.

Asked if there were songs he had forgotten about before remastering the album, Sir Paul said: ""Yeah, absolutely.

""Well, to tell you the truth, I don't listen to my old albums much, you know. I just don't.

""So, I mean, to me it's very strange that I would dare to do a track like Mumbo. To open an album with a track that hasn't got any lyrics, it's like, 'Whoah!' I mean, I think it's kind of cool now.

Cyprus: British woman wins appeal to overturn conviction for lying about gang rape;Monday 31 January 2022 11:44, UK;[];[];"A British woman found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has won her appeal to overturn the conviction at the country's Supreme Court, her lawyers said.

The then 19-year-old, from Derby, was given a suspended four-month jail term in 2020 after a judge found her guilty of public mischief following a trial.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told police she was attacked by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room, during a party in Ayia Napa on 17 July 2019, but was charged after signing a retraction statement 10 days later.

The now 21-year-old university student has maintained she was pressured by officers to withdraw the allegation and has vowed to clear her name having flown back to the UK after being sentenced.

The woman's Cypriot lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said: ""This is a very important day for women's rights and in particular for victims of rape or other forms of sexual violence in Cyprus.

""The acquittal by the supreme court of the young teenager points to the failure of the authorities to effectively investigate the rape claims she reported. This is what we will now pursue.""

Her family said in a statement: ""It is a great relief we hear that the authorities in Cyprus have recognised the flaws in their legal process.

""Whilst this decision doesn't excuse the way she was treated by the police or the judge or those in authority, it does bring with it the hope that my daughter's suffering will at least bring positive changes in the way that victims of crime are treated.

""Of course, if justice is to be done, an authority would need to pick up on the evidence that was gathered in Cyprus and do with it what should have happened at the outset.""

The British lawyer who coordinated the appeal, Michael Polak, from the Justice Abroad organisation, said the ""next step for justice"" in her case is for a ""full review and investigation"" of the rape allegations by a different police force.

During the appeal hearing last year, the woman's lawyers said her retraction statement should never have been admitted into evidence because it was made by a vulnerable teenager who had spent almost seven hours in a police station without legal representation.

Ms Charalambidou also said the lower court had started from the position that there was no rape and had failed to understand the offence of public mischief, which requires a false statement of a make-believe crime.

She said the trial judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, did not allow the defendant to talk about the alleged rape and had said seven times that ""this is not a rape trial"".

He was also accused of ignoring defence expert evidence and not taking account police failures in investigating the rape allegations.

When he sentenced the woman in 2020, the judge said the evidence showed she had ""lied"", adding: ""Her psychological state, her youth, that she has been away from her family, her friends and academic studies this year, this has led me to decide to give her a second chance and suspend the sentence for three years.""

The 12 Israeli men and boys arrested over the incident, aged between 15 and 20 at the time, denied any wrongdoing and were freed.

Mr Polak said: ""This is a watershed moment, not just for our client who has always maintained her innocence even when doing so caused her the hardship of not being able to return home during the lengthy trial proceedings, but also for others around the world in similar positions.

""We have always maintained that our client was not given a fair trial and today the Supreme Court of Cyprus has agreed with us.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131120847/http://news.sky.com/story/cyprus-british-woman-wins-appeal-to-overturn-conviction-for-lying-about-gang-rape-12529445;Category-7: health

Jaguar Land Rover chalks up fresh £9m loss and sees chip shortages extending throughout 2022;Monday 31 January 2022 14:58, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest car maker, has spluttered to a further quarterly loss due to ongoing chip shortages and said the problems would persist for the rest of 2022.

But JLR said the situation had ""improved somewhat"" from the previous quarter, which was hit by one-off factors such as COVID-19 outbreaks in south east Asia.

The £9m third quarter loss follows a £302m shortfall in the second quarter and first quarter that was £110m in the red.

Image: JLR said 69% of vehicles sold were electric or hybrid

It compares with a profit of £439m reported in the third quarter a year earlier.

JLR said that while production and sales remained ""significantly constrained by semiconductor shortages"", it continued to see strong demand with global retail orders at record levels.

Revenues of £4.72bn in the third quarter were £1.27bn lower than in 2020 with retail sales of 80,126 down by 38% and wholesales to dealers 33% lower at 69,182.

Meanwhile, its mix of electric and hybrid vehicle sales has risen to 69%, up from 53% in the same period in 2020.

The company, owned by India's Tata Motors, said: ""The semiconductor shortage is expected to continue through 2022 but is expected to gradually improve as capacity increases.""

JLR also said it was engaging with suppliers to try to secure components on the longer term.

It said that ""with this gradual expected improvement"" it expected fourth quarter profits to improve compared with the third quarter.

But for 2021/22 to date the losses add up to £421m and if JLR is in the red again for the full year it will be the fourth annual loss in a row for the carmaker.

The company reported a pre-tax loss of £861m for the year to the end of March 2021, after posting a shortfall of £422m a year earlier and a record £3.6bn loss in 2019

JLR has been seeking to improve its financial performance through a transformation programme which it expects to beat targets by delivering £1.4bn in savings in the current financial year.

Chief executive Thierry Bollore said: ""Whilst semiconductor supplies have continued to constrain sales this quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our products underlining the desirability of our vehicles.""

The results come after industry figures last week showed UK car manufacturing at its weakest level since 1956 as a result of the chip shortage which has hit manufacturers worldwide.

Elsewhere, electric car maker Tesla has said its performance in recent quarters was held back by the lack of semiconductors and that the issue would extend into this year, even as it delivered an annual profit haul of $5.5bn.

Cara Delevingne says she would have 'hated herself less' if she had LGBTQ+ role model growing up;Tuesday 1 February 2022 09:21, UK;[];[];"British model Cara Delevingne has said she would have ""hated herself less"" and ""not have been so ashamed"" if she had an LGBTQ+ role model growing up.

The 29-year-old previously described herself as pansexual and bisexual, but said last year that how she sexually identifies frequently changes.

Delevingne also said her struggles with her sexuality left her with suicidal thoughts.

In the past she has dated Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson and musician St Vincent, both women, but has said ""now I really value my privacy so much"".

Speaking about the lack of LGBTQ+ role models growing up, Delevingne told Harper's Bazaar UK: ""I do think I would have hated myself less, I would have not been so ashamed, if I'd had someone.

""The one thing I'm happy about growing up queer and fighting it and hiding it is, it gives me so much fire and drive to try to make people's lives easier in some way by talking about it.""

PlayStation maker Sony snaps up US games developer behind Destiny in $3.6bn deal;Tuesday 1 February 2022 07:39, UK;[];[];"PlayStation maker Sony has announced a $3.6bn deal to buy Bungie, the games developer behind titles such as Destiny.

It comes two weeks after Microsoft, maker of the rival Xbox console, said it was paying $68.7bn for Activision Blizzard, whose titles include Call of Duty and Candy Crush.

US-based Bungie was founded in 1991 and early hits included Myth and Marathon.

It was bought by Microsoft in 2000, under whose ownership it developed the Halo franchise.

Microsoft spun off the game studio in 2007 but retained the rights to Halo.

Sony has already been strengthening its network of in-house games studios in recent years - delivering a string of hits including its Spiderman franchise.

It also has titles such as Gran Turismo 7 and Horizon Forbidden West in the pipeline.

Jim Ryan, head of the Sony division responsible for PlayStation, said of the Bungie deal: ""This is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience.""

Sony had suffered a sharp share price fall after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was announced.

That deal will make the US tech giant the third biggest gaming company in global sales, behind Japan's Sony and China's TenCent.

It prompted concerns that, under Microsoft, Activision games might be pulled from PlayStation's systems, even though that would mean sacrificing a major source of revenue.

Sony's shares initially rose 2% on the Bungie deal though it later gave up most of those gains.

Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis, said: ""While this is one of Sony's biggest ever acquisitions, the amount paid by Microsoft puts into the context the heavy competition faced in this sector.""

The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation at the start of this year.

Child protection referral numbers rise as NSPCC calls domestic abuse increase 'tip of the iceberg';Tuesday 1 February 2022 09:54, UK;[];[];"Police made an average of 669 child protection referrals to social services every day last year due to domestic abuse across England and Wales, new figures show.

The 244,197 referrals in 2020-21 were an 8% increase on the previous year and have been described by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) as the ""tip of the iceberg"".

The figures - from NSPCC analysis of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services data - come amid calls to do more to help children affected by domestic violence.

The Domestic Abuse Act has meant that children are now able to be officially recognised as victims of domestic abuse, but the NSPCC said more needs to be done to ensure their needs are considered.

'Use the Victim's Law'

Anna Edmundson, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said: ""Sadly, we know these figures are the tip of the iceberg as domestic abuse often goes unreported.

""Domestic abuse can derail a childhood and it is unacceptable that support to recover remains patchy across the country, and what is available risks being axed by cash-strapped councils.

""We urge (justice secretary) Dominic Raab to use the Victim's Law to address this and ensure young victims of domestic abuse have easy access to professional services within their community so they can rebuild their lives no matter where they live.""

Local authorities must provide accommodation-based support services, such as refuges, when families need to leave their homes to escape domestic abuse.

But they do not have the same obligation to provide specialist and therapeutic services in the community for victims who remain at home after suffering domestic abuse.

Cash-strapped councils

The NSPCC said support across the country could ""dwindle further"" as cash-strapped councils divert more resources to accommodation-based services despite the majority of victims using community-based services.

According to Women's Aid, 148,852 children were supported by community-based services in 2020/21 compared to 11,890 in refuges.

Terri White, a journalist and author, lived in an abusive home as a child, with both she and her mother being assaulted by her mother's partners.

She said: ""I lived through violence as a child and can testify to the physical, emotional and mental trauma you're left with which can be life-long. That trauma has taken me decades to work through.""

A government spokesperson said: ""We are determined to deliver the support that victims of all ages need and through our Victims' Law consultation we will ensure no one is left to suffer alone.

""We are also investing £150 million in support services and spending £3 million this year on specialist help for children who experience domestic abuse, providing practical assistance every step of the way.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201092516/http://news.sky.com/story/tip-of-the-iceberg-child-protection-referral-numbers-rise-12530006;Category-3: environment

The actor co-hosts ABC talk show The View and was taking part in a discussion about a US school board's decision to ban Maus, a Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel about the experiences of a Holocaust survivor.

Goldberg, 66, had said: ""Let's be truthful - the Holocaust isn't about race.

""It's about man's inhumanity to man - that's what it's about.""

When one of her co-hosts said the Holocaust was ""about white supremacy"", Goldberg replied: ""But these are two white groups of people.

""You're missing the point. The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley.

""Let's talk about it for what it is - it's how people treat each other.

""It's a problem.

Her words prompted a furious reaction, with criticism from Jewish organisations and others.

Cost of living surge yet to dent housing market as prices see strongest start to year since 2005;Tuesday 1 February 2022 08:04, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"House price growth picked up to 11.2% in January - the strongest start to the year since 2005, according to figures from lender Nationwide.

It suggested the surge in the cost of living, with inflation at a near 30-year high, had yet to dent housing market activity, the lender said.

The year-on-year pace of growth was faster than the 10.4% seen in December and the strongest since June though Nationwide still thinks this will slow down later in 2022.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 Why are your bills going up?

Prices rose by 0.8% month-on-month, the sixth such increase in a row, to an average £255,556.

Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said housing demand had ""remained robust"" with mortgage approvals still running above pre-pandemic levels even after a surge in activity in 2021 spurred by a stamp duty holiday.

That high level of activity coupled with a low level of properties for sale has helped push prices higher.

But Mr Gardner said: ""While the outlook remains uncertain, it is likely that the housing market will slow this year.""

The surge in house prices at a much faster pace than earnings growth has made property much less affordable, something that was ""likely to exert a dampening impact on market activity and house price growth"".

Sharp increases in the cost of living, with inflation at 5.4% and set to rise further as expected energy bill increases take hold in the spring, are also putting household finances under strain.

Image: More Bank of England rate rises could dampen the market

Mr Gardner said: ""This rapid rise in inflation has been an important factor denting consumer confidence in recent months, especially how people see their own personal financial situation evolving, although as yet, this has done little to dent housing market activity.""

More interest rate rises - with another hike by the Bank of England expected this week after it raised its base rate from 0.1% to 0.25% in December - might also dampen the market.

""This will further reduce housing affordability if it feeds through to higher mortgage rates, although to date a significant proportion of the rise in longer term interest rates seen in recent months has been absorbed by lenders,"" Mr Gardner added.

Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, shared the view that house price growth was likely to slow this year as household budgets are squeezed.

""Admittedly, house prices could be boosted if households are willing to deploy the excess savings they accumulated during the pandemic-now equal to around 8% of annual GDP-to finance a home purchase, especially as pandemic-related uncertainty eases,"" she said.

""But house price growth has struggled during periods of high inflation, due to the resulting hit to real incomes.""

Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: ""Don't expect a return to single-digit house price growth until supply picks up.

""Demand has been unrelenting over the last several months, despite the absence of a stamp duty holiday and the presence of an Omicron surge.

""The high level of market valuations requested by prospective sellers in January indicates that supply will pick up as more owners decide now is the time to act.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201120841/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-surge-yet-to-dent-housing-market-as-prices-see-strongest-start-to-year-since-2005-12530075;Category-2: business and economy

Britain's biggest supermarket said it was moving overnight re-stocking to the daytime in 36 large stores and 49 convenience stores.

It is also converting 36 of its petrol stations to become pay-at-pump only sites during overnight hours.

The announcement comes a day after Tesco said it was scrapping its discount store brand Jack's with the closure of seven stores and loss of around 130 jobs, while also shutting meat, deli and fish counters at more than 300 sites.

It said that the combined result of the announcements would be to put around 1,600 roles at risk of redundancy across the business but that it aimed to offer alternative roles to as many as possible, with 3,000 vacancies currently needing to be filled.

Tesco said the changes to overnight roles came after it found that by moving stock replenishment to daytime trading hours it could ensure more staff were on the shop floor to help customers at peak times.

Jason Tarry, Tesco's UK and Ireland boss, said: ""We operate in a highly competitive and fast-paced market and our customers are shopping differently, especially since the start of the pandemic.

""We are always looking at how we can run our business as simply and efficiently as possible, so that we can re-invest in the things that matter most to customers.

""The changes we are announcing today will help us do this.

Customers can scan the barcodes while using the Royal Mail app and will eventually be able to watch videos, information about services, or even birthday messages and other greetings from senders.

At the moment, a video featuring Shaun the Sheep, created exclusively for Royal Mail by animation studio Aardman, is available to view.

It is the first in a series of planned videos to be released during 2022 that will allow customers sending stamped mail to choose which one the recipient can see when they receive an item of mail.

Wordle: How a simple online game became a million-dollar viral phenomenon snapped up by the New York Times;Tuesday 1 February 2022 12:07, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];[];"Could today's word be MONEY? Perhaps GAMES? Or DEALS, or TIMES, or even VIRAL?

Just kidding, of course. I've already done my Wordling for the day. No spoilers here.

Welcome to Wordle, the free online daily word game that has reportedly amassed millions of players since its inception just four months ago. For many, it has become a daily obsession, some staying up at night to get their fix first thing.

The appeal is in its simplicity: pick a five-letter word, any five-letter word, and start from there.

If any letters turn green, they're correct and in the right place. Yellow = right letter, wrong place; grey means try again. Six goes to get to the word of the day, and that's it. No hints or cheats. You get your next game when the clock strikes midnight.

Wordle 223 2/6



⬜🟩⬜🟨⬜

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 — Gemma Peplow 💙 (@gemmapeplow) January 28, 2022

It all started with a software engineer who wanted to create a simple game for his partner - which has now been bought by The New York Times for a seven-figure sum.

Living in a digital world in which we are bombarded by adverts, requests for data and downloads, Wordle is so simple even the biggest luddites can easily get to grips with it. It is also free. And it has created an online community, one in which players can easily share and discuss their results on social media spoiler-free, thanks to a simple emoji grid, so there's no danger of ruining that day's game for anyone else.

The green, yellow and grey emoji squares tell a story - all green on the second attempt (or even first for some) is pretty much down to luck, but those who do the rounds through a series of yellows and greens to get the right answer are using all their Wordle skills to get there. Those who have played that day's game can decipher others' emoji results codes to see how they did it.

It is also refreshing, when most other apps and games created to addict, that Wordle will only take a few minutes of your time. It always leaves you wanting more.

How to be a good Wordler

Some players have Wordle strategies. Start with the same word every day and one day, like the infinite monkey theorem (that a monkey hitting keys at random for an infinite amount of time will one day type the complete works of Shakespeare), your word will come up first time.

And it's good to start with a word with lots of the most common letters - mine is TEARS, if you were wondering - as they're most likely to come up

There has even been talk of some players having spreadsheets keeping note of all the words that have been played so far, so they know which ones to avoid.

Also, remember US spellings aren't always the same as in the UK (as many British players found out the hard way with FAVOR).

Image: Wordle has joined The New York Times for a seven-figure sum

Wordle origins

The game was started by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from Brooklyn, New York. Originally created for his partner, Palak Shah, he released it to the public in October. On 1 November, only 90 people had played it. Within two months that number had grown to 300,000, and it continues to snowball.

According to The New York Times (NYT), the viral phenomenon now has millions of players.

Announcing the newspaper's takeover, Mr Wardle tweeted to say Wordle had become ""bigger than I ever imagined (which I suppose isn't that much of a feat given I made the game for an audience of 1)"".

He said it had been ""incredible"" watching the game grow in popularity but also ""a little overwhelming"", hence his decision to sell.

Ms Shah was instrumental in getting the game ready for the public, Mr Wardle has said, having narrowed down the initial list of all of the five-letter words in the English language (about 12,000) to the ones that people will actually have heard of (about 2,500, which means it will last for a good few years yet).

Speaking about the game being created for her, she told the NYT: ""It's really sweet. This is definitely how Josh shows his love.""

Don't try Lewdle at work

The game has become so popular that there are now imitations.

Airportle, for example, gives players the chance to guess airport abbreviations, while Lewdle is the NSFW (not suitable for work) version (and it's much harder than the original).

In an interview with the NYT earlier in January, Mr Wardle explained the game's popularity. ""I think people kind of appreciate that there's this thing online that's just fun,"" he said. ""It's not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It's just a game that's fun.""

Moving to The New York Times

The NYT has listed listed the purchase price as being in the ""low-seven figures,"" but did not disclose specifics.

The newspaper, which has popular word games such as Spelling Bee and its crossword puzzle, has assured fans that ""at the time it moves to The New York Times, Wordle will be free to play for new and existing players, and no changes will be made to its gameplay"".

Jonathan Knight, general manager for The New York Times Games, said: ""The game has done what so few games have done: It has captured our collective imagination, and brought us all a little closer together.

""We could not be more thrilled to become the new home and proud stewards of this magical game, and are honoured to help bring Josh Wardle's cherished creation to more solvers in the months ahead.

Children sexually exploited in all parts of England and Wales as abusers find 'new ways' to groom them, inquiry finds;Tuesday 1 February 2022 12:05, UK;['ali fortescue', '@alifortescue'];[];"Children are being sexually exploited by networks in all parts of England and Wales in the ""most degrading and destructive ways"", according to a report by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA).

The report found that perpetrators are finding ""new ways"" to groom younger children, including through social media and dating apps.

It also found examples of children, including babies, being livestreamed for money, and sometimes sexually abused at the direction of the paying perpetrator.

It comes as ""extensive failures"" by local authorities and police forces mean they are struggling to keep pace with the changing nature of sexual exploitation of children by networks, the report found.

The inquiry looked at six local authority areas: St Helens, Tower Hamlets, Swansea, Durham, Bristol and Warwickshire.

It heard evidence about more than 30 children and young people, and survivors who described their experiences between 2003 and 2011.

One survivor, who was first abused when she was 12, described being forced to perform a sex act on more than 20 adult men.

A number of men were charged, but the charges were later dropped and a few months later she told the inquiry she was abducted by another group of men at gunpoint.

She was placed back into care and returned to ""a pattern of repeated self-harm"".

Dramatic rise in online-linked sexual crimes against children leads to calls for tougher regulations

It said there is a ""flawed assumption"" that child sexual exploitation was decreasing, when in reality it has become more of a ""hidden problem"" that is underreported unless linked to other forms of criminal behaviour such as county lines.

It said children had been described as ""at risk"" despite clear evidence harm had occurred and too many victims of exploitation are treated as offenders.

The report makes a number of recommendations, including strengthening the criminal justice system, updating government guidance on child sexual exploitation and better data collection by police forces and local authorities.

It is the inquiry's eighteenth report into child sex abuse; the final report, into residential schools, will be published next month.

Record use of Dover emergency traffic measures as new Brexit border checks bite;Tuesday 1 February 2022 17:46, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Emergency traffic measures to control congestion at the Port of Dover have already been used as many times this year as in the first six months of 2021 combined, following the introduction of new Brexit border checks.

Figures provided to Sky News by National Highways reveal the Dover Traffic Access Protocol (TAP), designed to prevent tailbacks of lorries causing gridlock in the town centre, has been instigated 18 times since 1 January.

That compares to 69 times in total during 2021, almost half of which occurred in the last two months of the year.

The TAP was not used once during January 2021, when freight volumes were very low because of COVID restrictions, concerns over the end of the Brexit transition and the impact of the French border closure ordered by Emanuel Macron.

Even allowing for a return to more normal trade volumes however, this year's figures are historically high.

Figures seen by Sky News show that between 2016 and 2020 the TAP was instigated at most nine times in January, with just three instances in 2019, pre-COVID and the last year the UK was a full member of the European Union.

Under the TAP lorries are confined to a 40mph speed limit and required to use only the inside lane of the A20 approaching Dover to allow local and passenger traffic to flow through the town.

In January, the TAP was instigated at the request of the Port of Dover on 17 occasions, resulting in tailbacks of parked vehicles up to six miles long.

It was activated at 4.16am on Tuesday at the request of the Port of Dover and is still in place at the time of writing, taking the total to 18 occasions in the first 32 days of 2022.

The latest queues come despite the return to service of all three DFDS ferries on the Dover-Calais route following routine maintenance.

Last month, government minister Baroness Vere said queues at Dover were a consequence of the vessels being out of use, not new Brexit red tape introduced on 1 January at the border with the EU in both directions.

Exporters and hauliers are now required to make customs declarations before traveling using the government's Goods Vehicle Movement System, which also manages transit and security information.

Previously, exporters had a 60-day window in which to complete the paperwork after shipments had been made.

Anecdotally hauliers report the new checks are taking up to 15 minutes per vehicle even when all documentation is in order.

There have also been reports of long queues at the inland border facility at Ashford where hauliers receive clearance to travel.

Rod McKenzie, a spokesman for the Road Haulage Association, said: ""It's clear there are teething problems with the new border systems that came in.

""The test will be if these queues and other issues subside as traders get used to the red tape.

""If they continue for much longer it suggests the problems may be more serious than just teething trouble.""

Boris Johnson: No 10 refuses to comment on fresh reports detailing lockdown parties PM allegedly attended;Tuesday 1 February 2022 22:51, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];[];"Downing Street has refused to comment on reports that reveal details of lockdown parties Boris Johnson is alleged to have attended.

In new allegations this evening, two newspapers detail claims he attended a party in his flat and also went to two separate leaving dos.

In the pared-back report released by Sue Gray on Monday, she revealed three lockdown events in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office that had previously not been publicly known about.

These events are being investigated by the Metropolitan Police and Ms Gray gave little detail about them yesterday.

Mr Johnson is reported to have given a speech at two of the events, according to reports in The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph.

Asked by Sky News about the new allegations, Downing Street declined to comment.

PM 'seen going up to Mamma Mia flat party'

Following earlier reports a gathering was held in Mr Johnson's flat on 13 November 2020, the day his top adviser Dominic Cummings left, the Telegraph has now said the PM was seen heading up to his flat that evening. Mr Johnson has refused to comment on any reports.

His wife, Carrie Johnson, was reportedly there and Abba songs including The Winner Takes It All were heard, the Mail on Sunday reported.

On Tuesday, Mr Cummings claimed there were photographs of the ""party"" and others in the building could hear music.

The three previously unknown events, Sue Gray's report says, were held on 18 June 2020, 17 December 2020 and 14 January 2021.

'Alcohol and 20 people' while indoor mixing banned

On 18 June 2020, Ms Gray said an event at the Cabinet Office involved ""the departure of a No 10 private secretary"".

The private secretary is understood to be senior diplomat Hannah Young, according to The Guardian and The Telegraph.

She was Mr Johnson's lead official on home affairs policy and left to become deputy consul general in New York.

There were allegedly 20 people, alcohol was being drunk and Martin Reynolds, the PM's principal private secretary who organised the ""bring your own booze"" party, was there and had earlier contacted senior advisers for advice on holding the leaving do, the Telegraph said.

Regulations at the time banned indoor mixing, with the rule of six applied to outdoors.

PM 'gave speech' at military adviser's leaving do

The 17 December 2020 event, called ""a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a No 10 official"" by Ms Gray, is understood to have been for Captain Steve Higham, the Telegraph said.

He was one of the PM's military and national security advisers and Mr Johnson is understood to have given a speech but, the Mirror earlier said he only stayed for a few minutes.

The day before, London had been placed in Tier 3, which meant there was no mixing of households indoors.

Prosecco and PM speech

On 14 January 2021, Ms Gray revealed she and the police were looking into ""a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries"".

It is understood one of them moved on to become a senior civil servant at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport while the other is unknown.

Prosecco was drunk, Mr Johnson is understood to have attended and, the Guardian reports, he gave a speech and left after five minutes.

England was in its third national lockdown at the time, with people prohibited from mixing indoors with other households, and it came a few weeks after Christmas was effectively cancelled.

The other two events the PM is believed to have attended that are being investigated by the Met are the 20 May 2020 ""BYOB"" party in the Number 10 garden and his birthday on 19 June 2020 in the Cabinet room at No 10.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201230947/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-no-10-refuses-to-comment-on-fresh-reports-detailing-lockdown-parties-pm-allegedly-attended-12530611;Category-1: politics

Tearless onions: Vegetable that can be chopped without irritating eyes to go on sale in UK in Waitrose;Tuesday 11 January 2022 16:55, UK;[];[];"Waitrose says it will become the first UK retailer to sell tearless onions.

""Sunions"", which have been available in the US since 2018, are said to be a sweet variety of the vegetable that ""doesn't reduce cooks to tears"".

Grown in Spain, they will retail at £1.50 for a three-pack when they go on sale online and in selected stores from Tuesday next week.

Image: The products will see for £1.50 for a packet of three Pic: Waitrose

That works out at 50p an onion, compared with 14p for a typical essential 150g onion bought loose from the supermarket.

The products were first developed by agricultural giant Bayer - then taken over by chemicals firm BASF when it acquired some of Bayer's seeds and crop business.

They were not created through genetic modification, instead coming about after decades of cross-breeding of less pungent strains of onion.

A website promoting the products says: ""Volatile compounds in onions are responsible for tearing and pungent flavour and the amounts of those compounds in other onions remain the same or increase over time.

""In Sunions, these compounds do the exact opposite and decrease to create a tearless, sweet and mild onion.""

However, the products were described in a review published by the Washington Post - which confirmed they did not cause tears - as ""flavourless"".

Waitrose said the tearless onions were ""perfect for those with sensitive eyes as well as cooking in the kitchen with children"".

World Bank sees 'pronounced slowdown' in global growth as COVID and inflation pressures bite;Tuesday 11 January 2022 19:40, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"The World Bank has warned of a ""pronounced slowdown"" in global growth as threats from new COVID-19 variants and cost of living pressures bite.

It also pointed to the risks of debt and income inequality as it stressed in particular the risk to emerging and developing economies.

The warning came as separate figures showed inflation across the OECD, a group of 38 mostly developed countries, was at a 25-year high amid soaring food and energy prices.

Image: Inflation across the OECD area is at a 25-year high

Elsewhere, there were signs of continued pressure on global supply chains as shipping giant Maersk said the new year ""has not started off as we had hoped"", with new outbreaks snarling up trade.

The World Bank's report said that after a strong rebound in 2021 with estimated growth of 5.5%, global expansion looked set to decelerate sharply to 4.1% this year - revised down from a previous estimate of 4.3% - and 3.2% in 2023.

Global GDP shrank by 3.4% in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.

The report pointed to the wave of pent-up demand after lockdowns dissipated and huge levels of support from governments and central banks around the world being wound down.

It said that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant ""indicates that the pandemic will likely continue to disrupt economic activity in the near term"".

In addition, slowing growth in bigger economies such as the US and China will hurt demand for what they buy from emerging and developing countries, it added.

With many developing nations lacking the means to support their economies if needed, the report said new COVID outbreaks, persistent supply chain strains, inflation pressures and high debt levels ""could increase the risk of a hard landing"".

The period ahead will see a widening divergence between richer and poorer nations with all advanced economies expected to have achieved a full recovery in output by 2023 but emerging and developing nations still 4% below the pre-pandemic trend, it added.

World Bank president David Malpass said: ""The world economy is simultaneously facing COVID-19, inflation, and policy uncertainty, with government spending and monetary policies in uncharted territory.""

Separate figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed inflation across its 38 member countries at 5.8% in November, up from 5.2% in October, and the highest rate since May 1996.

Notably, price rises in the US were at a 39-year high of 6.8%.

In Britain, inflation hit a decade high of 5.1% in November.

The OECD area as a whole saw energy prices soar by 27.7%, the highest rate since June 1980, while food price inflation hit 5.5%.

Among the factors putting pressure on prices is the combination of buoyant demand with a supply chain that is still struggling as a result of the pandemic.

Image: Maersk said shop waiting times at Felixstowe were at more than a week

Maersk, the world's biggest shipping company, warned in November that there was ""little visibility"" about when supply bottlenecks would end.

In a downbeat advisory note to clients on Tuesday, it said: ""Unfortunately, 2022 has not started off as we had hoped.

""The pandemic is still going strong and unfortunately, we are seeing new outbreaks impacting our ability to move your cargo.

""General sickness remains high as key ports in key regions are seeing new COVID-19 peaks.

""We recognise that this is causing delays to our customers' supply-chains and mitigating those disruptions is of the utmost importance to us.""

In Europe, delays at the port of Antwerp were easing from ten days to two days though in Britain's Felixstowe waiting times for ships to dock remained at more than a week.

Abdul Elahi: Police 'blamed victims' and failed to connect more than a dozen reports about online sexual predator;Wednesday 12 January 2022 02:54, UK;['alexander martin', '@alexmartin'];[];"A prolific online sexual predator was caught only after investigators at the FBI contacted the UK's National Crime Agency despite more than a dozen of his victims reporting him to British police beforehand, Sky News has learnt.

Last month 26-year-old Abdul Elahi was jailed for 32 years after pleading guilty to 158 offences including blackmailing victims to abuse themselves, their siblings, and children.

Some of the girls and women who Elahi coerced into sending intimate images of themselves have complained about their interactions with British police, being repeatedly told that they shouldn't have sent the messages, and incorrectly informed that there was no way to investigate the person who had blackmailed them because they used WhatsApp to communicate.

""The lifelong mental effects faced by victims could be decreased massively if we were listened to when speaking up in the first place,"" one of his victims, who had been blackmailed when she was still in secondary school, told Sky News.

""The acts are described as 'awful' and 'some of the worst ever seen' when talking about all of his victims combined but when it was just me going to my local police station, somehow the blame was on me,"" she added.

Victims, academics, and support groups are calling for additional training for police in both receiving reports from victims and investigating similar cases in the future.

CPS demands meant delay in prosecuting Elahi

Elahi targeted nearly 2,000 people, including financially vulnerable victims on social media platforms and underage users on so-called ""sugar daddy"" websites, between 1 January 2017 and 7 August 2020.

At least 196 of his victims were in the UK.

He had initially been arrested on 19 December 2018 but continued to offend for almost two years as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not believe there was enough evidence to press charges against him.

A spokesperson for the CPS told Sky News: ""There had been a huge investigation covering several countries which involved a vast amount of evidence that had to be examined thoroughly. We charged Elahi as soon as our legal test was met.

""The prosecution case was so strong that Elahi pleaded guilty. His 32-year prison sentence reflects the appalling offences he committed against so many people,"" they added.

A spokesperson for the National Crime Agency (NCA) said: ""Abdul Elahi is one of the worst sexual offenders the agency has ever investigated and caused utter devastation to victims all round the world.

""The investigation into his offending was extremely complex involving 20 countries, thousands of potential victims and a series of linked offenders.""

In reference to the CPS demands regarding evidence collection, they said: ""Critically, prosecutors required the NCA to reflect the totality of Elahi's industrial offending which involved an enormous amount of work with information required from foreign jurisdictions which is a very lengthy process.

""To manage the risk around Elahi we secured a court imposed sexual risk order after he was first arrested and arrested him three times in total before he was convicted and jailed for 32 years,"" they added.

Elahi's initial arrest by NCA officers in 2018 followed the agency being contacted by the FBI, which investigated him over the suspected blackmailing of a 15-year-old girl.

The NCA confirmed that it was aware of 13 victims who had reported his crimes to local police forces before Elahi was identified as a result of the American and British investigation.

""The NCA and NPCC are working together to ensure that victims of mass offenders receive a co-ordinated response,"" the agency said.

Image: NCA officers were 'really empathetic' compared to local police, one victim said. File pic: Reuters

Victim told she 'was in the wrong'

Several of the girls and women targeted by Elahi complained that they felt blamed as victims by the responses they received from police.

One who spoke to Sky News said she was told on three occasions she shouldn't have sent images of herself to the prolific blackmailer when reporting the initial offence, and that ""I was in the wrong as I was the one who had created the child pornography"".

There is no defence in the law that protects children who have been coerced into creating indecent images of themselves. As a result, although such victims are generally not prosecuted, police do record them as suspects when taking down the details of these crimes - potentially driving some officers to tell the victims that they shouldn't have sent the pictures.

The same victim told Sky News she was surprised when specialist officers from the NCA turned up at her house as she had no prior contact with the agency.

She described her experience with them as ""completely different"" as they were ""really empathetic compared to the police I spoke to"".

""They were quite focused on making sure I felt like it wasn't my fault and that I could come to them if I needed any more help with it. And it was just a whole lot more understanding, really,"" she said.

Sophie Mortimer, manager at the Revenge Porn Helpline which assists victims in removing their images from the web, told Sky News she had also heard complaints about how police and call handlers received these reports and supported demands for more training.

Image: The FBI contacted the NCA after investigating the blackmailing of a 15-year-old girl

Police 'lack cyber investigation skills'

In a victim statement another girl who had been blackmailed by Elahi said: ""The basic message I got from [the police] was just that I shouldn't have done it, and there's not really much they can do because it's through WhatsApp which is all encrypted messaging.

""A lot of it for me was on Skype as well, so there was pretty much no evidence of the details of what he'd done,"" she added.

But there is a significant amount of information that investigators can glean from services such as Skype, which does not use end-to-end encryption, and even from WhatsApp, which does, as the successful FBI and NCA investigation proved.

The value of this data depends on the steps that the suspect has taken to anonymise themselves, but their phone number and IP address should allow law enforcement to begin to identify them and how they operate.

Even in end-to-end encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp, the message content is still available if police have the victim's phone.

In cases where the victim had deleted the messages and blocked Elahi's number, his number itself could have been retrieved from the app's blocked list - allowing police to send a request for information about that number to WhatsApp and to the mobile network operator.

""They didn't really seem that interested in that part of it,"" one victim told Sky News about their interaction with police, adding: ""They never even suggested a way they could take it further.""

Research from the University of Suffolk published in 2018 found that roughly 95% of police staff have never received any training in investigating non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

For nearly half of the staff who had received training in how to conduct these investigations, it had been delivered via an online tutorial, just over half of whom said they found it moderately useful, and nearly a third only slightly useful.

The study - which said there was ""an urgent need for training across police forces"" - also reported that fewer than a fifth of police force members knew how to collect evidence from technology companies.

""The reluctance to invest in cybercrime related resources and training may be a deterrent in reducing online criminal behaviour,"" it added.

The lack of skills and training to investigate Elahi's crimes - as victims described the police responses - also stands in contrast to a report on digital investigations by Europol which ranked the content of messages as only the seventh most important type of evidence that law enforcement could collect.

The most important types of evidence according to Europol were connection logs and the IP address used at registration, which are still available to police when investigating WhatsApp messages and conversations.

A spokesperson for WhatsApp told Sky News: ""Using the information available to us, we respond swiftly to valid requests for data to support law enforcement investigations - as we always will.""

What the police have said

In response to Sky News outlining the criticisms from victims, National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for child protection Deputy Chief Constable Ian Critchley said: ""Police take the disclosure of private or intimate images - sometimes referred to as 'revenge porn' - very seriously and we recognise the need to ensure that victims have the confidence to report crimes, safe in the knowledge that they will receive appropriate support, will be listened to, treated with respect, compassion, and a thorough investigation will be launched.

""We will pursue all lines of inquiry and prosecute people where appropriate. When there is evidence of sexual abuse, coercion, blackmail, or exploitation, it is absolutely right that a criminal investigation is launched, and charges brought against those responsible.

""Where police have concerns about possible online abuse and blackmail, they will work together with other agencies, including schools, to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to safeguard children as soon as possible, and to enable offences to be investigated.

""The College of Policing has produced training which all officers involved in these types of investigations can access,"" Deputy Chief Constable Critchley added.

Cost of living surge sees households' financial wellbeing squeezed;Wednesday 12 January 2022 02:41, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"UK households have experienced the biggest slump in their financial wellbeing as a surge in the cost of living takes its toll, a new survey suggests.

A quarterly household finance index compiled by Scottish Widows fell to 40.1 in the final quarter of last year, down from 44.0 in the third quarter.

It was the biggest deterioration in the index - where the 50-mark separates improvement from worsening in the household's financial situation - since the second quarter of 2020.

The reading is the latest sign that families are feeling the squeeze from higher prices, with inflation at a ten-year high of 5.1% and expected to climb to 6% by the spring, a level not seen for three decades.

Soaring energy bills and fuel prices as well as higher food costs have been pushing inflation up and households face a further financial headache from rising interest rates - meaning bigger monthly mortgage and loan repayments - and National Insurance hikes.

Findings from the Scottish Widows survey showed the amount of cash consumers had available to spend fell at the sharpest rate for eight years.

Savings also faced a squeeze while there was a slight reduction in income from employment.

The report said only the highest earners added to short-term savings pots while lower earners struggled to put money aside.

Meanwhile there was a renewed increase in demand for unsecured credit, such as overdrafts and credit cards - even as the availability of this declined.

Nearly a quarter of households (23%) said they would have been likely to withdraw money from their pension pot if they could have.

The report found that worries about inflation saw households become increasingly pessimistic about their future finances over the course of 2022.

Their expectations were downgraded ""particularly sharply"" in December as the new Omicron variant took hold.

The figures were based on a monthly survey of 1,500 people across the UK.

Emma Watkins, managing director of retirement at Scottish Widows said: ""It was a challenging end to another year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic for UK households as rising living costs pinched the pockets of people in the fourth quarter.

""With inflation soaring into the new year and cash availability at its lowest since 2014, households' expectations of future financial wellbeing were the most downbeat since the third quarter of 2020.

""As a result, the strain on current finances has had a knock-on effect to future financial planning.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220112040712/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-surge-sees-households-financial-wellbeing-squeezed-12513943;Category-2: business and economy

Scientists find oldest ever confirmed human fossils are even older than previously thought;Wednesday 12 January 2022 16:09, UK;['alexander martin', '@alexmartin'];[];"Some of the oldest ever fossils to have been affirmatively identified as belonging to Homo sapiens have been discovered to be even older than previously thought.

Known as the Omo I remains, the fossils were found in the Omo Kibish Formation in southwestern Ethiopia, within the East African Rift valley between 1967 and 1974 - a region where humanity is believed to have evolved - and scientists have been attempting to date them ever since.

Earlier research suggested the fossils were less than 200,000 years old but a new study has confirmed that they must be older due to the discovery that a colossal volcanic eruption which took place 230,000 years ago showered the sediments above the fossils with volcanic ash.

An international team of scientists lead by researchers at the University of Cambridge made the discovery by analysing the ""chemical fingerprint"" in the volcanic ash layers around the bones.

To do this they collected pumice rock samples and then ground them down to sub-millimetre size.

""Each eruption has its own fingerprint – its own evolutionary story below the surface, which is determined by the pathway the magma followed,"" explained Dr Céline Vidal from Cambridge's Department of Geography.

""Once you’ve crushed the rock, you free the minerals within, and then you can date them, and identify the chemical signature of the volcanic glass that holds the minerals together,"" she added.

Their geochemical analysis linked the thick volcanic ash layer with an eruption from the Shala volcano, more than 400km (248 miles) away.

But they didn't have the age of the Shala eruption, said Dr Vidal, so another team in Glasgow had to measure the age of the rocks.

""When I received the results and found out that the oldest Homo sapiens from the region was older than previously assumed, I was really excited,"" she added.

The oldest ever remains of what appear to be anatomically modern humans were found in Morocco, and are believed to be about 360,000 years old - but it is not a certainty that they actually belong to humans rather than a closely related species.

However the Omo fossils possess ""unequivocal modern human characteristics, such as a tall and globular cranial vault and a chin,"" explained co-author Dr Aurélien Mounier from the Musée de l’Homme in Paris.

""The new date estimate, de facto, makes it the oldest unchallenged Homo sapiens in Africa,"" Dr Mounier added.

""It's probably no coincidence that our earliest ancestors lived in such a geologically active rift valley – it collected rainfall in lakes, providing fresh water and attracting animals, and served as a natural migration corridor stretching thousands of kilometres,"" said Professor Clive Oppenheimer, a volcanologist at Cambridge.

""The volcanoes provided fantastic materials to make stone tools and from time to time we had to develop our cognitive skills when large eruptions transformed the landscape,"" the professor added.

""Our forensic approach provides a new minimum age for Homo sapiens in eastern Africa, but the challenge still remains to provide a cap, a maximum age, for their emergence, which is widely believed to have taken place in this region,"" explained co-author Professor Christine Lane, head of the Cambridge Tephra Laboratory which hosted the majority of the research work.

""It's possible that new finds and new studies may extend the age of our species even further back in time,"" added Professor Lane.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220112170357/https://news.sky.com/story/scientists-find-oldest-ever-confirmed-human-fossils-are-even-older-than-previously-thought-12514360;Category-6: science and technology
Spiking: Woman felt 'overwhelming shame' after believing she was drugged, parliamentary committee hears;Wednesday 12 January 2022 14:31, UK;['ali fortescue', '@alifortescue'];[];"A 51-year-old woman who believes her drink was spiked at a ""quiet bar"" in Cornwall says she didn't report what happened because she felt ""overwhelming shame"".

Hannah Stratton says she realised something was wrong when her legs began feeling like lead, and felt ""embarrassed"" when others assumed she was drunk.

Giving evidence to a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry, Mrs Stratton said she thought she was ""far too old"" to be spiked, but believes she was targeted ""for fun"".

Image: Hannah Statton appeared before the committee

She decided not to report what happened to police because ""it would have been another journey to have to go through and I don't know if I would have been strong enough to be judged"".

The committee also heard from 19-year-old Zara Owen who described the ""agonising pain"" that left her limping after she believes she was spiked by injection.

She says: ""The fact that someone has injected a narcotic into my body without me being aware is terrifying.""

Mrs Owen says she spoke out because she wants to make people aware of a new form of spiking, after reports last year of people being drugged by injection.

Chief executive at the Alcohol Education Trust, Helena Conibear, told the inquiry that spiking prosecutions are ""extraordinarily low"", and people fear not being taken seriously.

Mrs Conibear says prevalence rates are particularly high at house parties and the LGBTQ+ community are often targeted, but says: ""It can be any drink in pretty much any location and it can happen to any person.""

She added that collecting data is very challenging, but research suggests there were just nine spiking charges in 2019 and eight in 2020.

Alexi Skitinis, whose drink was also spiked, told the inquiry he didn't report what happened because he was embarrassed and felt as a man ""it wouldn't be acknowledged as much"".

Mr Skitinis went to hospital three days after being spiked and had ""severe issues"" with his kidneys and liver.

He says he didn't drink alcohol for nearly two years because what happened ""took away the enjoyment of going out"".

Mrs Stratton told the committee she wants there to be an anonymous online system for reporting spiking cases and less tolerance for spiking in bars.

She says the experience left her feeling ""totally and utterly powerless"" and the emphasis should never be on victims keeping themselves safe.

Star Hobson: Mother's jail sentence referred to Court of Appeal for being 'unduly lenient';Wednesday 12 January 2022 17:08, UK;[];[];"The eight-year jail term for the mother of murdered toddler Star Hobson has been referred to the Court of Appeal after it was deemed ""unduly lenient"" by the attorney general.

Last month, Frankie Smith was jailed after being convicted of causing or allowing her daughter's death.

Sixteen-month-old Star was murdered by Smith's partner Savannah Brockhill who was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 25 years.

She said: ""I have carefully considered the details of this case, and I concluded that I can refer Frankie Smith's sentence to the Court of Appeal as I believe it is unduly lenient.""

Ms Braverman decided that Brockhill's term was not unduly lenient, however.

Joe Biden admits 'more work to do' as US inflation hits 7% for first time in nearly 40 years;Wednesday 12 January 2022 17:21, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"US inflation has hit 7% for the first time in 40 years in the latest sign of the cost of living pressures squeezing consumers across the globe.

Surging prices for used cars - up 37% on the same period last year - and higher rental costs helped drive the consumer price index (CPI) measure up last month.

Food and fuel prices have also been climbing sharply, adding to political pressure on President Joe Biden as well as America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, to take action.

Image: Inflation is a growing public concern - putting pressure on Joe Biden

The year-on-year inflation rate published by the US bureau labour statistics (BLS) was up from 6.8% in November - which was already the highest since June 1982 when Ronald Reagan was in office.

Mr Biden responded to the latest figures by saying that there had been progress in slowing the acceleration of inflation but acknowledging that there was ""more work to do with price increases still too high"".

The data also added to expectations that the Fed will start raising interest rates as early as March - after Fed chair Jerome Powell said that it stood ready to take action to prevent high inflation from becoming ""entrenched"".

Prices have been soaring as Americans ramp up spending at a time when the world's biggest economy is grappling with labour and raw materials as well as wider supply chain hold-ups.

The inflation surge is effectively wiping out the impact of healthy pay increases that are being enjoyed by many US workers.

Polls show that cost of living growth is replacing even the coronavirus as a public concern.

Image: Fed chair Jerome Powell says the Fed will act to stop high inflation becoming entrenched

Many economists think the Fed could hike interest rates as many as four times this year, adding to mortgage and other loan repayment costs and potentially slowing the economy.

Anxiety over central bank action has prompted turbulence in US stock markets at the start of this year, particularly in tech stocks seen as more attractive investments in a low rate environment.

But markets reacted calmly to the latest prices data which was in line with expectations.

The figures come a day after the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said inflation across its 38 member countries had hit a 25-year high in November.

Meanwhile, the World Bank warned of a ""pronounced slowdown"" in global growth with inflation among the key factors, as well as new variants of COVID-19.

In Britain, latest figures showed price growth at a 10-year high of 5.1%, with the Bank of England predicting it could rise to 6% by the spring as energy prices soar.

Jobs at risk as Johnson Matthey plans to close battery materials division;Wednesday 12 January 2022 19:33, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"UK industrial company Johnson Matthey plans to close its battery materials business, employing 430 people, after failing to find a buyer.

The announcement comes two months after JM said it was seeking to dispose of the business, killing off hopes for a British champion in a key industry in supporting the transition to electric vehicles.

That came as a surprise, just months after business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had opened the company's new state-of-the-art battery technology centre near Oxford.

Image: The wider group employs 15,000 people

In an update on the plan, JM said that discussions with a number of parties ""have not resulted in an agreement to sell the entire business as a going concern"".

It added: ""Consequently, we are announcing today that we are commencing consultation with our employees about our employees about our proposed closure of the battery materials business, and we are pursuing the sale of its individual assets.""

A spokesman said that ""very considerably fewer"" than 400 were ultimately expected to see their jobs affected as the company remained in talks to sell parts of the business to different parties while there would also be redeployment in other parts of the group.

Most of the staff in the battery materials business are based in the UK across offices in Billingham, on Teesside, Royston, near Cambridge, and at the technology centre near Oxford.

Others are based in Poland, Finland and Canada.

JM, which has a history of innovation, employs around 15,000 people overall.

The company had bet on growth in cathode materials - the most complex chemical component of car batteries - as it faced an expected decline in its main business supplying catalytic converters for cars as vehicles switch away from combustion engines.

But it decided to exit the business as it faced tough competition from bigger global rivals as well as slim returns.

JM has already taken a £314m hit as it wrote down the value of the division last year and expects to face a further £150m charge, including redundancy costs, as a result of full or partial closure.

A spokesperson for the Met said: ""Officers attended and remain on scene attempting to engage with the man.

""Another man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage.""

The sculpture depicts Prospero and Ariel from Shakespeare's play The Tempest and was installed in 1933, according to the BBC.

Police officer jailed after trying to arrange abuse of child;Wednesday 12 January 2022 20:47, UK;[];[];"A police officer has been jailed after he was caught trying to arrange the abuse of an eight-year-old girl.

Lee Cunliffe was jailed for eight years and four months after pleading guilty to arranging the commission of a child sex offence, perverting the course of justice, misconduct in a public office, distributing indecent photos of a child, and three counts of making indecent photos.

The 40-year-old from Wigan had been a serving officer with Greater Manchester Police in September 2020 when he began messaging a woman he believed was the mother of an eight-year-old girl on instant messaging app Kik.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Cunliffe told the ""mother"", who was actually an undercover officer for the Met Police, that he would come to London to sexually abuse her daughter.

Messages sent from police-owned computer

Prosecutor Arthur Gibson told the court that Cunliffe, a 17-year police veteran, had sent some of the messages from a police-owned computer at Swinton police station.

Cunliffe, a married father, was arrested in October 2020.

When his home was searched, officers found a laptop he had used to find indecent images of children.

These included images of a teenage girl who had made a complaint to Greater Manchester Police in 2018, Mr Gibson said.

The girl alleged her boyfriend had taken the images of her and shared them without her knowledge.

Cunliffe, a trainee detective, had been given the case.

The suspect was arrested and his computer and phone were seized, and Cunliffe later wrote in the crime log that they contained nothing relating to the offence.

But Mr Gibson said both devices still contained 227 accessible indecent images of children.

Despite this, the computer containing the images was returned to the suspect and no further action was taken.

Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary QC, said: ""What you did in relation to this girl and this case is shocking and strikes at the very heart of that foundation of trust that the public have invested in the police service.""

""Why should she ever trust the police ever again?""

Judge Menary said the teenager's complaint was not properly pursued and she ""remained seriously at risk of further disclosure"".

He added: ""The question, frankly, is this: why should she ever trust the police ever again about anything?""

Cunliffe's own laptop had evidence of files from between 2014 and 2018 showing what Mr Gibson described as ""an interest in child pornography and the sexual abuse of children"".

He said: ""However, there is some evidence to suggest that he recognised this and was in a state of turmoil about it.""

A notebook found in his home had entries saying he had a sex and porn addiction and was receiving counselling.

Julian King, defending, said Cunliffe had been seeing a psychotherapist and had been diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder.

Deputy Chief Constable of GMP Terry Woods said: ""Cunliffe's actions were absolutely inexcusable and have undermined the very essence of policing's core value of protecting the public and helping those in need.

""We expect our officers and staff to uphold the highest standards and Cunliffe's deplorable behaviour fell well below what was expected of him - he both abused his position at GMP and attempted to act on his own sexual gratification.""

Benefits hike should be doubled to protect poorest from cost of living surge - IFS;Wednesday 12 January 2022 20:34, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Benefits need to be hiked by twice as much as planned this spring in order to protect millions of the poorest in society from the impact of surging inflation, a respected economic think tank has argued.

In April, payments including the jobseekers' allowance, working tax credits and disability benefits are due to rise by 3.1% - in line with the inflation rate recorded last September.

But cost of living pressures have surged since then and the consumer price rise measure is expected to hit 6% by the spring, largely thanks to soaring energy bills.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 Why are your bills going up?

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said increasing benefits by 6% instead of 3.1% would cost an extra £3bn.

But it would save ten million households from facing a £290 real terms year-on-year fall in benefit income, it calculated.

Other measures to mitigate an expected £14bn surge in energy bills across the UK would either be very expensive or provide very partial compensation, the IFS argued.

Abolishing VAT on domestic energy, at a cost of £2.4bn, would on average give households back less than a fifth of the annual rise in their energy costs, the think tank said.

It would also further encourage people to spend their money on energy rather than other goods or services that are subject to tax - an undesirable outcome given the environmental impact.

Robert Joyce, deputy director of the IFS, said: ""The way in which we increase benefits each April is not fit for the period of high and rising inflation we now face.

""By April inflation will be about 6%. So the poorest are heading for a 3% year-on-year cut in their real benefit levels and living standards.

Ovo responds to energy crisis with move to cut quarter of workforce;Wednesday 12 January 2022 22:59, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Ovo Energy, the UK's third-biggest gas and electricity supplier, is to cut a quarter of its workforce as part of a restructuring aimed at saving costs amid the deepening industry crisis.

Sky News has learnt that Ovo could announce details of its plans as soon as Thursday, with roughly 1,700 out of 6,200 roles expected to be lost as part of a voluntary redundancy programme.

The announcement will come during a difficult week for the company, which provoked anger when it sent an apparently light-hearted email to customers this week recommending that they perform star-jumps or cuddle their pet to keep warm during the winter months.

Image: Chief executive Stephen Fitzpatrick founded Ovo in 2009 Pic: Ovo

Stephen Fitzpatrick, Ovo's founder and chief executive, was nevertheless praised on social media for the sincerity of an apology he made for the communication.

One source said Ovo's announcement of the redundancy programme would be accompanied by a commitment to increase minimum pay across the company to £12-an-hour, and to ""reshore"" all customer-facing jobs to the UK.

It also plans to open a new academy in Glasgow, and to close a number of its sites as part of a consolidation to three locations in London, Bristol and Glasgow.

Ovo has grown from scratch since it was set up by Mr Fitzpatrick in 2009, but was transformed by the acquisition of SSE's retail customer base two years ago.

Since the SSE acquisition, Ovo's integration plan has accelerated, and it is now migrating 120,000 customers each week to its own automated operating platform.

Ovo's greater automation means it requires fewer staff to run it, according to one industry insider.

It considered a bid for Bulb, the energy supplier which collapsed late last year, prior to it being placed into a form of insolvency, and could yet emerge as a contender to take on its roughly 1.6 million customers.

Ovo has about 4.5 million UK customers, making it the third-biggest player behind Centrica's British Gas and E.ON Next, the new brand which combines customers from E.ON and npower.

Ovo counts Mitsubishi, the Japanese industrial group, among its backers, and previously explored a deal to raise funding from a division of Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank.

Mr Fitzpatrick has been a vocal critic of government energy policy during the current crisis, saying that ministers were showing ""nowhere near enough urgency"" in trying to tackle the crisis, which has largely been sparked by soaring wholesale gas prices.

Since August, 25 suppliers have ceased trading, while Bulb has continued to trade, albeit under the temporary ownership of the government.

Together Energy, which is 50%-owned by Warrington Borough Council, is expected to fall into administration within days, adding further to the tally of industry casualties.

Some suppliers have been pleading with the government to remove the industry price cap altogether, an idea which has been dismissed by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.

"M&S; enjoys 'strong' Christmas but ASOS hit by supply woes during festive season";Thursday 13 January 2022 09:56, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Two major players in fashion retail have reported differing fortunes in terms of momentum over Christmas, with Marks and Spencer (M&S;) having more to smile about than ASOS for once.

While both grew sales over the festive season, the online-only retailer had already downgraded expectations due to headwinds including tougher competition in advance of Christmas.

ASOS forecast a hit from lower demand and supply chain disruption in November and reiterated that those issues had remained on Thursday when it posted total sales growth of 5% over the four months to 31 December.

It parted ways with its chief executive during that period - prompting something of a shock for investors as ASOS had long been a darling of the stock market thanks to consecutive periods of explosive growth.

Shares fell by more than 50% last year as its challenges mounted.

M&S;, which ASOS overtook in terms of market value in 2017 as years of turnaround plans failed to deliver, finally had a Christmas to celebrate.

It nudged up its profit outlook thanks to a market-leading grocery performance but also grew clothing and home sales - the latter proving a drag on its profitability for more than a decade.

The retailer said fashion and home sales were 37.7% up in the 13 weeks to 1 January at just over £1bn when compared to the same period last year.

Food sales up 10% year-on-year

The figure was 3.2% up on a pre-pandemic basis. Analysts had expected sales to decline.

Food sales - bolstered by its online delivery partnership with Ocado - were 10% up on a 12-month basis at £1.9bn.

It now expected full-year profit before tax and adjusted items to be at least £500m compared to previous guidance of about £500m.

Chief executive Steve Rowe said: ""Trading over the Christmas period has been strong, demonstrating the continued improvements we've made to product and value.""

However, he warned that inflation in fashion would materialise in the next few months.

His chief financial officer added that it was inevitable that some of the cost pressures would be passed on to shoppers.

Disappointment over profit outlook

M&S;'s shares have nearly doubled over the past year though they fell by 6% in early deals while ASOS saw gains of 7%.

Analysts said the M&S; decline was down to disappointment that its profit outlook was not raised further but it had succeeded in attracting a younger customer base thanks to its engagement with audiences on social media.

Daniel Kawczynski: Conservative MP facing suspension for breaking rules over apology for bullying parliamentary staff;Thursday 13 January 2022 10:24, UK;['alan mcguinness', '@alan_mcguinness'];[];"Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski is facing a one-day suspension from the Commons after being found to have broken the rules over an apology he gave for bullying parliamentary staff.

The recommendation has been made by the Commons Standards Committee and follows comments the MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham made before he said sorry last June.

Mr Kawczynski was found to have acted in a ""threatening and intimidating manner"" towards the complainants after he was unable to join a committee hearing because of technical problems.

But the committee ruled that interviews he gave on local radio and with a newspaper before the required apology in the Commons chamber meant he had failed to comply, as the apology was not ""unequivocal"".

MP 'caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House'

In its report, the committee said: ""Although he says he was sincere by the time he made the apology to the House, he had that morning effectively undermined the sincerity of that apology by broadcasting the fact that he was making it because he was required to do so and he disagreed with the way the case had been conducted.

""Mr Kawczynski also broke confidentiality requirements by speaking to Radio Shropshire about the content of the report before it was published and identifying complainants' job descriptions on nine occasions in his radio interview.""

The committee added: ""Mr Kawczynski's actions caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole.

""His actions also undermined the ICGS (Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme) and risked causing further harm to the complainants in his original case.""

Mr Kawczynski said he was under ""great pressure"" at the time the incident occurred - in part because he is so tall.

The Independent Expert Panel, which determines appeals and sanctions in bullying cases, said the incident in question happened in April 2020 when Mr Kawczynski was unable to join a committee hearing due to technical issues.

At the time, Parliament was adapting to new remote working arrangements during the first COVID-19 lockdown.

Kawczynski 'never set out to bully anyone'

The panel's disciplinary report said the MP had consumed a ""significant amount of alcohol"" on the day and phoned the manager of the committee staff while under the influence, behaviour that was ""grossly unprofessional"".

According to the panel, Mr Kawczynski accepted that on several occasions he let the two complainants, referred to as C1 and C2, and others know of his dissatisfaction.

He said that his frustration, combined with more ""long-standing personal issues"", may have had a ""detrimental impact on the way in which he behaved"".

According to the panel, Mr Kawczynski told them that he was dealing with a number of ""real pressures"" in his role as an MP, as well as being under pressure ""in part for personal reasons"".

""Brexit and serious flooding in his constituency both gave rise to serious difficulties for him as the local MP,"" the panel said.

""The Respondent is 6'9"" tall and thus very conspicuous in the street, in his local shops.

""He found himself under repeated attack by members of the public on both these grounds.

""He emphasised to us how such attacks could be extremely vicious.

""Against that background, the advent of the pandemic added another layer of pressure.

""It was in that context that his frustration with the technical problems associated with a remote meeting caused him to be so angry.

""Nevertheless, he emphasised that he had never set out to bully anyone and did not wish to bully anyone.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220113120734/http://news.sky.com/story/daniel-kawczynski-conservative-mp-facing-suspension-for-breaking-rules-over-apology-for-bullying-parliamentary-staff-12514801;Category-1: politics
COVID-19: Omicron takes out 3% of the workforce while a fifth of firms are hit by higher cancellations;Thursday 13 January 2022 11:48, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"An estimated 3% of the UK workforce was off work in late December while a fifth of businesses reported increased cancellations over the past month amid the surge in the Omicron variant, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The number-crunchers reported that 21% of firms had seen a rise in cancellations, with nearly half (44%) of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector being hit.

The run-up to Christmas was dominated by jitters over the impact of the latest COVID variant - with England ultimately alone in holding back from imposing tougher measures on pubs and restaurants despite surging case numbers.

The ONS said dinner reservations last week, according to OpenTable stats, slumped to 88% of their level for the equivalent week in 2020 - before the start of the pandemic - as coronavirus cases peaked at more than 200,000 a day.

It said that 3% of the workforce was estimated to be on sick leave or not working because of coronavirus symptoms, self-isolation or quarantine demands.

The ONS was unable to put a figure on the total number of people affected but said it was the highest sum since comparable estimates began in June 2020.

Virus-related staff shortages disrupted key services from hospital operations - with some declaring major incidents - to bin collections in early January.

The hairdressing and beauty treatments industry reported the highest absence levels at 7%, the ONS said.

Iceland, the frozen grocery chain, told Sky News on 4 January that it had an 11% absence rate.

Image: Iceland had more than one-in-ten workers off in early January

It is hoped that the worst is now behind businesses as far as Omicron is concerned.

That is because cases have dropped 19% over the past week.

However, economists have raised fears that a surge in inflation is likely to dent demand for non-essential spending in the months ahead, led chiefly by rising energy costs.

Bank of England notes growing caution

Separate Bank of England data on credit and debit card spending in the week to 6th January showed a fall to 82% of its pre-pandemic February 2020 average from 86% the week before.

The Bank said that lenders expect demand for mortgage borrowing to fall during the first three months of the year and credit card lending to rise.

Its Credit Conditions Survey also found that the rates of defaults on mortgages and consumer loans were expected to rise early this year as budgets were squeezed by rising living costs.

Tesco and M&S; were among big names, reporting on their Christmas progress on Thursday, to warn on inflationary pressures.

The latter's chief financial officer said it was inevitable that some of its higher bills would be passed on to shoppers as it grapples increases along its supply chain.

Costa Concordia: Ten years on pianist recalls terrifying escape from the capsized cruise liner;Thursday 13 January 2022 17:06, UK;[];[];"On 13 January 2012, the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia capsized off the coast of Tuscany after hitting a rock in the Tyrrhenian Sea.

Francesco Schettino, the captain of the cruise liner, was jailed for 16 years for multiple manslaughter after the disaster that left 32 people dead.

On the tenth anniversary of the tragedy, the ship's Italian pianist Antimo Magnotta, who is now living and working in London, has relived his terrifying ordeal and told Sky News how he is still tormented by flashbacks from what he witnessed.

I was working in a very elegant bar at the back of the ship called Bar Vienna. I remember it was a beautiful night, a starry night, the sea was very calm and quiet.

Then all of a sudden the ship suddenly swerved and started tilting. It was really unexpected because the conditions at sea meant it made no sense for this to happen.

Advertisement

I thought to myself - ""did we hit a whale or a giant monster or something?"".

I fell over and the piano started drifting on stage. I left the bar and found myself stumbling along sloping corridors with passengers and crew members. I was heading to the centre of the ship where there would be more balance.

When I got there I found myself with other crew members and passengers on this huge dancefloor. We were expecting some instructions, some kind of explanation, but the ship began to have multiple blackouts and power failures.

The ship was performing some very strange movements, it was tilting on one side and then slowly titling on the other side, I was thinking to myself - ""what is this?"".

Image: More than 30 people died when the cruise ship capsized

Passengers and crew members were screaming and calling out names. We couldn't see each other in the darkness.

It was quite cinematic I must say, it looked like a David Lynch film actually.

Finally, after more than an hour, the emergency signal on board was sounded.

I was a pianist, but I was also a crew member, and I had been trained to carrying out certain duties in an emergency.

I reached my master station and was in charge of a roll call for 25 crew members to embark on a life raft. I remember four people on my list were missing.

I was expecting a crew member from the bridge (the room where the ship is commanded) to come downstairs and lead myself and my crew members to our designated life raft.

But no one came from the bridge, and of course the ship, in the meantime, was still performing this very macabre choreography of slowly capsizing.

While the ship was tipping over I was confronted with a portrait of an ongoing tragedy, a grotesque paradox.

Image: People left the vessel on rescue boats after it hit a rock

It was like being inside a cabinet of horrors. I mainly remember the sounds - there was this cacophony from the bowels of the ship. People were screaming.

I describe the ship in this moment as being like a swan in agony. It was suffering.

I eventually saw a crew member dressed all in white carrying a box of walkie talkies. I asked him what was going on.

He whispered: ""Don't you know? We hit a rock, and this caused a massive leak on the side of the ship.""

He was very agitated, he was running on adrenaline, and said: ""You know what, the best suggestion would be for you to run for your life, and if you can, abandon the ship.""

I thought this must be some kind of joke, but then he just vanished.

Everyone was really panicking and end up scattering all around.

Image: Antimo Magnotta, centre, was working on the ship when it hit a rock in January 2012

This was the very beginning of my personal nightmare, because I had to perform a gruelling evacuation of the ship.

I knew where the life raft I was supposed to get on was located, and I knew it would now be under water.

I was 41 at the time and said to myself I can't die, this must be a joke.

But I started thinking about my daughter and this triggered a reaction in me, so I started climbing on some metallic bars, some ladders, pipes, whatever I could find in my way.

It took some time, but I found myself on the flank of the ship outside, facing the dark sea, holding onto a winch, a crane, I was holding on to this rope like I was clinging on to life itself.

Image: Mr Magnotta is pictured on a vessel during happy times

All I had to do was just wait to be rescued, It was difficult because it was pitch dark, the most difficult thing to do was to make myself visible.

This lasted pretty much four hours.

The ship was more or less on it side by this point, breaching at a very dramatic angle, maybe 80 to 85 degrees, if not more.

It was like the carcass of a stranded whale. I could feel and hear the death rattle of the ship.

When I was on the flank of the ship I felt something is deteriorating, disintegrating, my image, my story, was fading away, it was vanishing, ""I can't die,"" I said to myself.

I was not alone of course, there was a bunch of between 35 to 40 people around me, passengers and crew members.

I could see rescue boats and there was very frantic activity in the water. Helicopters were hovering above but they didn't seem to see us.

Image: The ship's captain Francesco Schettino was jailed for 16 years after the disaster

Eventually a little rescue boat was sent for us, and I will always say, jumping in this little rescue boat was like jumping back to life.

It was 3am, more than five hours after the ship hit the rock, that the rescue boat dropped me off at Giglio Island.

It was like celebrating a second birthday, it was the beginning of my second life.

Unfortunately, later on, I learned that two fellow musicians had lost their lives. My friend, a Hungarian violinist, who lost his life, had just gone down to his cabin.

I just thought to myself what if it had been the other way round?

This has haunted me for a long time.

Image: Guard officers threw flowers in the water at Giglio Island to remember those who died 10 years after the disaster

In the aftermath of the disaster I was devastated and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

I had mental scars still lingering, survivor's guilt and chronic insomnia. I couldn't play the piano anymore. I had a stone in my chest and not a heart.

I took up a new form of self-therapy and started writing, and I would cry sometimes of course.

It was a way to express myself and my anger.

These days I feel much better and I play the piano in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Now I am feeling much better, but still I have terrible flashbacks and insomnia - my sleep is always interrupted.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220113180751/http://news.sky.com/story/costa-concordia-ten-years-on-pianist-recalls-terrifying-escape-from-the-capsized-cruise-liner-12515157;Category-4: sports
Energy crisis: Ovo Energy informs staff of 1,700 job losses as union rounds on management;Thursday 13 January 2022 13:54, UK;[];[];"Ovo Energy, the UK's third-largest household supplier, has informed staff of its decision to cut its workforce by a quarter.

Sky News reported on Wednesday evening that 1,700 roles were to be axed in a bid to save money as the industry battles crippling rises in the cost of raw energy, especially gas, that have led 25 firms to collapse since August last year.

A source had told City editor Mark Kleinman that the cuts would come from voluntary redundancies under proposals to consolidate its offices to three sites in London, Bristol and Glasgow in the wake of Ovo's 2019 acquisition of SSE's household energy business.

Its plans were also understood to have included a commitment to increase minimum pay across the company to £12-an-hour and ""reshore"" all customer-facing jobs to the UK.

However, the developments were met with union anger.

Unite national officer for energy, Simon Coop, responded: ""We warned the directors about blundering into the SSE takeover.

""In recent years the same directors have plundered the accounts for amounts estimated to be touching £5m.

""So, the company must be subject to severe scrutiny before the union decides on our next moves, but if they move to compulsory redundancies they will be fully opposed by the union.""

OVO was understood not to be planning a public statement on the redundancy plans.

It follows a difficult week for the company, which provoked anger when it sent an apparently light-hearted email to customers recommending that they perform star-jumps or cuddle their pet to keep warm during the winter months as heating bills surge.

Image: The post was later taken down and Ovo has apologised to customers

The industry has warned that customers face a 50% hike in the price cap from April - on top of the 12% increase last October - without government intervention.

Such a rise could take average annual bills to £2,000.

Sky News reported last week that ministers are expected to reveal targeted measures ahead of the energy regulator's determination of the new price cap level.

That is due to be made public on 7 February.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220113180751/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-crisis-ovo-energy-informs-staff-of-1-700-job-losses-as-union-rounds-on-management-12514696;Category-2: business and economy

Prince Andrew: Which military roles has he lost - and what else could he be handing back?;Thursday 13 January 2022 20:22, UK;[];[];"Prince Andrew has had his military titles and royal patronages taken away as a civil sexual assault court case against him in the US moves forward.

What has Buckingham Palace said?

""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to the Queen,"" the palace said in a statement on Thursday.

""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""

The civil case has been brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claims Andrew ""committed sexual assault and battery"" upon her when she was a teenager.

Image: Virginia Giuffre says she was 17 when she was trafficked to have sex with Prince Andrew - claims he denies. Pic: Rex/Shutterstock

• What has Prince Andrew been accused of?

Ms Giuffre alleges that she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was a minor under US law, claims strongly denied by the duke.

Andrew failed in a legal bid to get Ms Guiffre's case against him thrown out.

Which military roles are being handed back?

Following a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, Andrew held several honorary military titles.

These were suspended after he stepped back from public duties in 2019, but he had retained the roles, effectively leaving the affected regiments in limbo.

The positions he is now relinquishing are:

• Colonel of the Grenadier Guards

• Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, (Canada)

• Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment

Image: The Duke of York, pictured in 2003, was colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Lancers

• Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment

• Colonel-in-chief of the Princess Louise Fusiliers of Canada

• Colonel-in-chief of the Queen's York Rangers

• Colonel-in-chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment

• Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth

• Commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm

Prince Andrew was also an honorary Royal Navy vice admiral, but it is unclear what will happen to that role.

What will happen to the military titles?

The military posts have been handed back to the Queen with immediate effect and they will be redistributed among other members of the Royal Family.

The Queen is head of the armed forces and honorary military appointments are in her gift.

The military posts will not be returned to the Duke of York.

What other patronages could the duke lose?

Although many charities relinquished their ties with him after 2019, Andrew was still listed on the Royal Family's website as being a patron or member of around 100 charities and organisations, including hospital trusts, cricket clubs and schools.

They included the Army Officers' Golfing Society, Berkshire County Cricket Club, Killyleagh Yacht Club, Horris Hill School in Hampshire, and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust.

On Thursday it was revealed he had lost his honorary titles at Royal Portrush and Royal County Down golf clubs in Northern Ireland.

Image: It is thought Andrew will still be known as the Duke of York

What else will change?

The Duke will no longer use the style ""His Royal Highness"" in any official capacity.

Will he still be called The Duke of York?

It is not known if the palace's announcement covers the Duke of York title but it's thought to be unlikely.

Royal commentator and biographer Christopher Warwick has previously told Sky News that while the Queen can appoint dukes, it takes an act of parliament to remove their titles ""which wouldn't cover Andrew or the monarchy in glory"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220113220800/http://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-which-military-titles-and-patronages-could-he-lose-12515262;Category-6: science and technology

Prince Andrew's US court battle has finally become too damaging for the Royal Family

It is Andrew as an individual and not as a royal who will potentially stand trial at the end of the year

The turnaround in 24 hours could not have been more dramatic.

From the palace saying they wouldn't comment on the court case, to a shock statement in essence confirming it's over for Prince Andrew's royal role.

Despite his constant denials and his conviction that he will fight this case, the ongoing battle in the US courts and the allegations that he sexually assaulted a teenage girl have finally become too damaging. He is no longer officially an HRH.

Prince Andrew: Which military roles has he lost - and what else could he be handing back?

Since he decided to step down from royal duties following that disastrous Newsnight interview two years ago, Prince Andrew has been in self-imposed exile. No official work, no events representing the military.

But there has still been this peculiar situation where he has kept a number of his royal charity patronages and his military affiliations, even though he hasn't been able to do anything in public to represent them.

Unease at still having to toast Duke of York

Getting members of the military to go on the record about the situation has been difficult, mainly out of respect for the Queen.

She is after all head of the armed forces, but there have been reports of significant unease at still having to toast the Duke of York at dinner.

The phrasing of Thursday's statement is interesting - it doesn't make it entirely clear if Prince Andrew voluntarily handed back the titles or if he was leant on significantly by members of the family to give them up.

But what is clear is that the judge's announcement on Wednesday, one that means the prospect of a trial looms even larger, meant the current situation just could not continue any longer.

Of course, there is also the question of who made the decision.

Prince Andrew is often referred to as the Queen's favourite son. Would she have decided it alone? I suspect not and I understand this was widely discussed within the family.

And don't forget Prince Charles and Prince William are now taking on significant responsibilities on the Queen's behalf, representing and shaping the institution. They are just as invested as her majesty in defending the royal name, not just for her reign but their future tenures as monarch.

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

The final sentence was also particularly telling, stressing that he is defending this case ""as a private citizen"", another phrase that appears to push him even further out into the cold; a reminder to us all that it is Andrew as an individual and not as a royal who will potentially stand trial at the end of the year.

So why after years of these allegations being front page news has this happened now?

You could argue that sometimes there is nothing more fatal than inaction. In the case of the monarch, the last thing she would want was for this to become a political matter, where her prime minister and her cabinet were advising her to take action against her son to avoid any kind of international embarrassment.

The Queen has again acted quickly

As we saw when it all blew up around the Sussexes, the Queen has again acted quickly. The situation with Prince Andrew, and the seriousness of the allegations, may be different from the Harry and Meghan situation, but the principles at play are the same.

While privately she may be supporting her son, nothing is bigger than the reputation of the institution. And of course, this is a year where the British monarchy was always going to be in the spotlight.

We can potentially see this as an attempt to draw a line under it as the rest of the family try to focus on the platinum jubilee. Although with story of this magnitude there is little doubt the court case will continue to cast a considerable shadow.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220113220800/http://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrews-us-court-battle-has-finally-become-too-damaging-for-the-royal-family-12515331;Category-1: politics

""I then went and I immediately contacted her son who has worked in my office as the diary manager and I asked him to tender his resignation forthwith, which he did,"" Mr Gardiner told Sky News.

""But I want to stress to you that the security services said to me they had no information that led them to believe that he was aware of his mother's illegal activity.""

Ms Lee 'asked about MP's parents-in-law this week'

Mr Gardiner received more than £500,000 from Ms Lee over a period of six years. And he revealed he had spoken to her as recently as this week when, Mr Gardiner said, she enquired about his elderly parents-in-law.

But he added he had been ""cautious"" about his relationship with her ""because I knew that she was a solicitor who acted for a number of Chinese businesses in the UK over a very long period of time"".

Mr Gardiner, who was a junior minister in Tony Blair's government and also served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, revealed he had ""spoken openly and frankly"" with the security services ""for a number of years"" about his engagement with Ms Lee.

""At no time did they suggest that I cut off engagement with her,"" he added, as he stressed he had always been ""totally transparent"" about donations made to his office.

The Labour MP said he had been told by the security services that they have ""no evidence at all"" at the moment that the money his office received came from the Chinese state.

Mr Gardiner's previous criticisms of China

He also highlighted his past criticisms of the Chinese government, such as on climate change issues and human rights concerns.

And the former shadow energy minister denied he had been a ""cheerleader"" for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which has been bankrolled by a Chinese state-backed firm.

Ms Lee has now had a ""Point of Light"" award she received in 2019 from then prime minister Theresa May rescinded.

Mr Gardiner pointed to that award as he described how Ms Lee ""was operating as a legitimate person in the UK"".

""This is somebody who received awards from the British prime minister,"" he said. ""This is somebody who, to all intents and purposes, was operating as a legitimate person in the UK.

""It now is clear, because the security services have this information, that she was acting to try and gain influence.

Spider-Man: Single page of comic sells for more than three million dollars;Friday 14 January 2022 03:05, UK;[];[];"A single page from a 1984 Spider-Man comic book has sold for $3.36 million (£2..45m) at an auction in Texas.

The page was the original artwork by Mike Zeck and shows Spider-Man with a black costume for the first time.

It is part of an increasing trend for auctions of popular culture memorabilia since the start of the pandemic, with record prices for comics and Pokemon cards.

Joe Maddalena, vice president of Heritage Auctions, which sold the Spider-Man comic, said: ""Collectors are buying their nostalgia so instead of buying their, you know, piece of contemporary art, this is it.

""They'd rather have this because this speaks to them more than a piece of contemporary art would.""

Describing the Spider-Man piece as ""one of a kind"", he said: ""It just was one of those moments in the lore of Spider-Man's fame that told this important part of this story that subsequently this character would turn into Venom. It's pretty amazing.""

And another superhero also proved to be a money-spinner at the sale, according to Mr Maddalena.

""Just a few minutes after this we had Action number one, the origin and first appearance of Superman, ok? A high grade copy, $3.18 million dollars so Spider-Man from 1984 beat Superman, which is unbelievable.""

Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre says she will 'continue to expose the truth' about alleged abuse;Friday 14 January 2022 01:55, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"The woman who has accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault has said she will ""continue to expose the truth"" and thanked the judge who rejected the royal's attempts to have the lawsuit thrown out.

Virginia Giuffre tweeted: ""I'm pleased with Judge Kaplan's ruling yesterday that allows my case against Prince Andrew to go forward. I'm glad I will have the chance to continue to expose the truth & I am deeply grateful to my extraordinary legal team.

""Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law & must be held accountable.

""I do not walk this path alone, but alongside countless other survivors of sexual abuse & trafficking.""

It comes as US judge Lewis Kaplan refused to dismiss the case after hearing arguments from Andrew and Ms Giuffre.

The duke's lawyers had asked for the civil lawsuit in New York to be dismissed after arguing Ms Giuffre waived her right to sue him when she signed a $500,000 dollar settlement agreement with Epstein.

The 2009 document said Ms Giuffre had agreed to ""release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge"" Epstein and ""any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant"".

The Duke of York will face a civil sex case trial later this year over claims he committed ""sexual assault and battery"" upon Ms Giuffre when she was a teenager.

She alleges she was trafficked by disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17.

The Duke has repeatedly denied the claims.

On Thursday, the royal was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages, and will no longer style himself ""His Royal Highness"".

Scientists develop new test that reliably predicts return or spread of deadliest skin cancer;Friday 14 January 2022 04:06, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Scientists have developed a new test that reliably predicts the spread, or return, of the deadliest form of skin cancer.

The technological advance followed a breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of skin cancer growth.

More than 16,000 people in the UK and 96,000 people in the US are diagnosed with melanoma every year.

Professor Penny Lovat, who led the work on the test, said it will reassure patients who are less at risk of the disease spreading.

The test, known as AMBLor, is applied to a standard biopsy of the primary melanoma when it is removed and will identify patients who are at low risk of cancer reoccurring or spreading.

It provides anyone diagnosed with a non-ulcerated early-stage melanoma - accounting for around 75% of all new diagnoses - with more accurate information.

""Our test offers a personalised prognosis as it more accurately predicts if your skin cancer is unlikely to spread,"" said Professor Lovat, of Newcastle University.

""This test will aid clinicians to identify genuinely low-risk patients diagnosed with an early-stage melanoma and to reduce the number of follow-up appointments for those identified as low risk, saving the NHS time and money.""

The British Skin Foundation supported the research, done in association with the university spin-out firm Amlo Biosciences.

The foundation's chief operating officer, Phil Brady, said: ""The development of the AMBLor test can alleviate stress and anxiety for patients caused by this potentially deadly skin cancer, whilst increasing efficiency and reducing costs to the NHS.""

The team has applied to make the test available on the NHS.

Cory Inglis, 49, had a biopsy for a melanoma which will be sent for analysis in the new AMBLor test.

He said the test ""helps significantly with the anxiety of an already very stressful situation"".

Currently, primary tumours are removed by surgery and pathologists study the biopsy under the microscope to determine the stage the skin cancer is at and the risk of it spreading.

Pothole breakdowns hit 'ridiculous' three-year high;Friday 14 January 2022 03:49, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Pothole-related breakdowns have hit a ""ridiculous"" three-year high, new figures have found.

The RAC said it received 10,123 call-outs for problems caused by damaged road services in 2021 - up by 19% on the year before (8,524 incidents) and a 10% increase on 2019 (9,198 breakdowns).

The breakdown recovery company said some 1.5% of all call-outs attended by patrols last year were for issues including broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers, and distorted wheels, all caused by potholes.

Image: The RAC said it received 10,123 call-outs for problems caused by damaged road services in 2021

Drivers are more than one-and-a-half times more likely to break down after hitting a pothole today than they were in 2006, according to the firm.

RAC head of roads policy, Nicholas Lyes, said the issue was ""ridiculous because it is almost entirely avoidable if roads were maintained properly"".

""The rot appears to have well and truly set in when it comes to the country's roads, with our patrols going out to vast numbers of drivers who, through no fault of their own, are breaking down because of the wear and tear caused by potholes,"" he said.

""With drivers contributing so much in terms of tax to the government, the very least they deserve are roads that are fit for purpose.

""Potholed roads are a menace, not a mere annoyance. They can cause thousands of pounds of unnecessary damage to drivers' vehicles, make using our roads uncomfortable, and can be a serious road safety hazard for anyone on two wheels.""

Potholes are often caused by rainwater getting into cracks in the road. When the water freezes, it expands and creates further deterioration in the road surface.

Mr Lyle warned the number of drivers hitting potholes could rise even further this year as there is ""plenty of cold weather still to come this winter"".

Image: Potholes are increasingly causing damage to cars

Analysis by the Local Government Association found that annual funding for more than 9.5 million pothole repairs has been removed from council budgets in England.

A report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance claimed councils in England and Wales would need to spend a total of £10 billion over a decade to bring all their pothole-plagued roads up to scratch.

A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""The Government is providing over £5 billion of investment over this Parliament for highways maintenance to local highways authorities across England.

""This is enough to fill millions of potholes a year, repair dozens of bridges, and resurface roads up and down the country.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220114052055/https://news.sky.com/story/pothole-breakdowns-hit-ridiculous-three-year-high-12515434;Category-2: business and economy

Leader of far-right militia Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy over US Capitol riot;Friday 14 January 2022 04:37, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"The leader of a far-right militia group has been charged with seditious conspiracy following last January's attack on the US Capitol.

The charge, which alleges the group attempted to overthrow the government, is more serious than the lower-level crimes others have faced and brings with it a 20-year prison sentence.

More than 150 people have been charged with assaulting police, and over 50 charged with conspiracy - mostly linked to another far-right group, the Proud Boys.

However, now 11 members of the Oath Keepers militia group are the first to have been arrested and charged with seditious conspiracy, including founder and leader Stewart Rhodes, 56, of Granbury Texas.

What is seditious conspiracy? Seditious conspiracy is when two or more people conspire to ""overthrow, put down to destroy by force"" the US government or to oppose by force to try and prevent the execution of any law. If convicted, it carries a sentence of 20 years behind bars. But the Civil War-era charge is rarely used, because it is difficult to prove and harder to win. The last time prosecutors brought a seditious conspiracy case was in 2010, in an alleged Michigan plot by members of the Hutaree militia to incite an uprising against the government. But the judge ordered an acquittal at trial, saying it had not been proved the accused ever had detailed plans for a rebellion. Among the last successful convictions for seditious conspiracy followed the 1954 storming of the Capitol by four Puerto Rican nationalists who opened fire on the house floor, wounding five.

Sky News last spoke to Rhodes in September 2020 after armed civilians took the streets in the wake of the death of Breonna Taylor.

At the time Rhodes said his anti-government group had taken to the streets to ""protect businesses"".

A former US Army paratrooper and Yale Law School graduate, Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers in 2009. The right-wing extremist group recruits current and former military, police and first responders.

Among the Oath Keepers charged alongside Rhodes is Jessica Watkins, 39, of Woodstock, Ohio.

Special correspondent Alex Crawford spoke to members of the group following last year's attack, and a friend of Watkins said she considered herself a patriot who had done no wrong.

""Jessica at no point was in an area not open to the public,"" her friend said.

""She stopped individuals within her sphere of influence from smashing or stealing.""

Former marine Donovan Crowl, 51, of Cable, Ohio has also been charged with seditious conspiracy. In 2021, his mother, Teresa Rowe, told Sky News she had been estranged from him for several years, having kicked him out for his right-wing views.

""I think he should face jail time,"" she said.

The indictment alleges Oath Keepers discussed for weeks their plans to overturn the election results and prepared for a siege by purchasing weapons.

Image: Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl have also been charged

They repeatedly wrote in chats about the prospect of violence, and Rhodes allegedly wrote in one text he wanted ""to scare the s*** out of"" Congress.

On 6 January, large crowds of rioters entered the capital, storming past police barriers, smashing windows and sending lawmakers running.

The indictment against Rhodes alleges Oath Keepers formed two teams, or ""stacks"", that entered the Capitol.

Image: Rhodes founded the group in 2009. Pic: AP

The first stack split up inside the building to separately go after the House and Senate. The second stack confronted officers inside the Capitol Rotunda.

Outside Washington, the indictment alleges, the Oath Keepers had stationed two ""quick reaction forces"" that had guns ""in support of their plot to stop the lawful transfer of power"".

According to court documents, Rhodes said: ""We're going to defend the president, the duly elected president, and we call on him to do what needs to be done to save our country. Because if you don't guys, you're going to be in a bloody, bloody civil war, and a bloody -- you can call it an insurrection or you can call it a war or fight.""

Prices hikes 'inevitable' in face of rising costs, warns Currys boss;Friday 14 January 2022 15:37, UK;[];[];"Customers can expect to pay more for electrical and tech goods in 2022 with price increases ""inevitable"", the boss of Currys has told Sky News.

Speaking to Ian King Live, group chief executive Alex Baldock pointed to rising costs ranging from components and transport through to wages.

However, he said the electrical retail giant would stand by its price promise to be the cheapest on the market.

His warning over inflationary pressures comes against a backdrop of rising prices across the economy, that threaten to squeeze household finances.

Mr Baldock said: ""We are flagging that price increases are inevitable

""The input costs, whether it's a product, product components, transport and of course, the operating costs in wage inflation do make that inevitable.

""And we will see that across the market in 2022.""

He added: ""What I would say is that we've got a very simple promise at Currys that you won't get it cheaper anywhere else.

""And that's a promise that we will continue to stand by.""

His comments came after Currys trimmed its full-year profit guidance following what it called a ""challenging"" technology market at Christmas.

The company saw sales drop over the key trading period as supply issues left the retailer short of stock for some popular tech products, such as games consoles.

It also highlighted ""uneven"" demand for products across its range with less call for big ticket items such as TVs, after strong sales in the summer ahead of the Euros football tournament.

However, the firm said it performed ahead of the overall UK tech market, which shrank by around a tenth compared with the same period last year.

Currys reported that like-for-like group sales dropped by 5% for the 10 weeks to 8 January compared with the same period last year, but were 4% above pre-pandemic levels.

South Dakota: Man arrested after elderly mother unknowingly served cannabis brownies at community centre card game;Friday 14 January 2022 17:04, UK;[];[];"A man has been arrested after his elderly mother unknowingly served cannabis brownies during a card game at her senior centre.

Michael Koranda, 46, was arrested on 5 January after reports of a ""possible poisoning"" at the Tabor Community Center in South Dakota.

The 46-year-old's mother told a sheriff that ""her son Michael had baked a pan of brownies and she took them to the community centre card game"", police wrote in an affidavit.

Several people then ate the brownies, which had been made using half a pound of cannabis-infused butter.

Koranda's mother was unaware the brownies contained the illicit ingredient when she handed them out.

Lockdown parties row: director general of government's COVID taskforce held office drinks bash when London was under Tier 3 rules;Friday 14 January 2022 17:49, UK;['greg heffer', '@gregheffer'];[];"One of the heads of the government's COVID-19 taskforce held an office leaving bash at a time when indoor socialising was banned, it has been revealed.

Kate Josephs, a former director general of the Cabinet Office's COVID taskforce - which drafts coronavirus restrictions and other pandemic policies - said she was ""truly sorry"" for the gathering on 17 December 2020.

She also revealed the event is now part of a wide-ranging investigation into multiple allegations of coronavirus rule-breaking in both Downing Street and other government buildings.

I am today making a statement. I am truly sorry. pic.twitter.com/xWByiiKfV3 — Kate Josephs (@katejosephs) January 14, 2022

The ""partygate"" scandal is threatening the political future of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who himself has admitted to attending a ""bring your own booze"" gathering in Number 10's garden during the first national lockdown.

In the latest revelation of a Whitehall drinks event at a time of strict COVID rules, Ms Josephs wrote on Twitter: ""On the evening of 17 December, I gathered with colleagues that were at work that day, with drinks, in our office in the Cabinet Office, to mark my leaving the civil service.

Advertisement

""I am truly sorry I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result.""

Ms Josephs left the COVID taskforce on 18 December 2020. She is currently chief executive of Sheffield City Council, a role that was advertised with a £190,000 salary.

""Sheffield has suffered greatly during this pandemic, and I apologise unreservedly,"" she added in her tweet.

""The specific facts of this event will be considered in the context of the Cabinet Office investigation.

""I did not attend any events at 10 Downing Street.""

What is the COVID taskforce? The COVID-19 Task Force within the Cabinet Office was established in late May 2020 when it consolidated various government efforts from the initial response to the crisis. The taskforce is charged with suporting the prime minister and Cabinet and, according to official documents, is ""responsible for coordinating the government's response to the pandemic"". This includes developing policies for the initial COVID response, as well as for the UK's recovery from the crisis. The taskforce is also in charge of implementing those policies. Another of its key roles is providing data and analysis to the prime minister. Ms Josephs was one of three directors general of the taskforce, who report to a more senior civil servant. It has previously been reported that the taskforce will be disbanded this spring.

London entered ""Tier 3"" COVID restrictions the day before Ms Josephs had her leaving drinks.

Under those rules, people in the capital were not allowed to mix with other households indoors and could only mix with a maximum of five others outdoors.

Bars, pubs and restaurants were also closed, while those who could work from home were told to do so.

On 17 December 2020, the government's official Twitter account posted: ""Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.""

It had already emerged that a Christmas party was held in Whitehall on 17 December 2020 in the private office of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, which is said to have been separate from the event attended by Ms Josephs.

The revelation forced Mr Case to quit as the head of the ongoing ""partygate"" investigation, with senior civil servant Sue Gray now leading the inquiry.

She is not expected to publish her findings until next week at the earliest.

Labour councillor Terry Fox, the leader of Sheffield City Council, held talks with Ms Josephs earlier on Friday.

""To be honest I need to express my deep disappointment - people will rightly feel angry and let down,"" he said in a statement.

""I get that completely. After everything that Sheffield has been through during the pandemic, this is news that we did not want to receive.

""Over the last year, Kate's been an asset to our city, and she is working tirelessly for Sheffield and it's people.

Woman was fined £12,000 for birthday party a day after two lockdown-breaching gatherings were held at Downing St;Friday 14 January 2022 19:18, UK;[];[];"A London woman was fined £12,000 for hosting a party last year just a day after two gatherings were held in Downing Street, it has emerged.

Vianna McKenzie-Bramble, 28, is one of thousands of people taken to court for breaching rules imposed by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19.

She held a birthday celebration with about 40 people and a bouncy castle in Hackney on 17 April, some months after her actual birthday.

On the same day, the Queen was attending the funeral of her husband of 74 years Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.

McKenzie-Bramble was criticised as ""disrespectful"" during a hearing in a closed Westminster courtroom in September last year.

Police Constable Lindsey England said in a witness statement: ""I explained to Vianna that there needed to be consequences for her actions, namely organising such a large gathering during a time where there is still such a significant risk to public health.

""On this day in particular it was the funeral of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip.

""The country is in mourning and only limited members of his close family were able to attend the ceremony.

""Vianna being so blase about organising such a large and illegal event for her 27th birthday party is totally unacceptable and disrespectful in light of everything that is going on in the world.""

But police have responded differently to two parties held by government advisers and civil servants at Downing Street just one day before McKenzie-Bramble's party and the duke's funeral.

The parties were all held while government guidance banned socialising indoors with anyone other than a person's household or support bubble.

Outdoors socialising was only allowed in groups of up to six, or two households.

No 10 has apologised to Buckingham Palace for the parties and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former communications director James Slack has apologised for the ""anger and hurt"" caused by one of the parties, which was a farewell event held for him.

The Metropolitan Police has said that if a recently-launched inquiry identifies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, it will be passed to them ""for further consideration"".

But its unwillingness to take action has angered many.

Among them is Patsy Stevenson, who was arrested at a vigil for murdered Sarah Everard in March last year, while coronavirus restrictions were in place.

The 29-year-old physics student told the PA news agency: ""It doesn't make sense in my head. And it just really enforces the idea that the government can get away with whatever they want.

""If they want to have any trust with the public, they need to investigate it immediately, and treat it the same as how they would treat it if it was a party with anyone else.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220114215645/https://news.sky.com/story/woman-was-fined-12-000-for-birthday-party-a-day-after-two-lockdown-breaching-gatherings-were-held-at-downing-st-12516043;Category-1: politics
Martin Shkreli: Man who made huge profits by inflating price of life-saving drug ordered to return £47m;Friday 14 January 2022 21:01, UK;[];[];"A man whose drugs company made huge profits by inflating the price of a life-saving drug has been ordered to return $64.6m (£47m).

Martin Shkreli, who has since been jailed, has also been barred from the pharmaceutical industry for life.

Shkreli, 38, increased the price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill after obtaining exclusive rights to it in 2015.

The decades-old drug treats a rare parasitic disease that affects pregnant women, people with cancer and Aids patients.

Shkreli, who was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals - later Vyera - said it was capitalism at work and insurance would ensure that people who needed Daraprim got it.

But his behaviour led to outrage. Hillary Clinton described it as price-gouging and Donald Trump said Shkreli was a ""spoiled brat"".

He resigned as Turing's chief executive in 2015 after being arrested on securities fraud charges relating to hedge funds he ran before moving into the pharmaceuticals industry.

He was convicted and is serving a seven-year sentence.

Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC was sued by the Federal Trade Commission and seven states: New York, California, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

They alleged that as well as hiking the price of Daraprim, Vyera created ""a web of anti-competitive restrictions"".

The effect of that, they claimed, was to prevent other companies from creating cheaper generic versions, partly by blocking their access to a key ingredient.

While Shkreli proceeded to trial, Vyera and its parent company, Phoenixus AG, settled last month, agreeing to provide up to $40m in relief over 10 years to consumers and to make Daraprim available to any potential generic competitor at cost.

Former Vyera chief executive Kevin Mulleady agreed to pay $250,000 if he violates the settlement, which prevents him from working for a pharmaceutical company for seven years.

UK weather: Frost and fog bringing hazardous driving conditions to parts of country;Saturday 15 January 2022 08:09, UK;[];[];"Frost and fog could bring hazardous conditions for some parts of the UK over the coming days.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for fog which is in place until 11am on Saturday.

Initially covering parts of the East Midlands, East of England, North East England, North West England, South West England, Wales, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humber, it was subsequently expanded mainly to cover the South East.

Fog patches were expected to form on Friday evening and become more widespread overnight, with some dense fog patches, especially in the Midlands and eastern England.

At its worst, visibility could drop to between 50m and 100m in a few places with a risk of freezing fog.

Conditions should slowly improve on Saturday, although fog could last into the afternoon in eastern areas.

The fog could bring difficult driving conditions and the chance of delays for buses, trains, and flights.

Temperatures could plunge in some rural areas in England and Wales but areas further north and in the far west will stay above freezing because of cloud cover.

The cold snap could last through to Monday.

Frank Saunders, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: ""Temperatures in England are expected to continue below normal in the coming days, with overnight minimum temperatures possibly getting to -4°C in some rural areas again tonight, and perhaps approaching this value again on Sunday night.

""Freezing fog will also form again across some areas on Friday night and Saturday morning.

""Areas covered by the alert are likely to see highs remain in the mid-to-low single figures through the weekend, especially in places where any fog or low cloud lingers throughout the day.""

Skateboarding in middle age 'helps empowerment and boosts wellbeing';Saturday 15 January 2022 02:02, UK;['aisha zahid', '@aishazahid'];[];"Skateboarding can help middle-aged people feel a sense of empowerment as well as boosting happiness and wellbeing, according to research.

The study, by Dr Paul O'Connor, suggests skateboarding can help those in middle age navigate depression, bonds with their children, and personal trials and tribulations.

It also suggests skateboarding opens up access to a new community, in turn helping people experience an identity separate from other parts of life.

Image: Esther Sayers began skateboarding at the age of 47

Esther Sayers began skateboarding at the age of 47 - now in her early 50s, she says it's a decision she hasn't looked back on.

She told Sky News: ""I had a couple of years of feeling a bit purposeless in terms of big life goals being completed.

""Adulthood can be quite constricting, you have to look after the home, the family, the job and be this professional expert.

""Skateboarding just fitted in my life at that time because it offered me something else, it offered me a new challenge, it offered me a new chance to learn again.""

She added: ""There's a stereotype that skateboarding is about freedom.

""It is about freedom for me, but it's also about a load of other things - it's about pushing myself, challenging myself, taking risks, building my strength emotionally and physically.""

Ms Sayers says the sense of achievement that comes with mastering a new trick is ""out of this world"".

At Hop King, a skate park in south London, there is a big focus on making the activity as inclusive as possible for age groups.

Image: The beginner classes are designed to make people of all ages feel welcome

Ben Hopkinson, co-founder of Hop King, told Sky News their beginner classes are designed to make people of all ages feel welcome.

They've seen a significant increase in the number of older people attending which has resulted in ""little communities"" within the skatepark being created.

Dr O'Connor said there are several reasons why older people are taking up skateboarding.

He told said for many people, it's because ""they feel like they had missed out"" if it's something they never did when they were younger.

""Fundamentally you've got something that's new, engaging, gives you some exercise, and can plug you into a community.

""It doesn't solve all your problems that's for sure but a lot of people find that it's quite inspiring, that it's motivational, that it's a creative outlet.""

Image: Ben Hopkinson, co-founded Hop King

Dr O'Connor says the fact you don't have to score points or win in skateboarding makes it ""very open, and people feel that they can progress in their own ability in their own time"".

He added: ""There's a big identity component about skateboarding as well - a lot of people I speak to are accomplished in their career.

""They want to push their identities, they don't want to be considered just as a colleague or a parent.

""They want to break free of some of the constraints of having to have a routine or a mortgage.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220115020638/https://news.sky.com/story/skateboarding-in-middle-age-helps-empowerment-and-boosts-wellbeing-12516316;Category-4: sports
Alec Baldwin's iPhone turned over to police investigating fatal movie set shooting;Saturday 15 January 2022 05:46, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Alec Baldwin has surrendered his mobile phone to investigators who are looking into the fatal shooting on his film set, his attorney has said.

A search warrant for the actor's iPhone was issued in December, but the Santa Fe County sheriff's office had said earlier this week it was still trying to obtain the device.

The Hollywood actor was rehearsing a scene in Rust and holding a prop gun when it went off, firing live rounds that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza.

Image: The search warrant issued by the state of New Mexico

On Friday, sheriff's department spokesperson Juan Rios said via email that Baldwin's phone had been turned over to authorities in Suffolk County, New York, who were in the process of downloading relevant data to send to New Mexico investigators.

According to court documents, investigators will examine text messages, emails, social network communications, browser activity, and other information stored on the device.

Aaron Dyer, an attorney for Baldwin, confirmed the actor had provided his phone to authorities on Friday.

""But this matter isn't about his phone, and there are no answers on his phone. Alec did nothing wrong,"" Dyer said in a statement.

""The real question that needs to be answered is how live rounds got on the set in the first place,"" he added.

Last week, Baldwin said any suggestion he was not complying with the search warrant for his phone was a ""lie"".

He added: ""This is a process where one state makes the request of another state. Someone from another state can't come to you and say, 'Give me your phone, give me this, give me that'. They can't do that. They've got to go through the state you live in.

""And it's a process that takes time and they have to specify what exactly they want.

""They can't just go through your phone and take your photos or your love letters to your wife or what have you, I really don't know.

""But of course, we are 1,000% going to comply with all that, we're perfectly fine with that.""

Baldwin has repeatedly said he did not know the gun contained a live round and he did not pull the trigger, saying investigators must find out who put it in the weapon.

Baldwin said he met with the film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed for a gun training session before the shoot, and she appeared capable and responsible.

Ms Gutierrez-Reed has been the subject of much of the scrutiny in the case. Her attorney has said she did not put the round in the gun and believes she was the victim of sabotage.

'I feel very lucky': Tennis star Chris Evert opens up about early ovarian cancer diagnosis;Saturday 15 January 2022 07:12, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Former world number one Chris Evert has opened up about her diagnosis of stage 1 ovarian cancer.

The American champion, 67, revealed she is currently undergoing six weeks of chemotherapy, adding: ""I feel very lucky that they caught it early and expect positive results from my chemo plan.""

In an article on ESPN, Evert said a malignant tumour was found during a preventative hysterectomy last month.

It comes after her younger sister, former pro tennis player Jeanne Evert Dubin, died from ovarian cancer in 2020 at the age of 62. Her sister's cancer had spread before it was detected, as she had no noticeable symptoms.

Likewise, Evert said: ""I just couldn't believe it. I had been working out, doing CrossFit, playing tennis. I didn't feel anything different.""

Evert said watching her sister go through treatment was ""devastating and traumatising"".

She added: ""When I go into chemo, she is my inspiration.

""I'll be thinking of her. And she'll get me through it.""

In the years since Jeanne's diagnosis, genetic testing has evolved, so when Evert sent her blood for testing it revealed she had a pathogenic variant of the BRCA1 gene.

Following discussions with her doctor, she had a hysterectomy in early December - at which point the cancer was discovered.

""70-80% of ovarian cancer is diagnosed at Stage 3 or 4,"" said her surgeon, Dr Joel Cardenas.

""Three months or so from now, she'd be Stage 3 or 4. If nothing is done, it reaches the abdomen.""

In the article, co-written by her friend Chris McKendry, Evert said she had chosen to share her diagnosis to try to help others.

""Ovarian cancer is a very deadly disease. Any information is power,"" she said.

Dr Cardenas said the key to an early diagnosis - and in turn, a better prognosis - is keeping up to date with exams, and knowing your family history.

""Ovarian cancer is rare,"" he said. ""However, if a patient has a family history, we encourage genetic testing and counselling.""

Coastguard celebrates 200 years of saving lives at sea after being created to combat smuggling;Saturday 15 January 2022 08:01, UK;[];[];"Coastguards are marking the 200th anniversary of the service dedicated to saving lives at sea, having originally been created to combat smuggling.

Founded on 15 January 1822 to tackle the tax-dodging illicit trade in goods, Her Majesty's Coastguard has evolved over the last two centuries into a British institution, ensuring people's safety around the UK's shores, 24-hours a day.

It now boasts 3,500 volunteers in 310 teams nationwide, which are supported by 10 search and rescue helicopters.

Image: To mark the milestone, 200 throwlines will be cast by coastguards around the country

As well as working in close cooperation with the RNLI, it also provides support to other critical public services, including the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic.

To mark the milestone, 200 throwlines - part of the standard lifesaving kit - will be cast by coastguards around the country as a symbol of the service's dedication.

Tom Wright, area commander for South West England, said: ""We have changed inconceivably from when we were first brought into place and in my time we have changed massively.

""We have got a lot safer and our rescue capability (has improved) and we are into technical rescue now.

""We rely a lot more on technology as far as our communications are concerned, and the new technologies, as far as drones to assist in search and rescue and other unmanned vehicles (go), will be key moving forward.""

Mr Wright added: ""We couldn't do what we do without the volunteers who give up their time 24/7 365 days a year.

""Without that workforce we wouldn't be able to undertake the search and rescue that we do.""

Image: South West commander Tom Wright hailed the vital role played by volunteers

Congratulating the Coastguard on its anniversary, maritime minister Robert Courts said: ""I am immensely proud and humbled by the continued dedication and professionalism from the staff and volunteers which ensures everyone's safety on our shores and around our coast.

""HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.""

Coastguard director Claire Hughes said: ""When you look at how we started and where we are now, it's easy to celebrate the innovation and development that can be seen throughout the service.

""And yet we are far more proud of the people, the volunteers and the staff who, throughout two centuries, have continued to strive to keep people safe at the coast and out at sea.

""We always have and always will respond to those in distress.""

The service also continue to move with the times with a £175m upgrade to its national radio network and the introduction of electric vehicles to reduce its carbon footprint.

It was back in 1809 that the Board of Customs formed the Preventative Water Guard to tackle smugglers with boats patrolling bays and coves around the country before it was placed under the Treasury in 1816.

In a minute dated 15 January 1822, the Treasury accepted it should return to the Board of Customs and declared the new force should be called ""Coast Guard"" which in effect became the ""birth certificate"" of HM Coastguard.

The Coastguard was formed with the merger of three services set up to prevent smuggling - the Revenue Cruisers, the Riding Officers and the Preventive Water Guard.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220115090933/http://news.sky.com/story/coastguard-celebrates-200-years-of-saving-lives-at-sea-after-being-created-to-combat-smuggling-12516356;Category-3: environment
Ricky Gervais on After Life, Michael B Jordan on working with Denzel Washington, and The Book Of Boba Fett - our weekly Backstage entertainment interviews and news;;[];[];"In June 2020, when grief was all too close to home for many, Ricky Gervais posted on Instagram thanking fans for making his show After Life, in which he plays a widower, the most watched British comedy programme in the world.

The second series was released during the pandemic, making viewers simultaneously laugh and cry as his character Tony continued navigating life following the death of his wife.

While Netflix has not released detailed viewing data, by asking around it quickly becomes clear that not only do lots of people watch the show, for many it's a favourite.

Now the third series – which is being billed as the last - is here and Gervais has told Sky News' Backstage podcast he never thought this far ahead when the show was originally commissioned.

""I didn't even know there would be a third series, didn't even know there would be a second series,"" he said.

""Everything I approach, I do a series and I make sure that it could be standalone in that, if the network or the broadcaster didn't want any more, if they ran out of money or no one liked it or I get hit by a bus, I make sure that it could be [just] that.

With the first season I hope there's a second, and that was true, but with the second I didn't know if there was going to be a third, and I said on Twitter and I said to Netflix, I'll do a third season if it's a wanted encore; if it goes down a storm, I'll do a third season.""

And even though all the promotional material is calling this the final series, Gervais isn't fully ruling out a return to the fictional village of Tambury.

""I've said I'm not going to do another one,"" he says. ""I believe that at the moment because I want to be held to it in a way, because it is tempting and it is mad to end it; it's at the top of its game, people love it, the money goes up, the actors love it, I love working with everyone.

""But I still think it might be the right decision. I stand by it now, it's 18 episodes and I think if I did another six they might be as good, they might not, but they have to be better in a way because if you do a fourth [series], and it's just only as good, it seems like it's not as good because people remember the first time they saw it and they watched it 10 times, and they love it.

""You want to leave on a high and you want people to go back and watch it again, which is exactly what's happening, that's exactly what's happening - I hope people love this as much as the first two, and I think I'll get out while I'm ahead.""

Ashley Jensen stars as Emma in the series Ashley Jensen stars as Emma in the series

Gervais involves the cast in planning the show, so the ending (don't worry – no spoilers here) didn't come as a surprise to them.

Even so, Tom Basden, who plays Matt, Tony's long suffering brother-in-law, says it still came with a lot of emotion.

""It’s been a very emotional show to make because of the subject matter, and because on set the cast are sort of in a heightened state of finding things very funny, and finding things very sad.

""And you're quite adrenalised a lot of the time when you're making the show.

""It feels very real, and the emotions feel very kind of direct, nothing feels that planned or artificial, particularly this series.""

Gervais says authenticity is key to the show's success.

""WHEN I HAD A REAL JOB, I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR MUCKING AROUND AND MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH - NOW PEOPLE REWARD ME FOR IT""

Ricky Gervais on making comedy shows

""The important thing is realism, and I think if you just go, 'Does this sound real? Is this likely? Is this in character? Have I seen this before? Has this happened? Will people understand what's going on?' If you do all those things, then it all works.

""The realer someone is, the better the performance, the more you laugh at the jokes and the more you cry at the sad bits.

""That's what counts - doing it for real.""

Gervais directs the episodes, as well as writing and starring in them.

The rest of the cast, many of whom are his friends and fellow comedians, clearly enjoy working with him.

""The main problem with Ricky as a director is that he just finds everything funny,"" says Basden.

""In series two when I did the scenes with Paul Kaye (who plays a psychiatrist), he had to leave the room and be listening to it on cans [headphones]. We could still hear him laughing outside the door.

""That's his sort of greatest flaw I think as a director, is that you sabotage your own work all the time.""

Diane Morgan, who plays Tony's colleague Kath, says people may have the wrong impression of Gervais.

Tony Way (right) plays photographer Lenny Tony Way (right) plays photographer Lenny

""I think people have got this idea that Ricky is quite arrogant and a bit like David Brent, and there is a touch,"" she laughs.

""But also, I think they don't see how - God, it sounds so cheesy - he's very thoughtful.""

Tony Way, who plays Tony's friend and colleague Lenny, agrees, saying Gervais ""lets you get on with it"".

And if the cast enjoyed working with Gervais, the feeling seems to be mutual.

""From my point of view, it's the most fun,"" he says. ""I mean, what a privilege, mucking around, making each other laugh for a job. That's mad.

""When I had a real job I got in trouble for mucking around and making people laugh - now people reward me for it.""

""THE WORLD CHANGED AND BY THE FIFTH TIME, [PEOPLE] WERE GOING, 'YEAH, GO ON, GIVE IT TO THEM, WE'RE SICK OF CELEBRITIES'""

Ricky Gervais on hosting the Golden Globes

The series launch comes less than a week after the Golden Globes – an event which Gervais has hosted five times.

This year there was no host, no celebrities, and the event wasn't even televised, following criticism of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association – the organisation behind the awards – for its lack of diversity and accusations of corruption.

Gervais says it's not something he was aware of.

""I see those guys for three hours, once every two years on average... I did that for fun, it was a great opportunity.

""They come to me and they say, 'you can go up, you write your own jokes, say what you want, it's well paid and 200-million people watch - it's a no-brainer, [but] if I'm not doing it, honestly, I'm trying to find enough passion to even care.""

Gervais has hosted the Golden Globes five times Gervais has hosted the Golden Globes five times

The comedian says that even if the ceremony had been on television, he wouldn't have watched.

""I've only ever watched awards ceremonies if I'm there; I'm either winning an award or handing them out. This idea of going home and watching three hours of other people winning an award, I don't know...

""I tried to make it a spectator sport when I did it and I did it five times over 10 years. I loved every one, I think I got better at it.

""My favourite one was the last one, mainly because the first time I did it 10 years ago, people are going: 'Why is he saying awful things to these lovely, these most important people in the world?' And the world changed, and by the fifth time they were going, 'Yeah, go on, give it to them, we're sick of them, we're sick of celebrities'.

Tonga: Tsunami waves hit Pacific country after huge underwater volcano eruption;Saturday 15 January 2022 19:09, UK;[];[];"A tsunami advisory has been issued for Hawaii and the North America West Coast after tidal waves hit the Pacific nation of Tonga following a giant underwater volcano eruption.

Satellite images captured the eruption followed by a huge plume of ash, steam and gas, triggering large waves that crashed ashore and sent people rushing to higher ground.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or the extent of the damage as communications with the small nation remained problematic.

The Tonga Meteorological Services said a tsunami warning had been put in force for all of Tonga.

In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported half a metre (a foot) wave slamming ashore in some areas.

""We are relieved that there is no reported damage and only minor flooding throughout the islands,"" the centre said.

Speaking to Sky News, Roger Musson, seismologist at the British geological survey, said: ""This is a very large eruption.

""There was an eruption of the same volcano about a year or so ago, but this one is seven times larger, which is really rather big,"" said Mr Musson.

""Tonga lies in what's known as the Kermadec subduction zone. It's a very seismically active area. And where you have subduction - where one crustal plate dips below another one - you also get volcanoes.

""This submarine volcano has been active for a few years now, but this is far and away the largest eruption it's produced.""

Image: It was the latest in a series of eruptions from the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano

The tsunami advisory was also issued for British Columbia in Canada.

Authorities in nearby Fiji also issued a warning, telling people to avoid the shoreline due to strong currents and dangerous waves.

Tsunami waves of 2.7ft (83 cm) were observed by gauges at the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa and waves of 2ft at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said.

It is the latest in a series of spectacular eruptions from the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano.

""The tsunami from a volcanic eruption like this tends to be worse close in, so it's pretty damaging in Tonga itself,"" explained Mr Musson.

""But with regard to the further effects around the Pacific, like the west coast of North America, I would not expect the the effects to be terribly strong.

""A tsunami advisory is just a warning to be aware rather than a statement something very dangerous is imminent,"" added the seismologist.

""It's always best to be careful about these things, but I would expect that it will be downgraded fairly soon.

""That doesn't help the people in Tonga, of course who've had their homes destroyed by the tsunami,"" he said.

Dr Faka'iloatonga Taumoefolau posted footage on Twitter showing water crashing on to the shore and flooding properties.

""Can literally hear the volcano eruption, sounds pretty violent,"" he wrote.

A convoy of police and military troops reportedly evacuated Tonga's King Tupou VI from his palace near the shore as residents headed for higher ground.

Scientists had observed massive explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early on Friday, the Matangi Tonga news site reported.

The site said satellite images showed a three-mile wide plume of ash, steam and gas rising up to 12-miles into the air.

They came ahead of a crucial vote on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill on Monday.

Many hundreds joined the so-called ""Kill the Bill"" protest in London, marching from Holborn towards Parliament Square in Westminster carrying banners reading ""defend the right to protest"" and ""we will not be silenced"".

The rally was joined by members of a broad range of groups, including social, racial, and environmental justice activists, who are demanding that the House of Lords squash the bill.

Speaking in Bristol to Sky News' Dan Whitehead, a protester named Lacey said: ""If the bill passes, ultimately my rights and everybody else's in terms of speaking out would just be essentially taken away.

""I know that there's petitions and things like that that exist, but unfortunately our government, or the people in power, just won't listen.

Sky News also spoke to Libby who said: ""I think that there are different ways of protesting, sure, they can be petitions, but there's not quite any visual that shows how many people care like boots on the ground all in one big group.""

Ben Hancock, 70, from London, told the PA news agency: ""The measures are completely draconian really, basically rights will be taken away from anybody to protest. I mean, effectively we're going to be reduced to a state similar to Russia.""

In its current form the new law would put protesters at risk of lengthy prison sentences and hefty fines for demonstrations that cause ""serious annoyance"".

It would also restate the common law offence of public nuisance - something which the Law Commission had recommended in 2015 - but civil rights organisations including Liberty have warned the offence is ""incredibly broad"".

Liberty said the wording of the offence ""includes 'any conduct which endangers the life, health, property or comfort of a section of the public' or 'that obstructs them in the exercise of rights belonging to the public'.

""Given that nearly all protests, arguably, 'obstruct' the public - indeed, it is the whole point of them - protestors may be charged under an offence that involves a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment,"" the organisation warned.

The bill would also expand the powers available to police to stop and search people, and introduce new laws against residing on land without authorisation with a vehicle which would effectively criminalise gypsy, Roma and traveller communities.

Amendments added to the bill by the government in the House of Lords in November make obstructing major transport works a criminal offence and would equip police with the power to ban named people from demonstrating.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220115204625/https://news.sky.com/story/kill-the-bill-demonstrators-warn-of-draconian-crackdown-on-right-to-protest-12516760;Category-1: politics
Rabbi and worshippers held hostage at Texas synagogue;Saturday 15 January 2022 23:11, UK;[];[];"A rabbi and several worshippers are being held hostage by a man at a synagogue in Texas.

A SWAT team and FBI officers have been called to the incident at Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville.

The hostage taker has reportedly told authorities he wants the release of Aafia Siddiqui from a federal prison.

Siddiqui, 49, was convicted in 2010 of attempting to kill US officers in Afghanistan and is currently being held at FMC Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden ""has been briefed about the developing hostage situation"" and ""will continue to receive updates from his senior team as the situation develops"".

Israel's prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said he was ""closely monitoring"" the situation, adding: ""We pray for the safety of the hostages and rescuers.""

Dara Nelson, a police sergeant for Colleyville Police, said there were no injuries to report and that officers had evacuated the area.

""The FBI negotiators are the ones who have contact with the person in the building,"" Sgt Nelson said, adding there was ""no threat to the general public"".

Audio of the initial hostage incident was caught on a morning Shabbat service which the synagogue was livestreaming on Facebook.

Although no images of inside the building were broadcast, the audio recorded a man shouting angrily, according to multiple reports.

At least four hostages including the rabbi were believed to be inside the synagogue, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press news agency on the condition of anonymity.

Siddiqui is currently imprisoned just over 15 miles away from the synagogue in Colleyville.

Law enforcement officials in Texas are attempting to establish whether the suspect is related to Siddiqui.

According to the Department of Justice, Siddiqui ""was detained by Afghan authorities [in 2008], who found a number of items in her possession, including handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack' and that listed various locations in the United States, including Plum Island, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street, and the Brooklyn Bridge.""

Restrictions could be lifted by end of January

It comes as coronavirus restrictions in England could be lifted by the end of January, with the Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden telling Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday that he was ""hopeful"", thanks to ""encouraging signs"".

The current Plan B rules - which includes the mandatory wearing of face masks in some settings, the use of vaccine passports or negative lateral flow tests to enter some venues and working from home where possible - are due to be reviewed in 10 days.

Mr Dowden added that there is ""promising data"" on COVID infections and hospitalisations that give ""pause for hope and optimism that we may be emerging from the worst of Omicron"".

His comments come after Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said infection levels in London, the South East and East of England are flattening off.

She said that while case numbers are still rising in northern parts of the country, the growth rate there is slowing.

On Friday, the UK's R (reproduction) number was estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.5, meaning that every 10 people infected with coronavirus will on average pass the disease to between 11 and 15 other people.

In a statement, Akram's brother Gulbar said family members spent hours ""liasing with Faisal"" during the siege, and that although he was ""suffering from mental health issues we were confident that he would not harm the hostages"".

""There was nothing we could have said to him or done that would have convinced him to surrender,"" Gulbar said.

Met Police working 'liaising' with FBI

The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit is ""liaising with US authorities and colleagues from the FBI"", which has said there is no indication there were any other individuals involved in the attack.

Akram took four people hostage, including a rabbi, inside the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville at around 11am local time on Saturday.

One was freed after six hours before an FBI SWAT team entered the building at around 9pm, shot the attacker dead and released the other three unharmed.

The rabbi held hostage in the attack, Charlie Cytron-Walker, has said Akram became ""increasingly belligerent and threatening"" during the standoff.

Mr Cytron-Walker credited security training his congregation had received over the years for keeping the hostages safe.

Without that training ""we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself"", he said.

The first part of the siege was captured on a Facebook livestream of the morning shabbat, which was cut off at around 2pm.

Akram demanded release of Pakistani neuroscientist

On it the hostage-taker was heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al Qaeda, who was convicted of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan.

He said he wanted to speak to Siddiqui, who is being held at FMC Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, following her conviction in 2010.

Witnesses claim he referred to her as his sister, but John Floyd, of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Siddiqui's brother was not involved.

""This assailant has nothing to do with Dr Aafia, her family, or the global campaign to get justice for Dr Aafia,"" he said.

""We want the assailant to know that his actions are wicked and directly undermine those of us who are seeking justice for Dr Aafia.""

Image: The siege lasted more than eight hours

Nearby resident Victoria Francis told the Associated Press she tuned into the stream before the feed was turned off and heard a man say ""I'm the guy with a bomb"" and ""if you make a mistake this is all on you"".

Video from Dallas TV Station WFAA also showed a number of people running out of the door of the synagogue and a man holding a gun.

The motive for the attack on the synagogue, which is around 30 miles from Dallas, is still unclear, and authorities are still trying to establish any relationship between Akram and Siddiqui.

Biden calls for 'harder focus' on guns

US President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident as it unfolded and has described it as an ""act of terror"".

He suggested the attacker was able to get a gun from off the street and that the siege represented a ""failure to focus as hard as we should on gun sales"".

An 86-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene and the man, also 88, is being treated for life-threatening injuries in hospital.

Police said it was not being treated as a domestic incident and that a ""serious level of violence"" was used.

There have been no arrests and officers remain at the scene.

Texas synagogue siege: Aafia Siddiqui - who is the Pakistani prisoner at the centre of the incident?;Monday 17 January 2022 11:08, UK;[];[];"The British man accused of holding hostages inside a Texas synagogue on Saturday demanded the release of a Pakistani woman who is imprisoned close by on charges of trying to kill American service members in Afghanistan.

Aafia Siddiqui is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the Fort Worth area after being convicted in 2010.

During the hostage situation in Colleyville multiple people said they heard Malik Faisal Akram, who was shot dead, refer to Siddiqui as his ""sister"" on the livestream.

A lawyer representing Siddiqui, Marwa Elbially, told CNN in a statement that he was not Siddiqui's brother and Siddiqui's family condemned his ""heinous"" actions.

Other people associated with Siddiqui have told Sky News they have no knowledge of Akram or affiliation with him.

For the Justice Department, which had accused Siddiqui of being an al Qaeda operative, her sentencing was a significant conviction in the fight against international extremism.

But to her supporters, many of whom believed in her innocence, the case embodied what they saw as an overzealous post September 11-American judicial system.

Who is Aafia Siddiqui?

She's a Pakistani neuroscientist who studied in the US at prestigious institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

She attracted the attention of American law enforcement in the years after the 9/11 attacks.

The FBI and Justice Department described her as an ""al Qaeda operative and facilitator"" at a May 2004 news conference.

In 2008, she was detained by authorities in Afghanistan.

American officials said they found in her possession handwritten notes that discussed the construction of so-called dirty bombs and that listed various locations in the US that could be targeted in a ""mass casualty attack"".

Inside an interview room at an Afghan police compound, authorities say she grabbed the rifle of a US Army officer and opened fire on members of the US team assigned to interrogate her.

She was convicted in 2010 on charges including attempting to kill US nationals outside the United States.

At her sentencing hearing, she gave rambling statements in which she delivered a message of world peace - and also forgave the judge.

She expressed frustration at arguments from her own lawyers who said she deserved leniency because she was mentally ill.

""I'm not paranoid,"" she said. ""I don't agree with that.""

What was the reaction to her sentencing?

Pakistani officials immediately decried the punishment, which prompted protests in multiple cities and criticism in the media.

The prime minister at the time, Yousuf Raza Gilani, called her the ""daughter of the nation"" and vowed to campaign for her release from jail.

Faizan Syed, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the group considers Siddiqui to have been ""caught in the war on terror"" as well as a political prisoner who was wrongly accused through flawed evidence.

Poorest families will be hit hardest by energy bills surge, charity warns;Tuesday 18 January 2022 03:44, UK;[];[];"The poorest families will be hit disproportionately hard when the Energy Price Cap rises in April - according to analysis by the charity The Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

They say some of those earning the least could end up spending 54% of their household income on energy bills when the price cap goes up, leaving them unable to cope.

'We have really, really struggled as a household'

Single dad Anthony is one of thousands across the country terrified about the impending rise. He had to stop working because of a disability - and now cares for his nine-year-old son and four-year-old daughter using just Universal Credit.

Image: Single dad Anthony is one of thousands across the country terrified about the impending rise

He says he already has to rely on charity handouts just to pay for things like school uniforms - and sometimes even food for his children.

""No father likes to admit they are struggling,"" he told Sky News. ""We receive about £1,000 a month in Universal Credit, and that supports the children as well as myself. And we find ourselves in a deficit of around £200 to £400 - and that's obviously going to increase as the energy prices increase as well.""

""We have really, really struggled as a household. And to hide that from your children is one of the most difficult things to do.""

Energy Price Cap increase

Because of soaring energy costs, the amount companies can charge customers on certain tariffs under the government's Energy Price Cap is predicted to go up in April by around 51 percent.

While it will be difficult for most customers to swallow, the analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the increase is likely to devastate the finances of the poorest families, who are already facing spiralling household costs.

The charity found that when the price cap goes up, the average low-income family will end up spending 18% of their household income after housing costs on energy bills.

Image: Anthony says he already has to rely on charity handouts just to pay for things like school uniforms

For single adult families on low incomes, this rises to a huge 54%. Meanwhile, the impact on higher-earning families will be much less severe - it says middle-income households will be spending an average of 6% of their income on energy bills.

It also found 1.8 million children across the country are now living in what they call 'very deep poverty' - meaning there isn't even enough money to cover the absolute essentials.

Emergency payments demanded for poorest families

The charity - along with many other organisations - is calling for the government to step in to cushion families from the increase.

""Heading into the cost of living crisis we now find ourselves in, those families whose budgets are already under constant pressure are going to find themselves sinking even deeper into poverty,"" said Katie Schmuecker, the Foundation's deputy director of policy.

""What we need to see is urgent action from the government - an emergency payment - that goes to families on the lowest incomes to help them get through this crisis.

""But we also need to be asking ourselves why families are so exposed to the cost of energy. One of the reasons is that our social security system is simply not providing enough support.""

Charities who support families in poverty also say demand for their services is skyrocketing. Christians Against Poverty - who help with household debt - told Sky News the number of appointments made for their debt help service was 41% higher last month compared to December 2020, while the number of calls to their helpline was up by almost a third.

The government says it has already taken decisive steps to protect the most vulnerable households.

""The Energy Price Cap has been protecting around 15 million households from high global gas prices. We are also supporting vulnerable and low-income households with the cost of fuel bills through schemes such as the Warm Home Discount and our £500m Household Support Fund,"" a spokesperson for BEIS said.

""We will continue to look closely at the pressures facing people and what further measures might be needed on abating high energy costs.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118040757/https://news.sky.com/story/poorest-families-will-be-hit-hardest-by-energy-bills-surge-charity-warns-12518779;Category-3: environment

Cost of living: Pay rises wiped out by surging inflation, official figures show;Tuesday 18 January 2022 07:32, UK;[];[];"UK workers saw their wage rises wiped out by surging inflation late last year, official figures show.

Weekly earnings - excluding bonuses - rose by 3.8% in the three months to November compared to the same period a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

But with inflation climbing to a ten-year high, the rise was cut to zero in real terms, the ONS said.

For November alone, workers suffered a real terms pay cut of 1% - the first such fall since July 2020.

But the figures also showed more signs of falling unemployment, which dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%.

Energy crisis: Three options left to insulate households from '50% increase in bills';Tuesday 18 January 2022 07:43, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will hold fresh talks with energy companies this week as the government narrows its options for insulating consumers from a forecast 50% increase in bills.

Campaigners claim up to six million households could be plunged into fuel poverty.

Ministers are under pressure to finalise plans ahead of the announcement of the new energy price cap on 7 February, forecast to raise average bills by around £700 to £2,000 per household.

With the bulk of the increase driven by soaring wholesale gas prices, talks are focused on domestic tax and policy costs currently loaded onto bills and what form any financial support to suppliers should take.

The three options

The landing zone for government action is understood to have narrowed to three areas, all of which require Treasury support to meaningfully reduce bills: cutting VAT; increasing the reach and value of the Warm Home Discount; and a Treasury-backed commercial lending scheme to spread the cost of suppliers absorbing customers from more than 20 companies that have collapsed.

Taken together the three measures could cut £300-£400 from consumer bills.

VAT cut

Ministers may also consider shifting some green levies from bills into general taxation. This may not be straightforward because some schemes, such as suppliers improving insulation in customer homes, are already contracted.

Cutting VAT charged at 5% would reduce bills by around £100 but would cost the Treasury up to £2bn.

The chancellor is said to be reluctant and the Prime Minister has argued it is a ""blunt instrument"" that benefits wealthy bill payers, but the impending price rise is so great it may be one of the few straightforward measures available.

Warm Home Discount

Expanding the Warm Home Discount (WHD), currently worth £140 and paid to 2.2 million people in receipt of certain benefits, would achieve ministers' aim of targeting the most vulnerable consumers.

The scheme is currently funded by all consumers and is drawn from the social and policy costs that make up 12% of energy bills. The existing cost, along with any increase, will have to be stripped out of bills and covered by general taxation.

Figures published by Ofgem on Monday showed that suppliers spent £351m on rebates through the WHD scheme last year.

The Resolution Foundation says rebates should double to £300 and the number of eligible households quadruple to cover more than 8 million in receipt of pension credits or working age benefits at a total cost of £2.5bn.

Commercial lending scheme

A state-backed scheme to spread the cost of taking on customers from failed companies is an idea also thought to have gained support.

Currently when a provider goes bust its customers are passed on to another supplier, with the cost of covering their credits and wholesale supply shared via a levy on all bill payers.

Company failures in the last 12 months have already seen £1.8bn in costs passed onto suppliers, with a further £1.7bn at risk via the government-backed administration of Bulb.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:33 Customers are being urged not to panic after energy supplier Bulb went into administration.

The scheme under consideration would spread those costs over multiple years, rather than loading them onto this year's bills.

Ofgem is already consulting on changing its licensing conditions to allow commercial lenders to cover suppliers' so called ""supplier of last resort"" (SOLR) costs.

'Help the most vulnerable and the poorest in society'

A Government-backed fund from which suppliers could borrow to buy energy when wholesale costs increase has also been proposed, but is not universally supported by suppliers.

There are concerns too that with gas prices forecast to remain well above historic averages for at least another 18 months it could become an open-ended commitment.

Centrica, the owner of the UK's largest supplier British Gas, has described such a scheme as a bail-out for failing suppliers.

Poorest families will be hit hardest by energy bills surge, charity warns

Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told Sky News the government should focus on support for the most vulnerable.

The new C-Band 5G service set to be rolled out by AT&T; and Verizon on Wednesday could leave a significant number of widebody aircraft unusable, the airlines warned.

It could also ""potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas"" and cause ""chaos"" for US flights, they said.

""Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded,"" wrote the chief executives of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned potential interference could affect sensitive aeroplane instruments such as altimeters and significantly hamper low-visibility operations.

""This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays,"" the letter warned.

On Monday, several airlines were considering whether to cancel some international flights scheduled to arrive in the US on Wednesday.

""With the proposed restrictions at selected airports, the transportation industry is preparing for some service disruption. We are optimistic that we can work across industries and with government to finalize solutions that safely mitigate as many schedule impacts as possible,"" plane maker Boeing said on Monday.

The letter calling for urgent action was also signed by UPS Airlines, Alaska Air, Atlas Air, JetBlue Airways and FedEx Express.

COVID-19: Sturgeon under pressure to ease restrictions in Scotland;Tuesday 18 January 2022 02:03, UK;['james matthews', '@jamesmatthewsky'];[];"Nicola Sturgeon faces renewed calls to lift COVID restrictions when she announces Scotland's next steps in combating the virus.

Sporting organisations have echoed the hospitality industry in demanding that Scotland's first minister eases measures when she makes a statement to the Holyrood parliament today.

From yesterday football supporters are allowed, once again, to attend matches in unlimited numbers but indoor events still have a seated limit of 200.

Dundee Stars ice hockey team is among those who have played recent matches in front of crowds a tenth of their normal size. Last Thursday, they played against Manchester Storm in a fixture that would normally have attracted around 2,000 spectators to Dundee Ice Arena. However, only 200 were allowed inside.

Eighty percent of the team's income comes from ticket sales and, to date, they have lost more than £100,000.

Co-owner Steve Ward, co-owner, told Sky News that he believes the decision to limit crowds doesn't sit easily with restrictions being lifted for football, rugby and outdoor sports.

""We understand everybody's got to play their part, but they've maybe acted a bit hastily.

""To get to a football match, most guys go to the pub first, that's still a huge thing. This is a family sport, with family units paying to come. There aren't bus loads and hordes of people all in the same area getting to the game. Everybody, more or less, comes in their family group and attends the match.

""You get 50,000 people inside Hampden, how many people are on public transport, using trains & buses? That's something I'm not so sure they have considered.""

Ahead of today's announcement, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes to ease restrictions on indoor venues and events from 24th January.

UKHospitality Scotland Executive Director Leon Thompson said: ""Hospitality needs to know that it can begin trading fully, including nightclubs, so we're calling on the Scottish Government to lift restrictions no later than 24th January.

MPs vote for controversial legislation to introduce voter ID;Tuesday 18 January 2022 02:27, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"MPs have backed controversial legislation to introduce voter ID.

Voters will need to show an approved form of photographic identification before they can collect their ballot paper to vote in a polling station, according to measures in the Elections Bill.

The measures will apply across the UK in general elections and councils will make a free voter card available for those without a suitable form of ID.

Labour says it will cut turn out

However Labour have said voter ID could prevent people from voting.

Labour MP Nick Smith (Blaenau Gwent) said: ""I am worried about voter suppression.

""And at stake is the very integrity of our elections.""

He said voter ID ""is an old, cynical trick. Insert an administrative hurdle"".

""Dress it up as improving security. Watch voter turnout go down. Job done. The fix is in.""

But Conservative former minister Steve Baker said: ""The idea that impersonation isn't a problem certainly does not accord with my experience in Wycombe.""

Government accused of rushing the Bill through the Commons

The bill passed under fraught circumstances as its report stage, where MPs debate amendments, was cut to two hours and 20 minutes due to extra business scheduled in the Commons by the government on Monday.

The third reading debate was also quick after four votes and a cut-off time of 10pm, leaving only seven minutes available.

SNP MP Patrick Grady said the government had ""rushed it through"" the previous committee stage, adding: ""The way this Bill has been rammed through this House is a complete an utter disgrace.""

Labour's former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee had urged the government to pause proceedings on the Bill, with its report noting more thorough consultations were needed - particularly in regards to the voter ID requirement.

""I'm offended by the limited amount of time we've been given this evening,"" he said.

A Bill 'full of solutions searching for problems'

Labour's bid to remove the voter ID section of the Bill was rejected by 327 votes to 234, a majority of 93.

Shadow communities minister Alex Norris said: ""This is a bad Bill. It's full of solutions in search of problems.

""Rather than opening up our democracy to greater participation it will do the opposite, all the while further weakening our democracy to dodgy finance.

""It's the sort of partial nonsense that you see in US state houses.""

Mr Norris said the evidence showed in 2019 ""you are more likely to have been struck by lightning three times than have voted after a phony voter"".

But the communities minister, Kemi Badenoch, said: ""I am disappointed but not surprised that the Opposition remains unable to see the necessity of this simple and proportionate protection for the integrity of our ballot.

""The fact is voter ID is supported by the Electoral Commission, it is backed by international election observers who have repeatedly called for the introduction, saying its absence is a security risk, it is long-established in liberal democracies across the world and is already in place in Northern Ireland.""

Man who raped and assaulted woman he met on social media after 'locking and chaining' her flat jailed for 17 years;Tuesday 18 January 2022 09:03, UK;[];[];"A man who raped and assaulted a woman he met online after locking and chaining her front door has been jailed.

Charles Akpoveta, a 33-year-old delivery driver living in Luton, was sentenced to 17 years in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Monday.

The trial heard how Akpoveta travelled into London on 29 February 2020 to meet a 28-year-old woman he had made contact with on a social media app.

Police said the pair went to her flat in Tower Hamlets where they had consensual sex, but afterwards, Akpoveta's mood changed and he spat in her face.

The woman asked him to leave but he refused, instead locking and chaining her front door.

He then carried out a number of assaults on her, police said, including beating, biting, strangling and urinating on her.

During the course of the night, the woman managed to phone the police.

Officers attended and arrested Akpoveta and he was taken to an east London police station and subsequently charged with multiple offences.

In November 2021, he was found guilty of four counts of rape, three counts of assault by penetration, three counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent.

This was along with three counts of assault by beating at a previous trial in October 2020.

Detective Constable Matthew Cooksey, investigating, said: ""First and foremost, I would like to commend the victim of these attacks for her bravery and determination throughout the investigation, in particular dealing with two cross examinations across two trials and her unwavering commitment to working with detectives throughout. Her strength of character is inspiring.

""Throughout our investigation, Akpoveta paraded as a man who had been wrongly accused, claiming that everything which he subjected the victim to was consensual. This couldn't have been further from the truth.

""I hope that today's result will give the victim some respite, and also demonstrate the Met's determination in ending violence against women and girls and bringing predatory offenders to justice.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118101254/https://news.sky.com/story/man-who-raped-and-assaulted-woman-he-met-on-social-media-after-locking-and-chaining-her-flat-jailed-for-17-years-12518857;Category-7: health
Oil price hits highest level since 2014 on Middle East supply fears;Tuesday 18 January 2022 12:33, UK;[];[];"Oil prices have hit the highest level for more than seven years as worries about violence in the Middle East added to an already tight outlook for supply.

Brent crude topped $88 a barrel in Tuesday trading, its highest level since October 2014 - creating a further potential headache for squeezed UK consumers if the increase is passed on to petrol pumps.

Supply concerns have risen this week after Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacked the United Arab Emirates, which is part of a Saudi-led coalition on the opposite side in Yemen's civil war.

Image: Some analysts think oil could return to $100 a barrel

Drone and missile strikes set off explosions in fuel tanker trucks and killed three people and Houthis said they could target more facilities while the UAE said it reserved the right to ""respond to these terrorist attacks"".

The country's oil firm ADNOC said it had activated continuity plans to ensure uninterrupted supply to local and international customers after an incident at its Mussafah fuel depot.

Elsewhere tensions between Russia and Ukraine have also been driving energy prices higher.

Meanwhile some oil-producing countries that have agreed between them to hike production by 400,000 barrels per day each month are struggling to reach their allowed capacities due to underinvestment and outages.

Market watchers also point to the growing feeling that the impact of the Omicron variant on economic activity will be less than feared - and not drag on demand as much as it might have done.

Goldman Sachs analysts have said they expected oil stocks in the OECD - a group of 38 mainly developed nations - to fall to their lowest since 2000 by the summer, with Brent oil prices rising to $100 later this year.

Rising oil prices could add to Britain's cost of living squeeze.

Petrol prices have already hit record levels in recent months while a surge in wholesale gas prices is filtering through to households too and is expected to prompt a big jump in the energy price cap.

The arrest comes after Ms Murphy was remembered as a ""woman who made a difference, who brought happiness and who was loved"" during her funeral mass at St Brigid's Church in Mountbolus.

Why Lloyd's of London could be saying farewell to the iconic HQ designed to bring people together;Tuesday 18 January 2022 15:01, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];"The Lloyd's Building's opening in 1986 symbolised the City of London's renaissance and heralded a wave of thrilling new developments across the Square Mile from Broadgate Circle to the Gherkin.

Why Lloyd's of London could be saying farewell to the iconic HQ designed to bring people together

Lloyd's said it was thinking carefully about the future requirements for the spaces and services it needs

It is one of the most recognisable buildings in Britain.

The Lloyd's Building on Lime Street in the City, designed for the world's oldest insurance market by the visionary architect Richard Rogers, revolutionised the way we look at buildings by positioning lifts and ducts on the outside in order to maximise available space on the inside.

By the end of the decade, though, it may be being used by a different tenant from the one that provides its name.

Image: The design revolutionised the way we look at buildings by positioning lifts and ducts on the outside

The market is holding a review in response to changing working habits and React News, the real estate market intelligence provider, reports that, although Lloyd's of London's lease on the building does not run out until 2031, there is a break in the contract that it could exercise in 2026 if it wants to leave early.

Lloyd's was quick to close its underwriting room - specifically designed to bring people together to write reinsurance contracts face to face - at the start of the pandemic.

Advertisement

From a capacity of up to 7,000 people in the room, prior to the pandemic, just several hundred people were working there by the middle of 2020.

Now the market is having to think about how many people, in future, will be seeking to locate themselves physically in the building.

Lloyd's said: ""As we adapt to new structures and flexible ways of working, we are continuing to carefully think about the future requirements for the spaces and services our marketplace needs.

""Currently, like many other organisations, we are considering a range of options around our workspace strategy and the future leasing arrangements for Lloyd's.""

Were Lloyd's to leave the Lloyd's Building, it would be an extraordinary moment.

The word iconic is overused, but when it comes to this building, it is entirely appropriate.

The Lloyd's Building, which took eight years to build at a cost of £75m, was a symbol of the City of London's renaissance when it was officially opened by the Queen on 18 November 1986.

Mrs Thatcher's Big Bang reforms had been enacted the previous month - unleashing competition across the Square Mile and attracting a wave of investment into the City by American, Japanese and German banks.

And, while Big Bang was a reform of equity markets and not insurance, the bold design of the Lloyd's Building was a supreme statement of confidence.

It projected to the outside world that the City, despite its institutions being centuries-old in some cases, was embracing modernity.

Like all great architectural works, it was not to everyone's taste, initially.

An un-named Lloyd's underwriter complained to the Financial Times shortly after relocating to the new headquarters that the building was dark and gloomy and suffered from poor air-conditioning, that the glass lifts were covered in bird droppings and looked ""tatty"" and that problems with the new escalators - a key part of the design - were taking it longer to transact business.

Image: The Walkie-Talkie, the Cheesegrater and the Gherkin were part of a wave of transformation kicked off by the Lloyd's Building

This denizen of what was always regarded as a highly conservative institution grumbled: ""I don't know whether the air-conditioning will work when the next heatwave comes along, but I suspect that even if it improves, we will still see people taking their jackets off.

""This never happened in all my 26 years in the old building.""

The opening of the Lloyd's Building, though, heralded a wave of thrilling new buildings across the Square Mile and competition among architects and developers to come up with the most imaginative designs.

These transformed the City's landscape.

Hot on the heels of the Lloyd's Building came the Broadgate Circle, developed by Sir Stuart Lipton and Godfrey Bradman and designed by Arup, built on the site of the old Broad Street railway station.

Famous for its amphitheatre, which in the winter was host to what was London's first ""turn up and skate"" open ice rink, it too is now one of the City's most recognisable landmarks.

Across the City, meanwhile, the ugly concrete blocks that had sat alongside St Paul's Cathedral since the 1960s were torn down and replaced in 2003 by the striking Paternoster Square development, which quickly became the new home for the London Stock Exchange.

The following year, the development was completed when Sir Christopher Wren's historic Temple Bar Gate - the traditional entry point to the west of the Square Mile - was relocated there.

Image: The design for No 1 Poultry was denounced by Prince Charles as resembling a '1930s wireless set'

These buildings and developments did not go up without what were often long and drawn-out hold-ups to the planning process.

One of the most bitter concerned the redevelopment of No 1 Poultry, next to the Mansion House, which had previously been a gothic Victorian building that housed the headquarters of jewellers Mappin and Webb.

It took several decades of campaigning by Lord Palumbo and the architect James Stirling to redevelop the site.

The design for the new building was denounced by Prince Charles as resembling a ""1930s wireless set"" but it is now so much a part of the City's fabric that its rooftop restaurant, Coq d'Argent, was even used as the site for the Queen's fictional helicopter departure point in the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.

Other remarkable buildings followed as the City of London Corporation sought to out-do the giant glass and steel temples being erected a few miles to the east in Canary Wharf.

They included the Gherkin, which opened in April 2004 and the Heron Tower (now the Salesforce Tower), developed by Gerald Ronson and designed by the US architects Kohn Pederson Fox. It opened in 2011.

Next came the Walkie-Talkie (20 Fenchurch Street), which opened in April 2014 and the Cheesegrater (122 Leadenhall Street), which opened three months later.

More recently has come the stunning 22 Bishopsgate, the City's tallest building, developed by Sir Stuart Lipton and Peter Rogers, the younger brother of Richard Rogers.

This wave of transformation was all kicked off by the opening of the Lloyd's Building and it is no coincidence that the Gherkin, the Cheesegrater and the Walkie-Talkie, three of the most controversial of the new towers, are close to it in the EC3 postcode, long regarded as the City's ""insurance quarter"".

Lloyd's has been through much cultural change in recent years and a move away from its headquarters would no doubt be as much of wrench as it was to the crusty old underwriters who moved in there 35 years ago.

But it would be totally in keeping with the way this venerable City institution is evolving.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118161330/https://news.sky.com/story/why-lloyds-of-london-could-be-saying-farewell-to-the-iconic-hq-designed-to-bring-people-together-12519139;Category-2: business and economy
Fundamental error' left child murder case unsolved for more than 20 years, court hears;Tuesday 18 January 2022 14:22, UK;[];[];"The murder of a six-year-old boy was unsolved for more than two decades due to a ""fundamental error"", a court has been told.

James Watson was 13 when he is alleged to have attacked Rikki Neave and strangled him with his own jacket on 28 November, 1994, the Old Bailey heard.

According to police, he stripped Rikki's body and posed him in a ""star shape"" in the woods before leaving his clothes in a bin.

Watson, now 40, was seen with Rikki on the day he went missing and police spoke to him at the time as a witness.

Rikki's mother was accused of the murder and child cruelty but, while she admitted child cruelty, the jury cleared her of the murder in 1996.

Prosecutor John Price QC told the Old Bailey that the jury's decision to clear Rikki's mother on the murder charge was correct.

""Fundamental error""

Mr Price added that the ""error"" that saw her charged with murder was largely due to incorrect weight given to sightings of Rikki at a time when reliable evidence showed he was dead.

""Much of this reliable evidence was itself acquired during the first investigation, but its true significance and importance was misunderstood or ignored.

""This fundamental error deflected the focus of attention of the investigation.

""It took it away from where it should have been.""

That error meant Rikki's murder remained a mystery until the case was reopened in 2015 and adhesive tapes from Rikki's clothes were examined.

This allowed the DNA match to Watson to be made.

Mr Price said evidence showed Rikki had walked willingly into the woods where he was subjected to a ""surprise attack"" from behind.

Marks on his neck suggested he was ""most likely"" strangled with his own jacket.

At 1.05pm that day, a youth had been seen walking out of a cul-de-sac where Rikki's clothes were later recovered.

Mr Price also told the jury that Watson was ""exhibiting a grotesque interest in the subject of child murder"" in late November 1994.

Together Energy becomes latest household supplier to collapse in gas price storm;Tuesday 18 January 2022 15:39, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Together Energy, which has 176,000 households on its books, has become the latest supplier to collapse in the wake of the soaring cost of gas that is tipped to force bills up by 50% from April.

Sky News reported earlier this month that the company, part-owned by Warrington Borough Council in Cheshire, was on the verge of throwing in the towel after it deferred making a £12.4m payment to the industry regulator.

Ofgem said on Tuesday that Together - and its subsidiary Bristol Energy - had ceased to trade.

More than two dozen suppliers have fallen by the wayside since August last year when an unprecedented increase in wholesale gas costs took hold.

Firms have been unable to fully pass these on to consumers because the vast majority of households are now protected by the government's price cap.

It rose by 12% in October but the next review by Ofgem is expected to see bills rise 50% to an average £2,000 annually in April without government intervention.

Sky News reported earlier on Tuesday that ministers are now examining three options to insulate families from the worst of the hike.

The prospect of such an increase has sparked warnings from numerous charities and other interest groups that it would drive a spike in fuel poverty to beyond six million families.

Customers of Together and Bristol now come under the protection of the regulator until they have a new supplier appointed to them.

Neil Lawrence, Director of Retail at Ofgem, said: ""Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers. We know this is a worrying time for many people and news of a supplier going out of business can be unsettling.

""I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry, under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.

In England, 16,218 people are being treated in hospital, with 614 in ventilation beds.

Meanwhile, 73,267 people have been given a third, or booster, dose of a coronavirus vaccine, taking the total to 63.6% of the population.

A further 26,502 people received their second dose, while 15,748 have been given the first jab, the latest figures show.

It comes as Scotland will remove all its Omicron coronavirus restrictions from next Monday, with the first minister confirming the country is on a ""downward slope"" of infections.

The changes will see nightclubs reopen, the requirement for table service in hospitality come to an end and attendance limits on indoor events lifted.

The prime minister is, according to The Guardian, drawing up plans that could see all COVID-19 rules phased out in England as early as March.

The paper reports his intention would be to let the country live with the virus.

Plan B restrictions, which are currently in place, are due to be reviewed next week, on 26 January. Working from home guidance, and COVID passports - both introduced when the new variant began circulating widely - are set to be scrapped, but face mask rules could remain in the short term.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs: ""I have always said that these restrictions should not stay in place a day longer than they are absolutely necessary.

""Due to these pharmaceutical defences and the likelihood that we have already reached the peak of the case numbers and hospitalisations, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to substantially reduce measures next week.""

With the government continuing to encourage booster jabs, a new survey has found two-thirds of adults feel the UK should share more vaccine doses with the world.

Of the 2,186 adults surveyed, around 63% said new variants were likely in countries with poor vaccine access so the UK should prioritise ensuring the vaccine is available worldwide, instead of giving any further booster jabs.

Energy crisis: Household finances face worst hit from surging bills since 1970 this year;Tuesday 18 January 2022 18:17, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Households in Britain could soon be spending more of their money on energy than any previous generation, including during the oil shocks of the 1970s and '80s, according to Sky News analysis.

If the energy price cap rises in line with current wholesale prices, by the end of the year the share of family expenditure on heat and power will exceed the peaks of the 1980s, taking them towards unprecedented highs.

The projections are the latest evidence of the impact families will face if and when record gas prices are passed onto them by their providers.

In 2019/20, before the latest series of price hikes, Britons were on average spending 4.2% of total household spending on electricity, gas or other fuels to heat their homes. This was comfortably below the average over the past half century, about 4.7% of total spending.

However, if the energy price cap takes the average bill up to £2,000 this spring, as is implied by Ofgem's formula, the share spent on heat and power will rise to 5.6% of spending. That would be the highest overall electricity/gas burden since the early 1980s.

If the price cap rises again in the autumn to £2,400, as is implied by current wholesale prices, that would push up spending on power and heat to 6.8% of household expenditure. This would be the highest level since at least 1970, in other words higher even than during the fuel crisis of the 1970s.

The previous peak was 6.3% of household spending in 1983.

These are aggregate numbers, so do not necessary represent the experience in specific households, some of which will face considerably higher energy burdens.

In particular, those in low income and low expenditure households may see their energy burden rise to 13% of total spending or above.

Nonetheless, the numbers, which are calculated conservatively assuming strong increases in overall household spending in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's nominal GDP forecasts in 2021 and 2022, underline the historic nature of the price increases.

They also highlight why the government looks set to take action to reduce the impact of these bills on households, or to spread out the cost over subsequent years.

However, with wholesale markets suggesting high prices for the next 18 months at least, there is a chance that pay-later tactic backfires, pushing up public debt, and hence debt interest payments, in the coming years.

Sky News analysis also found that nearly 40% of non-discretionary household spending on taxes, bills, mortgage interest and energy, is set to rise sharply this year, with Bank of England interest rates and payroll taxes (including the new health and social care levy) cutting further into household incomes.

'Brighton cat killer' Steve Bouquet dies months after being jailed for stabbing nine pets to death;Tuesday 18 January 2022 21:25, UK;['tom gillespie', '@tomgillespie1'];[];"A former Royal Navy gunner, who became known as the ""Brighton cat killer"" after fatally stabbing nine pets during a seven-month spree, has died.

Security guard Steve Bouquet, who also injured seven other felines, was jailed for five years and three months in July 2021.

Bosquet carried out the attacks in the city of Brighton, East Sussex, between October 2018 and May 2019.

The animals which were killed were named Hendrix, Tommy, Hannah, Alan, Nancy, Gizmo, Kyo, Ollie and Cosmo.

The prison service has now confirmed that Bouquet died in hospital on 6 January.

His cause of death is not known, however at his sentencing hearing the court was told he had thyroid cancer which had spread to his liver and lungs.

A prison service spokesperson said: ""Steve Bouquet died at Maritime Medway Hospital on January 6 2022.

""The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.""

Bouquet had been jailed at Hove Crown Court after being found guilty in June 2021 of 16 offences of criminal damage in relation to the cats, as well as possession of a knife.

He served in the Royal Navy for 22 years, including in Northern Ireland and Iraq.

During Bouquet's trial, jurors heard accounts from several cat owners who had found their pets bleeding on their doorsteps.

He was finally caught after the owners of nine-month-old Hendrix noticed a CCTV camera near to where their animal had been stabbed, that had been set up by a neighbour whose cat had suffered a similar fate a year before.

Police examined the footage and discovered that it had captured Bouquet ""stooping to stroke the cat before taking something from his rucksack and making a sudden jerk towards it"", Detective Inspector Chris Thompson said.

During a search of Bouquet's home, a knife, with feline blood on it and his DNA on the handle, was found.

Sentencing Bouquet, Judge Jeremy Gold QC said his behaviour was ""cruel, it was sustained and it struck at the very heart of family life"".

He added: ""It is important that everyone understands that cats are domestic pets but they are more than that. They are effectively family members.

""They are much loved by the adults and children who live with and care for them.

Dairylea advert banned for 'dangerous' depiction of two girls hanging upside down while eating cheese;Wednesday 19 January 2022 01:02, UK;[];[];"An advert that shows two girls hanging upside down while eating Dairylea cheese triangles has been banned after people complained it could encourage dangerous behaviour.

The video on demand ad, broadcast on ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5 in August, featured the pair hanging upside down from a football goal before one opened the cheese snack and ate it.

A total of 14 viewers complained that the advert condoned or encouraged unsafe behaviour that could be dangerous for children to emulate.

""A scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm""

Dairylea owner Mondelez UK said the purpose of the commercial, which also showed two supervising adults in the background, was to depict parents allowing their children more freedom.

The firm referred to a study that they said supported their view that a person's ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in, including when eating upside down.

Based on the research, and because Dairylea was a soft food, they said there was a very low risk of choking when eating upside down.

The advert had also been given an ""ex-kids"" scheduling restriction, but Mondelez said they were no longer running it and would remove references to eating upside down if they used it in future.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it took advice from the Child Accident Prevention Trust, whose view was that the scenario depicted in the ad represented a situation where there was potentially a high risk of choking.

The ASA also noted said one complainant had claimed their three-year-old relative, after seeing the ad, ate their food while hanging upside down.

""We therefore considered that eating whilst upside down was an unsafe practice and one which could be dangerous for children to emulate,"" the ASA said.

""We therefore concluded that a scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm and that the ad breached the Code.""

It came as two other adverts, for Lipton Ice Tea and Aqua Pura water, were banned for misleadingly claiming that the bottles were made from 100% recycled materials.

With both products, the claim did not apply to the cap or label.

Five other adverts that have been banned in recent years:

February 2020

Pretty Little Thing

The YouTube advert, which opened with a model looking over her shoulder seductively while wearing black vinyl chaps-style knickers with her buttocks on display, was banned for being ""overly sexualised"".

Another scene showed a model wearing a transparent mesh bodysuit and over-the-knee boots while lying on her side with her knee bent up and a neon bar between her legs.

Someone complained that the ad was overly sexualised and objectified women, saying it was offensive and irresponsible.

December 2020

Klarna

The Swedish bank was ordered not to repeat an Instagram campaign that ""irresponsibly"" encouraged customers to take on debt to cheer themselves up during the pandemic.

Four so-called influencers were paid by Klarna to encourage people to use the bank's ""buy now, pay later"" services to purchase things that would ""boost their mood"".

July 2021

BrewDog

Image: Brewdog insisted its advert was 'tongue-in-cheek'

Despite claiming it was ""tongue in cheek"", an Instagram ad by BrewDog which said ""due to advertising regulations we cannot claim this drink is healthy"" was also banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

The ASA received five complaints that the social media post in January implied that the drink was healthy and used general health claims that were not permitted for alcoholic drinks.

October 2021

Alpro

Image: Alpro's advert was deemed to have made a misleading environmental claim

Alpro was forbidden from continuing to use an advert for its almond milk after it was ruled it had made a misleading environmental claim.

The poster advertised a range of dairy-free milk alternatives that were seen on the side of a bus in October 2020 and read ""Next stop. Your recipe to a healthier planet!"" and ""Good for the planet, Good for you!""

A complainant, who believes commercial almond farming causes environmental damage, challenged whether the claim ""Good for the planet"" was misleading and could be substantiated.

British Gas

Rollout of 5G service delayed near key US airports over fears of flight disruptions;Tuesday 18 January 2022 23:13, UK;[];[];"The rollout of a new 5G service has been delayed near key US airports after the nation's largest airlines said it would interfere with aircraft technology and cause massive flight disruptions.

AT&T; and Verizon, the companies set to roll out the new C-Band 5G service on Wednesday, have made the decision after the Biden administration urged them to reach an agreement with airlines worried about the impact on flights.

US Airlines want the new 5G service, scheduled to come into effect on Wednesday, to be banned within two miles of airport runways.

AT&T; and Verizon have agreed to delay turning on some wireless towers near key airports but have not said how long for.

Image: Carriers including United Airlines have raised serious concerns about the new technology

Dubai's Emirates airline and Japan's All Nippon Airways suspended some flights to the US on Tuesday due to uncertainty over the 5G rollout.

ANA said on its website it was acting in response to a notice to airlines from Boeing over restrictions on the use of its 777 long-haul airliner amid industry concerns about radio interference. Boeing had no immediate comment.

It comes as Mr Biden said the agreements by AT&T; and Verizon ""will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to passenger travel, cargo operations, and our economic recovery, while allowing more than 90% of wireless tower deployment to occur as scheduled"".

Analysis: British flyers may be caught in US dispute which should never have reached boiling point

He said his administration will keep working with both sides to reach a permanent solution around key airports.

The airline industry had issued a dire warning about the impact the 5G service would have on flights.

The chief executives of 10 passenger and cargo airlines including American, Delta, United and Southwest say that the problem will be more disruptive than earlier thought.

Image: C-Band 5G service rollout could 'potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas,' airlines say

They say this is because dozens of large airports that were to have buffer zones to prevent 5G interference with aircraft will still be subject to flight restrictions announced last week by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The airlines added that those restrictions won't be limited to times when visibility is poor.

It could also ""potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas"" and cause ""chaos"" for US flights, they said.

""Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the travelling and shipping public will essentially be grounded. This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays,"" the chief executives wrote.

The new high-speed wireless service uses a segment of the radio spectrum, C-Band, that is close to that used by altimeters, which are devices that measure the height of aircraft above the ground.

Altimeters are used to help pilots land when visibility is poor, and they link to other systems on planes.

AT&T; and Verizon say their equipment will not interfere with aircraft electronics, and that the technology is being safely used in many other countries.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119023308/http://news.sky.com/story/rollout-of-5g-service-delayed-near-key-us-airports-over-fears-of-flight-disruptions-12519465;Category-6: science and technology

Joe Biden: One year on from getting the keys to the White House, how has he Biden fared as US president?;Wednesday 19 January 2022 04:15, UK;['mark stone', '@stone_skynews'];[];"US President Joe Biden will hold a news conference later today at the White House to mark his first year in office.

The event is much anticipated, and that alone is a hint of how challenging this first year has been for the 79-year-old.

The president does not give many news conferences. Critics suggest his team tries to shield him from problematic encounters with the media.

His supporters say he's simply focused on numerous different challenges which have dominated his first year.

Some of the challenges are of his own making. Others are not. But a year to the day since he took the oath of office as the 46th American president at the US Capitol, Joe Biden will reflect today on a rocky road.

Advertisement

It's worth saying that American political history suggests that the state of a presidency a year in doesn't often reflect what people think of the person at the end of their term.

But that notwithstanding, it's been a bruising year for Joe Biden.

Coronavirus

This has been the obvious dominant challenge in America, as it has been globally. It looked, for a time, as though the president was riding a corona success wave.

Despite huge vaccine scepticism across parts of American society, last summer his administration was claiming credit for soaring vaccination rates. The economy rebounded. Things were looking up.

COVID: US daily cases top a million

Then along came Delta, and Omicron soon followed. Hospitals again filled to alarming levels (largely with the unvaccinated) and the White House faced criticism for being unprepared.

The Biden Administration's reluctance to make home-test kits widely available has been a huge failure and its messaging has been perceived as mixed. U-turns have now come - one billion home test kits are being made freely available.

The Economy

The good news: American unemployment is at record lows. All around, 'hiring' signs hang in business and shop windows. Jobs are easy to find right now in America.

Under the Biden presidency, 6.4 million jobs have been created. That's admittedly from a low base given the pandemic but it's also more than any first-year president in American history.

The stock market is up, and wages are increasing.

Joe Biden admits 'more work to do' as US inflation hits 7%

But inflation is at a level which is hurting so many Americans. In December it rose to 7% - a level not seen since the early 1980s.

Biden managed to pass a whopping bipartisan infrastructure package which he hopes will allow America to 'Build Back Better' and cement his legacy.

Infrastructure is a slow burner though and right now he's being judged more on the cost of it all than on the results down the line: take the 15,000 bridges nationwide which need repairing. They will be years of traffic cones and roadworks before the results are felt.

Foreign Policy

Just one foreign policy decision dominates Biden's first year - Afghanistan. His decision to withdraw was no secret and was the fulfilment of a pledge he had made to the American people, who wanted out.

But the chaotic method of the departure and the speed with which Afghanistan collapsed had a huge cost for the president.

'It was time to end this war,' Joe Biden says

He's fortunate that the American media has largely forgotten about the country now. The dire situation and approaching famine are not part of the conversation in the US, but are a consequence of America's withdrawal.

The Afghan debacle has caused countries globally to question America's commitments abroad. Biden could face a huge test over Ukraine in the coming weeks.

Climate

This was a central plank of the President's inaugural address and yet when it came to COP in Glasgow, he was unable to commit to the funding he had pledged because he couldn't get members of his own party to support the spending bill.

US senator blocking Joe Biden's climate legislation poses threat to success of climate summit

And that neatly brings us on to...

Politics

Divisions in his own Democratic Party are causing the president persistent headaches on Capitol Hill. He thought things would be easy while he has control of the White House and both houses of Congress. It'll only get trickier if, as expected, the balance of power shifts with the midterms later this year.

Joe Biden says Donald Trump spread 'web of lies' about 2020 US election

Biden's opposition is a Republican Party which continues to peddle the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. Despite exhaustive vetting and audits in states nationwide, the so-called 'big lie' is now a mainstream view in the Republican Party.

The challenges this poses for democracy in America could be Biden's biggest test ahead. His reluctance to take on the issue, to mention Trump by name, to call out questionable state-level voter-rights legislation could well become a huge regret for him.

Polling

For the bluntest assessment of President Biden's record over the past 12 months, look at the opinion polls.

The Gallup poll had his approval rating at 56% in February 2021. By July it was down to 50%. By October last year it was down to just 42%.

But it's a new Gallup poll released just this week that gives a stark assessment not just of Biden's year but the trajectory and volatility of American politics in 2021.

The party preference poll showed a huge shift from a nine-point Democratic lead at the start of the year to five-point Republican lead by the end of the year.

While Biden was faltering on the issues outlined above and the Republicans regrouped around a president who many of them believe didn't lose, the polls swung.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119062345/http://news.sky.com/story/joe-biden-one-year-on-from-getting-the-keys-to-the-white-house-how-has-he-biden-fared-as-us-president-12519641;Category-1: politics
Inflation hits highest level for nearly 30 years as rising food prices add to energy bill squeeze;Wednesday 19 January 2022 09:34, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Inflation climbed to 5.4% last month, its highest rate since March 1992, as Britain's cost of living squeeze intensified, official figures show.

The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation, up from 5.1% in November, was higher than economists had expected - as food, furniture and clothing prices surged, as well as restaurant and hotel bills.

Food saw year-on-year increase in prices at 4.2% - a rate that has not been higher since September 2013 - while for clothes, inflation was at a four-and-a-half-year high, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

That added to continued pressure caused by energy bill hikes seen in October, fuel prices that have climbed to record levels, and a spike in demand for used cars - on average costing 28% more than in January - as chip shortages squeeze the supply of new vehicles.

The ONS recorded a measure of household utility bills inflation at its highest since November 2011.

Its latest figures come a day after official data showed wage rises for UK workers are already being wiped out by the surge in prices, even before the latest uptick.

Further upward pressure on inflation is expected in April when a new energy price cap could see bills for millions of households hiked by 50%.

The surge in the cost of living is putting pressure on the Bank of England to take further action - having already raised interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25% last month.

It said at the time that it expected inflation to hit 6% in the spring. Other forecasters see it going to 7%.

CPI has never been higher than it is now since the ONS started reporting price rises using this measure in 1997.

But using a statistical model extrapolating back to previous years it estimates that inflation was last higher in March 1992 at 7.1%.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in response to the latest data: ""I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and we will continue to listen to people's concerns as we have done throughout the pandemic.""

He said the government was providing £12bn in support to help, citing changes to the Universal Credit benefit, freezes in alcohol and fuel duties and targeted support to help households struggling with energy bills.

Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said: ""We've not seen the end of rising inflation yet.

""We expect it to peak in the months ahead, not least if, as expected, the energy price cap is raised.

""With prices on the rise and real wages already falling, it's likely households will face a cost-of-living crunch for much of this year.""

Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""We already knew that the rise in the price of energy, fuel and second-hand cars was likely to keep inflation way above the Bank of England's 2% target in December.

""What is of particular concern is that the change from November has come mainly from an increase in the price of food.

""Not only does this provide additional evidence that inflation is becoming endemic rather than transitory, it also bodes ill for households facing multiple rises in the cost of living this spring.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119071954/https://news.sky.com/story/inflation-soars-to-5-4-highest-rate-in-almost-30-years-as-cost-of-living-squeeze-intensifies-12519674;Category-2: business and economy
Surging inflation could dwarf other issues in the political landscape as households feel the strain;Wednesday 19 January 2022 10:11, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];[];"Higher prices are having a serious impact on UK consumers and will add to pressure on the Bank of England for another interest rate rise which many think could come as soon as February.

Surging inflation could dwarf other issues in the political landscape as households feel the strain

Another month, another eye-wateringly high inflation number.

In November the consumer prices index rate of inflation was 5.1% and most economists had expected it to stay at that level again in December.

In the event it outdid those expectations, rising to 5.4%.

Image: Food prices are climbing at the highest rate since 2013

This critical statistic - among the most important measures of economic activity - is now at the highest level since 1992, five years before the Bank of England was given operational independence to target prices.

It is a sign of serious strain for millions of households, since inflation is a measure of the cost of living.

The faster it is rising, the faster the prices of everyday goods and services are increasing, with a direct impact on everyone's standard of living.

You get a sense of this when you peer down into the index at the kinds of things whose prices are going up fastest.

The biggest upwards contribution to the index came from food price inflation, which is now at the highest level in nine years.

But underlying so many of these high prices are two factors.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:55 What impact will energy bills have?

The first is the unprecedented rise in energy prices, which feed into higher costs across the whole ""shopping basket"" of typical goods people buy.

The second is the disruption from COVID, which has contributed to supply chain problems across the world.

Put them together and you can see why prices here in this country - and in most developed countries - are testing decadal highs.

There are two big questions now.

First, how high will prices get? The Bank of England has already signalled its expecting them to go up to 6%.

But now many economists think they could breach 7%.

The second question is: how soon until the Bank's monetary policy committee takes further action to try to inflation down - in other words raising interest rates.

It lifted borrowing costs at its December meeting from 0.1% to 0.25% but now many think it could increase them again to 0.5% as soon as its next meeting in February.

There are many other things happening in the UK's political landscape at the moment.

But in time what we are seeing in the economy - with prices rising so fast, squeezing households at home and in the shops - may turn out to dwarf everything else in terms of its sheer significance and impact.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119103403/http://news.sky.com/story/surging-inflation-could-dwarf-other-issues-in-the-political-landscape-as-households-feel-the-strain-12519720;Category-2: business and economy

COVID-19: Working from home, COVID passports and mask-wearing to go as England Plan B rules to be lifted - and self-isolation rules set to go in March;Wednesday 19 January 2022 13:47, UK;[];[];"Work from home guidance, COVID passports and mandatory wearing of face-masks will be scrapped in England, as Boris Johnson announced the lifting of Plan B measures.

The prime minister said people will no longer be told to work from home ""from now on"", and from Thursday next week mandatory mask-wearing and COVID certification will end.

He confirmed the intention to end self-isolation rules for people with coronavirus in the coming weeks. The legal requirement would lapse when the regulations expire on 24 March, he said, and that date could be brought forward.

The PM told the Commons cases were falling and the Omicron wave had likely peaked nationally, meaning rules could now be eased.

Mr Johnson said it was time to ""trust the judgement"" of the public on the use of masks in enclosed and crowded places, and they will be scrapped in classrooms from tomorrow.

Restrictions on visits to care homes would also be eased further, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid setting out plans ""in the coming days"".

The prime minister went through the latest COVID-19 data on Wednesday morning with his ministers, before making his statement to MPs.

What's the latest UK COVID data?

Coronavirus infection levels in three of the four UK nations - England, Scotland and Wales - have fallen for the first time since before Christmas, suggesting the peak of the latest wave of coronavirus may have passed.

An estimated one in 20 people in private households in England are likely to have had the virus in the week to 15 January - or around three million people - down from a record 3.7 million the previous week, according to the latest Office for National Statistics data.

For Northern Ireland the latest figure is also one in 20, but number of people testing positive is up slightly from 99,200 to 104,300, with the ONS describing the trend as ""uncertain"".

In Scotland, the figure is around one in 20, or 236,600 people, down from 297,400 - and in Wales the estimate is one in 25, or 112,100 people, down from 169,100.

Has Omicron peaked?

A further 94,432 lab-confirmed COVID cases were recorded in the UK as of 9am on Tuesday.

The highest number of new cases to be reported on a single day during the current wave was 218,724 on 4 January.

There were 19,450 people in hospital with the virus as of 17 January, which is down 2% week-on-week.

More than 34,000 people were in hospital with the virus at the peak of the second wave back in January 2021.

Meanwhile, another 438 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total since the pandemic began in 2020 to 152,513.

This figure is the highest daily total since last February, but Sky's science correspondent Thomas Moore said a ""large part"" of this is due to reporting delays.

Is the pandemic entering its endgame?

Mr Johnson signalled his intention to start treating COVID-19 more like flu, saying: ""There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don't place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu.

""As COVID becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.""

Pressure to oust PM mounts

Mr Johnson's Commons announcement comes as pressure continues to mount over parties and gatherings held in Downing Street and other government departments in 2020 and 2021.

There is speculation that a confidence vote in the PM's leadership of his Conservative Party could soon be triggered by restive Tory MPs.

Around 12 more letters of no confidence in the PM were submitted this morning, according to Sky News political correspondents Sam Coates and Joe Pike.

And just before Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford announced he had defected from the Conservatives to Labour, accusing Mr Johnson of being ""incapable of offering the leadership"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119134148/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-working-from-home-covid-passports-and-mask-wearing-to-go-as-england-plan-b-rules-to-be-lifted-12519897;Category-7: health
Christian Wakeford: Tory MP defects to Labour telling Boris Johnson he is 'incapable of offering leadership';Wednesday 19 January 2022 13:00, UK;[];[];"Bury South MP Christian Wakeford has this morning defected from the Conservatives to Labour.

Mr Wakeford told Boris Johnson that ""you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves"".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed Mr Wakeford's defection saying: ""I would like to welcome Christian Wakeford to the Labour Party. He has always put the people of Bury South first.

""The policies of the Conservative government are doing nothing to help the people of Bury South and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse.""

A Conservative MP told Sky News the Tory chief whip ""hauled"" Mr Wakeford in last night ""and it sent him over the edge when they threatened his seat"" with having its boundary changed.

PMQs kicks off moments after MP defects

The former Conservative MP announced his defection moments before Mr Johnson faced MPs at Prime Minister's Questions and was seen sitting on the opposition benches.

Sir Keir kicked off PMQs by welcoming Mr Wakeford to the Labour Party and said he was happy to welcome any other MPs who wanted to defect.

Mr Wakeford was seen on the Labour benches wearing a Union flag facemask.

The PM did address his defection, telling MPs the Conservatives won Bury South for the first time in generations under him and pledged - to very loud jeers (from Labour) and cheers (from Tory MPs): ""We will win again at the next election under this prime minister.""

Mr Wakeford's defection comes a day after the PM said ""nobody told me"" attending a Downing Street garden party during the May 2020 lockdown was breaking COVID rules.

Mr Johnson faced calls for his resignation from Sir Keir and multiple opposition MPs over ""partygate"" but the PM kept telling them they needed to wait for the investigation by Sue Gray to finish.

He said it was coming ""next week"".

Senior Tory calls for PM to go

Several Tory MPs gave Mr Johnson a breather as they stood up at PMQs and asked questions not related to lockdown parties or calls for the PM to resign.

However, Mr Johnson's former Brexit secretary, David Davis, called for the PM to resign after he said he had spent weeks defending him from ""angry constituents"".

He told Sky News he has not submitted a letter of no confidence but leadership ""means shouldering responsibility and he didn't do it"" in the interview yesterday in which Mr Johnson said he did not know he was breaking rules.

The senior Conservative said: ""I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday he did the opposite of that.

""So I'll remind him of a quotation altogether too familiar to him, of Leo Amery to Neville Chamberlain: 'You've sat there too long for all the good you have done, in the name of God, go'.""

Mr Johnson replied: ""I must say to him, I don't know what he is talking about.

""What I can tell him - I don't know what quotation he is alluding to - what I can tell him is and I think have told this House repeatedly, I take full responsibility for everything done in this government and throughout the pandemic.""

But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries placed her support fully behind Mr Johnson, tweeting that there was ""huge and overwhelming support for Boris Johnson from packed Tory benches"".

Ben John: Ex-student told to read classic literature after being convicted of terrorism offence is jailed;Wednesday 19 January 2022 17:33, UK;[];[];"A former student who was given a suspended prison sentence and told to read classic literature after being convicted of a terrorism offence has now been jailed.

Ben John, described by police as a white supremacist with a neo-Nazi ideology, was given a two-year suspended term at Leicester Crown Court last August.

The 22-year-old, from Lincoln, has now been jailed for two years after Lord Justice Holroyde quashed the original sentence at the Court of Appeal, finding it was unlawful.

Lord Justice Holroyde said: ""We are satisfied that there must be a sentence of immediate imprisonment.""

John was convicted of possessing a record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism after he was found with a copy of the Anarchist's Cookbook - which contains instructions for making weapons, explosives and illegal drugs.

Police also found extreme far-right material including videos praising Adolf Hitler, white supremacist songs and a poster for the banned British neo-Nazi group National Action.

John has been jailed after the Attorney General's Office (AGO) referred his sentence to the Court of Appeal under the unduly lenient sentencing scheme.

He appeared by videolink in a dark shirt for part of Wednesday's hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The Court of Appeal was told the sentencing judge suspended John's prison sentence after the ex-student promised to stop his interest in far-right ideologies.

However, John had been ""liking"" Nazi-themed content online ""just five days after promising the judge he had put it behind him"", Solicitor General Alex Chalk QC said.

Mr Chalk argued that, while the sentence was intended to allow for ""potent control"" over John's rehabilitation, this idea in the circumstances was ""manifestly false"".

During his sentencing, John was invited by a judge to read famous works, including Pride And Prejudice and A Tale Of Two Cities, as he was given a five-year serious crime prevention order and the suspended sentence with an extra year on licence.

Richard Wormald QC, for John, argued the Anarchist's Cookbook was a ""counter-culture publication"" that he had downloaded in his early teens but had not accessed since.

He also said it was part of John's ""library"" which also contained Marxist literature and books on gardening and baking.

After a two-and-a-half-hour hearing on Wednesday morning, three senior judges quashed his original sentence and replaced it with a sentence of two years in prison and a third year on licence.

Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Lavender and Sir Nigel Davis, said certain offences require a mandatory year on licence.

However, a combined suspended sentence and licence cannot be longer than two years, meaning John's sentence was unlawful.

The senior judges found that while the original length of the sentence was ""very lenient"", it was not unduly so, and the sentence was only quashed due to the legal issue.

John will now have to surrender himself to a police station before 4pm on Thursday, the judges ruled.

Addressing him after giving their decision, Lord Justice Holroyde said: ""You will have to serve at least two-thirds of the two-year period.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119162306/http://news.sky.com/story/ben-john-ex-student-told-to-read-classic-literature-after-being-convicted-of-terrorism-offence-is-jailed-12520104;Category-1: politics

Bank of England governor 'concerned' about inflationary pressures becoming more stubborn;Wednesday 19 January 2022 15:32, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The governor of the Bank of England has voiced ""concern"" that inflationary pressures in the UK economy could prove more stubborn than it expected.

Andrew Bailey told a committee of MPs a key element of this was market forecasts since Christmas of higher than normal natural gas costs through 2023 as households and businesses grapple rising bills from unprecedented increases in wholesale prices - prices that have remained volatile this year.

He also highlighted growing wage expectations, explaining that its regional agents were ""beginning to see some evidence"" of pay rises going up more quickly because of rising inflation and tight supply of workers in the labour market.

He made his remarks in answers to questions from the Treasury Committee just hours after the latest official inflation figures showed the core consumer prices index (CPI) measure at its highest level for 30 years.

The number for December was above the expectations of economists and piles pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates when the monetary policy committee meets early next month.

Bank rate was lifted at its last meeting in December from the COVID crisis low of 0.1% to 0.25% as CPI surged by more than policymakers had anticipated.

It was seen as something of a climbdown from the Bank's position for most of last year that the accelerated pace of price growth would be ""transitory"" - a short-term consequence of economies getting back up to speed after pandemic restrictions.

It has been led by an unprecedented surge in energy costs but supply disruption has left its mark too on a broad-based list of goods and services in the UK and around the world.

The Bank, which has an inflation target of 2%, had said in December that it saw CPI hitting 6% by the spring.

But some economists have since forecast that a leap in the energy price cap, predicted at 50%, in April could help tip inflation to 7%.

Mr Bailey told the committee: ""We can't bring the gas price down"".

He also explained that monetary policy could do little to ease the supply chain problems including the shortage of labour as vacancy rates run at record levels.

The governor said too that it was difficult to split out the extent to which the challenges were attributable to COVID or Brexit.

He insisted his remarks about inflationary pressures should not be seen as evidence of support for a further rate hike.

He told the MPs that on the other side of the coin: ""If you get pressure on cost of living, pressure on real earnings, that will tend to restrain demand in the economy... and that could lead to an output gap opening up, and it could eventually of course lead to higher unemployment and that would bring inflation down.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119162306/http://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-governor-concerned-about-inflationary-pressures-becoming-more-stubborn-12519975;Category-2: business and economy

The teenager, from Darlington, County Durham, pleaded guilty to three counts of possession of a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. The offences are related to extreme right-wing terrorism, police said.

""Over the last few years, the pain in my right foot has worsened. Both of my ankles are fused and arthritic but my right one has always been more troublesome and (comedically) non-functional.

""If a better quality of life was possible (crutch free, less likely to wreck my arms), what was I waiting for?"" she said.

Tai spent five days in hospital before being discharged on Wednesday morning.

Suffolk Police said there was a pattern of ""heritage"" style post boxes being taken by thieves and they are treating the incidents as linked.

The first theft was on 7 January in Rickinghall, with later thefts in Wixoe, Cowlinge, Hawkedon, Stoke By Clare, Chedburgh and Depden Green.

The most recent happened overnight Monday into Tuesday.

A force spokesman said: ""The theft is either achieved by cutting them from their mounting metal or wood post but, also possibly, by using angle grinders and chainsaws.""

Child sexual abuse prosecutions fall by around half in four years;Thursday 20 January 2022 01:41, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"prosecutions for child sexual abuse have dropped by around a half in four years, Research by the NSPCC suggests.

The children's charity used the Freedom of Information act to show the total number of proescutions in England and Wales fell from 6,394 in 2016/17 to 3,025 in 2020/21.

In the same period the number of convictions fell from 4,751 to 2,595.

Cases taking longer to resolve

Additional figures given to the charity showed cases were taking longer to resolve.

Ministry of Justice data showed the median number of days from offence to completion went from 526 in 2017/18 to 668 in 2020/21.

'Utterly unacceptable'

Anna Edmundson, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said: ""Young victims of abuse have often lived through unimaginable trauma but many want to share their evidence with a court and prevent perpetrators from causing further harm.

""These figures show young witnesses are being denied this opportunity and those who do go to court experience long delays and inadequate support, which risks retraumatising them further.

""This is utterly unacceptable.

""We call on Dominic Raab to review and reverse the decline in prosecutions and convictions and use the Victims' Law to tackle the delays affecting child sexual abuse cases going through court, and provide much better support for young witnesses and victims.""

NSPCC lays out plans

The NSPCC has said it wants increased use of specialist sexual violence advisers who are trained to work with children, of special measures such as pre-recording evidence for court, and of intermediaries to help children while giving evidence.

It has called for a guaranteed share of the £477m received by the Ministry of Justice in the Spending Review to tackle the backlog of child sexual abuse cases.

It has also requested that a proportion of the £185m funding for Independent Sexual Violence Advisers pays for ""a significant number"" who are trained to work with children.

The NSPCC has also said it wants a boost in funding for child houses, where a number of specialist workers such as police officers and social services staff are based.

Child sexual abuse cases rise by 22%

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ""Child sexual abuse cases are some of our most challenging, complex and sensitive cases. They are dealt with by specially trained prosecutors working closely with the police to build the strongest possible cases that meet our legal test.

""The number of these cases prosecuted has increased by 22% in the past year, with most resulting in a conviction.

Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers file for a re-trial;Thursday 20 January 2022 06:20, UK;[];[];"Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell have filed a motion for a re-trial, just weeks after she was found guilty of recruiting underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein.

The 60-year-old Briton, who is an ex-girlfriend of the late billionaire paedophile, is due to be sentenced in June after her conviction in a New York court.

She was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for Epstein to molest at his various properties between 1994 and 2004.

Newborn baby found dead after being left in snow outside Chicago fire station;Thursday 20 January 2022 03:29, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];[];"A newborn baby has been found dead after being left in a duffel bag outside a fire station in Chicago.

Officials told local media a fire crew found the boy in the snow-covered bag around 5am on Saturday outside the Near North Side fire station.

""They were in and out so much that morning that no one heard the doorbell,"" Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said.

Baby Safe Haven Law

In the state of Illinois parents can hand their newborn over at hospitals, police or fire stations without fear of prosecution under the state's Baby Safe Haven Law.

The firehouse was a designated safe haven.

Authorities have said they do not know how long the baby was left outside in freezing temperatures, or whether he was alive when he was left.

Baby should have been handed over

Mr Langford said the fire station is used as an air supply maintenance facility, meaning crews are often out servicing supplies at other firehouses.

He said though the firehouse was a safe haven, babies must be ""passed person-to-person"".

""We're trying to make it clear that you have to make contact. Ringing a bell is not making contact. You have to physically see someone and hand the child over,"" Mr Langford said.

""If the person left the child there, and we don't recommend it, and called 911 to say the child is there, somebody would've been dispatched right there.""

Many of the victims had ties to Gambia, and families of several of the victims planned to bury them in their West African homeland.

The office of New York City mayor Mayor Eric Adams announced that Cardi B had offered to pay the repatriation expenses.

Primark to cut hundreds of jobs in store management shake-up;Thursday 20 January 2022 08:51, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Primark has revealed plans to cut hundreds of jobs in a shake-up of store management - as it pledges not to raise prices.

The fashion retailer is ""proposing removing a number of roles as well as creating a new entry-level management role"", a spokesperson said.

Overall it expects to see a reduction of 400 jobs across its network of 191 stores in the UK, which currently employ 29,000 people.

Details of the proposals, described as ""part of our ongoing programme to improve the efficiency of our store retail operations"", were revealed in a trading update from owner Associated British Foods (ABF).

It pointed to an Omicron hit to sales at Primark followed by an improvement over recent weeks.

Like the rest of the economy it faces growing inflation pressures - but insisted it has no plans to put up prices.

Overall, the fashion retailer's UK sales for the 16 weeks to 8 January were ahead of last year but still 10% behind pre-pandemic levels.

The company said it faced a squeeze on its raw material and supply chain costs but said this had been mitigated by favourable currency exchange rates and a reduction in store operating costs and overheads.

ABF said supply chain pressures experienced during the autumn had alleviated though it was still experiencing some delays at ports where goods were being shipped from, adding: ""We expect longer shipping times to continue for some time.""

Image: Primark sales remained 10% off pre-pandemic levels

Flagging the jobs cut plans, the company said: ""We are proposing to simplify our in-store UK retail management structure as part of our ongoing programme to improve the efficiency of our store retail operations.""

Kari Rodgers, Primark retail director for the UK, said: ""The changes we're proposing will deliver a simplified and more consistent management structure across all of our stores, provide more opportunities for career progression and offer greater flexibility.

""We are now focused on supporting our colleagues who are affected by these proposed changes and will be going through the consultation process.""

Meanwhile, Primark - which unlike rivals does not have an online retail platform - was on track to launch a new customer-facing website in the UK by the end of March, the company said.

It said the site ""will showcase many more of our products and will provide customers with product availability by store"".

The update - and Primark's confirmation that it does not plan to raise prices - comes as latest figures show rising inflation across the wider clothing sector amid a cost of living surge.

Rival Next has said it expects to hike prices by up to 6%.

ABF signalled that prices may go up in other parts of its business - a sprawling conglomerate which also includes a major sugar operation and brands such as Ryvita, Twinings and Ovaltine.

Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Inflationary headwinds are an unavoidable storm cloud hanging over just about everyone right now, but we think ABF is well-placed to ride it out.

""The group's low-cost retail business will appeal to shoppers tightening the purse strings, and improved efficiency across all areas of the business together with price hikes in the grocery business look likely to offset the bulk of the pain for now.

""But if costs continue to balloon, it could become a problem for Primark as the group has very little space to increase costs due to its position as a discount retailer.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120101258/https://news.sky.com/story/primark-to-cut-hundreds-of-jobs-in-store-management-shake-up-12520509;Category-2: business and economy
Boris Johnson: Tories who want PM to go 'facing intimidation and blackmail' from party and should contact police, MP says;Thursday 20 January 2022 10:41, UK;[];[];"Conservative MPs who want Boris Johnson to resign have been intimidated by the party and should contact the police if they have been blackmailed, a senior Tory has warned.

William Wragg, chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said a ""number of MPs have faced intimidation"" after declaring, or assumed to have declared, their desire for a vote of confidence in the PM.

He told the committee it is ""not the function"" of the government whips office to breach the ministerial code by ""threatening to withdraw investments in constituencies funded by the public purse"".

Whips blackmailing MPs and encouraging stories to embarrass

Mr Wragg accused the whips of ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass those that they suspect of lacking confidence in their prime minister"".

He added that ""intimidation in parliament is a serious matter"" and the reports he has been told of ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" so he told them to contact the Speaker of the House and the head of the Metropolitan Police.

""It is of course the duty of the government whips office to secure the government's business in the House of Commons,"" he said.

""However, it is not their function to breach the ministerial code in threatening to withdraw investments from members of parliament's constituency which are funded from the public purse.""

Mr Wragg is one of a handful of Conservatives who have publicly called for Mr Johnson to go over the Downing Street lockdown parties scandal but he did not reveal if he had been intimidated or blackmailed by the whips office.

Zara Rutherford, 19, landed her aircraft in Belgium - 155 days after departing on the 31,700-mile (51,000km) five-month journey.

There were cheers and applause as she landed at Kortrijk-Wevelgem Airport.

Draped in UK and Belgian flags, she told reporters: ""It's just really crazy, I haven't quite processed it.""

Her flight in a Shark microlight plane was supposed to take three months, but bad weather and visa issues kept her grounded, sometimes for weeks on end, extending her adventure by about two months.

Rutherford covered 41 nations and five continents after leaving on 18 August.

She had to steer clear of Californian wildfires, deal with bitter temperatures over Russia, and narrowly avoided North Korean airspace.

""I wouldn't do it again,"" she confessed after the penultimate leg on Wednesday.

""There's been amazing moments, but then there's been moments where I had fear for my life,"" she added.

Both of her parents are pilots and she started flying at 14 after spending years in small planes.

Rutherford said flying over New York and an active volcano in Iceland were her favourite moments.

To fulfil the round-the-world criteria she touched two opposite points on the globe: Jambi in Indonesia and Tumaco in Colombia.

Mr Martin made the comments to Sky News a day after his company revealed a slump in sales over the Christmas period blamed on Plan B guidance designed to tackle the Omicron variant.

Hospitality firms were not forced to close under the rules but working from home guidance reduced footfall in city centres resulting in a so-called ""lockdown by stealth"".

Now, however, businesses from bookies and gyms to bars and shops are reporting signs of trade recovering including some work Christmas parties rebooked for the new year.

Wetherspoons this week said it will make a loss for the first half of the financial year after a sales slump over the festive season - and taunted Boris Johnson over ""partygate"" claims about the behaviour of Downing Street staff during lockdowns, accusing the government of hypocrisy.

But speaking on Sky's Ian King Live as working from home measures were scrapped on Thursday with more restrictions to go in coming days, Mr Martin - though revealing that he had caught the virus himself - was in bullish mood.

'We've lost a quarter of a billion'

He told Sky's Ian King Live: ""I was breakdancing round my living room, so I take a lot of heart from it.

""We do hope that the virus is in retreat and that we can safely open up and we'll be delighted as will, I think, everyone really, if we can get back to something approaching normal - earn a buck.

""It's not sustainable for Wetherspoon or anyone else to continue to make losses.

""We've lost a quarter of a billion in the last couple of years having had 40 years, nearly, of profits before then.

""That doesn't do anyone any good. If you shut down pubs you massively lose tax income as well. We pay a lot more tax than we make in profits.

""Everyone will be happy, pubs can open up, and we can go back to the normal UK of the last couple of thousand years.""

However he said there had been a danger that warnings on COVID ""put the frighteners on people"" and that ""having wound the public up… to too great an extent, it may be difficult to get back"".

Mr Martin also revealed that while expansion plans outlined by the chain last year would still go ahead, it was ""waiting for the sales to get back to where they were before we go for it"".

Reflecting on his previous ""tongue in cheek"" comments about Downing Street, he accused the government of ""very bad decision making"" and said better was needed ""if Boris is going to survive"".

Office parties rebooked

The comments came as smaller operator Revolution Bars blamed plan B and government messaging which ""unhelpfully encouraged the limiting of social interactions"" as sales for the six weeks to 1 January fell by 23% compared with pre-COVID levels.

That included a 39% slump in corporate Christmas parties - but the company added: ""Pleasingly, many of the corporate parties have already been rebooked for early in 2022.""

It also welcomed the easing of Plan B restrictions but said it was alert to inflationary pressures.

Elsewhere the Gym Group, the nationwide fitness chain, reported that the emergence of the Omicron variant ""briefly impacted gym visits in December and early January"" but that weekly visits per member had since returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The company added that as of 18 January it had grown its membership to 776,000, up by 58,000 since the end of December, in what is typically the month ""when many people set new health and fitness goals"".

Meanwhile, Ladbrokes and Coral owner Entain said net gaming revenues in its shops rose by 60% in the final quarter of last year compared with a period in 2020 when they were shut - returning to within 10% of pre-COVID levels.

Two kidneys transplanted into human from genetically-modified pig in world-first operation;Thursday 20 January 2022 14:48, UK;[];[];"Two kidneys from a genetically-modified pig have been transplanted into the body of a human.

The transplanted organs were able to carry out the functions of kidneys once in the human body, scientists from the University of Alabama said.

They filtered blood, produced urine, were not immediately rejected, and were still working until 74 hours later.

Jim Parsons, the 57-year-old transplant recipient, was brain-dead and being kept alive on a ventilator.

The world-first has raised hopes that transplants from one species to another - xenotransplantation - could address the global shortage of donor organs, according to the study's lead surgeon Dr Jayme Locke.

""We have bridged critical knowledge gaps and obtained the safety and feasibility data necessary to begin a clinical trial in living humans with end-stage kidney failure disease.""

She added: ""The concept of being able to have an organ waiting on the shelf, waiting for the person who needs it, is just remarkable to think about - and exciting for that person.""

The next step is a clinical trial on living humans with serious kidney problems.

Researchers have been trying since the early 2000s to genetically modify pigs in a way that reduces the chance of the transplant being rejected.

Image: Jim Parsons' family said he would have wanted to help people. Pic: University of Alabama at Birmingham

Pig kidneys are a similar size to human kidneys and the transplant was conducted in a similar way.

Mr Parsons had been registered as an organ donor before his death but his organs were not suitable for donation.

His family allowed him to be kept on a ventilator to keep his body functioning during the study.

Mr Parsons' ex-wife, Julie O'Hara, said the family had made a unanimous decision that he would have wanted to help as many people as possible.

She said: ""Jim would have wanted to save as many people as he could with his death, and if he knew he could potentially save thousands and thousands of people by doing this, he would have had no hesitation.

""Our dream is that no other person dies waiting for a kidney, and we know that Jim is very proud that his death could potentially bring so much hope to others.""

The average wait for a kidney transplant in the UK is two-and-a-half years and a patient dies every day waiting for a willing and suitable donor.

There are about 3,000 kidney transplants every year.

The new study is published in the American Journal of Transplantation.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145317/https://news.sky.com/story/two-kidneys-transplanted-into-human-from-genetically-modified-pig-in-world-first-operation-12520930;Category-7: health

Energy crisis: Aquind cross-Channel power cable project rejected by government;Thursday 20 January 2022 17:42, UK;[];[];"A cross-Channel power cable project has been rejected by the government despite pressure to bolster energy supplies in the face of an unprecedented surge in prices.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng decided to dismiss Aquind's plans to provide a new electricity link between Portsmouth in Hampshire and Normandy in France.

The proposal was controversial as a company director, Alexander Temerko, has previously donated more than £1m to the Conservative Party.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:55 'Unprecedented' squeeze in energy bills ahead

Giving the green light to the project could have reignited the sleaze row that first enveloped the government late last year.

The claims have related to MPs' lobbying, second jobs and the prime minister's own financial affairs.

But a letter published on the Planning Inspectorate website showed Mr Kwarteng had decided to ""refuse development consent"" having considered his obligations under the energy National Policy Statement.

Berwick-upon-Tweed MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, now the International Trade Secretary, removed herself from the process in July over funding received by Northumberland Conservatives.

In 2020, Mr Temerko - a British citizen who was born in the former Soviet Union - told MPs that Russian-linked businessmen have ""zero"" political influence.

The proposed £1.2bn interconnector - which would have been able to transmit up to around 5% of Britain and France's total annual consumption- had faced stiff opposition in Portsmouth.

Campaigners there had argued against the route, adding that the construction would have led to chaos in a densely-populated City and destroyed landmarks.

Trade minister Penny Mordaunt, the MP for Portsmouth North, celebrated the decision, tweeting ""we did it"".

We did it. Aquind is refused development consent. More to follow.. pic.twitter.com/9zcoVO9eRY — Penny Mordaunt (@PennyMordaunt) January 20, 2022

Portsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan, a Labour frontbencher, said: ""The government have finally seen sense and stopped the disastrous Aquind project.

""This is a victory for the people of Portsmouth over years of uncertainty and Tory cronyism.""

Interconnectors are cables which help grid operators meet supply and demand for electricity.

Aquind's case for development was boosted when a fire last September knocked out a UK-France power link at Sellindge in Kent.

It is not expected to be operational again until late 2023 at the earliest.

The blaze contributed to the unprecedented surge in wholesale gas costs last year - costs that are tipped to result in a 50% rise in the energy price cap in April to an average £2,000.

Other factors behind the spike included poor wind generation from unhelpful weather conditions and a failure across Europe to replenish gas stocks after a cold end to the previous winter.

The scenario sparked a big debate over energy security Europe-wide amid the rush for renewables to bolster action against climate change.

An Aquind spokesperson responded: ""We disagree with the decision of the Secretary of State, and the rationale behind it. We are considering the decision, the grounds for the refusal, and a potential legal challenge.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120173637/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-crisis-aquind-cross-channel-power-cable-project-rejected-12521051;Category-3: environment
Fishermen 'lucky to be alive' after boat was hit by underwater German wartime bomb;Thursday 20 January 2022 19:32, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];[];"Seven fishermen were ""fortunate not to be killed"" after their boat was hit by an underwater German wartime bomb.

Five crew members on board the Galwad-Y-Mor suffered significant injuries - some life-changing - after the explosion on 15 December off the Norfolk coast.

A Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report into the incident said: ""Although the physical injuries were significant to five of the seven crew, they were fortunate not to be killed.""

Image: Galwad-Y-Mor suffered structural damage, the MAIB report said. Pic: MAIB

The fishermen had been hauling a string of 100 crab pots from the seabed when they noticed ""a lot of tension"" on the main line, the MAIB report said.

At around 11.22am the skipper revved the engine to break the line free, when three loud bangs resounded on the main deck.

The movement had disturbed an unexploded 250kg bomb dropped in the sea during World War Two, with the ensuing shockwaves sending the boat rocking. The skipper hit his head and was dazed while four of the crew were severely injured, but all remained conscious.

The MAIB report said it was a German-made high-explosive - probably an SC250, a bomb widely used and feared during the Blitz.

Power was immediately cut out and water began flooding the deck. The skipper roused the night watchman and sent a distress call to the coastguard, while the crew were ordered to prepare to abandon ship.

The captain of another nearby vessel, the Esvagt Njord, heard the distress call from around four miles away and sent a rescue boat to help save the crew.

The fishermen were hoisted on board the Esvagt Njord and given first aid, including from a paramedic.

Two were airlifted and taken to hospital at around 1.50pm, while the others were taken to hospital later in the afternoon.

A shard of metal later found in a crab pot was sent to specialists for forensic examination.

Boris Johnson's study into Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge cost taxpayers £900,000;Thursday 20 January 2022 19:09, UK;[];[];"A study commissioned by Boris Johnson examining the idea of a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland cost taxpayers almost £900,000.

Research into the possibility of a fixed link across the Irish Sea cost £896,681, the Department for Transport said.

Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy led the exercise, which concluded it would be technically feasible but ""impossible to justify"" as the ""benefits could not possibly outweigh the costs"".

The study found a bridge would cost an estimated £335bn, while a tunnel would be around £209bn.- despite the prime minister once suggesting it could be done for ""about £15bn"".

It said the work required would be incredibly challenging, taking nearly 30 years from planning to completion.

Beaufort's Dyke - an underwater trench on the most direct route - would also have to be ""carefully surveyed"", the study said, due to about a million tons of unexploded munitions dumped there between the First World War and the 1970s.

A bridge was described as needing a ""sacrificial outer layer"" enabling its main structure to survive a ""local detonation"".

The Oresund Bridge, a 10 mile-long road and rail link between Sweden and Denmark, was viewed as an inspiration for the potential UK crossing.

Mr Johnson had previously been enthusiastic about the possibility of a link but accepted the report's conclusion.

The study was carried out in tandem with a wider review of UK connectivity which cost another £1.1m.

Sir Peter led the review alongside his Network Rail job and did not get any extra pay.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Communities across the United Kingdom want to see better connections between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England, which is why we have explored all options and have sought to work with the devolved governments to deliver that.

""The purpose of the Union Connectivity Review was to examine, in detail, all aspects of transport connectivity between the nations to boost and deliver further opportunities for people, families and communities.

""As part of this detailed review, we consulted with the best engineers and technical consultants and undertook extensive social and geographical research to carry out a comprehensive study.

""This has informed our approach to rail, road and air, including making travel cheaper for all parts of the UK by reducing Air Passenger Duty by 50% for domestic flights.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120214432/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-study-into-scotland-northern-ireland-bridge-cost-taxpayers-900-000-12521095;Category-2: business and economy
Cost of living crisis lies in wait for Boris Johnson as he fights to save his job;Thursday 20 January 2022 22:42, UK;['beth rigby', '@bethrigby'];[];"Harlow is one of Essex's most deprived towns.

Nearly a third of households here have a yearly income of less than £20,000 and nearly two-thirds of households have less than £125 of spare cash left at the end of the month for non-essentials. A quarter of all homes in Harlow are council houses.

This, then, is a place where every penny counts and the cost of living squeeze is keenly felt - not just by its residents but its local Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who is desperate for the prime minister and his government to prioritise pounds in pockets over parties.

Sue Gray: Which lockdown parties is she investigating, and what has Downing Street said about them?

Image: Conservative MP Robert Halfon wants the PM to prioritise cost of living

Mr Halfon is here having his lunch in the local ""Cornish Cafe"". He often comes here to eat and chat with constituents and told me that he wanted the PM to focus on helping people with the cost of living squeeze.

He urged the government to cut VAT on fuel bills and look again at green levies on consumers' bills - suggesting a sliding scale so when energy prices spike, green levies reduce.

He said: ""If the government could institute a system where if the international energy prices go high, the green levies escalators go down. Even if you don't get rid of them completely, you can lessen them.""

He is frustrated. Born by the PM's seeming lack of focus on what, he says, is by far the most pressing issue for this government and the country, and the ""unnecessary distraction"" of the party scandal, which has left Mr Halfon and his constituents ""upset and distressed.""

But he has little time too for Tory party infighting and calls to get rid of Mr Johnson, arguing that it will only further distract his government and party from tackling the issues people really care about.

""Forget about operation red meat"", he said. ""The public want operation cost of living.

""My worry about everything that's gone on is that this is a distraction, because they're all focused on firefighting when they should be focused on helping the public cut their bills.

""The real elephant in the room is people are struggling to feed their families, to have a decent quality of life. That is not acceptable.""

Growing Tory civil war as MPs wait for Sue Gray's partygate report to determine Boris Johnson's future

The MP's view is echoed by the parents and teachers we spoke to at Jerounds Primary School, just a short drive from the café. Chatting to three mums - all with 10-year-old children in the school - it was clear that they are worried about the cost of living squeeze coming down the tracks.

Mother of four Naheeda told me: ""Wages are not necessarily going up with inflation, in line with the cost of living.""

Asked whether she had noticed it at the supermarket, day-to-day, she replied: ""Yes definitely. Whereas before you knew how much the weekly bill would be, now you're too scared almost... you think - what's it going to be!?""

Hayley Marsh said the removal of the £20 Universal Credit uplift ""made a real difference"".

""I was used to having it, now it's just gone,"" she said. As rates and bills rise, days spent taking her son out for pizza, or for fish and chips, ""will go out the window.

""I'll have to save more in advance just for a little trip out.""

But Boris Johnson's party scandal has cut through here too - with Hayley very angry, while Siobhan more forgiving but nevertheless dismayed that politics and infighting was distracting from getting on with dealing with issues that matter to families; from the cost of living to the post-COVID recovery.

Hayley ""really struggled"" with her mental health living at home alone as a single parent.

""And then he's there having cheese and wine laughing ha ha ha!"" she said.

""I was in a real crisis moment. I should have seen someone.""

Siobhan, though, says she's trying to look at the ""bigger picture.""

She said: ""I kind of think the nation would struggle with a change to prime minister more than anything else at the moment.""

The cost of living crisis is set to get worse, with the rise in National Insurance coming this April as the energy price cap is removed, sending household bills soaring.

The PM told Sky News last October worries over inflation were ""unfounded"", only to find three months later inflation hitting a 30-year high with all the price rises it brings for consumers. It suggests the PM, who won the 2019 election by claiming to be the leader for the working man, hasn't grasped the nettle.

'Not moral or immoral but amoral': Party whips have always revelled in their notoriety;Thursday 20 January 2022 18:04, UK;['jon craig', '@joncraig'];[];"Party whips in the House of Commons have always revelled in their notoriety and enjoyed being glamorised on stage and screen.

James Graham's play This House, about the rivalry, double dealing and dirty tricks of the government and opposition whips' offices during the Labour government of the 1970s, was a huge West End hit.

And who can forget author Michael Dobbs' villainous chief whip Frances Urquhart, who made House of Cards a smash hit on TV with his catchphrase ""You might think that. I couldn't possibly comment.""

Image: Walter Harrison was a legendary figure at Westminster

But is the real thing very different? Not really.

This House was based on true events in the '70s when votes were on a knife-edge and the battles were so intense that sick MPs were wheeled in to vote on hospital trolleys.

And the central character was Walter Harrison, Labour's deputy chief whip, a legendary figure at Westminster with a reputation for employing dodgy deals and rat-like cunning as well as bruising confrontations.

The dark arts continued into the 1990s.

In his new memoir, former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell - whose ministerial career was ended by the ""Plebgate"" controversy - has a chapter about the darker arts deployed by whips to bribe and bully MPs.

""A whip is not moral or immoral but amoral,"" he writes about his time as a whip in John Major's government in the 1990s, which included the ferocious parliamentary battles over the Maastricht Bill.

""If the government decides to proceed with the slaughter of the first-borns bill, it is the whips' job to secure the necessary votes by explaining that there are too many first borns around, fettering the chances of the second- and third-born children.

""So the public good is clearly served by their removal.""

Image: 'A whip is not moral or immoral but amoral,' Andrew Mitchell said

Mr Mitchell recalls how sometimes the intimidation of backbenchers took physical form. He says the burliest of Major's whips was capable of lifting a potential rebel off his feet by his tie and lapels.

But more often, the whips got their way using the promise of promotion or the lure of an honour, Mr Mitchell claims.

The burly whip Mr Mitchell refers to was David Lightbown, a giant of a man who had been a regimental sergeant major and who was known as ""The Terminator"".

Another enforcer in John Major's whips office of the 1990s used more duplicitous methods, claiming he had a ""black book"" full of stories about the sexual shenanigans of MPs - and indeed political journalists!

More recently, Gavin Williamson, who was Theresa May's chief whip, used to enjoy and revel in the publicity about a tarantula he kept in a glass box on his desk.

Image: Gavin Williamson was chief whip under Theresa May

The spider was called Cronus, after a Greek god who ate his own children. The Westminster folklore was that it served as a warning to errant MPs who stepped out of line.

Not all Tory chief whips have been bullies of Machiavellian figures, however.

MPs claimed Sir George Young - a cyclist known as ""the bicycling baronet"" - used to play Classic FM in his office when he gave troublesome backbenchers a very polite dressing down.

For many years, whips in both the Labour and Conservative parties were exclusively men.

This House features the young Ann Taylor as a junior whip.

Image: Sir George Young played Classic FM in his office when he was chief whip

Years later, in Tony Blair's first term, she became the first woman to serve as government chief whip. Jacqui Smith was later chief whip under Mr Blair too and Rosie Winterton, now a deputy speaker, was Ed Miliband's chief whip.

So despite what William Wragg claims, the macho culture in whips' offices is not what it was, though the current chief whip, Mark Spencer, a burly, ruddy-faced farmer from Nottinghamshire, has a physique that almost matches that of David Lightbown.

Don't dare tell any whips that they're softies, though.

They enjoy the mystique, the secrecy and - of course - the power they enjoy.

And Mr Spencer has been blamed - somewhat unfairly - for some of the blunders of the Boris Johnson premiership, such as the 100+ COVID rebellion last month and the Owen Paterson fiasco.

Now then, how would the real-life Walter Harrison or the fictional Frances Urquhart have dealt with the challenge of protecting Boris Johnson from the ""partygate"" scandal and the ""pork pie plot"" aimed at ending his premiership?";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120231516/https://news.sky.com/story/not-moral-or-immoral-but-amoral-party-whips-have-always-revelled-in-their-notoriety-12521135;Category-1: politics
Britishvolt gigafactory given £100m in taxpayer funding to help power electric car future;Friday 21 January 2022 03:53, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];"Plans for a new British-owned battery gigaplant in Northumberland have been boosted by the commitment of around £100m of government funds to the £3.8bn scheme.

The Britishvolt project intends to manufacture power cells for 300,000 electric vehicle battery packs a year at a new factory on the site of the former Blyth Power Station.

The injection of taxpayer funding comes via the Automotive Transformation Fund, and will be augmented by £1.7bn of private funding raised by real estate fund manager Tritax and investment manager abrdn.

The development is the second gigafactory to receive public funding in the North East in the last year as part of efforts to combat climate change through a new electric car future.

It follows the announcement of a £1bn joint venture between Nissan, Envision and Sunderland City Council to build batteries for the Japanese car manufacturer's electric vehicles (EVs) on Wearside.

Image: Nissan's expansion in Sunderland had been in doubt until the company said the Brexit trade deal benefited it

Britishvolt says 3,000 people will be directly employed at the factory, with a further 5,000 jobs created in the supply chain and wider economy.

Construction on the 93-acre site began last September and the company plans to reach a capacity of 30GW of capacity by the end of the decade, with production starting by 2024.

The government has committed to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 but the UK lags behind European competitors in battery production, the crucial link in the EV supply chain.

The Nissan-Envision factory will initially produce 9GW of battery cells a year, with capacity to increase to 35GW in time.

The UK is estimated to need up to 90GW of batteries a year by 2030 and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says the industry should be targeting at least 60GW by that date.

On current forecasts just 37GW has been committed to compared to a European Union total of 640GW.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the investment was a vote of confidence in the UK and the North East.

""In this global race between countries to secure vital battery production, this government is proud to make the investment necessary to ensure the UK retains its place as one of the best locations in the world for auto manufacturing.""

Peter Rolton, Britishvolt's executive chairman, said: ""This announcement is a major step in putting the UK at the forefront of the global energy transition, unlocking huge private sector investment that will develop the technology and skills required for Britain to play its part in the next industrial revolution.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121041004/http://news.sky.com/story/britishvolt-gigafactory-given-100m-in-taxpayer-funding-to-help-power-electric-car-future-12521139;Category-2: business and economy
'Bionic' gran is first in UK to use 'revolutionary' microchip that could help her see properly again;Friday 21 January 2022 03:59, UK;[];[];"An 88-year-old grandmother who lost the sight in her left eye has become the first person in the UK to detect signals in it using a ""revolutionary"" new bionic chip.

The woman suffers from geographic atrophy - the most common form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

This causes a blind spot to develop in the middle of the eye.

Image: She has become the first person in the UK to detect signals in her eye using a 'revolutionary' new bionic chip

It is estimated that the condition affects more than five million people worldwide.

The octogenarian from Dagenham, London, received the implant at Moorfields Eye Hospital as part of a Europe-wide clinical trial.

In a statement, she said she hoped the implant would allow her to do the things she loved again.

""Losing the sight in my left eye through dry AMD has stopped me from doing the things I love, like gardening, playing indoor bowls and painting with watercolours,"" she said.

""I am thrilled to be the first to have this implant, excited at the prospect of enjoying my hobbies again and I truly hope that many others will benefit from this too.""

Image: The implant works by surgically inserting a 2mm wide microchip under the centre of a patient's retina

How does 'revolutionary' new bionic chip work?

The implant works by surgically inserting a 2mm wide microchip under the centre of a patient's retina.

The patient then wears special glasses, containing a video camera that is linked to a small computer attached to their waistband.

The chip captures the video provided by the glasses, and in turn transmits this to the computer, which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process this information and guide the focus of the glasses.

Finally, the glasses project this image as an infrared beam back through the eye to the chip, which transforms this into an electrical signal that travels back through the retina cells and into the brain.

The brain then interprets this signal as if it were natural vision.

'Hope' for sufferers of AMD

The research is supported by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology.

Mahi Muqit, consultant vitreoretinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said the device ""offers hope"" to people suffering loss of vision due to dry AMD.

Devil-obsessed 'Ripper' found guilty of murder and sex attack in violent four-hour spree;Friday 21 January 2022 14:56, UK;[];[];"A devil-obsessed ""Ripper"" is facing a life sentence for killing one woman and attacking two others in a violent four-hour spree.

Delivery driver Brian Sengendo was found guilty of beating and stabbing Therasia Gordon, 44, to death before dumping her body in woods in Enfield, north London, last August.

Hours before, the 26-year-old targeted two other vulnerable women in the area, the Old Bailey was told.

Devil-obsessed

The court heard how Sengendo had a collection of Tarot cards and had recordings on his mobile phone talking about devils and demons.

He told one of the victims ""repeat after me, I'm the devil's child"" before forcing her to perform a sex act.

The defendant was found guilty of seven charges on Friday, including murder, attempted murder, kidnap and rape.

Judge John Hillen congratulated the police for their ""outstanding"" work in catching Sengendo.

He said: ""Through effective police work... it may well be a serial killer has been caught on day one.

""This is, to use a journalist vernacular, a Ripper case where an offender has been caught.""

Sentencing has been adjourned until 18 March.

Sengendo is facing a minimum of 30 years behind bars, the judge said, adding a whole life order would be considered.

'Pretended to be a client'

Prosecutor John Price QC told the jury that the defendant carried out the attacks of ""escalating gravity"" over less than four hours on the night of 3 August last year.

Sengendo kidnapped the vulnerable women by ""tricking"" them into his Vauxhall van.

Image: The van used by Brian Sengendo. Pic: Met Police

Mr Price said: ""He pretended to be a potential client, whereas in truth, no sooner had they got in and shut the door, this man had something very different in mind.""

The attacks came to light after police went to the aid of an injured woman stumbling in the road just after midnight on 4 August.

Holding her bleeding neck, the woman shouted: ""I have been stabbed, can someone please help me?""

She told the officer: ""I am a prostitute and my client stabbed me, then threw my mobile phone in the bush.""

Then shortly before 1am, a resident of New Park Avenue reported an attack in an alleyway behind their house to the police.

He said he had heard a woman shouting, ""help, please, no!"" and saw a young man striking something inside a van, the court heard.

The van had gone by the time officers arrived, but there was a large pool of blood on the ground, a mobile phone and two bloodstained knives at the scene.

The phone belonged to Ms Gordon and police circulated her details as a ""high-risk missing person"".

Image: Therasia Gordon was murdered on the night of 3 August. Pic: Met Police

A day later, a woman walking along Burnt Farm Ride, near the M25, saw what she thought was a ""life-size doll"" among trees.

But early on 6 August, a cyclist stopped and took a closer look, and realised it was a woman.

Mr Price said: ""He called out to her but got no response. He believed she must be dead and so he telephoned the police.

""It was immediately obvious from the outward appearance of her body that Ms Gordon had suffered a violent death. She had been stabbed and beaten.""

Arrest

Sengendo was arrested in the early hours of 7 August after CCTV footage led to the police identifying a white Vauxhall Vivaro which was linked to the defendant's former address in Enfield.

He told officers in his interview that he was ""confused"" but did not answer questions.

Police later found his blood-soaked trainers and Tarot cards in an empty flat next to his home, while his T-shirt was recovered from the scene of Ms Gordon's attack.

Two phones were also recovered - with one revealing searches for ""dead girl in Enfield"" and ""how long does DNA last"" in the days between the murder and the discovery of the body.

Sengendo claimed in his evidence that a man called ""KT"", who he met through his work as a Yodel delivery driver, must have taken the T-shirt and the spare keys to his van.

He denied all the charges against him and said he believed in the devil as any Christian would.

'Devastating impact'

Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, who led the investigation, said Ms Gordon's murder has had a ""devastating impact on her family, not least her mum, Jan"".

He added that he hoped she has some small comfort knowing that her daughter's killer will ""spend most of his life behind bars"".

""We must not forget the other women who suffered at Sengendo's hands. They too have spoken about the lasting effect that night has had on them. We commend their bravery in speaking to us and providing the evidence which was crucial to his conviction,"" he continued.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121153351/https://news.sky.com/story/devil-obsessed-ripper-found-guilty-of-murder-and-sex-attack-in-violent-four-hour-spree-12521789;Category-4: sports

Horror show for Netflix as shares plunge by a fifth after customer numbers fall short;Friday 21 January 2022 10:38, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"Netflix suffered a horror show as its shares lost a fifth of their value after latest subscriber numbers disappointed Wall Street.

The streaming service added 8.3 million customers in the last three months of 2021 - short of the 8.5 million that the company had targeted, despite a heavy line-up of new releases such as Don't Look Up and Red Notice.

It pencilled in subscriber growth of 2.5 million for the current quarter, less than half the 5.9 million that was being forecast by analysts.

Shares fell nearly 20% in after-hours trading after the results were published, adding to a recent decline in the company's value amid a wider slump in the tech sector.

The fall also wiped off most of the remaining gains it had seen since the start of the pandemic.

Netflix enjoyed strong growth during lockdowns as more people stayed at home in front of the television watching hits such as The Crown and Bridgerton, picking up 37 million customers in 2020.

But it suffered a hangover last year when only 18 million were added - the slowest annual pace of growth for five years. It took the total number to just under 222 million.

Subscriber additions had been expected to stabilise this year to a pre-COVID pace similar to 2019, when they hit just under 28 million.

But in its latest update, Netflix tempered growth expectations for the months ahead due to the late arrival in the first quarter of new content such as the second series of Bridgerton and Ryan Reynolds' time-travel film The Adam Project.

Meanwhile rival services such as Disney+ and HBO Max are putting it under pressure, with Netflix admitting that competition ""may be affecting our marginal growth some"".

However it said it was still growing in every country where other streaming services have launched.

""Even in a world of uncertainty and increasing competition, we're optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as streaming supplants linear entertainment around the world,"" the company told shareholders.

Wagamama owner warns bounce-back in consumer confidence after Plan B may take a while;Friday 21 January 2022 15:05, UK;['john-paul ford rojas', '@jpfordrojas'];[];"The owner of restaurant chains Wagamama and Frankie & Benny's has warned that consumer confidence may take a while to bounce back even after Plan B restrictions are lifted.

Sales at the Restaurant Group last month were hit by working from home guidance, calls for caution in socialising and increased travel testing requirements, the company revealed in a trading update.

The restrictions put a dampener in the recovery of Wagamama, which went from 11% like-for-like growth compared to pre-pandemic levels in October to just 1% in December.

Its other restaurant chains including Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito also saw growth in consumer appetite dry up with revenues down 2% by last month.

The group's pub division, including the Brunning & Price chain, saw sales 7% down in December.

But the company said it had delivered ""good cost control and continued strong trading relative to the market"", meaning that full-year earnings would be at the top end of a previously expected £73m-£79m range.

The Restaurant Group said it was ""encouraged"" by the lifting of all Plan B restrictions from next week but cautioned: ""We expect consumer confidence to take longer to recover.""

It also pointed to a continuing tough time for its airport concession outlets with any recovery in passenger volumes dependent on the changes to UK and international restrictions.

The comments were a bit more cautious than those of Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, who told Sky News this week that the lifting of restrictions had prompted ""breakdancing round the living room"".

They also appear to chime with a closely-watched survey from GfK showing that consumer confidence has plunged this month as cost of living concerns grow.

Babes in the Wood killer Russell Bishop dies aged 55;Friday 21 January 2022 12:55, UK;[];[];"Babes in the Wood killer Russell Bishop has died at the age of 55, the Ministry of Justice has said.

The murderer died in hospital from cancer after being rushed there from HMP Frankland in County Durham.

He was found guilty of murdering two nine-year-old girls in a Brighton park in 1986.

He was jailed after being tried for the second time in 2018 for the deaths of Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway using the latest DNA techniques on a sample from the crime scene which yielded a ""one-in-a-billion match"".

A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""HMP Frankland prisoner Russell Bishop died in hospital on 20 January. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.""

Bishop was 20 years old when he sexually assaulted and strangled the two girls in a den in Wild Park, Brighton.

A discarded sweatshirt on his route home linked him to the crime by DNA while fibre, paint and ivy hairs placed it at the murder scene.

Tests revealed a ""one-in-a-billion"" DNA match to Bishop from a sample taken from Karen's left forearm.

Their mothers described Bishop as an ""evil monster"" after 32 years of fighting for justice.

Although Bishop, a former roofer, was initially cleared of the ""Babes in the Wood"" murders, within three years he was sentenced to life for the kidnap, sexual assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.

Giving evidence earlier in the trial, Bishop said he feared he would be blamed when he joined the search to find the girls on 10 October 1986.

He told jurors: ""There were a few things that led to that kind of thinking.

""A couple of years before this I was wrongfully arrested for the Grand Hotel bombing in Brighton.""

While serving life for attempted murder, he was ordered to face a fresh trial under the double jeopardy law, following the DNA breakthrough.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121164123/https://news.sky.com/story/babes-in-the-wood-killer-russell-bishop-dies-aged-55-12521619;Category-7: health
COVID-19: Republic of Ireland scraps almost all coronavirus restrictions;Friday 21 January 2022 17:26, UK;['stephen murphy', '@smurphytv'];[];"The Irish government has agreed to lift almost all coronavirus restrictions from tomorrow - in a move attributed to the passing of the peak of the Omicron wave, and the country's high vaccine uptake.

The landmark decision will be announced by Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheal Martin in a televised address to the nation this evening.

From this weekend, Irish pubs, restaurants and other hospitality outlets can return to normal operations, and customers will not be asked for their digital COVID pass.

Currently, a valid pass must be shown, and hospitality must close at 8pm.

The requirements for social distancing will also be dropped.

Spectator limits at outdoor and indoor events will be lifted.

Ireland hosts Wales in the opening match of the Six Nations in two week's time at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. That game, and Ireland's other home fixtures, will now have a capacity crowd of almost 52,000 attending.

A full return to the workplace begins on a phased basis from Monday.

Some rules are being retained, however. The requirement to wear face masks is being retained, until at least the end of February, and a digital COVID pass will still be required for international travel.

Ireland has now passed the peak of its fifth wave of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

With one of Europe's highest vaccine uptakes, and a stabilised hospitalisation rate, the National Public Health Emergency Team felt able to advise the government there was no longer a public health rationale to keep restrictions.

Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said the government was ""very, very conscious"" of older and vulnerable people who had concerns about a full reopening, but said it was all about ""finding a balance"".

The minister said he expected an increase in case numbers in the weeks ahead, but added that the health system had proved it could handle it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121174100/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-republic-of-ireland-scraps-almost-all-coronavirus-restrictions-12521991;Category-7: health
Louie Anderson: Emmy Award-winning actor and comedian dies aged 68 after battle with cancer;Friday 21 January 2022 17:48, UK;[];[];"Emmy Award-winning actor and comedian Louie Anderson has died at the age of 68 after a battle with cancer.

The star of the series Baskets died on Friday morning in Las Vegas, where was admitted to hospital to receive treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, his publicist Glenn Schwartz told Deadline.

Anderson won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 2016 for his role as Christine Baskets in the FX series, and was nominated another two times.

His performance in the animated programme Life with Louie, which aired on Fox from 1997 to 1998, earned him two Daytime Emmys.

He created the show based on his childhood.

Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, he was a counsellor to troubled children before winning first place in the Midwest Comedy Competition in 1981, which gave him his start in comedy, according to Deadline.

Anderson starred in films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Coming to America, Eddie Murphy's 1988 hit movie.

From 1999 to 2002 he hosted the popular American game show Family Feud and was cast in several sitcoms over the last two decades.

He guest-starred on the Big Bang Theory spin-off Young Sheldon and was a recurring character in the TBS comedy Search Party.

One of 11 children, Anderson grew up with an alcoholic father who he described as violent and unpredictable.

Despite his success as a comic, he said he felt no relief from his pain, so he entered therapy and joined a group for the children of alcoholics, which helped him ""break a lifelong pattern of denial"".

This journey was chronicled in his 1991 book, Dear Dad.

He said his mother was complacent and treated the family's pain with large amounts of food, which he talked about in his 1994 book Goodbye Jumbo ... Hello Cruel World.

Image: Louie Anderson pictured in 1987. Pic: AP

He battled an addiction to junk food and problems with low self-esteem which he said he expressed by overeating.

In a 1987 interview with The Associated Press, Anderson compared himself to another comedian who mined his childhood for comedy.

""Bill Cosby and I had similar goals,"" Anderson told AP.

""I wanted parents to be able to bring their children and children to be able to bring their parents to my concerts.

""I feel a family that can laugh about family problems is better off.

""The difference between Cosby and myself is that he sees it from an adult perspective and I tell it from a child's viewpoint.""

In 1987 he said he had stopped using his size as stage material, saying: ""I've always been big. But I don't do fat jokes anymore.""

Muriel McKay: Family of woman murdered 52 years ago plead with Met chief to get them search warrant for farm;Friday 21 January 2022 19:00, UK;['martin brunt', '@skymartinbrunt'];[];"The daughter of murdered Muriel McKay has appealed to Scotland Yard's commissioner to speed up the search for her mother's body on the farm where the family believes she was buried 52 years ago.

She is also planning legal action to force the landowner to let her scan the site privately after he refused permission.

Dianne McKay, 81, fears a recently reopened police investigation is moving too slowly and has urged Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to intervene.

In a letter, Dianne McKay writes: ""Despite the fact that we have had severe difficulty gaining access to the land, we have made numerous personal approaches to the land owner who clearly lacks empathy for the trauma we have been through.

""This was a private investigation, funded privately and we had hoped to keep it that way.

""However, I am 82 and my sister is 85 and not in very good health. We are hoping that after 52 years of pain, we can finally obtain some closure.""

Image: The surviving kidnapper has identified the spot where he says Muriel is buried but the farm's owner has refused permission

Muriel McKay, 55, was kidnapped from her Wimbledon home on 29 December 1969 and held at a remote farm in Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire.

Her kidnappers, brothers Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein, demanded a £1m ransom and got Muriel to write letters asking for the money to be paid, but after a bungled police operation nothing more was heard from her.

Muriel was married to newspaper executive Alick McKay, deputy to wealthy media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, who had just bought the Sun newspaper. Her kidnappers had mistaken her for Mr Murdoch's then wife, Anna.

The brothers were eventually arrested and convicted of her murder, but went to prison without revealing what happened to their victim.

Last year, the McKay family hired a lawyer who tracked down Nizamodeen Hosein in Trinidad and over several weeks of questioning he said Muriel had been well-treated but had died of a heart attack and he panicked and buried her behind a barn close to the farmhouse.

He didn't say why he hadn't explained this at his trial, but was precise in his description and location of the burial site.

Image: A radar scan revealed disturbance to the ground where the family believe Muriel is buried

The family hired a ground penetrating radar specialist and, from a footpath that runs through the farm, scanned the site and claim it revealed death disturbance down to four feet.

Dianne writes in her letter: ""We have done all the groundwork required and now emotionally struggle with the delays we are facing in the final hurdle to locate my mother.

""We can continue to conduct this investigation with our own team, at our own expense as we have done so far - all we need is your assistance in gaining access to what is still the manure heap where my mother is buried to carry out a non-invasive scan.

Image: Muriel McKay with her husband Alick, who was Rupert Murdoch's deputy

""We trust that in the event we are to locate my mother's remains, the area will be secured until a coroner can have her exhumed and finally laid to rest properly.""

In a confrontation at the farm last week the current owner, a financier, told Dianne he didn't believe Nizamodeen's burial story, but would cooperate if police got a search warrant to excavate his land.

Detectives have reopened the case files and told the family they would need to gather their own evidence and may want to interview Nizamodeen themselves.

Police to meet MP who claims Conservative critics of Boris Johnson are being 'blackmailed';Friday 21 January 2022 22:54, UK;['alan mcguinness', '@alan_mcguinness'];[];"Police will meet with a Conservative MP who has alleged that government figures have been engaging in ""intimidation"" that amounts to ""blackmail"" against Tories who have questioned Boris Johnson's position.

A Scotland Yard detective will talk with William Wragg next week about his allegation, which comes as the prime minister is under pressure over a number of Downing Street parties during COVID restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""As with any such allegations, should a criminal offence be reported to the Met, it would be considered.""

The development was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, which quoted Mr Wragg as saying: ""I stand by what I have said. No amount of gas-lighting will change that.

""The offer of Number 10 to investigate is kind but I shall leave it to the experts. I am meeting the police early next week.""

Mr Wragg added that he would be outlining ""several"" examples of bullying and intimidation, which in some instances involved public money.

What did the MP allege?

Mr Wragg, chair of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and one of a number MPs who has called for Mr Johnson to resign, made his allegation at the start of a committee hearing on Thursday.

""The intimidation of a member of parliament is a serious matter,"" he said.

""Reports of which I am aware would seem to constitute blackmail.

""As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police.""

Mr Wragg said the reports he had received included ""members of staff at 10 Downing Street, special advisers, government ministers and others encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass those they suspect of lacking confidence in the prime minister"".

He also claimed some MPs had received threats to ""withdraw investments"" from their constituencies.

In the wake of Mr Wragg's claim, an MP who defected to Labour this week said he was threatened with the loss of a school in his constituency if he did not vote the way party bosses wanted him to.

A Labour source has said the vote related to free school meals.

As the row rumbles on, The Times has reported that Conservative MPs who want Mr Johnson out of office are considering publishing a secretly recorded conversation with the chief whip, as well as messages, to back up the intimidation claims.

Blackmail 'has no place in British politics'

They added: ""If there was any evidence to support it, it would of course be looked at.""

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News that threatening to hold back funds from an MP's constituency was ""completely unacceptable"".

Barbara Broccoli, with her brother Michael G Wilson, have produced the last nine Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum Of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre.

One of the most sought after and iconic roles in cinema is now back up grabs following Daniel Craig's final outing as 007 in the most recent Bond movie No Time To Die.

Elba, who stars in the crime drama Luther, is often tipped as one of the leading candidates to take over.

The 49-year-old has appeared in several Hollywood movies including Concrete Cowboy, Pacific Rim and Thor: Ragnarok.

Speaking to Deadline's Crew Call podcast, Broccoli addressed the speculation over who will next play Bond after she was told ""a lot of fans want to see Idris Elba in a tuxedo"".

Broccoli, 61, said: ""Well, we know Idris, we're friends with him, and he's a magnificent actor.

""And, you know, it's been part of the conversation, but it's always difficult to have the conversation when you have someone in the seat.

Former senior Met Police officer who used spy cameras to secretly film naked women is jailed;Friday 21 January 2022 17:38, UK;['tom gillespie', '@tomgillespie1'];[];"A former senior Metropolitan Police officer has been jailed after using spy cameras to secretly film naked women.

Neil Corbel, who was a detective inspector when he committed the crimes, posed as an airline pilot to book models for photoshoots before planting the gadgets in hotel rooms, flats and Airbnbs.

The cameras were hidden in everyday items, including tissue boxes, phone chargers, air fresheners, glasses, keys and headphones, to video his unsuspecting victims for up to four hours.

Corbel, 40, from Hertfordshire, had contacted victims online using the name ""Harrison"".

The married father-of-two, a former counter-terrorism officer, was caught after a model, who had agreed to pose naked for a photoshoot, became suspicious of a digital clock.

An internet search of the brand name revealed the device was a high-end spyware video-recording device which could be controlled from a smartphone.

When he was arrested, Corbel told police he was addicted to pornography and officers found images of 51 women on his hard drive, with 19 victims, including 16 models and three escorts, agreeing to make statements against him.

Corbel, who resigned after being suspended by the Met, where he was attached to the Continuous Policing Improvement Command, pleaded guilty to 19 voyeurism offences at Westminster Magistrates' Court in September.

Judge Martin Edmunds QC jailed Corbel for a total of three years at Isleworth Crown Court on Friday for the offences across the London, Manchester and Brighton areas between January 2017 and February 2020.

""You used a range of deceptions to induce women to take off their clothes in your presence so you could record videos for your sexual gratification,"" he told Corbel.

""You did so using multiple strategically placed covert cameras, sometimes as many as nine.""

He added that the victims ""were entitled to have the personal autonomy"" and each had set ""clear boundaries"".

The judge said Corbel did not exploit his police role to either ""locate or intimidate"" his victims and did not use ""police equipment or specialist police knowledge"".

However, he said the revelation it was a serving officer had ""seriously undermined"" his victims' trust in police.

Three of Corbel's victims watched on as he was jailed, having faced him in court to read their victim impact statements.

One model, who agreed to pose for a ""fashion and artistic nude shoot"", was visibly angry as she told Corbel his crimes had ""affected every aspect of my life"".

Image: Neil Corbel has been jailed for three years

""I have pulled so much of my hair out with stress I have bald spots and have had to turn down work,"" she said, showing her scalp to the court.

Other victims, who were not in court, mentioned the case of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard, who was snatched off the street before being raped and murdered by Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens.

""The fact that he is policeman is a huge deal,"" said one.

""These people are meant to protect us. Following the murder of Sarah Everard this feels like a very frightening time to be a woman.""

Edward Henry QC, defending, said Corbel felt ""genuine remorse"" for the ""deplorable activity"" and was voluntarily seeking to ""combat"" his sex addiction.

He said Corbel, who had ""put people away who would have done terrible harm and caused much bloodshed"" during his 13-year career, did not spend police money or commit the offences on police time.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122030712/http://news.sky.com/story/former-senior-met-police-officer-who-used-spy-cameras-to-secretly-film-naked-women-is-jailed-12521963;Category-7: health
Servant returns, Kenneth Branagh on Belfast and the stars of Mass - our Backstage entertainment review;;[];[];"On the day of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, Valentine's Day 2018, like many, actor Fran Kranz found himself trying to make sense of the senseless.

Fourteen students and three teachers died in the massacre, which came after so many before: Columbine, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook. Just a few weeks ago, four students were killed after a fellow pupil opened fire at his high school near Detroit in Michigan.

Kranz, probably best known at that point for his portrayal of Topher Brink in the science fiction drama series Dollhouse, as well as films including Cabin In The Woods and The Village, went online to order books on the mass killings. Having become a father for the first time in 2016, the Parkland shooting affected him so deeply, he couldn't not do something, he says.

Clockwise from top left: Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Ann Dowd in Mass - Bleecker Street/Sky UK Clockwise from top left: Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Ann Dowd in Mass - Bleecker Street/Sky UK

The tragedy became the catalyst for his directorial debut, Mass; a raw and painfully intimate story of two sets of parents meeting in the aftermath of such a shooting. Starring Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton, Ann Dowd and Reed Birney, it is set almost entirely in one room; just four people, sitting around a table, talking.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2021 to critical acclaim, and in December received the Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award - an accolade presented to the ensemble cast, director and casting director of a film, and previously won by the likes of Oscar winners Moonlight and Spotlight.

Kranz tells Sky News that through Mass he wanted to explore the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation; feelings that to those faced with the darkest of situations might seem impossible to come by.

""I wanted to believe they were possible - they were possible in my own life and in my family's life and in the world,"" he says.

""We have these shootings in our country so frequently that it was on my mind and troubling me, as this new parent. What would happen? And so I was trying to with this film, in many ways, just to work through my own feelings on the subject of forgiveness.""

Mass director Fran Kranz and stars Dowd and Isaacs at a screening of the film in New York - AP Mass director Fran Kranz and stars Dowd and Isaacs at a screening of the film in New York - AP

Kranz was also inspired by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a restorative justice body set up in 1996 to investigate human rights abuses after the end of apartheid, chaired by the late Desmond Tutu, and The Forgiveness Project.

""I felt like I wanted to do something with these stories,"" he says. ""But I'm not South African and did not know how I would participate in something like that... [then] the day of the Parkland shooting, I was so overwhelmed I went on to Amazon and just ordered several books on mass shootings in America. I just thought, I need to understand what the hell is going on here.

""That's what started this kind of two years, essentially, of reading nothing but the subject. And it did get to a point where there was a moment, particularly around reading about the tragedy at [Sandy Hook], because of the age of these children... it was so emotional, crying in front of a laptop.""

Kranz wrote and rewrote scenes for Mass, he says, realising the dialogue at first was ""too decent, too polite... too rote"". But it was something he felt he had to do, and knew he had to get right.

""I've tried to write things before and I never really had the guts or the sort of follow-through to make something. But there was a moment where I felt, I have to make this movie because what's the point of all this? What's the point of all this emotion? What's the point of reading all of this and learning about the personal lives of so many families, children, teachers, parents... I just had to do something with it.""

As part of her research, Dowd (The Handmaid's Tale, Hereditary, Compliance) read A Mother's Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy, by Sue Klebold, the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.

""She had lived the unimaginable story of [my character] Linda's life, essentially, of her son being the shooter, shooting many others, taking his own life. So I read it [but] didn't dwell on it, because the script was powerful and enough.""

Despite the fierce arguments over gun laws in the US, there is no politics in Mass. ""It can't be a polemic and I have to approach it just from a human perspective and tell the story of human beings working through pain to try and get to a better place,"" says Kranz.

""If we can focus on the empathetic connection to people, we might find another way, or we might find ourselves in a place where some of these problems feel easier to solve because we're approaching it from a place of compassion for one another, as opposed to the adversarial approach of: you're doing something wrong and need to stop.""

""FOUR PEOPLE ENTER A ROOM - IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING TERRIBLE OR WONDERFUL COULD HAPPEN""

Mass star Jason Isaacs

Plimpton (The Goonies, Beautiful Girls) and Isaacs (Harry Potter films, The OA, Hotel Mumbai) play Gail and Jay, the parents of one of the victims.

""At the time I read [the script] first, it was clear the world was incredibly divided,"" Isaacs tells Sky News.

""Trump was president in America and was using blame as a tool, and Britain was divided by Brexit. [Mass] is a film about people whose lives have ground to a halt because they're so crippled by hatred and blame and resentment, and they're poisoning themselves for that. And it was kind of a plea for human connection.

""It's such a brave and bold subject to want to tell a story about, but it was made so personal and human; [it] had, at the same time, that gripping element of, I was desperate to find out what happened next. Four people enter a room; it feels like something terrible or wonderful could happen.""

The film explores the theme of forgiveness - Bleecker Street/Sky UK The film explores the theme of forgiveness - Bleecker Street/Sky UK

It's a film, essentially, ""about four people talking"", he says. ""It doesn't have special effects or mountains or aliens. It's four human beings interacting at their most raw.""

Isaacs says he hopes audiences aren't ""misled"" into thinking Mass is a film about a school shooting. ""It really isn't anything to do with that,"" he says. ""That happened many years before the film. We're a couple whose marriage has ground to a halt, our lives have ground to a halt, and we want to be able to move forward... I don't think it's about the people specifically to whom this has happened.""

Plimpton disagrees. ""We have a different perspective,"" she says. But they do agree that the central theme of the film is about moving forward in the face of unspeakable tragedy.

""It has the specifics of the universal, if that doesn't sound too pretentious,"" says Isaacs. ""It speaks to anybody whose lives are held back by hatred or division or the notion that someone else is to blame.""

""Grief,"" Plimpton adds.

Mass is about grief and moving forward: four people, sitting in a room, talking it out.

Shane McInerney: Irish football coach faces 20 years in jail for allegedly exposing himself on flight in row over food;Saturday 22 January 2022 10:52, UK;[];[];"An Irish football coach could face up to 20 years in prison for alleged ""unruly behaviour"" on a plane - including exposing himself to cabin crew in a row over the food.

Shane McInerney, 29, is said to have caused ""numerous disturbances"" on the Delta Airlines flight from Dublin to John F Kennedy (JFK) International Airport in New York.

McInerney, from Galway, is also accused of repeatedly refusing to wear a face mask and throwing a can which hit another passenger on the eight-hour journey which departed on 7 January.

He is said to have walked from his seat to complain about the food being served before pulling his pants down, exposing his buttocks to an attendant and nearby passengers.

The pilot tried to speak with McInerney who is said to have responded by telling him not to touch him.

He also put his fist close to the pilot's face, it is alleged.

McInerney is further accused of refusing to stay in his seat as the plane made its descent to JFK - instead choosing to stand in the aisle.

He was taken into custody after the plane landed.

Legal papers filed in New York said: ""During the approximately eight-hour flight, the defendant repeatedly refused to wear a face mask despite being asked dozens of times by flight crew personnel.""

He has been charged with interfering with flight crew - a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years behind bars.

In his Instagram profile McInerney describes himself as a sportsperson, former professional football player, coach and qualified personal trainer.

Reports suggest he was flying to the US to take a job teaching football at an academy in Daytona, Florida.

He shared a picture of himself at Daytona Beach, earlier this week, telling followers: ""Great to be back in the sunshine state.

""Blessed to call this place home for the next few months.""

McInerney appeared in court last week and has been released on bail.

His lawyer declined to comment.

In a statement, Delta said it has ""has zero tolerance for unruly behaviour at our airports and aboard our aircraft as nothing is more important that the safety of our people and our customers"".

Coronavirus: Inside a long COVID clinic as patient who was 'fit and healthy' can now 'barely do anything';Saturday 22 January 2022 18:01, UK;['katerina vittozzi', '@kvittozzi'];[];"""Look me - I'm shaking,"" Laura Swarbrick says as she waits for her appointment.

Even getting to today's long COVID clinic has been an unbelievable struggle for the 28-year-old.

Last summer, Ms Swarbrick was in the Royal Preston Hospital's intensive care ward being treated for COVID-19.

She was there for nine weeks and the experience left her with crippling anxiety and depression.

""Coming back to the same place that I saw so many awful things happen, where I saw people literally dying on the ward around me, I find it terrifying,"" she said.

""And I'm so scared of being put back in here, I try not to leave the house.""

Ms Swarbrick admits she needs help.

'I didn't even believe in COVID'

Aside from the mental health impact, she said she is breathless after walking short distances and she has a persistent, wracking cough.

""I didn't believe in long COVID,"" she said.

""I didn't even believe in COVID - I thought it was all a hoax.

""But I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

""I was fit and healthy and now I can barely do anything.""

Around 30 patients are being seen at today's special long COVID clinic, run by Royal Preston Hospital's consultant chest physician, Dr Sharada Gudur.

Although the clinic is mainly looking for respiratory issues, it also points patients towards specialists in long COVID's other symptoms, like muscular wastage.

'COVID just destroyed me'

In the waiting room, awaiting his turn, was Michael Pilling.

""My family call me a gentle giant,"" he told me, laughing.

At over six feet tall, and with a big, muscular build, Mr Pilling said he used to find his work as a facilities manager ""easy"".

""I used to lift up and move around tables like they were nothing,"" he said. ""But now COVID just destroyed me.""

Mr Pilling, 63, caught COVID-19 in January last year, just weeks before he was due to get his first vaccination.

He was in an intensive care unit for nearly two months and lost four and a half stone.

""Up until now, I'm still fighting to get back to full strength with my legs and that,"" he said.

""The rest of my body seems to be healing but not my legs.

""It has just knocked me for six basically, broke me down, and that has affected me mentally too.""

Scientists are still studying why some people are affected by long COVID and others are not.

Image: Long COVID has a wide range of symptoms, so sufferers need a multi-disciplinary team

Dr Gudur said: ""Long COVID is a very long process.

""People have expressed that it is a never-ending saga.""

What the situation needs, Dr Gudur said, is more funding and more research.

One of the main challenges is finding the staff to run the clinics.

Long COVID has a wide range of symptoms, so sufferers need a multi-disciplinary team, from respiratory specialists to physiotherapists and radiographers.

Dr Gudur said: ""Maybe one day there will be COVID specialists, because this is going to be a chronic disease and it's important that everyone recognises that it is an entity on its own, and give the patients the care that they deserve.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122215233/https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-inside-a-long-covid-clinic-as-patient-who-was-fit-and-healthy-can-now-barely-do-anything-12522619;Category-7: health
'An apology means nothing now': Woman was raped as a child after going to police station to report sex attack;Saturday 22 January 2022 17:05, UK;['becky cotterill', '@rlcotterill'];[];"A woman has revealed her battle for justice following being repeatedly raped as a 12-year-old after being picked up by two men from a police station where she had gone to report a sex attack.

Her ordeal is part of an upcoming review into child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Sophie (not her real name) told Sky News that the assault in 2006 left her severely traumatised and she now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Sky News has seen a provisional copy of one section of the review and it reveals how Sophie was failed by the police and social services.

Detailing the horrific attack, Sophie told Sky News that she had been drinking with her friends in a local churchyard when a man had sexually assaulted her.

'They just told me to go home'

She bravely went to Oldham Police Station to report the attack but said she was dismissed by the desk clerk.

""They just told me to go home. There were two men at the door that offered to take me,"" says Sophie.

She says the desk clerk let her leave with the men.

Naively Sophie went with them, but instead of taking her home they sexually assaulted her in a car.

They then refused to take her home and instead she ended up in two different houses in Oldham where she was exposed to more abuse.

Over a 24-hour period, eight men attacked her and she was raped multiple times.

Only one man, Shakil Chowdhury, now 54, was jailed in 2007 for raping Sophie that night.

""It's unimaginable to think that that could even happen but it does,"" Sophie said.

""But now all you can do is protect others and stop it from continuing.""

Publication of review into child sexual exploitation delayed

A review of child sexual exploitation in Oldham was commissioned in 2019 by the council and safeguarding board.

It has been looking at historical allegations, including social media posts about shisha bars, taxi companies, and children's homes being involved in the exploitation of young people.

The review was due to be published by the end of last year but it has been delayed.

While the wider findings are still unknown, the provisional conclusions about Sophie's treatment by the police and the council were thoroughly damning.

""There were significant opportunities missed by children's social care to intervene and put in place appropriate arrangements to protect Sophie,"" the review stated.

""No one raised concerns about the apparent failure to protect Sophie when she presented herself at the police station.

""We believe this is evidence of a significant failing by Greater Manchester Police in their treatment of a vulnerable 12-year-old child.""

The police never identified the desk clerk who was on duty when Sophie went to report being assaulted, and the staff roster has long been destroyed.

Police and the council created the impression of a cover-up

The review stated that Sophie's experience that night should have led to a multi-agency child protection investigation.

By denying they'd fallen far short of their duties to Sophie, the police and the council created the impression of a cover-up, it added.

The police will apologise to Sophie and Sky News understands the council will too.

""An apology means nothing now,"" Sophie said.

""You know, they've been found at fault but it's too late - damage is already done.

""The people in charge need to go. That's the only way it can be rebuilt and trust can happen.""

In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said: ""Since it has not yet been published, it is not appropriate for GMP to comment in detail on the report.

""This woman has tragically experienced lasting harm as a result of what happened to her and our failure to protect her. We fully intend to express our deepest and most sincere apology directly to her.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122215233/https://news.sky.com/story/an-apology-means-nothing-now-woman-was-raped-as-a-child-after-going-to-police-station-to-report-sex-attack-12522529;Category-7: health
Chief whip denies claims he told MP she was sacked as a minister due to her Muslim faith;Saturday 22 January 2022 22:59, UK;[];[];"The chief whip has said an MP's claims that she was sacked as a minister because of her Muslim faith are ""completely false"".

Nusrat Ghani, the 49-year-old MP for Wealden in East Sussex, was sacked as transport minister in a February 2020 re-shuffle.

Ms Ghani said she was told by a whip, who she did not identify, that her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"" at a meeting in Downing Street.

Image: Chief Whip Mark Spencer denied Ms Ghani's claims

She said she was also told that her ""Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable"" and that there were concerns ""that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations"".

Chief Whip Mark Spencer said in a statement: ""To ensure other whips are not drawn into this matter, I am identifying myself as the person Nusrat Ghani MP has made claims about this evening.

""These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.

""It is disappointing that when this issue was raised before Ms Ghani declined to refer the matter to the Conservative Party for a formal investigation.

""I provided evidence to the Singh Investigation into Islamophobia which concluded that there was no credible basis for the claims to be included in the report.""

It is understood that Ms Ghani's claims relate to a meeting in March 2020 and that when she raised the issue, she was invited to use the formal party complaints procedure, which she declined to do.

Earlier, Ms Ghani had told The Sunday Times that her experience was ""like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless"".

She said she was later warned that continuing to raise the issue would leave her ""ostracised by colleagues"" with her career and reputation ""destroyed"".

""When I challenged whether this was in any way acceptable and made clear there was little I could do about my identity, I had to listen to a monologue on how hard it was to define when people are being racist and that the party doesn't have a problem and I needed to do more to defend it,"" she said.

""It was very clear to me that the whips and No 10 were holding me to a higher threshold of loyalty than others because of my background and faith.""

A spokesperson on behalf of the Whips Office had earlier told Sky News: ""These claims are categorically untrue.

""Ministerial roles are appointed on merit and rewards for hard work.

""The Conservative Party does not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination.""

Ms Ghani said that the experience made her consider quitting as an MP, adding: ""I will not pretend that this hasn't shaken my faith in the party.""

Her claims are the latest regarding the behaviour of government whips towards their party colleagues.

Chris Bryant, Labour chairman of the Commons standards committee, said he has spoken to ""about a dozen"" Tories who claimed to have been bribed or threatened by government whips.

He said that alleged threats to pull public funding from members' constituencies amounted to ""misconduct in public office"" and should be reported to the police.

William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, will meet police this week to discuss his allegations that No 10 tried to blackmail MPs.

He was one of seven Tory MPs to call for Boris Johnson to resign as prime minister.

Writing on Twitter in response to Ms Ghani's claims, he said: ""Nus is very brave to speak out. I was truly appalled to learn of her experience.

""She shows such strength and integrity supporting others. I am proud to have her as my friend and colleague. We must change things for the better.""

Responding to the reports, leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, wrote: ""This is shocking to read, the Conservatives must investigate immediately. Solidarity with Nus Ghani for your bravery in speaking out.

Fans sue Universal Pictures saying they were duped after Ana de Armas was cut from Yesterday;Sunday 23 January 2022 11:30, UK;[];[];"Two film fans are suing Universal Pictures, claiming they were duped into renting a film because their favourite actress was in the trailer, only to find she did not make the movie's final cut.

Michael Rosza, of California, and Conor Woulfe, of Maryland, watched the trailer for Yesterday, which featured Ana de Armas.

They concluded that de Armas, therefore, played a role in the movie so they paid $3.99 (£2.94) to rent it.

But when they watched it they found that de Armas - who was initially cast as a love interest for the main character played by Himesh Patel - did not appear at all.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Mr Rosza and Mr Woulfe are suing Universal in a proposed class action and filed their complaint in California federal court last Friday.

They are seeking at least $5m (£3.7m) on behalf of California and Maryland residents who paid to watch Yesterday.

In the complaint, they said: ""Although Defendant (Universal) included the scenes with Ms de Armas in the movie trailer advertisements, for the purposes of promoting Yesterday and enticing film sales and rentals, Ms de Armas is not and was never in the publicly-released version of the movie.

""Unable to rely on fame of the actors playing (main character) Jack Malik or Ellie to maximise ticket and movie sales and rentals, Defendant consequently used Ms de Armas's fame, radiance and brilliance to promote the film by including her scenes in the movie trailers advertising Yesterday,"" the lawsuit reads.

Universal has not commented, but the film's writer Richard Curtis said in 2019 that de Armas's character Roxanne was cut because she overshadowed the love story between Patel's character and another woman.

He described it as a ""very traumatic cut"", adding that she had been ""brilliant"" and ""radiant"" in the role.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220123120902/http://news.sky.com/story/fans-sue-universal-pictures-saying-they-were-duped-after-ana-de-armas-was-cut-from-yesterday-12522784;Category-5: entertainment and culture

""After being made aware of these extremely serious claims, the prime minister met with Nusrat Ghani to discuss them,"" the spokesman said.

Chief Whip Mark Spencer has revealed he is the whip in question but said the accusations are ""completely false"".

Mr Johnson is understood to have met Ms Ghani in July 2020 and wrote a letter to her after that suggesting she started a formal complaint process.

Ms Ghani, MP for Wealden in East Sussex, said the whip told her ""Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable"" and it made her consider quitting as an MP.

She added that they told her there were concerns ""that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations"".

Ms Ghani's accusation comes as the tactic of whips is called into question following allegations by some Conservative MPs they have been blackmailed for failing to toe the party line, or even considering it.

In Mr Spencer's statement, he said: ""To ensure other whips are not drawn into this matter, I am identifying myself as the person Nusrat Ghani MP has made claims about this evening.

"M&C; Saatchi suitor AdvancedAdvT sweetens bid with cash";Sunday 23 January 2022 15:38, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"The quoted bid vehicle pursuing a takeover of M&C; Saatchi has tabled a fresh offer which includes a partial cash alternative for investors in the London-listed advertising group.

Sky News has learnt that AdvancedAdvT, which is backed by the technology entrepreneur Vin Murria and serial dealmaking group Marwyn, submitted a revised bid to the board of M&C; Saatchi late last week.

City sources said the new proposal included roughly 40p-a-share in cash, a shift from the initial all-share offer.

The latest development underlines the continuing tussle over the future of one of the best-known names in the advertising industry.

Analysis: M&C; Saatchi shares soar as deputy chair Vin Murria spearheads takeover move

Shares in M&C;, which was co-founded in 1995 by the Saatchi brothers Maurice and Charles, were given a boost on Friday when it announced that the City watchdog had discontinued an investigation into its accounting practices.

The agency has been in play for the last fortnight, with its independent directors saying that the original offer from AdvancedAdvT - structured as a share exchange merger - failed to ""articulate an alternative strategy for the benefit of the company's stakeholders beyond an initial change of control of M&C; Saatchi"".

""Furthermore, the proposal does not reflect the value of the business and its future prospects and would disproportionately transfer equity value from M&C; Saatchi shareholders to AdvT shareholders,"" M&C; said in a statement on 7 January.

Ms Murria, who is also deputy chair of M&C;, owns a separate stake in the business and wants to combine it with AdvancedAdvT to ""build a data, analytics and digitally focused creative marketing business with a strong balance sheet and additional management expertise in transforming businesses at pace and execute on complementary M&A; [mergers and acquisitions]"".

Although some commentators have described the bid for M&C; as a means of taking it private, market sources said the opposite was true, because it would become part of a larger listed company.

Marwyn has been a prolific creator of cash shells and orchestrator of takeovers of companies including the WeBuyAnyCar owner BCA Marketplace and Entertainment One, the owner of Peppa Pig.

It was unclear this weekend how M&C;'s largest shareholders, which include Invesco, would respond to the partial cash alternative contained in the revised proposal.

M&C; could come under pressure to confirm the renewed approach to the stock market on Monday.

Banking sources said they expected M&C; to pursue alternative deals by reaching out to other potential bidders in the near future.

Last week, Sky News revealed that M&C;'s finance director, Mickey Kalifa, was on the brink of quitting to join Dept, a rival digital agency owned by the private equity firm Carlyle.

The London-listed group subsequently confirmed that he had resigned, saying it was for ""personal reasons"".

Shares in M&C; closed on Friday at 175p, giving it a market value of about £213m.

The seizure is the largest Royal Navy drugs bust since HMS Montrose seized 2.4 tonnes of drugs in the Arabian Sea last year.

US Navy stops boat

Also on Sunday, the US Navy announced it had seized a boat in the same waters that had been carrying fertiliser which could be used to make explosives.

The US Navy's 5th Fleet said its guided missile destroyer USS Cole and patrol ships had stopped and searched the boat - a stateless fishing dhow sailing from Iran to Yemen last Tuesday.

The route is well-known for weapons smuggling.

The boat has previously been stopped off the coast of Somalia loaded with thousands of assault rifles and rocket launchers, thought to be from Iran and destined for Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Afghanistan: Taliban's crackdown against women exposed - but some are rebelling;Sunday 23 January 2022 19:09, UK;[];[];"The drive through snowy streets in the Afghan capital takes us through winding, narrow alleyways. It's necessary to avoid the attention of the Taliban soldiers who man multiple checkpoints in Kabul.

In the car's back seat is the leader of one of the most unlikely and bravest of rebel groups. Her diminutive size hides a giant of a personality. She's already been warned a number of times by the Taliban who don't agree with her activities.

But she's unrepentant and more importantly, determined to continue - despite the dangers of risking the Taliban's wrath.

""This is our life,"" she tells us.

""It is our passion. We have to carry on.""

She's already moved location after the Taliban told her if she didn't stop, they'd shut her down. Now she leads us up a metal stairway to a small, hidden backroom where her fellow rebels are now gathering daily.

Inside, heads bowed, concentrating hard and wrapped in thick winter coats because there's zero heating in mid-winter, is a small group of girls. These are some of the rebels taking on the Taliban - and all because they want to continue their art classes.

Drawings in art classes 'a sin'

Many of them are drawing portraits of females - and that appears to be one of the points upsetting the Taliban, who have visited the art teacher and told her she needs to stop these classes.

Image: The art classes now take place underground

""It's because we're drawing women whose faces aren't covered, who aren't wearing proper hijabs,"" the teacher - who we're keeping anonymous for her own safety - explains.

""And the Taliban believe that's a big sin in Islam.""

She's showing us a range of beautiful paintings and drawings of young women and girls. Among them is a portrait of the singer Billie Eilish.

She explains the Taliban don't like depictions of Western celebrities because they don't think they are suitable role models or people who should be celebrated.

This is just a small glimpse into how dramatically life has changed for women and girls in Afghanistan since the Taliban swept to power nearly six months ago.

Image: Western celebrities are not seen as suitable role models

Barred from work and education halted

Most women - apart from health workers and some government employees - have been barred from work. Millions have had their education halted and a series of restrictive measures have been brought in, ranging from instructing women to wear the hijab to insisting they can only travel long distances with a male relative escort.

A UN report by a group of human rights experts found the measures ""taken together, constitute a collective punishment of women and girls, grounded on gender-based bias and harmful practices"".

There's growing evidence the Taliban are going further - cracking down on the small protests being sporadically but persistently organised by women, demanding the restoration of their rights. The most recent demonstration in Kabul last Sunday showed a worrying escalation in Taliban tactics. It was broken up by soldiers using pepper spray and then followed up a few days ago by raids on the homes of the organisers.

Image: Women are being erased from society - in this wedding hall, female faces have been painted over

A video was posted online by a young woman called Tamana Paryani as the Taliban are heard banging on her door. She films herself screaming: ""Help me, help me! The Taliban are here"".

The video has been denounced as fake by the Taliban leadership who told international outlets it was a ruse to try to secure refugee status abroad.

Women taken away by Taliban or in hiding

But the Sky News team followed up the raids, talking to multiple witnesses outside Tamana's home in Kabul who'd watched events unfold that night. They told us there were numerous armed Taliban wearing Special Forces uniforms who turned up outside Tamana's home.

The raid lasted about twenty minutes, several witnesses told us, and a number of people heard Tamana and her three sisters screaming for help. The girls were spotted being taken away by armed men in military uniform and haven't been seen since.

Image: The art teacher has been told to stop the classes

We tracked down several of the women who'd been at the demonstration including the family of one who is videoed, arm raised and leading the chants for improved female rights. She's seen in other videos, talking into the camera and holding a photo collage of world leaders including the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The politicians have tape over their mouths to signify what the protestors feel is their silence over events in Afghanistan. The woman - who we are not identifying for her own safety - is now on the run and in hiding in fear of her life.

Her mother was at home with her grandchildren when she says about 20-30 armed Taliban soldiers turned up trying to find her daughter. They burst into the home, forcing their way past the door. She shows us bruises on her arm where she tried to hold the door shut.

""I was shocked when I saw lots of Taliban with guns and even carrying rockets inside my home,"" she tells us. ""They pointed their guns at all of us even the children... I was so scared.""

She tells us the Taliban confiscated her telephone when they found foreign numbers in her contacts. She's been in communication with Afghan women who fled into exile when the previous government collapsed.

""I've been to the Ministry of Interior Investigations Unit and complained and asked them why they took my phone,"" she says. ""I told them I've done nothing wrong and asked them why did they do that?""

She says she got no answers.

Taliban: 'We do not threaten women'

We were given a rare interview with one of the Taliban's most senior spokesman. Abdul Qahar Balkhi is the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is part of the Taliban delegation in Norway right now - meeting representatives from several Western countries - to discuss how to avert the impending humanitarian disaster unfolding in Afghanistan. We asked him about this week's raids on female demonstrators' homes.

Image: Day labourers wait for work on the streets of Kabul

""Our security do not approach women specifically,"" he reassured us. ""Because this is an Afghan society... we have a lot of respect for women, we do not threaten women... ever.""

When we showed him the video of Tamana pleading for help, he admitted the video was alarming.

""It is, of course distressing,"" he said. ""But the Ministry of Interior absolutely rejected it and called the video fake.""

""How is that fake?"" I asked him. ""If it's fake, where is the young woman?""

""Maybe you can approach the Ministry of Interior and ask them how they came to that conclusion?"" he replied.

Image: There is an impending humanitarian disaster unfolding in Afghanistan

But despite repeated calls to the Ministry of Interior and the Kabul Police Commander, we got no replies.

Abdul Qahar Balkhi went on: ""As for what you rightly pointed out... of terrifying women and children, rousing them from their sleep in the dead of night, it happened for twenty years in Afghanistan... foreign forces would barge into homes, kill women and children, torture them and detain them, take them to Guantanamo and Bagram.""

The country's not only hurting economically but is deeply psychologically scarred too from 20 years of what the Taliban and many others call ""occupation by foreign forces"".

And history is hard to forget, especially when you're in the teeth of an unfolding disaster, which many Afghans believe has been caused and stoked by the international community's actions.

International community refuse to recognise Taliban

The collapse of the previous administration and the chaotic withdrawal of foreign troops after two decades prompted an immediate halting of the bulk of international aid. It led to the freezing of billions of dollars of overseas assets as well as a range of sanctions. It plunged an already fragile economy into virtual meltdown, exacerbating an already critical humanitarian crisis.

And the Taliban say nearly six months on no country has yet officially recognised their government as legitimate and argue they are part of the problem.

Image: We are led up a metal stairway to a small, hidden backroom

""The international community cannot condemn the Afghan people to collective punishment and starvation because they failed in their mission in Afghanistan,"" the Taliban spokesman said.

""That has been our message and from our part if we hadn't taken the measures that we have taken and mitigated the effects of this humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place here in Afghanistan, we would be in a far, far worse place at this moment.""

He went on to stress, in a wide-ranging interview: ""It is the moral obligation of the international community to recognise the government that exists which is a reality. It is not going anywhere anytime soon and this government has shown that it is a responsible actor. The politicising of recognition is only endangering the lives of the common people.""

Norway talks controversial

The Norway talks have been controversial, with many in Afghanistan believing the international community should not bargain with the fighters who seized power. But the humanitarian crisis is critical and only getting worse.

The former prime minister Gordon Brown is one advocating for immediate assistance to the people of Afghanistan. He said on Sky's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: ""If we can't get aid to people, they will die in front of our eyes. This is a humanitarian catastrophe.

Everything you need to know about the Taliban takeover

""I don't forget the sacrifices of our troops and part of the reason we were there was to protect the Afghan people and now we face a nightmare and it's really a moral failure. When children are starving and no health provision, we have a duty to act.""

But others like the first Afghan woman to lead a political party - who spoke to us from exile in Britain - insisted any aid must be contingent on womens' rights.

Fawzia Koofi said: ""This is the best time for the world to think about how can they to pressurise the Taliban.

""Instead of giving them money, they need to pressurise them to listen to a political dialogue... the government needs to be diverse enough.""

Stocks and Bitcoin take fresh hits as cocktail of worries combine to hit markets;Monday 24 January 2022 13:29, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Wholesale gas costs have risen sharply while Bitcoin and stock market values have plunged further as tensions over Russia's intentions concerning Ukraine add to a cocktail of worries being juggled by global investors.

The market volatility builds on heavy sell-offs that saw the US Nasdaq index come under particular pressure last week and endure its worst week of trading since March 2020.

That was largely down to fears of overinflated tech firm values and an accelerated pace of interest rate rises ahead as the Federal Reserve prepares to meet in the face of surging inflation.

The start of the new trading week saw a sell-off in Europe gather pace - building on losses on Friday linked to the US rate and tech rout.

The flight from risk also saw Bitcoin fall more than 6% to below $34,000 for the first time since July last year.

The pound came under pressure too and was six tenths of a cent down on the dollar as the so-called safe haven US currency found support.

The FTSE 100 was 108 points - or 1.4% lower - in early afternoon deals, led by mining and housebuilding stocks.

That built on the losses of 1.2% witnessed on Friday while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 was down by more than 2%.

Percentage falls in France, Germany and Italy on Monday were even sharper, with the MIB in Milan off by more than 2.7%.

Market analysts pointed to a growing influence from the Russia-Ukraine tensions.

It was evident in wholesale gas prices, which rose across Europe on Monday amid no sign that the stand-off was closer to a diplomatic solution.

NATO revealed it was bolstering its air and sea forces in the region while the UK joined the US in pulling out some of their embassy staff from Kyiv.

The UK wholesale gas contract for next day delivery was 13% up on Monday while that for February delivery was 8% higher - though at 207p per therm, it remains well down on the unprecedented highs above 400p witnessed last year.

Those additional costs are, without government intervention, tipped to raise the energy price cap by 50% for UK households from April.

Bjarne Schieldrop, commodities analyst at SEB, told Sky's Ian King Live that Europe was already paying a heavy price for the spat with Russia over Ukraine, as Moscow holds the key to wholesale costs through its 40% share of gas supply to the EU.

Asked whether Russia had been deliberately withholding supplies as a bargaining chip, he said of plunging gas pipeline volumes: ""[The] increasing assumption these days is that this is sort of gaming from the Russian side with respect to Ukraine.""

It is the spectre of inflation that has harmed market sentiment - particularly in the US where the central bank's crisis era of support is being wound down.

All the major US indices have been tumbling from record highs this year as the pace of price increases threaten to dampen both consumer and corporate demand.

AJ Bell's investment director, Russ Mould, wrote: ""The Federal Reserve is meeting on Wednesday amid expectations of a first interest rate hike in March and more increases to come this year than had previously been pencilled in.

""This has been signalled by a rise in bond yields. The hardening of monetary policy has negative implications for the valuations of tech stocks and they have seen big slumps in recent weeks.

""Perhaps Apple, Microsoft and Tesla can come to the rescue with some knockout numbers when they report this week. On the other hand, a series of disappointing updates from these technology titans would only undermine sentiment further.

""The shifting market landscape is further complicated by the increasingly noisy sabre rattling by Russia on the Ukrainian border.

""Escalation to a full armed conflict is likely to prompt market volatility and potentially a further surge in energy prices - only adding to the current inflationary pressures.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124130522/https://news.sky.com/story/stocks-and-bitcoin-take-fresh-hits-as-cocktail-of-worries-combine-to-hit-markets-12524238;Category-2: business and economy
Julian Assange granted permission to seek appeal against extradition to US;Monday 24 January 2022 12:59, UK;[];[];"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has won the first stage of his Supreme Court bid to appeal against the decision to extradite him to the United States.

The 50-year-old is wanted in America over the leak of thousands of top secret documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In December 2021, US authorities won their High Court challenge to overturn an earlier ruling that Assange should not be extradited due to a real and ""oppressive"" risk of suicide.

His fiancee, Stella Morris, called the decision ""dangerous and misguided"" at the time and said Assange's lawyers intended to bring an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Speaking after today's decision, Ms Morris said outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London: ""What happened in court today is precisely what we wanted to happen... the Supreme Court has good grounds to hear this appeal.""

She added: ""Julian continues to suffer - for almost three years, he's been in Belmarsh prison, and he is suffering profoundly day after day, week after week, year after year.

""Julian has to be freed and we hope that this will soon end.

""But we are far from achieving justice in this case because Julian has been incarcerated for so long and he should not have spent a single day in prison.""

Ms Morris continued: ""Our fight goes on. We will fight this until Julian is free.""

Image: Stella Morris said she will continue to fight for Assange to be freed

If he had not won the right to seek an appeal, Assange's case would have gone directly to Home Secretary Priti Patel for a final decision on whether he should be sent to the US.

But his legal team has secured the right to seek appeal at the Supreme Court based on a point of law that is of ""general public importance"".

Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, for Assange, previously said the case raised ""serious and important"" legal issues, including over a ""reliance"" on assurances given by the US about the prison conditions he would face if extradited.

On Monday, two senior judges ruled there was a point of law, but denied him permission for the appeal.

However, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, sitting with Lord Justice Holroyde, said Assange could go to the Supreme Court itself and ask to bring the appeal.

""Whether or not the issue needs ventilation in that court is a matter appropriately for its decision,"" Lord Burnett said.

Image: Supporters of Assange outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London today

Lord Burnett asked the Supreme Court to ""take steps to expedite consideration"" of any application for an appeal.

Assange's lawyers now have 14 days to make the application to the Supreme Court.

In her January 2021 ruling blocking the extradition, then-district judge Vanessa Baraitser found in favour of the US on all issues except Assange's mental health.

Assange has previously indicated that he wants to challenge the original judge's other findings at a later date.

Image: Julian Assange, pictured in January 2020, is being held in Belmarsh prison in London

Overturning the block on the extradition in December last year, the senior judges found that the judge who originally stopped the extradition had based her decision on the risk of Assange being held in highly restrictive prison conditions if extradited.

However, the US authorities later gave assurances that Assange would not face those strictest measures either pre-trial or post-conviction unless he committed an act in the future that required them.

Lord Burnett previously said that if the original judge had been given those assurances at the time of her ruling, ""she would have answered the relevant question differently"".

In Monday's pronouncement, Lord Burnett said the point of law was about the circumstances in which an appeal court can be given assurances by a country that were not given at the original extradition.

He added that ""although the law in this jurisdiction has long been settled it does not appear that the Supreme Court has considered the question.

""Assurances are at the heart of many extradition proceedings"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124130522/https://news.sky.com/story/julian-assange-granted-permission-to-seek-extradition-appeal-at-supreme-court-12524225;Category-6: science and technology
British rower with incurable cancer sets new world record with two friends for Atlantic crossing;Monday 24 January 2022 11:31, UK;[];[];"Three British women, one of whom has incurable cervical cancer, have shattered the world record for rowing across the Atlantic.

Kat Cordiner and teammates Abby Johnston and Charlotte Irving arrived in Antigua on Sunday evening.

The women completed the 3,000-mile crossing from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to English Harbour in the Caribbean in 42 days, seven hours and 17 minutes, knocking seven days off the female trio record in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.

Image: The women named their boat Dolly Parton

The women were given an emotional dockside welcome by family and friends who had flown out to celebrate with them.

As they stepped onto land for the first time since 12 December, they said they felt ""wobbly, overwhelmed and happy"".

It is thought Ms Cordiner is the first person to tackle this challenge as a cancer patient.

The women are raising money for Cancer Research UK, Macmillan Cancer Support and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.

Ms Cordiner, 42, Ms Irving, 31, and Ms Johnston, 32, were on a 25ft boat - called Dolly Parton - rowing two hours on and two hours off continuously and unsupported.

When they set off, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, sent them a hand-written good luck message wishing them ""fair winds and following seas"".

During their trip they had to contend with scorching heat, huge waves, sleep deprivation, blisters and callouses on their hands, and sharks.

As they arrived, the waiting crowds were told: ""If you followed their social media, these ladies made rowing the Atlantic look like one big party at Club Dolly Parton with karaoke, Hawaiian shirts, face glitter and glow sticks.""

Image: The women did the race without support boats

Ms Cordiner was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March 2019, completely by chance as she was having her eggs harvested in the hope of having a baby in the future.

She underwent a radical hysterectomy but doctors left her ovaries as she wanted to do another round of egg-freezing. Once her eggs were harvested, she had her ovaries removed.

After the surgery, all seemed well. But in June 2020, she began experiencing stomach pains and knew instantly the cancer was back.

Ms Cordiner worried that going back into treatment would scupper the crew's chances of taking part in the Atlantic Row.

But there was a further blow - despite training through chemotherapy, doctors found a growth on her heart and told her to stop exercising immediately.

Her medical team treated the cancer first and then operated on her heart to remove the tumour.

The 42-year-old is now in remission and only taking drugs to deal with the effects of being plunged into an early menopause.

She said: ""The doctors have told me I don't have decades, I have years, so I really want to make the most of them. I don't want to muck around doing stuff that doesn't matter - I want to do things that are challenging and fun.

""I don't know how long I'll be in remission. A lot of people think cancer/chemo/death. But today the drugs are so much better - you can live your life with cancer. People live for years on treatment.""

'Death threats are a way of life': Gypsies and Irish Travellers and Muslims 'least-liked' in UK, survey finds;Monday 24 January 2022 09:10, UK;['lisa dowd', '@lisaskynews'];[];"Gypsies and Irish Travellers are the ""least-liked"" people in the UK, with nearly half of people feeling ""negative"" towards them, according to a new report.

The statistics revealed by the University of Birmingham also found that Muslims are the second ""least-liked"" community.

Report author, Dr Stephen Jones, a lecturer in sociology and religious studies, told Sky News: ""What's interesting is you can see there is, for example, discrimination against black African Caribbean people in the UK, but in surveys people do not express that hostility in the way that they do towards Muslims, in the way that they do towards Gypsies and Irish Travellers.

""So I think there's a certain sense in which that kind of hostility is publicly acceptable, it doesn't get the same kind of pushback that other forms of racism and prejudice receive.

""Quite why that is is a complex question, it's down to our media representation, to our political leadership to various different historical and cultural factors.""

The survey, in conjunction with YouGov, took into account the views of 1,667 people and found that 44.6% viewed Gypsies and Irish Travellers negatively, 25.9% felt negative towards Muslims, 8.5% felt negative towards Jewish people, 6.4% felt negative towards black people and 8.4% felt negative towards white people.

Image: Ms Nasreen and Ms McShane both say their communities are threatened with violence

Abiline McShane, a British Romany Gypsy traveller, told Sky News she was not surprised by the findings, and faced prejudice, and worse, on an almost daily basis.

""I can go into a room full of people and feel hatred from that room full of people,"" she said.

The 54-year-old said there had been a recent ""drive- by"" at one of the West Midlands traveller sites where ""someone just shot into the site, so you imagine people in my community don't sleep very well"".

She added: ""You tend to find things like 'oh let's blow them up in their caravans or let's blow up their gas bottles while they're inside' - death threats to us is like a way of life.""

Shazia Nasreen, a healthcare assistant in Walsall, said she was targeted, as a Muslim, for wearing a headscarf, and had had stones thrown at her.

""They think I've come in as a migrant even though I was born in this country… I get questioned - 'Are you allowed to work? Does your husband allow you to work? Are you allowed out the house?' This is in this day and age.""

Image: Dr Stephen Jones, a lecturer in sociology and religious studies, authored the report

Dr Jones said he found that much of the hostility was coming from the upper and middle classes.

""When one looks at upper and middle class social groups in the UK they are quite effective at not expressing their prejudices openly, as you might say,"" he said.

""The political discourse we've heard of so-called red wall voters, the post-Brexit socially conservative anti-immigration voter, that's created a sort of vision where prejudice is seen as to be located within working class groups rather than upper and middle classes.

""What's interesting about Gypsy and Irish Travellers and Muslim groups is that precisely because the prejudice seems to be slightly more acceptable, it seems to be expressed more often amongst upper and middle class and more educated groups too.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124130522/https://news.sky.com/story/death-threats-are-a-way-of-life-gypsies-and-irish-travellers-and-muslims-least-liked-in-uk-survey-finds-12524098;Category-1: politics
Peloton: Another TV character falls victim to the exercise bike, but defiantly says 'I'm not going out like Mr Big';Monday 24 January 2022 13:05, UK;[];[];"Another TV character has suffered a heart attack at the hands of a Peloton bike - despite the exercise company not giving permission for it to be used.

There are spoilers for Showtime/Sky show Billions in this story!

The popular online exercise bike was used by Mike Wagner (played by David Costabile) during the premiere of the latest season of Sky and Showtime's Billions.

However, this time the character survives - unlike Sex And The City's Mr Big (played by Chris Noth), who died after using it in the show's reboot.

As a nod to the fate of the Sex And The City character, Mike Wagner says ""I'm not going out like Mr Big"" when he returns to the office - a line reportedly added in during post-production.

After the show went out in the US, Peloton was quick to reiterate it did not give permission for their brand to be used.

A spokesperson told Sky News: ""We get why these fictional TV shows would want to include a brand that people love to talk about, but Showtime's use of Peloton's Bike+ and reference to a Peloton Instructor was not a brand, product, or instructor placement, and we did not agree for our brand and IP to be used on this show or provide any equipment.

""As referenced by the show itself, there are strong benefits of cardio-vascular exercise to help people lead long, happy lives.""

Not all publicity is good for the brand though, with shares plummeting by 11% after Mr Big died while using the bike last month.

It attempted to resurrect its financial fortunes by including Chris Noth in a hastily produced advert for its bikes - a move which backfired after he was accused of sexual assault.

The firm's share price further dropped last week, after a report was leaked that suggested it would be halting production due to a slowdown in demand - something denied by Peloton's CEO.

Unbeknown to Laura Spears, an email notifying her that she had won a lottery prize of $3m (£2.5m) had been sent to her spam folder.

The 55-year-old - from Oakland County in Michigan - bought a Mega Millions ticket on the Michigan Lottery website for a draw on 31 December last year.

She matched five numbers to win $1m (£740,000) and managed to multiply her prize by three because she had paid for a ""Megaplier"".

Ms Spears explained: ""I saw an ad on Facebook that the Mega Millions jackpot was getting pretty high, so I got on my account and bought a ticket.

""A few days later, I was looking for a missing email from someone, so I checked the spam folder in my email account.

""That's when I saw an email from the lottery saying I had won a prize. I couldn't believe what I was reading, so I logged in to my lottery account to confirm the message in the email.

""It's all still so shocking to me that I really won $3m.""

She claimed her winnings at the lottery headquarters last week, saying she plans to share the money with her family and retire early.

Ms Spears said she would make sure to check her spam folder more often.

Treasury minister Lord Agnew resigns over government's 'lamentable' record on tackling COVID business loan fraud;Monday 24 January 2022 17:38, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];[];"A minister has resigned at the despatch box after criticising the government's record on tackling fraud in the coronavirus business schemes.

Lord Agnew, who was both a Treasury and Cabinet Office minister, dramatically quit his role in Boris Johnson's government in the House of Lords on Monday afternoon, saying the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had shown a ""lamentable"" oversight of COVID loan schemes which has resulted in large amounts of fraud being committed.

The peer told the chamber that the Treasury ""appears to have no knowledge or little interest in the consequences of fraud to our economy or our society"", adding that a mix of ""arrogance, indolence and ignorance freezes the government machine"".

Image: Lord Agnew walked out of the House of Lords chamber after resigning from his post

Lord Agnew, who has served as a minister since February 2020, added that his remarks and resignation is ""not an attack on the prime minister"".

More than £47bn was given to small businesses under the government's largest coronavirus scheme - the bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) - which had the aim of saving companies at risk during the pandemic.

The National Audit Office has estimated that as much as £5bn of this could have been fraudulently claimed.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We are grateful to Lord Agnew for his significant contribution he has made to government.""

Chancellor Rishi Sunak tweeted: ""Lord Agnew has served the Treasury with diligence and commitment. I want to thank him for his dedicated service and tireless work during the pandemic.""

Prior to announcing his resignation, Lord Agnew was updating peers about the £4.3 billion of COVID loans - written off by the Treasury - which Labour said has gone to ""fraudsters"".

The former minister said government oversight of the various coronavirus business schemes has been ""nothing less than desperately inadequate"" and that ""schoolboy errors were made"".

Image: Lord Agnew said his resignation was not to do with Boris Johnson

""My Lords, you can see is my deeply held conviction that the current state of affairs is not acceptable,"" he told peers.

""Given that I'm the minister for counter fraud, it feels somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I'm incapable of doing it properly, let alone defending our track record.

""It is that is for this reason that I've suddenly decided to tender my resignation as a minister across the Treasury and Cabinet Office with immediate effect.

""I would be grateful if my noble Lord would pass this lead on to the prime minister at his earliest convenience.

""It is worth saying that none of this relates to far more dramatic political events being played out across Westminster. This is not an attack on the prime minister and I'm sorry for the inconvenience it will cause.""

Lord Agnew added: ""Total fraud loss across government is estimated at £29bn a year.

""Of course, not all can be stopped - but a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance freezes the government machine.

""Action taken today will give this government a sporting chance of cutting income tax before a likely May 2024 election. If my removal helps that to happen, it would have been worth it.""

Peer provides high drama by quitting as minister from despatch box Rob Powell Political correspondent @robpowellnews The Lords is not used to high drama. But today Lord Agnew provided that. His critique of the government’s record on tackling pandemic support scheme fraud was methodical, detailed and excoriating. The now former minister handed his resignation note to a colleague and asked them to pass it to the prime minister, closed his file and with a formal “thank you and goodbye”, walked out. That rarely heard sound in the upper chamber – applause – then rang out. But beyond the political drama, the points Lord Agnew made were deeply serious. He accused the Treasury of having “no knowledge” or “little interest” in tackling fraud. That is a damaging accusation especially for a chancellor that prides himself in his economic response to the pandemic. It also comes a week after confirmation that £4.3bn of COVID payments had been written off because of fraud. Lord Agnew said the impact of this will be felt by us all and there is a “penny of income tax waiting to be claimed if we just woke up”. He was clear his words were not designed to wound Boris Johnson. Indeed at times his critique seemed to echo words we’ve heard from the former Number 10 advisor Dominic Cummings about the inability of the state to deliver for the public. “Any prime minister should be able to reasonably expect that the levers of government were actually connected to delivering services for our citizens”, he told peers. Apt words indeed at a time when the government appears to be stuck in a scandal-induced stasis.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Lord Agnew's resignation is ""a damning indictment of the chancellor and the government's failures on fraud"".

""That the government's own anti-fraud minister feels he is unable to defend the government's record on billions of pounds of taxpayer cash gifted to criminals tells you all you need to know about the incompetence of this government,"" Ms Reeves said in a statement.

""It should be a source of enduring shame to the chancellor that he has so casually written off £4.3bn of taxpayers' money that is now in the hand of criminals and gangs.

""Coming on top of billions spent on crony contracts and billions more lost in loan fraud schemes, these levels of waste destroy any claim the Conservatives have to careful stewardship of the public finances. Labour would treat every pound of taxpayer money with the respect it deserves.""

Lord Agnew's resignation over this Government's failure is more integrity than Boris Johnson can manage.



It is no surprise that a Minister feels unable to defend the waste of billions of taxpayer pounds on crony contracts and fraud.



""Arrogance, indolance and ignorance"" indeed. — Angela Rayner (@AngelaRayner) January 24, 2022

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner added: ""It is no surprise that a minister feels unable to defend the waste of billions of taxpayer pounds on crony contracts and fraud. 'Arrogance, indolence and ignorance' indeed.""

After concluding his resignation speech, Lord Agnew exited the chamber to applause from some peers.

Number 10 insisted to reporters the government had been clear fraud was ""unacceptable"" following Lord Agnew's resignation.

The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""On the wider issues that he's raised, we introduced our unprecedented COVID support schemes at speed to protect jobs and livelihoods, helping millions of people across the UK, including nearly £12m on the furlough scheme alone.

Image: Number 10 said the government has made clear fraud related to the coronavirus business schemes is 'unacceptable'

""We've always been clear fraud is unacceptable and are taking action against those abusing the system, with 150,000 ineligible claims blocked, £500 million recovered last year and the HMRC tax protection taskforce is expected to recover an additional £1 billion of taxpayers' money.""

It is not the first time a minister has resigned at the despatch box in the House of Lords.

Back in 2018, Lord Bates stunned peers when he announced he would quit as he was ""ashamed"" for failing to turn up on time in the upper chamber.

However, the international development minister's offer of resignation was rejected by the then prime minister Theresa May. He subsequently left the government the following year.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124190310/http://news.sky.com/story/treasury-minister-lord-agnew-resigns-over-governments-lamentable-record-on-tackling-covid-business-loan-fraud-12524460;Category-2: business and economy
COVID travel restrictions are being scrapped - all the changes announced by transport secretary;Monday 24 January 2022 16:52, UK;[];[];"The COVID travel restrictions imposed by the government are being scrapped.

The transport secretary has outlined a range of measures aimed at making travel more open and user-friendly.

""Britain is open for business,"" Grant Shapps told the Commons.

He said the government intends to move away from ""blanket border measures"" to a ""more sophisticated and targeted global surveillance system"".

This is what changes.

Fully vaccinated

Starting at 4am on 11 February, there will be no requirement for vaccinated passengers arriving in England to do post-arrival lateral flow tests, said Grant Shapps.

The ""fully vaccinated"" definition still means two doses - people don't need a booster yet.

Starting at the same time, vaccine certificates from 16 new countries including China and Mexico will be accepted at the UK border - meaning more than 180 countries and territories will have their vaccine certificates accepted in the UK.

Not fully vaccinated

Passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer need to isolate or complete a day eight test after they arrive.

They will still need to fill out a passenger location form ""to demonstrate proof of a negative COVID test taken two days before they travel and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test"", Mr Shapps said.

Passenger locator form

The passenger locator forms will be made ""easier and quicker"" from the end of February - and people will get an extra day to complete them before they travel

Surging inflation pushes cost of servicing govt debt to December record of £8.1bn;Tuesday 25 January 2022 07:39, UK;[];[];"Interest payments on government debt hit a record £8.1bn for the month of December because of surging inflation, according to official figures.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the cost of servicing the country's £2trn+ debt pile was almost 200%, or £5.4bn, up on December 2020.

It is because half a trillion pounds worth of government bonds are linked to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation which stood at 8.4% in December - its highest level since 1991.

In December, the RPI uplift on index-linked gilts was calculated at £5.5bn.

""The recent high levels of debt interest payments are largely a result of movements in the RPI to which index-linked gilts are pegged"", the report said.

The additional cost is a burden the chancellor could well do without as the government remains under pressure on many fronts, with a planned National Insurance tax hike in April to fund social care facing a growing Tory backlash as household and corporate bills grow in the face of the inflation problem.

The main consumer prices index is already at its highest for almost 30 years and tipped to shoot up further when an adjustment to the energy price cap is made that could, according to industry experts, see average bills hit £2,000 annually without government intervention.

Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday: ""We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our Plan for Jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs.

""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments.

""Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK.""

The wider ONS figures showed that the government borrowed less than economists had expected last month.

Public sector net borrowing, excluding the effects of bank bailouts during the financial crisis, totalled £16.8bn.

It took the amount from April to December to £146.8bn - £129bn less than at the same point in the 2020/21 financial year when the COVID-19 crisis demanded an unprecedented rise in peacetime spending to support the economy and health services.

The ONS said the year-to-date total included a £6bn downward revision to borrowing up until November.

Corporate tax revenues hit £5.5bn in December - a record at current prices - and largely explained by large companies paying their tax bills quarterly.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125073413/https://news.sky.com/story/surging-inflation-pushes-cost-of-servicing-govt-debt-to-december-record-of-8-1bn-12524749;Category-2: business and economy

Royal Mail to cut 700 jobs after Christmas deliveries hit by Omicron disruption;Tuesday 25 January 2022 09:05, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Royal Mail has announced plans to cut 700 managerial jobs in a bid to cut costs after a tough Christmas season disrupted by the Omicron variant.

The company said it was engaging with its unions on the proposal which, it added, would hopefully be achieved through ""natural turnover, redeployment and voluntary redundancy"".

The cuts come on top of 2,000 job losses announced as the COVID pandemic gathered pace in 2020 - a time when demand for its services surged, thanks largely to online orders during lockdowns.

Royal Mail, which has a chequered history in terms of cordial union relations, said the move would ""further simplify and streamline our operational structures to ensure an improved focus on local performance, and devolve more accountability and flexibility to frontline operational managers"".

It expected that the cuts would result in £40m of savings annually.

Royal Mail made the announcement while revealing that its UK business now expected to deliver adjusted operating profit of about £430m in its current financial year from an earlier forecast of £500m.

It blamed a restructuring charge of £70m.

The company said it delivered a ""solid performance"" over the key Christmas season despite the challenges posed by staff COVID absence rates.

Royal Mail reported a 2.4% drop in revenue for the three months to December after a slower-than-expected rise in parcel volumes around Black Friday.

It said that revenue was still up 17% on 2019 levels. Shares were up by 3.5% at the market open.

Chief executive Simon Thompson told investors: ""With the rise of Omicron, absence has been around twice pre-COVID levels, with about 15,000 staff off sick or isolating in early January.

""Thankfully, this is now improving. We are resolutely focused on addressing these issues which have affected our service in some parts of the country.

""Year to date we have spent more than £340m on overtime, additional temporary staffing and sick pay, as well as providing targeted support for the offices most impacted.

""We have taken steps to maintain as comprehensive a service as possible, whilst keeping our people and customers safe. I'd like to thank all our people who have worked incredibly hard, as they have done throughout the pandemic.

""I would also thank customers for their patience in those areas where we have faced operational challenges and increased absence as we focus on restoring our usual levels of service everywhere.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125110825/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-mail-to-cut-700-jobs-after-christmas-deliveries-hit-by-omicron-disruption-12524776;Category-2: business and economy
Marmite maker Unilever cutting 1,500 jobs as part of massive shake-up;Tuesday 25 January 2022 09:49, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"Consumer goods giant Unilever has confirmed plans to cut 1,500 jobs under a shake-up of its global operations.

The maker of Dove soap-to-Marmite, which made the announcement after details were apparently leaked on Monday evening, said the cuts to senior and junior management roles were the result of a new, simpler organisational structure.

The company said it would now consist of five distinct divisions: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream.

The UK-based firm, which employs 149,000 worldwide - 6,000 of them in the UK and Ireland - was yet to confirm where the most job losses would be made but it said that factory operations were to be spared.

It also emerged on Monday that activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners had reportedly built a significant stake in the company amid the bid process last week that saw Unilever's stock crumple.

Values only recovered when Unilever confirmed there would be no further offer beyond the £50bn that had been rejected by GSK on value grounds.

Anthony Bailey began a crime spree on 20 June last year, first breaking into a security box at a car repair garage in Lewes, Sussex.

The 37-year-old stole a Skoda Citigo that he crashed in Essex the following day, leaving the scene before police could arrive.

On 14 August, he then broke into a house in Fenstanton - taking a Ford Kuga and two bank cards, one of which was used at a local petrol station.

He abandoned the vehicle a few streets away but was linked to the scene by a single cigarette butt left in the footwell of the car.

Forensic analysis linked him to the theft of the Skoda, as the same DNA was found on the airbag of the crashed vehicle.

PC Andy Smith said: ""This case highlights the importance of forensics and our scenes of crime officers.

""Bailey probably thought he had got away with these crimes but he was linked to the crime by the cigarette butt and thankfully has now been brought to justice.""

IMF takes axe to global growth forecasts as Omicron and inflation hit recovery;Tuesday 25 January 2022 14:18, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has taken an axe to its global growth forecasts while listing a string of threats to the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

The world's lender of last resort downgraded a prediction, made in October, for 4.9% growth in collective gross domestic product this year, saying it now expected a figure of 4.4%.

That was down from the 5.9% estimated during 2021 as economies fought back from the worst of the massive downturn during 2020.

It said the reduction in its updated 2022 forecast was largely led by the world's two largest economies - the United States and China.

But the IMF's World Economic Outlook also cut its expectations for most advanced and emerging economies, including the UK.

The IMF cited disruption brought by restrictions to stop the Omicron COVID variant and inflation - caused by surging energy prices and supply chain woes that have seen shipping volumes overwhelmed and worker shortages.

""In the United Kingdom, disruptions related to Omicron and supply constraints (particularly in labour and energy markets) mean that (2022) growth is revised down by 0.3 percentage point to 4.7%,"" the report said.

Of the advanced economies, only Spain is expected to outperform the UK this year in terms of growth.

The IMF said: ""The global economy is entering 2022 in a weaker position than anticipated.

""News of the Omicron variant led to increased mobility restrictions and financial market volatility at the end of 2021.

""Supply disruptions have continued to weigh on activity. Meanwhile, inflation has been higher and more broad-based than anticipated.""

The IMF forecast said shutdowns of Chinese cities to control Omicron and financial stress in its property market meant it was shaving 0.8% off its earlier projections for the world's second-largest economy.

Image: Residents of Beijing are given COVID tests as the authorities look to limit the spread of the Omicron variant

It now expected growth of just 4.9% for 2022 as a result.

The new forecast saw a projection of 4% for the United States - a decline of 1.2% on October's forecast.

Inflation has since hit a 40-year high of 7% in the US and is tipped by financial markets to force the US Federal Reserve into four interest rate rises this year.

The IMF warned of a knock-on effect in the event of US rate increases.

The report said: ""Less accommodative monetary policy in the United States is expected to prompt tighter global financial conditions, putting pressure on emerging market and developing economy currencies.

""Higher interest rates will also make borrowing more expensive worldwide, straining public finances.""

It said risks to its latest forecasts were tilted to the downside amid uncertainty over Omicron and the potential for new variants.

The report also cited risks from climate change, a resurgence in protests against virus restrictions and rising prices.

Growing geopolitical tensions, including in eastern Europe where Western powers fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine, were listed too.

Sandwich-maker Greencore to feel investor heat over pandemic pay awards;Tuesday 25 January 2022 14:38, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];"Greencore, the London-listed sandwich-maker, is facing a big investor revolt this week after paying its top executives lavish bonuses despite not repaying millions of pounds of taxpayer support.

Sky News understands that Greencore, which produces 645 million food-to-go items every year, will become the latest blue-chip business to be embarrassed by a large-scale backlash over boardroom pay during the pandemic when it holds its annual meeting on Thursday.

Shareholders' anger, which has been fuelled by recommendations from proxy advisers, stems from the decision to award chief executive Patrick Coveney a bonus of more than €600,000, even after the company cancelled its dividend and tapped investors for additional funding.

Mr Coveney's bonus will lapse when he leaves Greencore to become chief executive of SSP Group, the transport catering provider.

A significant protest vote will come just days after WH Smith only narrowly carried a motion in favour of its bosses' pay packages in the wake of its decision not to repay government money received during the COVID-19 crisis.

City unrest over big rewards is expected to be more sharply in focus this year because of the cost-of-living squeeze facing British households during the coming months as inflationary pressures bite.

A Greencore spokesman said the pandemic had had ""a significant and prolonged impact on the profitability of our business"".

""We are hugely grateful for the liquidity support that we have received from our investors, and for the UK government's furlough scheme which helped us navigate our way through this challenging period with minimal redundancies.""

He said that while no bonuses had been paid for 2020, it was considered ""appropriate"" to pay executive bonuses last year.

""At the time of vesting, a review will be conducted to ensure that any vesting is appropriate in light of the performance of the business between now and [2024],"" the spokesman added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125160713/http://news.sky.com/story/sandwich-maker-greencore-to-feel-investor-heat-over-pandemic-pay-awards-12525123;Category-2: business and economy
'Superhuman evacuation effort' to save thousands trapped in cars as snow hits Turkey and Greece;Tuesday 25 January 2022 11:44, UK;[];[];"Flights have been suspended at Istanbul Airport after a massive snowstorm brought parts of the Eastern Mediterranean to a standstill - with thousands of people rescued in a ""superhuman evacuation effort"" after becoming stranded in their cars in Greece.

Rescue crews have been clearing major throughways in and around the Turkish city after the storm, named Elpida, blanketed the city of 16 million people with 78cm (31in) of snow in some areas.

Stranded motorists either spent the night in cars, abandoned their vehicles to walk home, or crowded metro trains and public transport. A lucky few were rescued and taken to hotels.

""Nothing is moving. The snow ploughs can't even reach us,"" Ahmet Odabasi, 40, one of thousands of travellers stranded overnight on a road west of Istanbul said.

""I have been stuck here for 12 hours now. I am lucky that I have gas, food and water,"" said the motorist, who was driving to Istanbul from the city of Edirne near the border with Greece.

The city's Disaster Coordination Centre, or AKOM, says an Icelandic low-pressure system is behind the cold front and precipitation affecting most of the country.

Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said more heavy snowfall was likely in the city on Tuesday evening, and flurries are expected in the Eastern Mediterranean region through to Wednesday.

On Monday, authorities in Istanbul suspended intercity bus services and blocked travel to the city from Turkey's northwestern Thrace region.

The Istanbul governor's office announced that civil servants would be allowed to stay at home on Tuesday, except for those employed in security, health and transportation sectors.

Schools across Turkey are already closed for a winter break.

Mr Imamoglu said the municipality has provided shelter to about 1,500 homeless people. Another 1,500 people stranded at a bus terminal due to the suspension of intercity services were taken to hotels or hostels.

Teams have left some two tonnes of food for stray cats and dogs, Mr Imamoglu said.

In neighbouring Greece, rescue crews, including the army, worked through the night to evacuate thousands of people stranded in their cars on an Athens motorway.

More than 3,500 people had been evacuated by early Tuesday, some abandoning their cars on foot, but about 1,200 cars remained stuck on the Attiki Odos, the capital's main ring road, government spokesperson Giannis Oikonomou said.

As temperatures fell overnight, soldiers handed out food, water and blankets to drivers, some of whom were stranded in their cars for more than 10 hours.

""We had a very difficult night and a superhuman evacuation effort is underway on Attiki Odos,"" Mr Oikonomou told Greek television.

""We are still in a very difficult phase, as the forecasts indicate that we will face (weather) difficulties again in a while,"" he said.

Most public transport has been put out of action in the city by the snowfall.

Authorities declared a public holiday on Tuesday, shutting public offices and private businesses except supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations in the greater Athens area and on some islands.

Parts of Athens were hit by power cuts, and the grid operator said crews were working to restore electricity.

Fifteen passengers were injured when a rail transport vehicle tried to pull a train carrying about 200 passengers which had halted in heavy snow in central Greece.

Climate change threatening 22,500 UK ancient sites and buried treasures as peat bogs dry out, warn experts;Tuesday 25 January 2022 11:59, UK;[];[];"About 22,500 sites of archaeological significance in the UK are under threat from climate change, British experts have warned.

As changing weather patterns continue to dry out peatlands, the buried artefacts they contain could be destroyed.

Due to peat soil containing very little oxygen, organic materials like wood, leather, textiles and even, in some cases, human flesh do not rot.

This means items from centuries ago can still be unearthed.

One of the most famous such finds was that of Lindow Man, a preserved body of a man believed to be from the Iron Age that was discovered in a peat bog in Cheshire in 1984 by professional peat cutters.

Dr Andrew Birley, director of the Vindolanda Trust and the chief archaeologist at Magna, a Roman fort alongside Hadrian's Wall, said the ""desiccation"" from climate change had already begun at the site.

He said: ""We knew that Magna had the potential to be a remarkable archaeological time capsule, and that the landscape was changing, but the geoarchaeological survey work has proved beyond doubt that Magna has some of if not the richest environmental deposits thus far identified from the World Heritage Site.

""The continuing monitoring at Magna will provide the data we need to understand the extent to which climate change, heavy rainfall, heatwaves and drought events, are having an impact on this precious resource.""

Fellow archaeologist Dr Gillian Taylor added: ""The impact of climate change upon archaeological sites requires urgent attention to prevent the loss and destruction of our World Heritage Sites.

""Understanding the impact of current climatic conditions upon sites, especially at the molecular level is challenging, but important to ensure development of management strategies to mitigate environmental challenges of the future.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125162904/https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-threatening-22-500-uk-ancient-sites-and-buried-treasures-as-peat-bogs-dry-out-warn-experts-12524757;Category-3: environment
Draco Chapman: Boy, four, died after neck trapped between two stair gates fitted by his mother, inquest told;Tuesday 25 January 2022 21:49, UK;[];[];"A four-year-boy died after his neck became trapped between two stair gates that were fitted one above the other in a door frame by his mother, an inquest has heard.

An injured Draco Chapman was found by an older sister at home in April 2019, then taken to Norwich and Norfolk University Hospital, placed in an induced coma, transferred to another hospital, and died later that month in a hospice.

The child's head had become stuck in a six-inch gap between the stair gates leading to the living room in the Norwich property as he tried to climb over, Norfolk Coroner's Court was told.

His mother Rachel Chapman said she had put the stair gates on top of one another to keep her children safe and to stop them climbing over the lower one and on to the stairs.

Draco suffered neurotic asphyxiation from accidental hanging, and a cardiac respiratory arrest, according to a medic.

Image: Draco was treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital

Dr Roddy O'Donnell, clinical director of the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge - the second medical facility where he was treated - said: ""It was clear he had suffered serious and irreversible neurological injury.""

The court was told that before his death, Draco had been diagnosed with a heart murmur and Noonan syndrome, a condition which can cause heart defects and developmental delays.

Boy's mother was at a parents' evening

Draco, who was one of six children, all of whom lived with his mother, was being looked after by an older sibling at the time of the incident while she was at a parents' evening on 2 April 2019.

Sergeant Graham Green, of Norfolk Constabulary, told the court that after Draco was found injured he was taken upstairs by an older brother who carried out CPR on him and called the emergency services before his mother arrived home.

Mrs Chapman said in a statement: ""I returned home and expected it to be normal. My oldest child was on the phone to the ambulance screaming that he (Draco) had stopped breathing. I went upstairs to do CPR and the ambulance staff arrived and took over.""

She said she had fitted the stair gates on top of one another to stop the children climbing over the bottom one.

'The two stair gates were to keep children safe in the lounge'

She said: ""I was pregnant and agreed with the health visitor that I needed help and she made a referral to social services.

""I struggled but knew I needed help. My oldest would help with the children but I had to accept it had got out of hand.

""On 2 April, I fitted the second stair gate to stop them (the children) from getting out of the lounge and on to the stairs. I thought it would act as a door and keep them safe in the lounge.

""The bottom one didn't work as Draco used to climb over it.""

Draco died on 23 April 2019 and the court heard that his mother was no longer caring for her other children.

His death was recorded as accidental by the coroner, Johanna Thompson, who said: ""The medical cause of death is catastrophic brain injury and asphyxiation by hanging.

""Draco became trapped by his neck while trying to climb over the lower stair gate and as a consequence of becoming trapped between this and the higher stair gate, this caused him to become asphyxiated and caused cardiac arrest.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125210809/http://news.sky.com/story/draco-chapman-boy-four-died-after-neck-trapped-between-two-stair-gates-fitted-by-his-mother-inquest-told-12525238;Category-7: health

Holidaymakers rush to book breaks after testing rules scrapped in time for half-term;Tuesday 25 January 2022 18:54, UK;[];[];"Holidaymakers have been rushing to book half-term trips after the government said COVID testing for travellers arriving in the UK would be scrapped from next month.

Airline and tour operator Jet2 said it had seen a ""notable increase in demand for holidays and flights"" after the announcement on Monday.

Thomas Cook said bookings were up by about a third on Tuesday on the previous day while weekly bookings this month were about four times higher than the average from last year.

It pointed to particular interest in the February half-term break while noting that for the summer Turkey had become the most popular family holiday destination.

Ryanair said it had seen a ""significant uplift in bookings off the back of yesterday's announcement"".

The changes mean that from 11 February, fully-vaccinated arrivals will no longer have to take a coronavirus test.

For those not double-jabbed, the requirement to self-isolate will be dropped.

Jet2 chief executive Steve Heapy said traditional hot spots such as the Spanish islands, mainland Spain, Portugal and Italy were all proving popular.

Mr Heapy said bookings were already strong before the latest announcement but were now up 30% on last week ""demonstrating just how much of a game-changer the removal of all testing is for fully vaccinated holidaymakers"".

""With international travel starting to look like it did before the pandemic, customers are jumping at the chance to book their flights and holidays,"" he said.

Andrew Flintham, managing director at tour operator Tui UK, said the announcement was ""a huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal"" and had already resulted in an increase in bookings.

""Many families look to go on holiday over the February half-term, so we are delighted these changes will come into effect in time,"" he added.

""Going abroad will finally start to feel more normal again and without the added expense of testing.""

Mr Flintham said he expected bookings for this summer to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye welcomed the easing of restrictions but warned that rules remaining in place in holiday destinations still require travellers to take tests.

He told Sky News: ""We need to get the tests lifted at the other end of the journey, because for most countries you might need to go to you will still need testing before you're allowed into those countries.""

Among the destinations requiring arrivals from the UK to take a COVID-19 test, even if fully vaccinated, are Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, mainland Portugal, Switzerland and the US.

Florida: Search under way for 39 people missing after suspected human smuggling boat capsizes as one survivor found;Tuesday 25 January 2022 22:59, UK;[];[];"A search is under way off the Florida coast after a boat capsized reportedly with 40 people on board in a suspected ""human smuggling"" incident, according to the US coastguard.

The survivor said he and 39 other people had left Bimini in the Bahamas on Saturday night.

He said the boat then capsized in bad weather.

The man also said no one was wearing a life jacket.

Environmental activist tricked into relationship with undercover police officer Mark Kennedy gets £230,000 compensation;Wednesday 26 January 2022 00:23, UK;[];[];"A woman deceived into a relationship with an undercover police officer has been awarded almost £230,000 after a tribunal ruled her human rights had been breached.

Environmental activist Kate Wilson, 41, started a relationship with Mark Stone in 2003 and had a ""whirlwind romance"" for nearly two years before breaking up.

She found out in 2010 he was a married policeman called Mark Kennedy - part of Metropolitan Police's public order intelligence unit - who was undercover to spy on activists.

Kennedy had sexual relationships with up to 10 other women during the operation.

One - with a woman known as ""Lisa"" - went on for six years before she saw his real name in a passport.

Advertisement

An Investigatory Powers Tribunal has now ruled there were human rights breaches and ordered the Met and the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) to pay Ms Wilson £229,471.

The activist also had contact with half a dozen other undercover officers between 1998 and 2010, including some from the Special Demonstration Squad unit.

She argued her right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, her right to privacy and right to freedom of expression had been infringed.

The Met and NPCC accepted her case but denied other officers, apart from Kennedy and his cover officer, knew or suspected there was a sexual relationship.

Helen Ball, the Met's assistant commissioner for professionalism, said there had been ""serious failings"" that meant Kennedy wasn't properly supervised.

""In entering into a sexual relationship, Kennedy's actions went against the training and guidelines undercover officers received at the time,"" she said.

""However, the tribunal found that the training was inadequate and more should have been done to consider the risks of male undercover officers forming relationships with women. We accept these findings.""

The tribunal also said a failure to guard against the risk of undercover officers having sexual relationships amounted to unlawful discrimination against women.

Ms Wilson said in a statement: ""It is important to note the IPT compensation is not about the relationship I was deceived into by Mark Kennedy. That was settled in a civil claim back in 2017.

""It is compensation for the parts of the claim that the police denied right up to the end - how complicit Mark's managers were, and the role of five other undercover officers in violating my political rights, and the fact that they dragged out those denials for 10 years.""

She said the ruling was also recognition that ""spying on the protest movement is political policing and has no place in a democratic society"".

The NPCC said ""significant"" changes to undercover policing had been implemented and that training is now ""significantly more rigorous than that during Mark Kennedy's time, both in duration and content"".

Approval from assistant chief constable rank or equivalent is now needed and the ""independent Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office is informed of and scrutinises undercover deployments"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126034354/https://news.sky.com/story/environmental-activist-tricked-into-relationship-with-undercover-police-officer-mark-kennedy-gets-230-000-compensation-12525549;Category-3: environment
'Bandit country' landlady Sue Gray's 'bring your own booze' party report could call time on the PM;Wednesday 26 January 2022 03:05, UK;['jon craig', '@joncraig'];[];"Is the former pub landlady Sue Gray about to call time on Boris Johnson?

The launch by the prime minister of her long-awaited report has been as chaotic as his much-ridiculed responses to the 'partygate' allegations.

First there was no party, he claimed. Then he was ""sickened"" by the video of his former press Secretary Allegra Stratton mocking the allegations.



Then it was a ""work event"", he said. And then ""nobody told me"" the ""bring your own booze"" party was against lockdown rules.



And now, with Sue Gray's report, at first No. 10 signalled it wouldn't be published in full, then it would be. First it appeared it would be delayed by the police investigation, then it emerged it would be published within days.

Then it would be published on Wednesday, with a statement by the PM immediately after Prime Minister's Questions. Then No. 10 said the PM hadn't seen it, so it wouldn't.

But then Tory MPs were told to expect it on Wednesday after all, but the PM's statement would come later, possibly at 3pm. Or maybe Thursday. Confused?

Behind the scenes bust-ups and Johnson jitters

So why the chaos and confusion? Two reasons: first wrangling behind the scenes between Sue Gray and her team and No. 10 over whether the report should be published in full after all.

After all, the report is potentially career-ending for the Prime Minister. No wonder he and his inner circle had the jitters.

Secondly, there has also been a huge bust-up behind the scenes over the report's presentation to Parliament, with fears that the government wanted to dump it in the Commons library only minutes before the PM stood up to declare he was in the clear.

Read more: Why Met Police's 'partygate' probe may not prevent Sue Gray publishing inquiry in full

What is clear is that the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, wasn't having that and insisted on MPs being given time to read the report before quizzing the PM on its findings.

By all accounts, there was a showdown between Sir Lindsay and Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg that appears to have been won by the Speaker.

It's worth recalling that in the 1980s Sue Gray ran a pub in ""bandit country"" near the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.

Energy boss casts doubt on government deal to prevent 50% price cap hike;Wednesday 26 January 2022 07:18, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];"The chief executive of a major household energy supplier has cast doubt on whether the sector and government will be able to spare households from a huge spike in bills from April.

Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, used a letter to the three million households on its books to explain the options facing companies and ministers to limit increases from surging wholesale gas costs but said: ""Honestly, I don't know if we'll be successful.""

The industry - decimated by the unprecedented rise in raw energy costs since last summer - has predicted that the energy price cap, which has so far shielded bill-payers from the worst, will rise by 50% to an average annual £2,000.

Image: Greg Jackson said there was space for both Treasury support and private funding to help spread the cost over years

Regulator Ofgem will announce the new level households face on 7 February.

The government is widely expected to announce some help to offset the worst in advance of that date - before the hike takes effect on 1 April - but it remains unclear what form that support could take as talks continue.

The cap, which had already risen by 12% in October, has prevented Octopus and its rivals from passing on the cost of wholesale gas to their customers.

It is a key reason why 27 suppliers have collapsed since last August - with Octopus taking on the 580,000 customers of failed Avro Energy last September.

Mr Jackson told customers that he favoured a Treasury-led scheme to help spread the increased cost of energy over several years, adding that private funding could also be used, to spare households from an instant surge in bills.

He said that other options, such as removing VAT and green levies from bills and extending the Warm Home Discount, would not be enough on their own to make a significant difference and just shift the financial burden elsewhere.

""The key thing is this: the cost of the energy we're buying on the global markets to supply our customers is three times higher than it was a year ago,"" he explained.

""At the moment, customers on standard variable tariffs are protected from price rises until the government price cap is updated in April. That means for an average home, we are currently buying energy for about £2,000 and selling it for £1,300.

""However, when the cap is updated, it's likely a typical bill will rise over 75% compared to the same time last year. That's another £60 a month: a huge burden for most homes.""

He added: ""Spreading the cost of this sudden spike over several years will allow us to make the imminent April rise much, much smaller - more like £12 per month - and adjust prices to gradually cover the cost over time.

""And with the benefit of time, the gradual rises are likely to coincide with falling wholesale prices, making the effective increase much smaller, and eventually dropping below current prices.

""We are putting enormous effort in, alongside many others: energy suppliers, Ofgem and the government, to try and ensure there is decisive, collective action that best protects as many households as possible.

""Honestly, I don't know if we'll be successful.

""But if we aren't, it won't be from lack of trying.""
