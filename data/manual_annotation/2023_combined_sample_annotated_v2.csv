4786;4786;Stay for free and book it backwards: nine easy ways to have a cheaper holiday;2023-01-07T11:00:17Z;['N/A'];['Budget travel', 'Europe holidays', 'Airbnb', 'Travel websites', 'Consumer affairs', 'Travel'];;"Cutting back costs and going on holiday don’t exactly go hand in hand. In fact, a trip away is often the first thing on the chopping block when cash is tight – but why are we so loth to let it go? Is it because in the busyness of life, we know just how beneficial a holiday can be? The good news is that getaways don’t need to break the bank, and with some imaginative thinking – and these handy tips – you may be surprised at what you can afford. Book your holiday backwards Forget the destination and start with the accommodation first. Sites like Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com allow you to type in entire countries, and even continents, which leaves you free to use the filters to find exactly what you’re after for the right price. Pay nothing for your accommodation No, it’s not too good to be true – it is possible to stay for free at houses all over the world thanks to home swap holidays (though it’s important to check in advance whether a work visa may be required in the destination country). Whether you’re looking after a pet or simply keeping someone’s plants watered, there are several websites that help match you up with owners who need someone to look after their home while they’re away. Check out TrustedHousesitters, Nomador and HouseCarers – once you’ve paid the annual fee, you can go on as many trips as you like. Experience ‘van life’ for a fiver
Thanks to the growing trend of #vanlife, getting away in a campervan has never been more popular, but when customers only want a one way rental, it leaves companies needing to get the van back to base. This opens up a great opportunity for bargain hunters as rental firms will offer out these return journeys for as little as £5 for an entire trip. Check out Indie Campers, iMoova and Just go. If you’re just looking for a car, DriiveMe has a similar offer with one way rentals starting at just £1.
Explore UK railways with a secret rail pass An undersung travel hero, a Rovers & Rangers ticket offers incredible value if you’re hoping to explore the UK by train. There are more than 100 options based on which networks you want to use and how many days you want to go for, which can be found on National Rail – a typically good deal is the Explore South Wales ticket which grants you four days of unlimited off-peak travel in an eight day period for just £69 for an adult, £45.55 with a railcard and £34.50 for a child. However, you can’t buy them online and will instead need to buy them in person from a train station ticket office or from a conductor on board your chosen network. Given the general lack of awareness of this type of ticket, I’d opt for the former and give yourself a bit of extra time to get this sorted. Explore Europe using the overnight train network Want to holiday in Europe for cheap but don’t fancy flying? Overnight trains are the answer. The most important thing is to get yourself to a train hub where these sleeper trains are ready and waiting to whisk you away as you sleep, from as little as €29.90 (make sure you’re booking months in advance to access these fares). Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam are all good options near the UK and will link you on to Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. What’s more, there are new routes and brand new sleeper trains coming in 2023, so it’s set to be a really exciting time for slow travel. To get started, take a look at Nightjet’s routes and check out Seat61 for more train inspiration, plus detailed guides on what to expect from your chosen journey.
Work for your stay Working a few hours a day in exchange for accommodation isn’t just for gap year students, and it can offer an incredible learning experience for those travelling with children. From learning about new cultures and understanding the importance of team work to simply disconnecting from constant screen time, there’s loads of reasons why this type of holiday can be a fantastic getaway for everyone. Try Workaway and Worldpackers for opportunities including farm work, decorating and even web development. Use data to find the best value destinations There are two things to bear in mind if you’re trying to get the best value from your pound on holiday: how strong sterling is compared to the local currency, and how much things cost when you get there. While there has been a lot of noise about the falling value of the pound in recent months, that isn’t the case everywhere; in Turkey the amount of lira you can exchange for sterling has doubled in the last couple of years. As for day to day costs, use Numbeo which compiles the prices of everything from milk to fast food for more than 11,000 cities across the world. Pack smart With low cost airlines charging up to £36 each way to take a large cabin bag on board, now is the time to streamline your packing. Start by listing all the outfits you intend to wear with one or two hero pieces that can be reworn several times. Then invest in some roll-by-hand vacuum bags to make the most of your space. If you’re heading to self-catered accommodation, use stackable mini cosmetic pots for salt, pepper and sugar and don’t forget some olive oil in a small shampoo bottle. Finally, pack into a backpack, rather than a suitcase – even if you do find one small enough for your airline’s dimensions, you’re giving away much needed inside space to wheels, the handle and even the case itself! Get a free room upgrade Free room upgrades are not just reserved for those celebrating birthdays and milestone anniversaries. It’s worth simply expressing how excited you are to stay at the hotel and asking if you could be considered for an upgrade if they have the availability. Of course, if it is a special occasion you should definitely throw that in there too, but the key is to be kind, complimentary and to never expect anything for free. When it does work out, it’s the best feeling ever. • This article was amended on 11 January 2023. Text was added to clarify that, before travelling abroad, potential housesitters should check whether the destination country may require a work visa.";https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jan/07/nine-easy-ways-to-have-a-cheaper-free-holiday-budget-accommodation;guardian;entertainment & culture;4786
4199;4199;Oceans were the hottest ever recorded in 2022, analysis shows;2023-01-11T08:00:12Z;['Damian Carrington'];['Climate crisis', 'Oceans', 'Environment', 'Extreme weather', 'World news'];;"The world’s oceans were the hottest ever recorded in 2022, demonstrating the profound and pervasive changes that human-caused emissions have made to the planet’s climate. More than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed in the oceans. The records, starting in 1958, show an inexorable rise in ocean temperature, with an acceleration in warming after 1990. Sea surface temperatures are a major influence on the world’s weather. Hotter oceans help supercharge extreme weather, leading to more intense hurricanes and typhoons and more moisture in the air, which brings more intense rains and flooding. Warmer water also expands, pushing up sea levels and endangering coastal cities. The temperature of the oceans is far less affected by natural climate variability than the temperature of the atmosphere, making the oceans an undeniable indicator of global heating.
Last year is expected to be the fourth or fifth hottest recorded for surface air temperatures when the final data is collated. During 2022, we saw the third La Niña event in a row, which is the cooler phase of an irregular climate cycle centred on the Pacific that affects global weather patterns. When El Niño returns, global air temperatures will be boosted even higher. The international team of scientists that produced the new ocean heat analysis concluded: “The Earth’s energy and water cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gases by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system.” Prof John Abraham, at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota and part of the study team, said: “If you want to measure global warming, you want to measure where the warming goes, and over 90% goes into the oceans. “Measuring the oceans is the most accurate way of determining how out of balance our planet is. “We are getting more extreme weather because of the warming oceans and that has tremendous consequences all around the world.” Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, also part of the team, said: “Warmer oceans mean there is more potential for bigger precipitation events, like we’ve seen this past year in Europe, Australia, and currently on the west coast of the US.” He said the analysis showed an ever-deeper layer of warm water on the ocean surface: “This leads to greater and more rapid intensification of hurricanes – something we’ve also seen this past year – since the winds no longer churn up cold sub-surface water that would otherwise dampen intensification.”
Research released on Monday by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed that many extreme weather events in 2022 had been made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, such as the heavy rain that caused devastating floods in Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Reliable ocean temperature measurements stretch back to 1940 but it is likely the oceans are now at their hottest for 1,000 years and heating faster than any time in the last 2,000 years. The analysis, published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used temperature data collected by a range of instruments across the oceans and combined separate analyses by Chinese and US teams to calculate the heat content of the top 2,000 metres, where most of the heating occurs. The oceans absorbed about 10 zettajoules more heat in 2022 than in 2021, equivalent to every person on Earth running 40 hairdryers all day, every day.
The researchers also analysed salinity, which along with temperature determines water density and is a vital driver of ocean circulation. An index of the variability in salinity across the oceans reached a record high in 2022, showing continued amplification of the global hydrological cycle. Another important feature of the oceans is stratification, where the layering of water by density becomes stronger. This restricts the mixing of deeper, cooler and more nutrient-rich waters with surface waters. The long-term trend of increasing stratification continued in 2022, the scientists found, with “important scientific, societal, and ecological consequences”. One consequence, said Abraham, is that less mixing in the ocean means the surface layer absorbs less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increasing global warming. The researchers also said: “There are increasing occurrences of record-shattering heatwaves and droughts in the northern hemisphere, consistent with intensive ocean warming in the mid-latitude Pacific and Atlantic oceans.” The heating of the oceans, and the impacts on extreme weather, will increase until humanity reaches net zero emissions. In October, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the atmospheric concentration of all the main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – had reached record highs. WMO head Prof Petteri Taalas said: “We are heading in the wrong direction.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/11/oceans-were-the-hottest-ever-recorded-in-2022-analysis-shows;guardian;environment;4199
4683;4683;Under the ‘we pay, you entertain’ deal, Harry is now the hardest working royal | Martha Gill;2023-01-08T06:30:40Z;['Martha Gill'];['Prince Harry', 'Monarchy', 'Prince William', 'Catherine, Princess of Wales', 'UK news'];;"It’s as if royal watchers have been fed on scraps all their lives – the breaking of the colour of a pair of tights protocol here, the “body language that suggested tension” there – and the Duke of Sussex has laid before them a banquet. His book Spare, leaked to the press, serves up course after course. Hardly had we digested the first revelation - a necklace-smashing fight between royal brothers - when the next were presented. The boys “begging” their father not to marry Camilla; two tearful bust-ups between duchesses; Charles joking that Harry wasn’t his; Harry’s frostbitten penis at William’s wedding. It was William and Kate, it turns out, who encouraged him to wear that Nazi costume in 2005 – Harry had just been following orders. Then there was the lost virginity in a field to an “older woman” who “treated him like a young stallion”. “I mounted her quickly, she spanked my ass and sent me away,” he wrote. If you thought that after the Oprah interview and “intimate” Netflix series, Harry would be flogging a dead horse – well, you’d at least be partly wrong. Of course, this has been greeted with the usual outrage by people who are patently absolutely loving this stuff. You can’t tell me that royal commentators – people who spend their lives trying to scrape a story out of a choice of dress – aren’t having the time of their lives. Or that anyone isn’t, excepting perhaps William, Kate, Charles and Camilla. The revelations, I’d say, have greatly added to the gaiety of the nation. And is it really true that Harry has caused the monarchy’s “worst crisis in 30 years”, as one front page ran? Has he, as one royal biographer put it, “cruelly undermined” the very tenets of constitutional monarchy? “The more light you shine, the less likely [the monarchy] is likely to survive,” said a former editor of the Sun, who, let’s be clear, once made a good part of his living shining a light on the monarchy. Really? What are the royals for in 2023? An alien arriving on Earth, observing the way we treat, pay for and “consume” them, would see the deal clearly. We keep them for our entertainment. The contract was made particularly stark in 2019, when Harry and Meghan first broke royal protocol and refused to show off Archie as soon he was born. “They can’t have it both ways,” royal biographer Penny Junor said at the time. “[We] are paying nearly £3m for Harry and Meghan’s house, so in terms of public relations it would be a good quid pro quo for the pair to briefly show Archie off.” We pay, you stump up the entertainment. If this is the bargain, Harry is now the hardest working royal out there. What else is a monarchy for these days? It doesn’t “represent” anything modern Britain agrees with. It represents the triumph of birth over talent, for example, in a country that prides itself on being a meritocracy. It represents colonial rule in a Britain that feels rightly uncomfortable about that part of its history. It celebrates first-born boys and fecund women (would the media love Kate as much if she were infertile?) in a country that strives for sexual equality. Perhaps we keep the monarchy for a whiff of history – a sort of comforting nostalgia, drawing us back to the Tudors and Plantagenets. In which case, we should be delighted at Harry’s leaks. What could be more nostalgic than a fight between two “arch-nemesis” princes, or royal wives, or wicked stepmothers, or kings doubting the legitimacy of their sons? What could be more traditional than the business of the royal bedchamber (or field) being a matter of public interest, whispered about in taverns throughout the land? No, Harry’s book has not endangered the monarchy. Nothing ever does – not divorce, not affairs, not the Queen attempting to mourn Diana in private, not Prince Andrew paying £12m to settle a case with a woman who claims he sexually assaulted her when she was 17. As far back as the Ipsos survey goes, which is 1993, a steady 70-ish% of the population has wanted to keep the monarchy. It doesn’t really matter what the royals do.
If anything, the “core” members of the family should be thanking Harry and Meghan. When was the last time you saw a bad headline about William, Kate, Charles or Camilla? Now think back to the bruising senior royals tended to get in the 1990s and early 00s – the decision in 1993, for example, to run the transcript of a conversation between Charles and Camilla in which he fantasised about becoming a tampon. In the 2020s, the media behave more like an outpost of the firm’s PR machine – saving outrage for the “protocol-breaking’ activities of the Sussexes. Under this cover, Kate can wear whatever tights she wants. Walter Bagehot’s famous “daylight upon magic” quotation often overshadows his other thoughts about the monarchy. He also conceived of it as a showpiece for the public: the “nice and pretty events” and “irrelevant facts that speak to men’s bosoms”, leaving government free to get on with serious business. Yes, the true purpose of the royals is public entertainment. Harry should get all our thanks. • Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While forest protection should provide a win-win situation, benefiting both biodiversity and climate, it can too easily become lose-lose, because carbon offsets allow emissions to continue, worsening global heating and threatening not just forests but all natural ecosystems. The problem is that reliable quantification of the “additionality” of nature-based climate mitigation is near-impossible. The answer is that ecosystem protection (and restoration, wherever possible) must become the default, not the add-on. Until that happens, any carbon trading based on natural processes should be limited to the offset of biologically based emissions, excluding those from fossil fuels. Dr Phil Williamson University of East Anglia • Your reporting of the phantom carbon credits scandal is very welcome. But the bigger problem lies with the concept of offsetting itself, whether in the established market in carbon or the quickly emerging market in biodiversity. Such schemes offer a licence, indeed an incentive, to polluters to carry on polluting. Without damage – emissions or ecological vandalism – there is nothing to offset, a situation that would make investors and speculators in these markets very unhappy. As George Monbiot remarked in 2006, this setup is reminiscent of the indulgences scam run by the medieval church.

4384;4384;Spare by Prince Harry review – a flawed attempt to reclaim the narrative;2023-01-10T00:01:30Z;['Charlotte Higgins'];['Autobiography and memoir', 'Prince Harry', 'Books', 'UK news', 'Monarchy', 'King Charles III', 'Culture'];;"The monarchy relies on fiction. It is a constructed reality, in which grown-up people are asked to collude in the notion that a human is more than a human – that he or she contains something approaching the ineffable essence of Britishness. Once, this fiction rested on political and military power, supported by a direct line, it was supposed, to God. Nowadays it relies on the much frailer foundations of habit, the mysteries of Britain’s unwritten constitution, and spectacle: a kind of symbolism without the symbolised. Ceremonials such as the late queen’s funeral are not merely decorative; they are the institution’s means of securing its continuance. The monarchy is theatre, the monarchy is storytelling, the monarchy is illusion. All this explains why royals are so irresistible to writers of fiction, from Alan Bennett to Peter Morgan: they are already halfway to myth. And, it seems, no one cleaves harder to the myths than the royals themselves. There’s a fascinating passage in Prince Harry’s autobiography, Spare, in which he describes his father’s delight in Shakespeare: how he would regularly take his son to Stratford, how he “adored Henry V. He compared himself to Prince Hal.” Harry himself tried Hamlet. “Hmm. Lonely prince, obsessed with dead parent, watches remaining parent fall in love with … parent’s usurper? I slammed it shut.” At Eton, he was cast as Conrade, one of Don John’s comic minions in Much Ado About Nothing. To his surprise, he was rather good. “Being royal, it turned out, wasn’t all that far from being on stage.” Prince Harry portrays himself as no great reader. Studying invited reflection; reflection invited grief; emotions were best avoided. But he does himself an injustice. He is a voracious reader – of the press. For years, it seems, he devoured every syllable published about him, in outlets from the London Review of Books to the Sun to the faecal depths of below-the-line on social-media feeds. His father’s most oft-quoted refrain in the book is “Don’t read it, darling boy”; his therapist, he writes, suggested he was addicted to it. Spare is about the torment of a royal in the age of the smartphone and Instagram; a torment of a different order from even that suffered by his mother, and certainly by Princess Margaret, forbidden from marrying the man she loved by her own sister. (For Harry, Margaret is “Aunt Margo”, a cold-blooded old lady who could “kill a houseplant with one scowl” and once gave him a biro – “Oh. A biro. Wow” – for Christmas.)
The fiction of royalty can be maintained only if its characters are visible, hence its symbiotic but rarely straightforward relationship with the media. Spare contends that portrayals of the royals in sections of the press – aside from having at times involved shocking criminality, outright invention, intolerable harassment and overt racism – have also often depended on a kind of zero-sum game, in which one family member’s spokesperson will attempt to protect their client at the expense of another, trading gossip for favours. Harry, in his role as the expendable “spare”, has often been the victim of this process, he argues. Narrative tropes and archetypes as old as the hills have been invoked in the distortions: the wayward son; the warring brothers. In Meghan’s case, something even more corrosive: the witch-like woman. It is the monarchist press for which Harry reserves special loathing. The Telegraph’s royal correspondent “always made me ill”, he writes; and he cannot bear even to name Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News UK, referring to her anagrammatically as Rehabber Kooks. As for her boss: “I didn’t care for Rupert Murdoch’s politics, which were just to the right of the Taliban’s”. Clueless as Harry may be about the sheer extent of his privilege – early in the book he writes, “It sounds posh and I suppose it was” of childhood meals of fishfingers served under silver domes by footmen – he isn’t remotely a snob, nor, I infer, temperamentally of the right.
A striking passage recounts the prince’s talking to his therapist about Hilary Mantel’s 2013 LRB essay about Kate Middleton. It became notorious, wilfully misread by the tabloids as being anti-Kate, even though it was the monstrosity of the representation of the now Princess of Wales that Mantel was skewering. Harry recalls his disgust at Mantel’s calling the royal family “pandas” – cosseted, fascinating animals kept in a zoo. “If even a celebrated intellectual could dismiss us as animals, what hope for the man or woman on the street?” Still, he half gets what Mantel was driving at. The words “always struck me as both acutely perceptive and uniquely barbarous,” he writes. “We did live in a zoo.” Describing his unpreparedness for having his funding cut in 2020, he writes: “I recognised the absurdity, a man in his mid-30s being cut off by his father … But I’d never asked to be financially dependent on Pa. I’d been forced into this surreal state, this unending Truman Show in which I almost never carried money, never owned a car, never carried a house key, never once ordered anything online, never received a single box from Amazon, almost never travelled on the Underground.” In her essay, Mantel remarked that “Harry doesn’t know which he is, a person or a prince”. Spare is clearly the prince’s attempt to claw back personhood, to claim his own narrative. Of his tabloid persecutors, he writes: “I was royal and in their minds royal was synonymous with non-person. Centuries ago royal men and women were considered divine; now they were insects. What fun, to pluck their wings.” That, of course, is half-remembered Shakespeare: “As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport,” says the blinded Gloucester in Lear. The gods in Harry’s version are neither Olympians nor kings, but paparazzi and reporters – and so the circle has turned. Spare is by turns compassion-inducing, frustrating, oddly compelling and absurd. Harry is myopic as he sits at the centre of his truth, simultaneously loathing and locked into the tropes of tabloid storytelling, the style of which his ghostwritten autobiography echoes. Had he seen more of the golden jubilee year of 2002, he would have observed that his impression that “Britain was intoxicated … Everyone wore some version of the union jack” was quite wrong; swaths of the UK were indifferent, some hostile. His observations about the darkness of the basement flat he once occupied in Kensington Palace, its windows blocked from the light by a neighbour’s 4x4, will seem insulting to those who can’t find a home, or afford to heat one. The logical corollary of the views he now holds would be a personal republicanism, but needless to say that is not the path he takes: “My problem,” he writes, “has never been with the concept of monarchy.” What he shows, though – whether intentionally or not – is that the monarchy makes fools of us all.

2331;2331;Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Smith scrap to save boxing’s troubled reputation;2023-01-20T11:10:35Z;['Donald McRae'];['Boxing', 'Sport'];;"British boxing’s first significant fight of the year, between Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Smith in Manchester on Saturday night, is a superior matchup to the controversial and postponed bout which cast such deep shadows over a troubled sport last October. Three months ago, Eubank Jr was meant to face Conor Benn in a heavily hyped catchweight promotion built on the enmity between their fathers over 30 years ago. Eubank Jr is a middleweight, who has also campaigned relatively successfully at super-middle (168lb), while Benn is a welterweight (147lb). The difference in size meant that the fight should never have been agreed, even at a compromised weight of 157lb, but money always wipes away good sense and intelligent competition in boxing. After the staggering amount of attention generated in the buildup there was, in the end, only disappointment and outrage at the way in which the promoters had tried to press ahead with the fight despite the fact that Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a performance-enhancing drug that can boost testosterone levels in men.
The aftermath has been severely damaging for boxing, especially as it then emerged that Benn had failed an earlier drugs test for clomiphene. Benn, backed by his promoter Eddie Hearn, set about finding “proof” that he was innocent and this week he claimed that “science” had exonerated him and the “evidence doesn’t lie”. Yet it is hard to find anyone, outside of the Benn and Hearn camp, who seriously believes both his test results were contaminated. Against this dismal backdrop, Eubank Jr chose to accept a much more difficult challenge in fighting Smith. While he is still the bigger man, for Smith has fought mostly at super-welterweight, one division lighter than Saturday’s middleweight contest, Eubank Jr knows that his opponent is a tough and seasoned pro who has operated in the paid ranks since 2008. Smith has lost three of his 36 fights but he has been a world champion and also traded punches with the formidable Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez who stopped him in nine rounds in 2016. He makes Benn seem like an untested, and now tainted, prospect in comparison. Eubank Jr, at 33, is a year younger than Smith and he has also fallen short on two occasions – losing to Billy Joe Saunders and George Groves. He has, however, improved under a new trainer in Roy Jones Jr, the great former world champion, and Eubank will step into the ring as a marginal favourite. This still seems to resemble a 50-50 battle – but Eubank Jr believes he will eventually prove too big and too strong for Smith. But it would also not be too much of a surprise if Smith ekes out a narrow victory.
The evenly balanced nature of the bout, with both fighters having limitations at the very highest level, is intensified by the fact that defeat will be a grievous blow for the loser. “At this stage of my career I know I’ve got a lot to lose,” Smith concedes. “My fear is losing to somebody I should never lose to. And I feel I should never lose to Eubank Jr.” An even more urgent statement is made by Eubank Jr: “If I don’t get the victory, my career is in dire, dire straits. It’s in jeopardy. Victory is the most important thing in my life at this moment.” He told me last week that this is a fight for the “purist” and, while it will be only Smith’s second middleweight bout scheduled for 12 rounds, Eubank Jr expects a gruelling scrap. A potentially gripping domestic showdown should be seen by as large an audience as possible in an attempt to clear the acrid taste left by the Benn fiasco. But of course the machinations of boxing mean that, in an attempt to wring more money out of their longsuffering fans, it has become a pay-for-view offering. It might not deserve such status but, unlike the Benn v Eubank Jr scandal or last month’s appalling pay-per-view massacre which saw Tyson Fury bludgeon a hapless Derek Chisora for a third time, this is a genuine contest with plenty of needle. There were depressing scenes at Thursday’s press conference when Smith resorted to a homophobic taunt to try to unsettle Eubank Jr. He apologised afterwards as did Eubank, who wore a rainbow armband for the weigh-in on Friday, for his own barbed response. It can only be hoped that the actual bout will produce all that remains good and decent about boxing – despite the embarrassment, greed and stupidity of recent events. They might not think much about such a lofty goal but Eubank Jr and Smith are fighting for the tarnished reputation of British boxing – as well their own intensely personal ambitions.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/20/chris-eubank-jr-and-liam-smith-scrap-to-save-boxings-troubled-reputation;guardian;business & economy;2331
5241;5241;Hunt confirms cut to ‘unsustainably expensive’ business energy support;2023-01-04T22:31:50Z;['Alex Lawson'];['Energy industry', 'Energy bills', 'Business', 'Jeremy Hunt', 'Industrial policy', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Hospitality industry'];;"Jeremy Hunt has confirmed that he will announce plans to reduce energy support for businesses in the Commons next week, telling industry leaders it was “unsustainably expensive”. The chancellor has told business groups that a package providing support at a “lower level” than current measures would be available to them beyond March, promising to avoid a “cliff edge” in curtailing the subsidy. The government introduced support for “non-domestic” energy customers bills in October, alongside financial help for household gas and electricity bills. The scheme, which cuts the bills for organisations including businesses, hospitals, schools and charities, was due to end in March.
Hunt met business groups on Wednesday to hear their concerns about the cost of energy, which remains high owing to an increase in the cost of wholesale gas over the past 18 months. Business groups including the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), UK Hospitality, the Institute of Directors and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) attended the meeting. The government said that the energy scheme was “one of the most generous in Europe”, but added “no government can permanently shield businesses from this energy price shock”. The cost has been estimated at about £20bn for the six months until the end of March. In a statement after the meeting, government officials said: “Extending the scheme at current levels could cost tens of billions of pounds, with costs potentially doubling or tripling if international energy prices increase further than expected. It is vital that taxpayer’s exposure to volatile international energy prices is reduced. “However, the chancellor also heard the concerns of the business community who are facing high energy prices, and explained that any future support, while at a lower level, would be designed to help them transition to the new higher-price environment and avoid a cliff edge in support.” Under the scheme, the government funds a discount on non-domestic customers’ gas and electricity bills. It covers the cost between a wholesale prices and a “government supported price” of £211 per MW hour for electricity and £75 per MW hour for gas. Hunt will lay out the detail of the reduction in financial support next week. The BBC reports that the government plans to halve the current level but that the scheme will run for a further year until March 2024. Shevaun Haviland, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “More than a third of firms have told us they are finding it difficult to pay their energy bills even when they are in receipt of government support. “Any continued help is welcome, but it is now clear the new plan will be at a lower level than the existing one. That’s unsurprising, given the state of public finances, but this will still have a significant impact on many businesses.” It remains unclear whether the government will follow through on plans to tailor the support by sector or pursue a simpler option to continue to cut all firms’ bills. Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the FSB, said: “Let’s not forget this energy price crisis affects all small businesses, which typically have lower margins and are least able to deal with cost pressures. “That’s why we want to see an extension of the energy support scheme which takes into account the size of the business, rather than focused on specific sectors. This will help restore hope and optimism and grow our economy” The chancellor’s actions mirror his intervention on household energy bills. The former prime minister Liz Truss caused concerns over spending by announcing a two-year plan to cut bills, before Hunt shortened the scheme to 18 months. The Treasury has been handed a boost in recent days by falling wholesale gas prices, which raised hopes that efforts to cut energy bills may not prove as costly as first feared. Separately a BCC survey of more than 5,600 firms showed that business confidence and sales have stabilised at low levels, while inflation remains the biggest factor of concern. The study indicated that, while the change in administrations from Truss to Rishi Sunak stabilised financial markets, measures announced in Hunt’s autumn statement in November appear to have had “no impact” on business confidence.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/04/unsustainably-expensive-business-energy-help-to-reduce-hunt-confirms;guardian;business & economy;5241
8537;8537;Jeremy Hunt confirms HS2 will reach central London after reports it might stop in suburbs;Friday 27 January 2023 14:46, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['hs2', 'jeremy hunt'];['confirms', 'mr', 'oak', 'old', 'project', 'suburbs', 'line', 'reports', 'london', 'central', 'euston', 'stop', 'hs2', 'hunt', 'reach', 'jeremy'];"HS2 will end at Euston after reports the high-speed line could stop before reaching central London, the chancellor has confirmed.

Jeremy Hunt said he did not see ""any conceivable circumstance"" the original plan would not be followed and that he was ""incredibly proud"" of the work going ahead.

The endpoint of the line came into question after a report in The Sun claimed the last leg of HS2 could be scrapped and replaced with a new hub at Old Oak Common in the suburbs of northwest London.

Politics live: 'Best tax cut right now is cut to inflation,' says Hunt

This would leave passengers having to finish their journey into the centre of the capital on the new Elizabeth underground line.

The government did not deny the reports or that a two to five-year delay to the entire project - currently due to be completed between 2029 and 2033 - was being considered due to record high inflation impacting costs.

However, when asked if he and the government were committed to the line ending in Euston as planned, Mr Hunt said: ""Yes we are.""

The chancellor added: ""I don't see any conceivable circumstance in which that would not end up at Euston and indeed I prioritised HS2 in the autumn statement.

""We have not got a good record in this country of delivering complex, expensive infrastructure quickly but I'm incredibly proud that for the first time in this last decade under a Conservative government we have shovels in the ground, we are building HS2 and we are going to make it happen.""

Later, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman confirmed he was on the same page as Mr Hunt, and that the government was ""committed to the integrated rail plan"".

But when Mr Sunak was pushed by reporters later on Friday, he avoided answering questions over whether the project would be delayed.

Planning your route into London Making the final southern destination for HS2 a station at Old Oak Common - which is yet to be built - could well have saved the government billions. But what would the impact have been on passengers? Let's say Euston is your final destination. You would get off at the new station, which will be fairly close to Hammersmith in west London, and take the Elizabeth Line to Tottenham Court Road - a journey of around 15 minutes. From there, you could take the Northern Line three stops to Euston. Or, if you're feeling energetic, it would be a 20-minute walk.

The HS2 project has been dogged by criticism over its financial and environmental impact.

In October 2021, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove suggested capital investment for the line would be reviewed.

But after being installed at Number 11, Mr Hunt subsequently backed the project.

The target cost of Phase 1 between London and Birmingham was £40.3bn at 2019 prices, despite an overall budget of £55.7bn being set just four years earlier.

And more than £1bn has already been spent on work at Euston.

Penny Gaines from campaign group Stop HS2 said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs were spiralling out of control.

""These reports just show that there are so many problems with HS2,"" she added. ""It's being delayed further and further so the cost is going up, it should be cancelled in its entirety as soon as possible.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127162455/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-confirms-hs2-will-reach-central-london-after-reports-it-might-stop-in-suburbs-12796388;skynews;politics;2628

The Olympic cyclist and his wife Peta were woken up when balaclava-clad intruders invaded their home on 27 November 2021, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

Prosecutors say two Richard Mille watches worth £400,000 and £300,000 were taken in the robbery.

Romario Henry, 31, of Bell Green, Lewisham, south-east London and 28-year-old Oludewa Okorosobo, of Flaxman Road, Camberwell, south London, deny two counts of robbery.

Cavendish, giving evidence in court on Monday, said he woke to the sound of voices before heading downstairs with his wife.

He said: ""I got up to follow her out and as I was stepping out of the room... she started to come back up.

""She shouted 'get in'. There were figures really close behind her.""

Cavendish tried to press a panic alarm, he said, but was jumped on by an intruder who began punching him in the head.

""One held me and another pulled out a knife and just held it in my face,"" Cavendish said.

""It wasn't a knife you have in a kitchen.

Peta Cavendish told the court: ""As I got a few steps down the stairs I could hear men speaking but it was still dark.""

She said she could see ""men's figures in balaclavas... running towards the bottom of the stairs"".

Asked by prosecutor Edward Renvoize how she felt when she saw the men, she told the jury: ""It was just everyone's worst nightmare.""

Mrs Cavendish said her husband was interrogated as he was held at knifepoint: ""One of them held a large black knife to his throat and they said 'Where's the watches?' and 'Do you want me to stab you?'.""

She said that her husband had been ""out of hospital for four days maybe"" at the time following a cycling crash which left him with three broken ribs and a tear to his left lung.

Cavendish told jurors he is a brand ambassador for Richard Mille watches and is sometimes loaned custom-made timepieces to wear.

Ali Sesay, 28, of Holding Street, Rainham, Kent, admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing.

6223;6223;Gangsta Boo: Former Three 6 Mafia rapper who also collaborated with Eminem, OutKast and more, dies aged 43;Tuesday 3 January 2023 13:34, UK;[];['tennessee'];['boo', '43', 'shared', 'privacy', 'rapper', 'eminem', 'aged', 'outkast', 'gangsta', 'dies', 'solo', 'released', 'preferences', 'view', 'youre', 'mafia', 'collaborated', 'mitchell', 'open'];"Rapper Gangsta Boo, a former member of the hip-hop group Three 6 Mafia, has died at the age of 43.

During her career, she collaborated with artists including Eminem, Gucci Mane, Run The Jewels, Lil Jon, E-40, TI and OutKast.

The music star, real name Lola Mitchell, was found dead in her hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, on New Year's Day.

Her cause of death has not been released and no further details about where she was found have been given.

Her mother, Veronica Mitchell, confirmed the news, saying in a statement on behalf of the family: ""The Mitchell family would like to thank everyone for their condolences regarding the untimely death of Lola 'Gangsta Boo' Mitchell.

""The family is asking for your continued prayers and privacy as we process the loss of our loved one.""

Gangsta Boo's career in music began when she was just 14, when she was spotted by DJ Paul, a founding member of Three 6 Mafia. She had joined the rap collective, which also included notable members including Juicy J, Crunchy Black and Lord Infamous, by her 15th birthday.

She performed on the group's debut album Mystic Stylez in 1995 and went on to appear on other albums including the platinum-selling When The Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1.

Her debut solo album, Enquiring Minds, was released in 1998, while she was still with the group. However, they later parted ways and she released her second solo record, Both Worlds *69, in 2001.

Just weeks before her death, she said she was getting ready to release her fourth solo album, The BooPrint, later in 2023. She also filmed an unreleased video, Imma Mack, with producer Drumma Boy, who has paid tribute, and on New Year's Eve shared a video of her accomplishments in 2022.

""Gangsta Boo was like a sister to me and told the world about me the way my blood brother did,"" Drumma Boy said in a statement.

""We both are Leos and share the same energy towards unity and seeing people happy! This is just such a devastating loss cuz she always wanted to see others win! RIP to the Queen Of Memphis, forever my sister.""

Drake, Missy Elliott, Rah Digga, TyDollaSign and OutKast's Big Boi are among those who have also paid tribute, along with her former Three 6 Mafia bandmates.

8506;8506;Dramatic changes in most common Non-UK countries of birth - who makes the new top 10?;Friday 27 January 2023 13:32, UK;[];['census 2021'];['20', 'dramatic', '2021', '2001', 'census', 'fourth', 'nonuk', 'wales', 'countries', '2011', 'makes', 'common', 'place', 'birth', 'changes'];"Romania has jumped from being the 86th most common non-UK country of birth to the fourth in the space of 20 years.

Meanwhile, Jamaica and Kenya have tumbled out of the top 10, according to new analysis of the 2021 census data.

Other new entries in the top 10 include Poland and Nigeria, but there have been sharp drops for Australia and Canada.

The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show how the top non-UK countries of birth in England and Wales have changed in recent decades.

India was the most common non-UK country at both the 2021 and 2011 census, and the second most common in 2001.

Ireland has slipped from first place in 2001 to fourth in 2011 and fifth in 2021.

The rest of the top 10 has seen major changes, however.

Romania ranked 86th in 2001 and by 2011 had climbed to 26, before jumping to fourth place in 2021.

Poland has risen from 18th in 2001 to second in 2021, while Nigeria is up from 14th to eighth.

But Jamaica has fallen out of top 10, dropping from sixth place in 2001 to 20th in 2021, along with the US (from seventh to 11th) and Kenya (ninth to 21st).

""The rise in position of both Poland and Romania is likely because they joined the EU in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and therefore gained entitlement to free movement,"" the ONS said.

""These changes over the last 20 years reflect a notably different picture of international migration over time.""

This is borne out by trends further down the rankings, which show China rising from being 25th at the 2001 census to 12th in 2021.

Other notable movers were Spain (up from 23rd to 13th), Portugal (34th to 15th) and the Philippines (30th to 17th).

By contrast, leaving the top 20 are Australia, which has fallen from 11th place in 2001 to 26th in 2021, Cyprus (down from 15th to 37th) and Canada (17th to 38th).

The census takes place across the UK every 10 years and provides the most accurate estimate of all the people and households in the country.

The latest census was filled out by more than 24 million households across England and Wales on 21 March 2021.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127134149/http://news.sky.com/story/dramatic-changes-in-most-common-non-uk-countries-of-birth-who-makes-the-new-top-10-12796624;skynews;politics;2597
5733;5733;2024 Veepstakes: who will Donald Trump choose as his running mate?;2023-01-02T07:00:08Z;['David Smith'];['Donald Trump', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Ron DeSantis', 'US elections 2024', 'US politics'];;"Donald Trump, the former US president, is making a third consecutive run for the White House. But there is a job vacancy this time: his running mate. No one thinks it will be former vice-president Mike Pence after the pair fell out over the 2020 election and January 6 insurrection. Trump, a 76-year-old straight, white man who needs to broaden his appeal, might look to a person of colour, a woman or a young person for 2024 (or all of the above) – or he might not. Here are 10 potential contenders: Tucker Carlson The Fox News host turned up last summer in Iowa, which gets the first say in the Republican presidential nominating process, prompting speculation about his political ambitions. He is a Trump kindred spirit who goads liberals, appeases Russian president Vladimir Putin and promotes the far-right “great replacement” theory that western elites are importing immigrant voters to supplant white people. But Carlson would be sure to turn off moderates and independents. Ron DeSantis
Some “Make America Great Again” voters torn between the authentic original and his upstart rival want to see them join forces on a dream Maga ticket. Florida governor DeSantis once made a campaign ad in which he read Trump’s book about getting rich, The Art of the Deal, to one of his children and encouraged them to “build the wall” along the US-Mexico border by stacking toy bricks. But Trump has now branded him “Ron DeSanctimonious” and the pair seem too similar to run together: less yin and yang than yin and yin. Tulsi Gabbard The former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate is attempting to launch a new career as a rightwing media personality. She campaigned for election-denier Kari Lake and other Republicans in the midterm elections. Her provocative challenges to western orthodoxy towards dictators such as Putin and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad are likely to strike a chord with Trump. He may also decide he needs a female running mate to make himself less toxic to suburban women. Marjorie Taylor Greene The far-right congresswoman from Georgia personifies the age of Trumpism with racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements, indications of support for political violence and wild conspiracy theories such as the claim that a Jewish-controlled space laser started a California wildfire. She recently suggested that, if she had led the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the mob would have been armed and victorious in its efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 victory (she later claimed this was “sarcasm”). She has little experience but her pugnacious campaigning style is right up Trump’s street. Nikki Haley The former South Carolina governor was Trump’s first ambassador to the United Nations. She turned against him over the January 6 insurrection but, like many other Republicans, found it easy to forgive him. She also proved willing to campaign for Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker despite his glaring incompetence and scandals. Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, might regard the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India as the perfect foil to charges of sexism and racism. Kari Lake
She was the breakout Republican star of the midterms all the way until election day – when she lost the race for governor of Arizona. The charismatic former TV anchor was endorsed by Trump and found a way to repeat his election lies while sounding almost credible. Despite his distaste for losers, Trump has twice welcomed Lake to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida since her defeat. It would be no great surprise to hear him say she is straight from “central casting”. Kristi Noem The governor of South Dakota has become another familiar face on the conservative conference and media circuit, railing against targets such as coronavirus pandemic lockdowns and the Chinese Communist party. In July, she told CNN she would support Trump in 2024 and “would be shocked if he asked” her to be his running mate. Noem has experience in elected office and could give Trump a new shot at credibility among Christians, rural Americans and women. Sarah Sanders She was unswervingly loyal as Trump’s White House press secretary, championing his agenda and insisting that he was misunderstood by critics. Last month she was elected as governor of Arkansas, following in the footsteps of her father, Mike Huckabee, creator of The Kids Guide to President Trump. Sanders and Huckabee, a former pastor, might help Trump shore up the Christian evangelical vote against potential challengers such as Pence. Tim Scott
The South Carolina senator is said to be eyeing his own run for the presidency. The Trump campaign might regard Scott as a compelling choice, hoping that he would neutralise accusations of racism and rally “Blacks for Trump”. He told the Republican national convention in 2020 that his grandfather “suffered the indignity of being forced out of school as a third-grader to pick cotton and never learned to read or write … Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime.” Elise Stefanik Trump prizes loyalty and few have been more loyal than congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York, the number three Republican in the House of Representatives. Once a moderate, she staunchly defended the former president during his impeachments and declared this year: “I am ultra-Maga. And I’m proud of it.” Shrugging off disappointing midterm results, she was quick to endorse Trump for 2024. He has described her as “a star” and said: “She looks like good talent.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/02/donald-trump-2024-vice-president-running-mate;guardian;politics;5733
4361;4361;Golden Globes 2023: who will win and who should win the film awards;2023-01-10T07:43:40Z;['Benjamin Lee'];['Golden Globes 2023', 'Golden Globes', 'Awards and prizes', 'Cate Blanchett', 'The Fabelmans', 'Everything Everywhere All At Once', 'Culture', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Film', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'Colin Farrell', 'The Good Nurse'];;"After an almost two-year period of what felt like an unending cycle of embarrassing reveals and nervous repair work, the Golden Globes are finally, sort of, pretty much, maybe, kinda back.
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has been accused of a great many things – racism, bribery, giving The Tourist three nominations in 2010 – and after last year’s ceremony was both celebrity- and TV camera-free, the industry now awaits to see if Tuesday’s ceremony will be enough to return them to former glories. But aside from whether anyone will, or should, watch what happens, which nominees will, or should, come away winners? Best film (drama)
After the pandemic temporarily decimated the box office, the slow crawl back has led to a debate over exactly what awards bodies will be celebrating this season. Will there be more impetus than usual to reward the audience-alluring blockbusters as a way of recognising their importance in keeping so many people employed? While Baz Luhrmann’s flashy biopic hit Elvis might well have found its way into this category on any other year, it’s less guaranteed that Tom Cruise’s smash sequel Top Gun: Maverick would have been a contender, given its reliance on spectacle at the price of pretty much anything else. If voters were going for this commercial reasoning then it could be either the latter film or James Cameron’s juggernaut Avatar: The Way of Water, which continues to creep up the all-time box office list, that wins out (although Cruise’s public boycott of the Globes could play a part in his film being denied a win). But I’m betting the HFPA opts for Steven Spielberg’s autobiographical ode to the movies The Fabelmans which might have bombed on the big screen but its message of the power of film will send a similar message. Todd Field’s spiky character study Tár is sadly too knotty for HFPA voters to unravel. Will win: The Fabelmans Should win: Tár Shoulda been nominated: Empire of Light Best actress (drama)
While Tár as a whole might be, sadly, too chilly for some voters to fully embrace, they will probably find its star Cate Blanchett hard to resist, delivering an all-timer of a performance as a morally challenged composer losing her grip. Blanchett has a history of adoration from the Globes with three wins and another eight nominations (she even squeaked through for the thoroughly dreadful Where’d You Go, Bernadette) and with most agreeing that this is a career-best turn, it’s doubtful the HFPA won’t take the opportunity to add to her mantelpiece. Her closest competition would probably be Michelle Williams for The Fabelmans although heat around her has cooled as Blanchett has managed to scoop up the majority of critics circle prizes in recent months. Next in line would be Viola Davis for The Woman King, the kind of robust, mainstream crowd-pleaser that the Globes are known for liking, while Ana de Armas for Blonde, and Olivia Colman for Empire of Light, might be viewed as the best things about the films they’re in but that won’t be enough. Will win: Cate Blanchett, Tár Should win: Cate Blanchett, Tár Shoulda been nominated: Florence Pugh, The Wonder Best actor (drama)
It’s been a notoriously weak year for male actors, the female category overstuffed with contenders, while the men have trailed far behind. There are, in my opinion, two ways for this category to go, given that the arguable best actor Oscar frontrunner is in the comedy and musical category. The first would be Brendan Fraser winning for Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, the kind of pre-packaged transformative awards performance that voters have always loved, but Fraser has spoken out against the HFPA and an alleged groping incident involving the former president. He’s a confirmed no-show at this year’s ceremony but even without that swirling, the film has been falling out of favour with many critics, who have rightfully criticised its creaky theatricality and awkward acting. The second, and more sturdy, scenario sees Austin Butler win for his role as Elvis, a film that has slowly become one of the surest things of this awards season. Voters love music biopics and lower-wattage competition from Hugh Jackman in The Son, Bill Nighy in Living and Jeremy Pope in The Inspection will only make Butler’s path to the stage even smoother. Will win: Austin Butler, Elvis Should win: Austin Butler, Elvis Shoulda been nominated: Jack Lowden, Benediction Best film (comedy or musical)
There are reasons to think that Martin McDonagh’s friendship-turned-sour comedy The Banshees of Inisherin might come out on top here – it leads the field with the most nominations – the HFPA picked Three Billboards in the same year that the Academy didn’t – but I think the category, and the night itself, will be dominated by the multiverse caper Everything Everywhere All at Once. It might seem like a younger, edgier choice for the HFPA but beyond the buttplug jokes is a simple and, for many, rousing story about family. It also, like so many best comedy or musical winners, is essentially more of a drama, re-raising the debate about how seriously comedy is taken at the Globes. Elsewhere, Glass Onion will probably be seen as too much of a frippery, Babylon too divisive and Triangle of Sadness too odd. Will win: Everything Everywhere All at Once Should win: Triangle of Sadness Shoulda been nominated: Bros Best actress (comedy or musical)
While she might have fallen out of the best actress Oscar race, it’s pleasing to see Emma Thompson recognised here for her never-better turn as a woman exploring her sexuality in the wonderfully revealing Good Luck to You, Leo Grande. With a different campaign and in a different year, it might have been hers to lose. But the wins will probably continue for Everything Everywhere All at Once and Michelle Yeoh’s barnstorming central performance. There’s a great swell of support for her and the career that has preceded this and she’ll probably become only the second woman of Asian descent to win this category. Elsewhere a deserving Lesley Manville for her lovely Cinderella tale Mrs Harris Goes to Paris and the far less deserving pair of Anya Taylor-Joy for The Menu and Margot Robbie in Babylon will have to settle for the sidelines. Will win: Michelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All at Once Should win: Emma Thompson, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande Shoulda been nominated: Amandla Stenberg, Bodies, Bodies, Bodies Best actor (comedy or musical)
Quite possibly the easiest category of the night to predict has Colin Farrell rightfully sprinting away with this one for his exquisitely measured performance in The Banshees of Inisherin. It’s the comedy or musical category but it’s Farrell’s quieter, dramatic moments that should help seal the deal and it’ll play into HFPA’s desire for big stars winning big awards. His competition here is pretty much non-existent as he’s the only contender gaining genuine awards traction outside of the Globes, with Babylon’s Diego Calva, White Noise’s Adam Driver, The Menu’s Ralph Fiennes and Glass Onion’s Daniel Craig all unlikely to feature in the Oscar race. Will win: Colin Farrell, The Banshees of Inisherin Should win: Colin Farrell, The Banshees of Inisherin Shoulda been nominated: Billy Eichner, Bros Best supporting actress
There is a genuine route here for Angela Bassett to triumph for her scene-devouring turn in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever given the actor’s long, respected career and the film’s powerful off-screen emotional arc but it will most likely be a night for the category’s other elder stateswoman. Jamie Lee Curtis, one of the only nominees confirmed to be attending the ceremony, will probably follow her Everything Everywhere All at Once co-stars to the stage (even if her slot should have gone to Stephanie Hsu) after two wins in the past and another five nominations. Curtis was also memorably one of the only celebrities who took part in last year’s ceremony, via video, showing her support for the HFPA. The Banshees of Inisherin’s Kerry Condon is a lock for a best supporting actress nod at the Oscars but might have to sit this one out, deserving as she might be. The nomination for Triangle of Sadness breakout Dolly de Leon is a win in itself while Carey Mulligan’s nod for She Said feels like filler given how the film hasn’t performed elsewhere. Will win: Jamie Lee Curtis, Everything Everywhere All at Once Should win: Dolly De Leon, Triangle of Sadness Shoulda been nominated: Judy Davis, Nitram Best supporting actor
Unusually, there are two nominations here for the same movie – both Brendan Gleeson (who is arguably a lead) and Barry Keoghan for The Banshees of Inisherin – and as such, may well cancel the other out. Brad Pitt’s inclusion for Babylon is mostly because, well, he’s Brad Pitt, while Eddie Redmayne is unlikely to leap ahead for The Good Nurse, a film with very little buzz. Ultimately, HFPA and academy voters love a strong narrative and there’s probably no stronger this year than Ke Huy Quan, the out-in-lead frontrunner for Everything Everywhere All at Once. A successful child star in the 80s, he struggled to find work in the decades after, eventually retreating from the industry. But he was lured back for what ended up being his magnum opus, playing multiple roles with aplomb and his understandably emotional string of speeches during the awards circuit (he’s already won a ton) will probably continue this week. Will win: Ke Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All at Once Should win: Ke Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All at Once Shoulda been nominated: Judd Hirsch, The Fabelmans Best director
There was some mild pushback over the lack of diversity in this category (no Sarah Polley for Women Talking or Gina Prince-Bythewood for The Woman King) but it’s a competitive year for the big guns and it’s likely that the biggest will win out. While James Cameron could rightfully be awarded for the sheer size of the undertaking behind Avatar: The Way of Water, Baz Luhrmann for the trademark dazzle of Elvis and the Daniels for the lower-budgeted ingenuity of their Marvel-esque Everything Everywhere All at Once (I think Martin McDonagh’s work on The Banshees of Inisherin will be deemed too minor in comparison), it looks like it will be Steven Spielberg’s year. The HFPA hasn’t handed him the best director award since Saving Private Ryan at 1999’s ceremony, despite five nods in the years since, and with his intimate movie-loving drama The Fabelmans also set to win best drama, I can see him getting further reward here for saluting the reason the Globes allegedly exist in the first place.

8168;8168;Politics news - latest: 'He's toast': Tories turning on Nadhim Zahawi as he avoids questions on future;;[];['live'];['future', 'tories', 'zahawi', 'wes', 'mr', 'labour', 'thinking', 'politics', 'turning', 'reesmogg', 'toast', 'nadhim', 'streeting', 'conservatives', 'hes', 'questions', 'reform', 'latest', 'nhs'];"Tories should listen to Labour on NHS reform, says Rees-Mogg

Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Conservatives should learn from Labour's Wes Streeting after he called for ""fundamental reform"" of the NHS.

The shadow health secretary told parliament earlier this month that the government was ""sticking plasters"" on the health service and called for a massive workforce expansion.

In an interview with The Guardian on Friday, Mr Streeting denied reforms would mean more privatisation, instead suggesting the private sector should be used to tackle waiting lists in the short-term and to develop technology.

Today, Mr Rees-Mogg said Conservatives should take Mr Streeting seriously, as his comments ""reflect the political appetite for reform.""

Talking on The Moggcast, the backbencher said: ""I'm really interested that Wes Streeting, obviously a Labour politician, is talking about reforming the NHS, which the Conservatives have shied away from.

""But that is something we are going to have to talk about because the NHS is not working as it should and we cannot endlessly go on spending more money and thinking that there is somebody else who will pay for it.""

He continued: ""What he [Streeting] is saying is so important because I think that reflects the political appetite for reform and Tories therefore need to be thinking about it very seriously.""

Mr Rees-Mogg did not comment on the specific proposals put forward by Mr Streeting and Labour, which include scrapping the non-dom tax status to fund more medical school places and allowing patients to self-refer to specialists.

The party also plans to force GPs to provide face-to-face appointments to those who want them, introduce online-booking to more services and ""bring back the family doctor.""

The Met Office said on Wednesday: “Mist, fog and freezing fog – including freezing drizzle – will be slow to clear across southern parts of England this morning.” Travel delays, cancelled flights and dangerous road conditions are a possibility despite the weather being expected to improve slightly on Wednesday afternoon, it also warned. The Environment Agency has a total of 24 flood warnings in place across southern England. These warnings are in place in an area stretching from Ludgershall in Wiltshire down to Dorset and across to Somerset. The agency warned motorists and walkers to be wary of “dangerous” high tides in east Yorkshire on Wednesday night after issuing a new flood warning for an eight-mile stretch of the Humber estuary. The agency said: “The combination of high tides and waves is expected to generate hazards for exposed areas. Please be careful along beaches, coastal footpaths and roads as waves and sea spray could be dangerous.” While a yellow warning for freezing fog was lifted on Wednesday morning, motorists are warned to take extra care as forecasters said poor visibility could extend into the start of next week. The Met Office said visibility would improve slightly on Wednesday but remain poor as a succession of cold fronts is expected to bring rain to the south. Residents and commuters in Bracknell Forest, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Reading, Slough, Southampton, Surrey, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham would need to be mindful of the conditions, the Met Office warned. Fog is also expected to hit Bath and North East Somerset, Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire. Temperatures will only slightly improve to peaks of 8C, with overnight lows of -6C, even though rain, fog and wind are expected to ease for a dry and cloudy day.

Following a meeting between the NATO secretary-general and the German defence minister, still no decision has been made on whether Berlin will allow Leopard 2 tanks to be sent to Ukraine.

Over the weekend, Germany's foreign minister hinted Berlin would not stand in the way if Poland decided to send the German-made tanks - but she later appeared to backtrack on her comments.

NATO's Jens Stoltenberg said he and defence minister Boris Pistorius ""discussed the issue of battle tanks"" in their talks in Berlin today.

""These discussions will continue and I am confident we will have a solution soon,"" he said.

Mr Stoltenberg added he welcomes France, the UK and other allies pledging tanks for Ukraine ahead of likely renewed offensives from both sides this spring.

4465;4465;Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pumpkin, beans, greens and cheese;2023-01-09T11:00:14Z;['Rachel Roddy'];['Winter food and drink', 'Food', 'Italian food and drink', 'Soup', 'Main course', 'Vegetables', 'Cheese'];;"It is impressive, I think, when someone can choose a melon or a pumpkin by a sniff or a shake. This ability usually involves nerve, too: the confidence to pick something up and examine it from all sides, and a skin thick enough not to be concerned by stallholders, supermarket managers or signs saying “Do not touch”. I don’t have any of the above, so I’m often disappointed by melons and pumpkins. I told my friend Alice this recently and she revealed her technique while we were shopping at Monteverde market. She often asks stallholders to cut melons, pumpkins or squashes open, promising that she will buy even if it’s furry or flavourless, but in the knowledge it’s a dud. And, of course, the cutter is then in a corner. This, too, requires nerves and skin as thick as the knobbly, grey-green pumpkin I stood holding in a shop the other day. Shaking it didn’t tell me much and I didn’t ask, of course. Fortunately, it wasn’t a dud. Nor was it particularly brilliant; despite being a zucca marina di Chioggia, which are usually reliable things, with dense, orange flesh that is first and foremost savoury, with a sweetness that comes after. If only I’d had more nerve, or gone to another shop. Other pumpkin varieties to look out for are squat, dark-green kabocha, which has dry, starchy flesh with a butter and chestnut flavour and just a touch of sweetness; pale green-blue crown prince, which looks like someone has sat on it, and has dense flesh that reminds one of swede and sweet potato; red, green and white-striped turban squash, which indeed does look like a pumpkin wearing a turban, and has gentle flesh like butternut squash. Roasting makes good pumpkin great, average pumpkin better, and might save a dud if you give it enough olive oil or butter and salt. So that is what I did, to go with beans and greens cooked in much the same spirit as a cassoulet – that is, slowly and with seasoning, until they are soft and well-flavoured and surrounded by starchy bean broth. Like classic cassoulet, the beauty of this dish is the soft, almost fudge-like beans with a slight crust on top. If you are serving soon after making them and the dish is still very hot, then a few minutes under the grill should do it. If time has lapsed and it has cooled down, return the dish to the oven at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 15-20 minutes, or until it is heated through and the parmesan is bubbling. Contrast is good, so serve with green salad, more cheese and perfectly ripe pears, if you have the ability and nerve to pick them. Pumpkin, beans, greens and cheese Soak 8 hr + Prep 15 min Cook 75 min Serves 4 300g white beans, soaked in cold water for 8 hours, then drained 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1 sprig sage, plus a few extra leaves to serve Salt and black pepper Olive oil 300g kale or greens, cut into rough ribbons 1 small pumpkin or butternut squash (roughly 400g) 4 tbsp grated parmesan Put the soaked beans in a heavy-based pan and add enough cold water to cover by at least 5cm. Add the garlic, sage sprig, a good pinch of salt and two tablespoons of olive oil. Bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer for 75 minutes, or until the beans are tender. In the last 10 minutes of cooking, add the greens. Meanwhile, cut the pumpkin or squash into 2cm wedges, removing the seeds and also the skin, if you wish. Rub with olive and salt, then bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes, or until soft and golden. Use a slotted spoon to lift the beans into a large dish, adding just enough liquid to give them a soft, stew consistency. Arrange the pumpkin slices and a few more sage leaves among the beans, top the whole thing with a swirl of olive oil and parmesan. If the dish is still very hot, a few minutes under the grill should be enough to give it a bit of a crust. If time has lapsed and it is cool, reheat in the oven at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese bubbles.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/09/pumpkin-beans-greens-and-cheese-stew-recipe-rachel-roddy;guardian;entertainment & culture;4465
7679;7679;Rishi Sunak's Richmond constituency to receive £19m as latest successful levelling up fund bidders revealed;Wednesday 18 January 2023 22:31, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];['conservatives'];['revealed', 'funding', 'successful', 'levelling', 'local', 'investment', 'project', 'fund', 'community', 'communities', 'latest', 'projects', 'richmond', 'receive', 'sunaks', 'constituency', 'round', 'rishi'];"Rishi Sunak has announced that more than £2bn will be invested in more than 100 projects across the UK through the levelling up fund - with £19m going to his own constituency.

Reinforcing his commitment to levelling up the country, the prime minister promised the latest round of funding would ""build a future of optimism"" by delivering economic growth and new jobs across the UK.

Labour criticised the fund, accusing the government of presiding over a ""Hunger Games-style contest where communities are pitted against one another"".

A spreadsheet of the 111 successful bids released by the Department for Levelling Up shows that £19,008,679 has been granted to a project in Mr Sunak's Richmond constituency after an application by Richmondshire district council.

The document says: ""Richmondshire will receive £19m to transform Catterick Garrison town centre. This includes new routes for walking and cycling, a new town square, and a new community facility that will host new businesses and a community kitchen.""

Among the other projects is the Eden Project North in Morecambe, which received £50m for the regeneration project designed to transform the Lancashire town's seafront.

Also on the list is the Cardiff Crossrail plan, which has been allocated £50m of government funds, while a new roll-on, roll-off ferry for Fair Isle in the Shetlands is to receive £27m.

The government said that the £2.1bn in funding had been split between £672m to develop better transport links, £821m for community regeneration, and £594m to go towards restoring local heritage sites.

Projects in London, however, have received more investment than those in Yorkshire and the North East combined, and projects in the South East have been allocated almost twice as much as those in the North East.

Levelling up - where did the first round of money go?

Landmark levelling up white paper is published

Lisa Nandy, shadow levelling up secretary, criticised the fund and accused the government of ""extraordinary arrogance"".

""The Levelling Up Fund is in chaos, beset by delays and allegations of favouritism,"" she said.

""It takes an extraordinary arrogance to expect us to be grateful for a partial refund on the money they have stripped out of our communities, which has decimated vital local services like childcare, buses and social care.

""It is time to end this Hunger Games-style contest where communities are pitted against one another and Whitehall ministers pick winners and losers.""

Mr Sunak said the investment will allow the government to ""spread opportunity everywhere"".

""By reaching even more parts of the country than before, we will build a future of optimism and pride in people's lives and the places they call home,"" he said.

Ten projects in Scotland will share £177m of levelling up funding, including £20m to help turn Arbuthnot House in Aberdeenshire into a museum and library, as well as modernising Macduff Aquarium, and £20m to refurbish the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock.

Other investment granted includes:

• £20m to Gateshead Quays and the Sage

• £5.1m to build female changing rooms in 20 rugby clubs across Northern Ireland

• £50m to create a direct train service, linking Newquay, St Austell, Truro, and Falmouth/Penryn in Cornwall

• £40m for a new Multiversity, a carbon-neutral education campus in Blackpool's Talbot Gateway central business district

Image: Boris Johnson made 'levelling up' a key phrase and mission during his time as PM

Levelling up was a key Tory policy under Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.

""The defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities,"" Mr Johnson said as he unveiled the government's levelling up white paper last year.

The mission to shift government focus and resources to Britain's forgotten communities has been continued by Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, who said the government was ""firing the start gun"" on a range of projects with the latest funding.

""This new funding will create jobs, drive economic growth, and help to restore local pride,"" he said.

""We are delivering on the people's priorities, levelling up across the UK to ensure that no matter where you are from, you can go as far as your talents will take you.""

The latest successful bids follow the allocation of £1.7bn to 105 projects from round one of the levelling up fund in 2021.

The government confirmed last year that round two funding would match round one, but said it increased this by more than £400m after receiving a high number of transformative bids.

The total allocated so far from the fund to local community projects is £3.8bn.

The government has also confirmed there will be a further round of investment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118234805/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunaks-richmond-constituency-to-receive-19m-as-latest-successful-levelling-up-fund-bidders-revealed-12789673;skynews;politics;1770
4525;4525;Song of a GP: folk musicians tell stories of modern British lives for BBC;2023-01-09T06:00:10Z;['Mabel Banfield-Nwachi'];['Folk music', 'UK news', 'Music', 'Culture', 'BBC'];;"A series of contemporary folk songs and short films were released on Sunday as part of the 21st Century Folk initiative to celebrate the lives and experiences of five people across the north-east of England. The programmes, launched by BBC Radio 2 in partnership with BBC Local Radio, follow the songwriters as they meet the people selected to take part in the project. The songwriters were then tasked with creating folk music from the contributors’ stories that told relatable tales of life in the north-east, which were then performed by local musicians. The people selected to take part ranged from a doctor who administered thousands of Covid vaccines during the pandemic, to a foyboatman who helps ships from around the world moor on the Wearside docks.
This project is a modern take on the historic BBC Radio Ballads, a series of documentaries made in the 1950s and 1960s for the BBC Home Service that weaved the real voices of working communities with traditional folk songs. Andrea Bell, who runs a soup kitchen and food bank called the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen, was chosen to share her story. Bell was partnered with singer-songwriter Martyn Joseph, who composed and performed Albert’s Place, inspired by Bell’s life. Singer-songwriter Thea Gilmore from Oxfordshire wrote She Speaks in Colours, capturing the story of Delyth Raffell from Blyth, who tragically lost her teenage daughter, Ellen, aged just 16, to anaphylaxis. The One Show on BBC One will feature Raffell, showing the moment Gilmore performed her song to her for the very first time, tonight at 7pm.
Katie Toner, 28, from Northumberland was also picked to tell her story, which was taken up by singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Angeline Morrison. Toner runs an inclusive events business, where she organises accessible parties and sleepovers for neurodiverse children. She has autism and ADHD and said typical children’s parties were often overwhelming as a child. Toner said she was shocked when she found out she had been selected for the project, but felt grateful to be given the opportunity to open up conversations about neurodiversity. “When it’s your life, it’s just your life. It’s not until you sit back and talk to people that you realise perhaps it’s more unique than I realised it was,” Toner said. “I’m a really proud ADHD and autism advocate so if I can tell my story and other people’s stories too, that’s even better.” Morrison, whose album was named the Guardian’s best folk album of 2022, said it was a real honour to be approached for the project. “I’ve done lots of collaborations, I’ve done commissions, lots of toplining, but I’ve never been asked to write a song about a particular living person before. It’s a great honour but there’s a lot of weight that comes with that too. “I really loved listening to Katie talk about her life. She seems like a proud liver of life and somebody who is taking all the uniqueness of who they are and pouring it into beautiful things for other people. She really is an incredibly generous person.”
Toner’s song, A Dream for You, was performed by the Unthanks. “The heart of this project was bringing the community together, so for Radio 2 to bring me and Angeline from opposite ends of the country, but then me and the Unthanks, from literally a 12-minute drive away … it’s just brilliant.”
Other contributors included Michael Dodds, a fifth-generation foyboatman in the port of Sunderland. Dodds met the Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford, who was inspired by Dodd’s stories of his life and work, to write Foyboatmen. Difford performs the song with the singer Kathryn Williams, who composed the music. Dr Ifti Lone, a dedicated GP working in Middlesbrough, had his story told by songwriter Sean Cooney. Cooney performed the song Doctor Boro with his bandmates, the Young’uns. 21st Century Folk is available on BBC Radio 2 across this week and all the songs can be heard now on BBC Sounds. • This article was amended on 9 January 2023.

15;15;Broncos appoint Sean Payton as head coach as Texans hire DeMeco Ryans;2023-01-31T21:48:38Z;['Guardian sport'];['NFL', 'Denver Broncos', 'Houston Texans', 'San Francisco 49ers', 'New Orleans Saints', 'US sports', 'Sport'];;"The Denver Broncos and Houston Texans settled on the identity of their new head coaches on Tuesday.
ESPN reports that the Broncos have agreed compensation with Sean Payton’s former team, the New Orleans Saints, with whom he won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season. The Broncos will reportedly receive Payton and the Saints’ 2024 third-round draft pick in the deal. New Orleans will get Denver’s 2023 first-round pick (No 30) and the Broncos’ 2024 second-round pick.
Meanwhile, the Houston Texans confirmed they have agreed a deal with DeMeco Ryans to be their new head coach. Ryans has won widespread praise as defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. The 38-year-old played for the Texans for six seasons after they selected him in the second round of the 2006 draft. As a linebacker with the team he won defensive rookie of the year and was selected to two Pro Bowls.As a coach he has distinguished himself as a defensive mind: under his leadership the 49ers were best in the NFL in points and yards allowed this past season. San Francisco were particularly good against the run with Ryans as defensive coordinator, ranking second in the league by holding teams to 77.7 yards. That’s a stark contrast to Houston’s run defense, which ranked last in the NFL by allowing 170.2 yards this season. The Texans have not had a winning season since 2019, but they have the No 2 overall pick in this year’s draft and own Cleveland’s first-round picks in 2023 and 2024 after they traded Deshaun Watson to the Browns last year. “For so many reasons, DeMeco is everything we are looking for in a leader and coach for our organization,” Texans owner Cal McNair said in a statement. “He has a proven track record for developing high-quality players and constantly innovated his defensive scheme over the last six seasons in San Francisco. “We started this process with the goal of finding someone our fans and city can be proud of and we’ve done just that. While we received a lot of incredible feedback and support for DeMeco from different people, it was our discussions with him and his vision for our football team that made him the right coach to lead us as we continue to evolve as an organization.” Ryans’ appointment means the Texans are the first NFL team in history to hire three Black head coaches in succession. Payton will also inherit a struggling team, although the same could be said for the Saints when he became their head coach in 2006. Alongside future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees, Payton led the Saints to the playoffs nine times and the NFC South title on seven occasions. Payton remained under contract with New Orleans after stepping down from the Saints last season and working in broadcasting this season. The Broncos, who went 5-12 this season and extended their playoff drought to seven years, fired rookie coach Nathaniel Hackett in December after he went 4-11. Interim coach Jerry Rosburg went 1-1. Payton’s top task will be to get quarterback Russell Wilson back to his winning ways after the 11-year pro had his worst statistical season following his blockbuster trade from Seattle for four premium draft picks and three players. The Broncos dealt their first- and second-round picks to the Seahawks for Wilson. They got back into the first round by trading pass rusher Bradley Chubb to the Miami Dolphins, who sent the Broncos a first-rounder originally owned by the San Francisco 49ers. That selection now belongs to the Saints.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/31/reports-broncos-to-appoint-sean-payton-as-head-coach-as-texans-hire-demeco-ryans;guardian;sports;15
1437;1437;Northern California shooting case of ‘workplace violence’, police say;2023-01-25T00:57:17Z;['Dani Anguiano', 'Richard Luscombe'];['California', 'US news', 'Gun crime', 'Monterey Park shooting'];;"An agricultural worker in northern California allegedly killed seven people as part of a “workplace violence incident”, the state’s third deadly mass shooting in little more than a week. Police are questioning 67-year-old Chunli Zhao, who they say shot dead four and wounded one more on Monday afternoon at a mushroom farm where he worked in Half Moon Bay, a coastal community 30 miles south of San Francisco.
He then moved on to a trucking firm about 5 miles away and killed three more, officials said. He was taken into custody without incident after being spotted sitting in a car by a deputy in the parking lot of a sheriff’s substation. He is being held without bail and is expected to be arraigned on Wednesday. California has been left reeling by back to back gun violence in recent days. The new year has brought multiple mass killings – that is, with at least four fatalities excluding any perpetrator – in the US, three of which occurred in California. Within 48 hours, 18 people died in mass shootings in the state, including 11 people killed at a lunar new year event at a Monterey Park dance hall on Saturday. Last week a “horrific massacre” in the small central valley town of Goshen left six people dead, including a teenage mother and her 10-month-old baby. The violence in Half Moon Bay has devastated the coastal city of 12,000 people, an agriculture hub known for producing pumpkins and flowers, particularly the area’s farmworkers, many of whom are immigrants. “Many of these workers came to this country to work and provide for their families. Instead many of them yesterday lost family members,” said Christina Corpus, San Mateo’s first Latina sheriff. Local agencies are providing income replacement to workers affected by the shooting and offered hotel rooms to impacted families. “Right now we’re reaching out to the community with mental health services and trying to help the families as best we can, and trying to make sense of what is an absolutely senseless act,” Dave Pine, chair of the San Mateo county board of supervisors, told NPR’s Morning Edition on Tuesday. “We mourn the loss of these innocent people, and look forward to a day when we don’t have to be living in fear of gun violence in our community, and in the country.” Detectives are piecing together a motive for the Half Moon Bay shooting, which the sheriff said on Tuesday was not a random attack as Zhao was an employee at Mountain Mushroom Farm. “All of the evidence we have points to this being the instance of workplace violence,” Corpus said. “The only known connection between the victims and the suspect is that they may have been coworkers.”
“He had an opportunity, I really do believe, to hurt other people, but he has targeted individuals that he went after and pursued,” she told CNN. Corpus told a Monday night press conference that the suspect was a mushroom farm worker who acted alone, and there was no further threat to the community. The shooter opened fire on workers at the farm with no regard for who was nearby, Corpus said. “It was in the afternoon when kids were out of school. For kids to witness this, it’s unspeakable,” she said. “People saw him there today and it seemed like a normal day for everyone, and then this tragedy happened.” Video of the suspect’s arrest showed three officers approaching a parked car in the sheriff’s substation parking lot at a strip mall with their guns drawn. The man was pulled to the ground after emerging from the vehicle, placed in handcuffs and led away. FBI agents are assisting the investigation, the agency said Tuesday, offering forensic and technical support and victim services and trying to determine how the gunman acquired the weapon. Corpus said he used a semi-automatic gun that was recovered from his vehicle, and told CNN on Tuesday that the weapon was legally owned and registered to the suspect. Joe Biden expressed his sympathy in a statement on Tuesday morning from the White House, calling again on Congress to reinstate a nationwide ban on assault weapons. “For the second time in recent days, California communities are mourning the loss of loved ones in a senseless act of gun violence,” the president said. “Even as we await further details on these shootings, we know the scourge of gun violence across America requires stronger action. I once again urge both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this assault weapons ban to my desk, and take action to keep American communities, schools, workplaces and homes safe.”
California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, tweeted that he was “at the hospital meeting with victims of a mass shooting when I get pulled away to be briefed about another shooting. This time in Half Moon Bay. Tragedy upon tragedy.” At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the governor and other elected officials called for action to address the constant gun violence that plagues America. “The least amongst us are the ones that are the headlines today across the country, around the world – that is the farmworkers. They were killed with purpose, with intent, execution style,” said congresswoman Anna Eshoo. “We have unfinished business in our country to address gun violence … until it is our finished business, there will be pain in many communities.” The governor pledged the state would commit to looking at what it could do to reduce gun violence, but said California cannot do it alone and more action is needed from officials in Congress. “What the hell is going on?” Newsom said. “It’s said all the time ‘only in America’. Number one in gun ownership, number one in gun deaths. It’s not even complicated … It doesn’t have to be this way, wasn’t always this way. We’ve allowed this to happen.” Pine, the San Mateo supervisor, spoke emotionally at the Monday press briefing as he blamed the tragedies on the surfeit of guns in the US, 120 for every 100 residents. In a survey released last year, one-third of Americans admitted to legally owning a gun, and 6 million Americans said they carried a loaded handgun daily. “We simply have too many guns in this nation.

596;596;Absence from work at record high as Americans feel strain from Covid;2023-01-29T08:00:43Z;['Melody Schreiber'];['Coronavirus', 'US news', 'World news'];;"For many Americans it feels like everyone is out sick right now. But there is a good reason: work absences from illness are at an all-time annual high in the US and show few signs of relenting. And it’s not just acute illness and caregiving duties keeping workers away. About 1.5 million Americans missed work because of sickness in December. Each month, more than a million people have called out sick for the past three years. In June 2022, about 7% of adult Americans had long Covid, which can affect productivity and ability to work, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The last time the absentee number dipped below a million Americans was in November 2019. Last year, the trend accelerated rather than returning to normal. In 2022, workers had the most sickness-related absences of the pandemic, and the highest number since record-keeping began in 1976. In 2022, the average was 1.58 million per month, for a total of 19 million absences for the year. The largest spike was in January 2022, when 3.6 million people were absent due to illness, about triple the pre-pandemic number for that month. Parents and caregivers also saw the highest rates of childcare-related absences of the entire pandemic in October 2022 as illnesses surged amid relaxed precautions and lower vaccination rates among children. Patterns in absenteeism correspond with rises and falls in the spread of Covid. But long Covid is probably contributing to sick leave rates as well. One analysis in New York found that 71% of long Covid patients who filed for worker’s compensation still had symptoms requiring medical attention or were unable to work completely for at least six months. Two in five returned to work within two months, but still needed medical treatment. Nearly one in five (18%) of claimants with long Covid could not return to work for a year or longer after first getting sick. The majority were under the age of 60. Workforce participation has dropped by about 500,000 people because of Covid, according to one study that looked over time at workers who were out sick for a week. But the actual number could be higher, because not all workers are able to take time off during their illnesses, Bach said. “It’s likely that long Covid is keeping somewhere around 500,000 to a million full-time-equivalent workers out of work,” said Katie Bach, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Some affected by long Covid have reduced their hours, while others have left the workforce temporarily or permanently – a metric not captured by work absence data, but calculated in labor participation statistics. Patients who are very sick with long Covid often “try to work for some amount of time and then eventually they drop out”, Bach said. Between death and disability, the workforce has been reduced by as much as 2.6% during the pandemic, with 1bn days of work lost, McKinsey recently reported. Those who stay in their jobs may need more sick leave than before because of new chronic illnesses. “People who are on the less-sick end of long Covid, maybe they can keep working, but every now and then they might need a day or two off just because they have overdone it or something happened that triggered a symptom flare,” Bach said. Much more research still needs to be done on the causes of and treatments for long Covid, the researchers said. Some patients do eventually recover, for instance, but it’s not clear why or how long they will be sick. “We don’t know how long it’s taking them to recover. There’s a lot of uncertainty there,” said Alice Burns, associate director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The more immunity people have, from vaccines and recovery from prior cases, the less likely they are to get sick in the first place, which reduces the risk of developing long Covid. But it is still possible to have long Covid even after mild or asymptomatic infection. All of this means the US may continue to see higher-than-normal workplace absences. “Some people just really need flexibility from their employers,” Burns said. That can include telework, unscheduled leave, flexible schedules and reduced hours. “The challenge with that is, those supports are a lot more likely to be available to workers who have office jobs, higher-paying jobs, who are pretty well-established in the labor market,” Burns said. “Covid in general, and long Covid too, are more likely to affect people who are minorities, who have lower levels of education, [who have] likely lower levels of income. So there may be, for many people, a mismatch between the people who need some of these employment-related supports and the types of jobs they are in.” Employers can adjust to this new normal by offering as many accommodations as possible, both for those suffering initial bouts of Covid infection and those experiencing longer-term symptoms, Bach said. Again, some of the jobs where people are most at risk might be the least accommodating – it’s usually easier for office workers to telecommute than it is for fast-food workers – but there are still steps employers can take. “Companies have to get creative, like: can we offer more frequent breaks?” Bach said. “Can we as a society convince Medicare and Medicaid to reimburse a little bit more where companies are employing people with long Covid? What memory aids can we put together?” If long Covid continues to affect 7% of the country, that’s 23 million people at any given time who may require accommodations under laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act. “But there isn’t a lot of clarity about what is a reasonable accommodation” under the law when it comes to Covid and long Covid, Burns said. While Covid has thrown the country into disarray in every realm, including work, it is also shining a more intense light on the ways chronic illness affects productivity and workforce participation – a change that disability and chronic illness activists say is long overdue, Bach pointed out. “My hope is that it’s big enough that we can rethink how we research and treat these diseases, and how we approach workplace accommodation,” Bach said. “In a world where any of your workers could suddenly become disabled, I think you have to be more flexible.” • This article was amended on 31 January 2023 to reflect that cited CDC data on long Covid was published in June 2022 and referred to adults only.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/29/covid-absence-workforce-health-long-covid;guardian;health;596
943;943;Popcaan: Great Is He review – dancehall star’s banal hymns to luxury;2023-01-27T08:00:46Z;['Jason Okundaye'];['Music', 'Culture', 'Pop and rock'];;"Fifteen years into his career, dancehall kingpin Andrae Sutherland, AKA Popcaan, feels on top of the world. On his fifth album, Great Is He, he expresses gratitude for his rise with plenty of classic dancehall braggadocio – and who could blame him? From international collaborations with Gorillaz, Jamie xx and Pusha T, to selling out Wembley SSE arena in 2018, his distinctive singjaying has left an indelible mark on the culture.
Opening track Defeat the Struggle is a touching ode to ambition and upward mobility: “Ghetto yutes that have a dream,” he sings, “don’t ever let it go.” Then we’re thrown into the steel drums of Freshness, on which he boasts about “millions make one week”. The chorus of “Prada mi Prada, Gucci mi Gucci” is powerfully catchy, and across the album there are vividly evocative references to luxury goods that conjure imagery of fierce drip. His mentor, Vybz Kartel, showed off his Clarks; Popcaan shows off “fresh Louis V, fresh Nike Air”. But this rags-to-riches narrative quickly feels hackneyed, and the album itself proves bloated. Though Popcaan’s vocals are consistently slick, you reach New Benz and wonder what purpose such a track serves the album beyond letting us know about the “New Benz, new yard”. The origin story spun on St Thomas Native feels leaden rather than inspiring. And by the time penultimate track Past Life, and the “crackers and water” diet it speaks of, comes around, the message loses impact. Closing track Great Is He, with its gospel backing vocals and praise of the “most high”, is equally dull, and feels like falling asleep at midnight mass. Luxury and gratitude are fine motifs, but without enough sonic distinction between tracks it gets boring fast.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/popcaan-great-is-he-review-ovo;guardian;entertainment & culture;943

There were thunderstorms, snow and powerful winds in California on Sunday, with the National Weather Service warning of a ""relentless parade of atmospheric rivers"" - storms consisting of long plumes of moisture stretching out into the Pacific.

Gavin Newsom, the governor, said 12 people had been killed as a result of the violent weather in the past 10 days.

The 28-year-old has sold all the rights to the 291 songs he has released, or has an interest in, up until the end of 2021, to Hipgnosis Songs Capital, the music rights business backed with an initial $1bn from the private equity firm Blackstone. The business is managed by Hipgnosis Song Management, which is run by the music mogul Merck Mercuriadis, who founded a separate London-listed music rights business also called Hipgnosis, which has spent $2bn on music deals since 2018. “This acquisition ranks among the biggest deals ever made for an artist under the age of 70,” said Mercuriadis. “At only 28 years of age, he is one of a handful of defining artists of the streaming era that has revitalised the entire music industry.” Bieber released six studio albums between 2010 and 2021, as well as a number of remix and compilation albums. He has also released dozens of singles and is a prolific collaborator on songs, including Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito. To date most of the lifetime catalogue deals have been with artists nearer the end of their careers, such as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Tina Turner, Bary Manilow and Blondie. Investors in music rights have also viewed the evergreen value of classic catalogue music as a safer investment due to the known popularity of songs that have found a stable fanbase over decades. The Blackstone-backed HSC, which was formed in 2021, has spent about $600m on deals ranging from full catalogues to partial rights with artists such as Leonard Cohen, Kenny Chesney, Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake.;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/24/justin-bieber-rights-music;guardian;entertainment & culture;1491

Hamlin, 24, was released from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and flown home to Buffalo, where he will continue his recovery at a different hospital.

Hamlin's heart had to be re-started after he suddenly fell to the ground and had a cardiac arrest during a game last Monday night against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Medical staff rushed on to the field and gave the Buffalo Bills player CPR for about 10 minutes before he was taken from the stadium in an ambulance as stunned players and spectators - including his parents - looked on in silence.

Hamlin was then put on a ventilator during days of intensive treatment at the Ohio medical centre - and has made a fast recovery.

Dr William Knight said he was ""doing well"", while another medic, Dr Timothy Pritts, said: ""We continue to be ecstatic about his recovery"".

Hamlin tweeted this evening: ""Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart. Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling.

""The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world (and) more. Bigger than football!""

He added in a subsequent post: ""Grateful for the awesome care I received at UCMC. Happy to be back in Buffalo.

224;224;Monique Ryan accused of causing chief of staff to be sacked over refusing ‘unreasonable’ work hours;2023-01-31T01:37:11Z;['Paul Karp'];['Australian politics', 'Law (Australia)', 'Australia news'];;"Sally Rugg has accused the commonwealth of “hostile conduct” and claimed independent MP Monique Ryan caused her to be sacked for refusing to work “unreasonable” additional hours, court documents reveal. Rugg’s federal court application, released on Tuesday, reveals that Ryan’s chief of staff is seeking an injunction to keep her job with the member for Kooyong, alleging a breach of the Fair Work Act’s general protections provisions. Rugg claims that she exercised a workplace right to refuse “unreasonable” additional hours, and that Ryan then “directly procured [or] induced” her employer, the commonwealth, to take “adverse action” by seeking to dismiss her for it. Rugg argues the commonwealth also took adverse action “to injure the applicant in her employment by engaging in hostile conduct in the workplace”. Although the commonwealth, which employs staffers through the Department of Finance, is listed as the first respondent in the case, Rugg is seeking a declaration that Ryan was “involved” in the contraventions. That is because Ryan “directly procured, induced, or [was] knowingly concerned in or party to the contravention, in that the second respondent was the principal actor on behalf of the first respondent in the relevant transactions”, the document said. In addition to an injunction to keep her job, Rugg is also seeking compensation and unspecified “pecuniary penalties” from both the commonwealth and Ryan. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The document reveals Rugg’s employment was to be terminated on Tuesday, one day after the case was listed for its first hearing on Monday, which was vacated. The case is due for its first interlocutory hearing before Justice Debra Mortimer on Friday, to consider Rugg’s request for an interim injunction to keep her job pending final determination of the case. Given the allegation of unreasonable work demands, the case may renew scrutiny on the Albanese government’s decision in June to cut crossbench MPs’ staffing allocation from eight to five people. The crossbench protested against the cut, citing the Jenkins report that found “long and irregular hours of work” as a risk factor of working as a political staffer in parliament house.
Rugg is a Melbourne-based LGBTQ+ activist and feminist who played a leading role in the yes campaign during the marriage equality vote in her former position at GetUp, before working as the executive director of Change.org. Ryan was elected in 2022, ousting then deputy Liberal leader and treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, from his blue-ribbon inner-Melbourne seat. In July, Rugg told the Sydney Morning Herald that she was drawn to Ryan after watching her debate Frydenberg during the election campaign. “What drew me to Monique was obviously the policy priorities – climate change, gender equity, integrity and transparency in politics – but also her approach as a grassroots, community-connected independent,” Rugg reportedly said. On Monday, Rugg, Ryan, and their lawyers Maurice Blackburn and Sparke Helmore declined to comment on the case.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/31/monique-ryan-accused-of-causing-chief-of-staff-to-be-sacked-over-refusing-unreasonable-work-hours;guardian;politics;224

Ukrainian air defences shot down 47 of the 55 missiles Russian forced fired at Ukraine, the country’s top general claimed. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, reported on Telegram that there had been explosions in the city. He wrote: “As a result of a rocket hitting a non-residential building in the Holosiiv district, there is currently information about one dead and two wounded. The injured were hospitalised by medics.” Russian missile strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern port city of Odesa. No injuries were reported, but there were power blackouts and some residents reported an interruption to the water supply. There were also reports of explosions in Vinnytsia and Kherson. The prosecutor general’s office said three people were killed and seven injured in an attack on energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia. The attacks came the day after Joe Biden approved sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. The US had resisted providing its own M1 Abrams tanks, citing maintenance and logistical challenges with the hi-tech vehicles. Earlier, the US president had spoken by phone with leaders Emmanuel Macron of France, Olaf Scholz of Germany, Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Rishi Sunak of Britain. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Biden for the “powerful decision” and described it as “an important step on the path to victory”. Germany also confirmed on Wednesday it will make 14 Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine’s war effort. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also said his government plans to send further military support to Ukraine beyond the tanks. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine welcomed the decision, and said he was “sincerely grateful” to Scholz. The key to providing tanks for Ukraine’s defence against Russia was speed and sufficient numbers, Zelenskiy said on Wednesday. “The key now is speed and volumes. Speed in training our forces, speed in supplying tanks to Ukraine. The numbers in tank support,” he said in his nightly video address. Germany will also approve other European countries supplying German-made Leopard 2 tanks from their own stock. Finland, Spain and the Netherlands will contribute the same model, according to German media reports. A second battalion will be made up of Leopard 2A4 tanks from Poland and Norway. The Russian embassy in Germany has accused Berlin of taking the conflict in Ukraine “to a new level of confrontation”. The decision to approve the delivery of Leopard tanks to Ukraine means the “final refusal” of the German government “to recognise its “historical responsibility” to Moscow, ambassador Sergei Nechayev said in a statement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow views sending tanks to Ukraine as “direct involvement in the conflict”. He told reporters “There are constant statements from European capitals and from Washington that the sending of various weapons systems, including tanks, to Ukraine in no way means the involvement of these countries or Nato in the hostilities that are taking place in Ukraine. We categorically disagree. In Moscow, everything that both the alliance and the capitals I mentioned are doing is perceived as direct involvement in the conflict. We see that it is growing”. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, one of President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, has also said on Thursday that the US and Nato were parties to the conflict in Ukraine and were seeking to drag out the fighting. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists. The designation is the latest in a long campaign by the Kremlin to curb independent media and stop their reporting from reaching ordinary Russians in a crackdown that has escalated since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. In a statement announcing the decision, Russia’s general prosecutor said the Latvia-based news outlet “poses a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system and the security of the Russian Federation”. Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv, has confirmed that the region has been affected by a hack of the authority’s IT systems. A German citizen was arrested at Munich airport on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing intelligence onto Russia, the prosecutor general’s office said on Thursday. Ukraine’s military spokesperson, Serhiy Cherevatyi, said Wednesday Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the eastern town of Soledar in the Donetsk region, according to the country’s state broadcaster Suspilne. The withdrawal of forces was made “in order to preserve the lives of service personnel”, he said.

3408;3408;UK unions call in cancer expert over fears of asbestos risk to female teachers;2023-01-15T10:00:10Z;['Michael Savage'];['Schools', 'Trade unions', 'Cancer research', 'UK news', 'Science', 'Society', 'Education', 'Teaching', 'Medical research', 'Cancer', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Women'];;"The threat of asbestos-related cancer to female teachers is to be examined after possible signs of an elevated risk of fatal illness. Trade unions are to work with one of the country’s leading cancer experts on a study of the exposure women in their late-40s to mid-60s may have had to the material inside school buildings. It comes after researchers detected a possible increase in mesothelioma deaths among the group that could be statistically significant. Official data has already shown that female former teachers born from 1935 to 1954, working when asbestos was still being installed in schools, have a 40% increased rate of mesothelioma, a cancer related to asbestos exposure that affects the lining of lungs. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) reported more than 5,000 asbestos-related deaths in 2019 across the population as a whole, including from cancers like mesothelioma. Statisticians have now detected a rate of mesothelioma deaths that “borders on statistical significance” among teachers born between 1955 and 1974. Unions are planning to work with Professor Julian Peto, who has studied the issue for many years. The proposed study will identify teachers who have had lung operations so that any samples taken from them can be studied to detect levels of asbestos exposure.
“Most teachers born since 1955 began work after the 1970s – when asbestos was no longer being installed in schools – so their exposures were from the asbestos already installed, much of which is still there,” Peto said. “The question is what the continuing risk is, and what should be done to reduce it. “The updated data for 2011-2020 now shows an excess in female teachers born 1955-74 (19 mesothelioma deaths, versus 12.3 expected), which borders on statistical significance, although the numbers are still too small to give a reliable estimate of the continuing risk. We would like to study this important question. The lifetime mesothelioma risk can be predicted from these asbestos levels in lungs.” Asbestos was banned in 1999 but was used extensively in England from the 1950s to the mid-1980s, meaning that many schools contain some of the material. A government survey in 2019 found that 80.9% of participating schools said asbestos was present on their estate. Most were found to have a plan for managing it. Unions and campaigners have been pushing for swift asbestos removal. Earlier this year, a Commons select committee called for total removal from public and commercial buildings within 40 years. However, the government said it was sticking to the policy of keeping asbestos in place where it can be managed safely, stating that removal may risk increasing exposure. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This research is vitally important. We believe it will establish once and for all the risk asbestos in school buildings poses to the health of teachers, support staff and children. We hope the results will convince the government of the urgent need for an independent review of current policy, which is to manage rather than remove asbestos.” Shelly Asquith, health, safety and wellbeing policy officer at the TUC, said: “It’s only in recent years that we’ve started to see how much of a problem it is among teachers and former teachers. It’s good to get recognition, and hopefully some scientific evidence, to back up the work we’ve been doing for a few years on this.

4306;4306;Madagascar’s unique wildlife faces imminent wave of extinction, say scientists;2023-01-10T16:00:15Z;['Phoebe Weston'];['Mammals', 'Wildlife', 'Evolution', 'Biology', 'Environment', 'Science', 'Madagascar', 'Conservation', 'Biodiversity', 'World news'];;"From the ring-tailed lemur to the aye-aye, a nocturnal primate, more than 20m years of unique evolutionary history could be wiped from the planet if nothing is done to stop Madagascar’s threatened mammals going extinct, according to a new study. It would already take 3m years to recover the diversity of mammal species driven to extinction since humans settled on the island 2,500 years ago. But much more is at risk in the coming decades: if threatened mammal species on Madagascar go extinct, life forms created by 23m years of evolutionary history will be destroyed. “Our results suggest that an extinction wave with deep evolutionary impact is imminent on Madagascar unless immediate conservation actions are taken,” researchers wrote in a paper published in Nature Communications. Madagascar is one of the planet’s biodiversity hotspots with 90% of its species found nowhere else on the planet, yet more than half of its mammal species are threatened with extinction. So much is on the line because the island is relatively pristine and is home to wildlife that has evolved nowhere else, having split from greater India around 88m years ago. It is the world’s fourth largest island, about the size of Ukraine, and much of its diversity has been built on species coming from Africa and then diversifying over millions of years. “It’s about putting things in perspective – we’re losing unique species traits that will probably never evolve again,” said lead researcher Dr Luis Valente from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, and the University of Groningen. “Every species is valuable in its own right; it’s like destroying a piece of art, so what is happening is very shocking.” His team collaborated with researchers from the US and the conservation organisation Association Vahatra in Madagascar.
The island is particularly known for its ring-tailed lemurs, members of a unique lineage of primates found nowhere else. Other well-known inhabitants include the fossa, a carnivorous cat-like animal, and the panther chameleon, as well as a vast array of unique butterflies, orchids, baobabs and many other species. Biologists and palaeontologists created a dataset that showed all the mammal species currently present on the island, those that were alive when humans arrived, and those known only from fossil records. Of the 249 species identified, 30 are extinct. More than 120 of the 219 mammal species alive today on the island are threatened with extinction. Lost species can never return, and so the study looked at how long it would take to recover the same levels of biodiversity through new species colonising and evolving on the island.
Valente said: “Lots of these species could be going extinct in the next 10 or 20 years – they cannot wait much longer. You can quickly reach a point where a species isn’t viable any more. The main message is that biodiversity is not going to recover quickly. Even the places we think are pristine and really untouched can be pushed to the point of collapse quite quickly.” The loss of mammals would have significant impacts on other species of plant and insect that depend on them. Valente said: “It’s a cascading effect – losing these mammals would likely cause a collapse of the ecosystem more broadly. In total, it is likely to be more than 23m years at stake.” The main threats are human-induced habitat destruction, climate change and hunting. During the past decade, the number of mammal species threatened with extinction on Madagascar has more than doubled, from 56 in 2010 to 128 in 2021. Conservation programmes are needed to create livelihoods for local people, to stop forests being converted into farmland, and to limit the exploitation of resources such as hardwood trees and animals used for bushmeat, the paper’s authors said.
Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said: “This fascinating study shows it would take millions of years for natural processes to rebuild the levels of biodiversity already lost, and tens of millions of years if currently threatened species are also lost. While this study looked at Madagascar, similar analyses could be done for other islands and continents, and I think would tell a similar story. He added: “The impact humanity has already had on Earth’s biodiversity will last for millions of years, but the next few decades are hugely important for avoiding large-scale extinction that could have much deeper and longer consequences.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/10/madagascar-unique-wildlife-extinction-aoe;guardian;environment;4306
2048;2048;Turkey condemns burning of Qur’an during far-right protest in Sweden;2023-01-21T22:00:25Z;['Danya Hajjaji'];['Sweden', 'Turkey', 'Islam', 'Europe', 'Religion', 'Protest', 'Nato', 'World news'];;"Turkey has condemned a demonstration involving the burning of Qur’ans in Sweden on Saturday, further inflaming tensions between the two countries amid Stockholm’s Nato bid. The protest in Stockholm, which took place under heavy police protection in front of Turkey’s embassy, gathered about 100 people and a crowd of reporters, Agence France-Presse reported.
The Danish far-right politician Rasmus Paludan, who also has Swedish citizenship and staged the event, gave an hour-long speech against Islam and immigration before setting fire to a copy of the Qur’an. A day prior, Turkey’s foreign ministry summoned Sweden’s ambassador over the permission granted to Paludan’s protest. It was the second time Sweden’s ambassador to Turkey has been summoned this month, after having had to answer for a 12 January stunt during which a Kurdish group hung an effigy of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Stockholm. Earlier on Saturday, Ankara cancelled a 27 January visit by Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, intended to be a discussion about Turkey’s refusal to ratify Sweden’s Nato accession. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said the meeting was cancelled because it “has lost its significance and meaning”. Jonson, however, announced the meeting had been postponed after talks with Akar on Friday at the US military base in Ramstein, Germany. “Our relations with Türkiye are very important to Sweden, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue on common security and defence issues at a later date,” he tweeted on Saturday. Prior to Paludan’s event on Saturday, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, called it a “hate crime” that could not be characterised as freedom of expression, and asked Sweden not to allow the “vile act” to take place. The Stockholm protest was also denounced by İbrahim Kalın, chief adviser to Erdoğan. “The burning of the Holy Qur’an in Stockholm is a clear crime of hatred and humanity,” Kalın tweeted. “We vehemently condemn this. Allowing this action despite all our warnings is encouraging hate crimes and Islamophobia. The attack on sacred values is not freedom but modern barbarism.” Sweden’s government has sought to distance itself from the demonstration, with the foreign minister, Tobias Billström, condemning it on Saturday. “Islamophobic provocations are appalling,” Billström tweeted. “Sweden has a far-reaching freedom of expression, but it does not imply that the Swedish government, or myself, support the opinions expressed.” Turkey has proved to be an obstacle to Sweden and Finland’s historic application for Nato membership after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which marked a reversal of the Nordic countries’ decades of neutrality. Sweden and Finland have gained the approval of 28 Nato members so far, bar Hungary and Turkey. In November, Hungary’s president, Viktor Orbán, said his parliament would ratify Nato membership for Sweden and Finland in early 2023. But Turkey is still holding back, demanding the extradition of people in Sweden it claims to have links to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU and the US – or to banned cleric Fethullah Gülen. • This article was amended on 23 January 2023 to clarify that Rasmus Paludan is a far-right politician in Denmark with dual citizenship.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/turkey-condemns-burning-of-quran-during-far-right-protest-in-sweden;guardian;politics;2048
1438;1438;Musk tells court he lacked ‘specific’ funding to take Tesla private;2023-01-25T00:47:08Z;['N/A'];['Elon Musk', 'Tesla', 'US news', 'Technology'];;"Elon Musk expected strong financial support when he tweeted that he would take Tesla private in 2018, but lacked specific commitments from potential backers, according to testimony he gave on his third day of questioning in a San Francisco federal court. Musk is accused of defrauding investors by driving up the price of Tesla stock by tweeting on 7 August 2018 that he had “funding secured” to take the electric carmaker private. The trial is testing whether the world’s second-richest person can be held liable for his use of Twitter. At stake are millions of dollars for shareholders who claim they suffered losses after Musk tweeted that “investor support is confirmed” for the deal.
Tesla’s stock price surged after Musk’s tweets, and later fell as it became clear the buyout would not happen. Musk told the jury on Tuesday that he could have drawn upon several sources of financing to take Tesla private, from existing shareholders like Oracle Corp co-founder Larry Ellison to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund or his own fortune. “Funding was absolutely not an issue,” Musk said. “It was quite the opposite.” Musk, however, acknowledged he did not have binding agreements with investors, leaving it to the jury to decide if he misled shareholders. A jury of nine will decide whether the Tesla CEO artificially inflated the company’s share price by touting the buyout’s prospects. Responding to questions from his lawyer Alex Spiro, Musk said that his tweet was intended to inform investors about his interest in taking Tesla private. Musk said he had already discussed his interest with the Tesla board and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and he feared it would leak to the media. “I had no ill motive,” he said. “My intent here was to do the right thing for shareholders.” The Saudi fund did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Musk told the jury he decided to drop the idea of taking the company private after getting feedback from shareholders. “After talking to a number of investors, especially the smaller investors, they said they would prefer a Tesla that remained public and I felt it was important to be responsive to their wishes,” Musk testified. The jury was shown notes and documents from a board meeting in the days after the tweet at which Goldman Sachs, which was working with Musk on the proposed deal, had indicated there would be more than enough funding to take the company private. Goldman Sachs did not immediately reply to a request for comment. But when questioned by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the investors, Musk said he did not have binding agreements for financing from any interested party. Musk repeatedly resisted the “yes” or “no” responses sought by Porritt about discussions over funding pledges by the Saudi fund, prompting the judge at one point to help with the questioning. “Was a specific number discussed?” the judge asked. “Not a specific number,” Musk said. On Monday, Musk said he could have financed the deal by selling his stake in SpaceX, the aerospace company where he is also chief executive officer. He has also said he believed financing had been pledged by the Saudi fund, before they backpedalled. The tweet has already resulted in a $40m settlement with securities regulators. After it became apparent that the money was not in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla’s chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing. The trial is scheduled to continue into next week with testimony by Tesla board members and experts.

Disgruntled passengers took to social media to share concern for ""dangerous"" overcrowding, with hundreds of people queuing to get on to platforms.

Southeastern, which operates trains from the station, said passengers were delayed due to a trespasser at Hither Green, south east London, but many blamed the network's new slimmed-down timetable.

Implemented on December 11, the ""simplified"" timetable involves fewer peak-time trains and a cut in services, and has caused serious backlash.

One passenger, Suzanne Whitlock, wrote: ""100s of passengers in a crush at London Bridge due to the changes you introduced - with no consultation - in December.

""It's not just doubled commutes, it's dangerous. Every night is like this, trapped on packed trains, escalators and platforms. Do something.""

A spokesperson for Southeastern told Sky News: ""An earlier trespasser on the line at Hither Green last night caused line closures, cancellations and delays in and out of London, which had an impact on services at London Bridge.

""The individual was removed from the tracks, with power restored to all lines by Network Rail and normal services resumed by 5.39pm. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused to our customers due to this incident.""



""A safety review was held this morning with Network Rail"".

'Absolutely atrocious'

At a council meeting on 25 January, Greenwich Council's deputy leader, Averil Lekau, said that she would be writing to the company, calling the ongoing issues ""absolutely atrocious"".

But former Greenwich Council leader Danny Thorpe pressed for more urgent action, after he was one of many caught in the ""appalling"" conditions at London Bridge on Wednesday night.

""Hundreds of people were kettled onto platforms,"" Mr Thorpe said in the meeting. ""Things got so bad there was violence and the police were called to the station.""

He called for Ms Lekau to send an urgent letter on Thursday, raising ""serious concerns about health and safety,"" which he said was ""undoubtedly being caused by the lack of trains being delivered"".

'Teething issues' with new timetable

Southeastern and Network Rail apologised for disrupted, overcrowded and unreliable services over the past two weeks, blaming ""teething issues"" with the new timetable on 23 January.

Good to see a bit of heavy metal in the post. However, what baffles me is why Royal Mail never issued stamps featuring portraits of the UK soldiers who lost their lives during the Iraq conflict. Back in 2009, I helped organise part of the UK art gallery tour of Queen and Country by the Turner prize and Oscar winner Steve McQueen. After travelling to Basra as the Imperial War Museum’s official artist, McQueen created a solemn tribute to Britain’s fallen. Within a modernist oak sarcophagus are 155 portraits of individual soldiers printed on large sheets of postage stamps, with the soldier’s name, regiment, age and date of death printed in the margin. I remember being profoundly moved by seeing the faces of those who had lost their lives. I can still see some of their faces now, all these years later. McQueen’s objective was for Royal Mail to officially issue the stamps so that the public would come to recognise those soldiers. But it refused, saying that it would be “distressing and disrespectful” to armed forces families. However, the families I spoke to were keen for their loved ones to be remembered in this way. It’s time for institutions to help us remember our past – we’d be a better country for it.

4025;4025;Australia’s credibility on human rights blighted by laws targeting climate protesters and jailing children, report says;2023-01-12T03:15:03Z;['Daniel Hurst'];['Australian foreign policy', 'Human rights', 'Law (Australia)', 'Protest', 'Activism', 'Prisons', 'Australian immigration and asylum', 'Indigenous incarceration', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Climate crisis', 'Energy', 'China'];;"The detention of children under 14 and new laws targeting climate protesters are harming Australia’s credibility to stand up for human rights in the region, a leading rights body has warned. Human Rights Watch called on Australia to address its own “alarming deficiencies” when the organisation on Thursday published its annual reports on the performance of nearly 100 countries.
It specifically raised alarm about New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania introducing “new laws targeting peaceful climate and environmental protesters with disproportionate punishments and excessive bail conditions”. The organisation took aim at the Albanese government for maintaining the previous government’s policy to turn back asylum seeker boats, and also renewed concerns about the over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Sophie McNeill, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Australia was a wealthy, privileged country with strong democratic institutions “and that’s why when we have these failings it’s so alarming”. She said the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, had “made it clear that she is passionate about human rights and that she does want Australia to lead in the region”. “But our ability to do that is undermined by the alarming deficiencies that we still have regarding the treatment of First Nations people, asylum seekers and peaceful climate protesters,” McNeill said in an interview. “We must get things in order at home to really ensure we have that credibility to promote human rights and democracy in the region in response to rising authoritarianism from China.”
Australia has faced increasing domestic and international pressure over the past few years to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years, but it is largely in the hands of state and territory governments and progress has been slow. McNeill said it was “clear that this is an issue that needs that federal leadership to get it over the line”. Human Rights Watch also raised concerns about curbs on freedom of expression, saying authorities in NSW were “disproportionately punishing climate protesters” through new laws that allow for big fines and up to two years in prison for protesting without permission. Similarly, the organisation said, new anti-protest laws in Victoria and Tasmania invoked “severe penalties for non-violent protest”. Human Rights Watch is calling on all countries to “apply a human rights lens to the existential threat of climate change”, given that the most vulnerable pay the highest price for inaction. It argues the climate crisis poses a threat to the right to life, the right to health, and the right to a safe and healthy environment. In its World Report 2023, the organisation said the change of government in Australia had led to some improvement in human rights, “including more ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets to address climate change”.
But it said continued support for fossil fuel developments “contributes to the global climate crisis and undermines the right to a healthy environment”. On refugee and asylum seeker policy, McNeill called on the Labor government to quickly fulfil its election promises to end temporary protection visas and increase the humanitarian intake. “Not only will it make a positive difference to thousands of people’s lives but it will also improve Australia’s overall human rights standing,” she said. The government last month appointed senior diplomat Bronte Moules as Australia’s new ambassador for human rights. Wong said the ambassador’s mission was to “lead Australia’s work to protect and promote human rights globally and be a key advocate on issues of importance to our region”. In its global review, Human Rights Watch said a “litany of human rights crises that unfolded in 2022 – from Ukraine to China to Afghanistan – has left behind a sea of human suffering”. The organisation’s 712-page report reviews practices in nearly 100 countries, including China, where it said repression deepened in 2022. The organisation warned against allowing the Chinese government to evade accountability for human rights abuses, after the UN human rights council “fell two votes short of passing a resolution to discuss the UN high commissioner for human rights report that concluded that abuses in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity”. It also said the Indian government had “continued its systematic discrimination and stigmatisation of religious and other minorities, particularly Muslims”. China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told reporters in Canberra this week there “doesn’t exist such a question of human rights abuses in Xinjiang” and the UN report was “a product of absolute political manipulation”. The Indian government has previously dismissed “ill-informed” attacks on the country’s human rights record, saying it “values religious freedom and human rights”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/12/australias-credibility-on-human-rights-blighted-by-laws-targeting-climate-protesters-report-says;guardian;politics;4025

Headstones were toppled, iconography destroyed, and graves smashed, in an incident at around 3.20pm on Sunday afternoon.

CCTV covering a part of the cemetery shows two young men carrying out the attack, at one stage throwing chunks of marble at a notable grave and seemingly targeting certain graves.

The Jerusalem Protestant Cemetery, in the grounds of The Jerusalem University College on Mount Zion, was founded in 1848 and maintained by local communities.

It contains the graves of 77 military personnel, four of whom died shortly after the First World War, and 73 men of the Palestine Police who were killed during the Second World War.

It is also the burial place of many senior Christian leaders including Samuel Gobat, the former Bishop of Jerusalem.

Israeli police are investigating the violence and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has said it will carry out damage assessments to begin repair work.

The president of the university, Oliver Hersey, said in a statement: ""The Mount Zion Police Department is working with staff at Jerusalem University College to identify two young men caught on security cameras throwing large pieces of marble crosses at headstones, in an effort to restore peace and safety to those residing in the Mount Zion community.""

The strategies were discussed by ministers, victim-survivors, authorities and technology companies as part of national dating app roundtable talks in Sydney on Wednesday. The federal communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said it was an “important first step”, flagging discussion of possible longer-term changes like background checks for dating app users. “None of us underestimate the complex issues around privacy, user safety, data collection and management that are involved,” she said. “There’s no one law that is going to fix this issue.” “Many instances of abuse are perpetrated by those without a criminal record or any convictions … and that’s why a big focus of the discussion was also on what could be done to encourage respectful online interactions.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dating apps were also put on notice by the eSafety Comissioner, Julie Inman Grant, who warned none were up to her safety standards and that they needed to make major improvements or they would face a mandatory code. She said platforms needed to be transparent about how many people were being abused so the government could get a handle on the scale of the problem. “I wouldn’t say any one [app] is meeting all of those standards,” she said. The commissioner would be issuing notices to all platforms demanding greater sharing of data, collaboration between platforms on safety measures and roadmaps for how they planned to deal with users who reappear on apps and reoffend. “If I don’t get total transparency, I have legal compulsion powers that I can use,” she said. Rowland said complaint handling by apps was a key area of concern. “We need industry to improve their action, their transparency and their accountability in how they respond to consumer complaints,” she said.
The federal social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said people with lived experiences of app-enabled abuse and violence needed to be at the centre of discussions to stop perpetrators. “There does need to be a proactive response, where it is perpetrators and those perpetrating the abuse that are held to account,” Rishworth said. Teach Us Consent founder, Chanel Contos, called on dating app companies to invest in educating the public about respectful relationships and consent. Federal, state and territory attorneys general will now be asked to look at the issues and consider criminal justice response as a matter of priority. Wednesday’s meeting was called in response to the rising number of people using online dating apps and a corresponding rise in assault and abuse. A recent study from the Australian Institute of Criminology found three-quarters of survey respondents had been subjected to sexual violence on dating apps in the last five years. Tinder’s parent company, Match, vowed to work with Australian authorities to improve user safety by using technology within the platform, saying it was “focused on building safety in everything we do”. A Bumble spokesperson said the company was looking forward to working with others to improve safety for women on and off the platform. “Any instance of violence, harassment or abuse is unacceptable to us and we do not hesitate to permanently remove perpetrators from our platform,” the spokesperson said. “We have a law enforcement portal to facilitate access to data for investigative purposes. We will even take action against perpetrators for behaviour that is reported to us that occurred on other apps.” In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

Many cities were hosting firework displays and large public gatherings free of restrictions for the first time since the pandemic. Large crowds in the UK braved cold temperatures, as more than 100,000 people were estimated to have gathered on the Embankment of the River Thames in London for the display at midnight, despite blustery showers. The fireworks and light show referenced the late Queen Elizabeth II’s death with ER, the initials of the Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II, illuminated by drones along with a portrait of Her Majesty’s on a coin changing to an outline of King Charles III. The conflict in Ukraine, the England women’s football team winning the European championships and Pride’s 50th anniversary were also referenced in the show. It was an altogether different story in Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, where an 11pm curfew had already precluded large parties, before a series of air raid alerts and reported explosions from Russian attacks disturbed the first few hours of 2023. Earlier in the evening Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had given a TV address in which he declared: “They said our only choice is surrender. We answered our only choice was to fight on!”
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, devoted his new year address to rallying the Russian people behind his troops fighting in Ukraine. Festivities in Moscow were muted, without the usual fireworks on Red Square. New York City joined the glow of the new year later with a dazzling spectacle in Times Square, anchoring celebrations across the United States. The night culminated with a countdown as a glowing geodesic sphere 3.6 metres (12ft) in diameter and weighing almost six tons descended from its lofty perch atop One Times Square. The ball’s surface was comprised of nearly 2,700 Waterford crystals that officials said were illuminated by a palette of more than 16m colours. At the stroke of midnight, a ton of confetti rained down on revellers, glittering amid the jumbo screens, neon and pulsing lights. Last year Covid restrictions meant only 15,000 of the usual 60,000 spectators attended Times Square to watch the traditional moment. Elsewhere, Australia marked its first restriction-free New Year’s Eve after two years of Covid disruptions, with more than a million revellers watching the traditional fireworks display in Sydney’s harbour. Lockdowns at the end of 2020 and a surge in Omicron cases at the end of 2021 led to crowd restrictions and reduced festivities.
A rainbow of colour lit up Sydney harbour with 2,000 fireworks launched from the four sails of the Sydney Opera House and 7,000 fireworks from more positions on the Sydney Harbour Bridge than ever before. In Edinburgh, thousands of people attended the traditional Hogmanay celebrations which included a concert in Princes Street Gardens headlined by Pet Shop Boys, and DJ sets at the annual street party. Fireworks went off every hour between 9pm and 11pm, counting down to the traditional midnight display.
In Manchester, celebrations went ahead at Manchester’s Piccadilly Gardens without fireworks due to budget pressures. Scarborough also had to forgo fireworks, after an Arctic walrus nicknamed ‘Thor’ became a celebrity on New Year’s Eve after being discovered in the harbour. The local council decided to postpone the firework display in order to avoid disturbing the creature, as the giant mammal drew huge crowds to the seaside resort in what is believed to be the first sighting of a walrus in Yorkshire. The animal is believed to be the same walrus spotted on the Hampshire coastline earlier this month.
In China, thousands gathered in central Wuhan to count down to the start of what many hoped would be a much better year after a “tough” 2022 filled with lockdowns and, in December, a major new outbreak of Covid. Many released balloons into the sky when clocks struck midnight, as per tradition in the central Chinese city where the pandemic began three years ago, before grabbing selfies with their friends. “In the past year, I feel that Covid-19 was very serious and some of my family members have been hospitalised,” a 17-year-old Wuhan high school student, surnamed Wang, said from the riverside shortly after midnight. “I hope they will be healthy in the new year. This is the most important thing.” Some came in fancy dress and almost everyone present wore masks as the country sees a wave of Covid which accelerated after curbs were dropped and which has since infected large swathes of the population, with deaths now reaching an estimated 9,000 a day, according to UK-based health data firm Airfinity.
“I am afraid,” said a woman surnamed Jin, referring to the possibility of being reinfected with Covid. “I was still afraid when I came out tonight, but I just wanted to come out, because everyone has come out.” A Wuhan resident surnamed Chen, 24, who works in e-commerce, said: “It had been a long time since things were lively and vibrant.” Police used loudspeakers at a number of locations, blasting out a short message on a loop telling people not to gather, to which people appeared to take little or no notice. In Shanghai, which like many Chinese cities in 2022 was put under a lengthy lockdown, many thronged the historic riverside walkway, the Bund. “We’ve all travelled in from Chengdu to celebrate in Shanghai,” said Da Dai, a 28-year-old digital media executive who was travelling with two friends. “We’ve already had Covid, so now feel it’s safe to enjoy ourselves.” In France, Paris staged its first new year fireworks since 2019 with a 10-minute show, estimated to have been watched by 500,000 people who had converged on the Champs-Élysées. But the Czech capital, Prague, was among those feeling the pinch economically and did not hold a display. “Holding celebrations did not seem appropriate,” said city hall spokesperson Vit Hofman, citing “the unfavourable economic situation of many Prague households” and the need for the city to save money. Heavy rain and high winds meant firework shows in the Netherlands’ main cities were cancelled. Berlin welcomed the new year with fireworks over the Brandenburg Gate while Athens had a display over the ancient Parthenon temple on top of the Acropolis hill.

139;139;Infosys: firm founded by Rishi Sunak’s father-in-law in UK tax dispute;2023-01-31T12:02:25Z;['Anna Isaac'];['Business', 'Technology sector', 'HMRC', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;"Infosys, the company founded by Rishi Sunak’s father-in-law NR Narayana Murthy, is in a multimillion-pound dispute with the UK tax authorities. HMRC and the Indian IT services firm, in which the prime minister’s wife, Akshata Murty, holds a stake of close to 1%, disagree over a corporation tax bill of about £20m, according to the company’s annual report. The dispute, first revealed by the Times, is one of a clutch of tax issues the company has in a range of jurisdictions, including Australia. Large tax disagreements that could affect a company’s operations or profits often have to be disclosed to shareholders and regulators. Infosys is publicly listed in India and New York.
A spokesperson for Infosys told the Guardian: “Infosys provides details of certain ongoing disputes with various regulatory authorities, including this specific tax matter with HMRC. The company has filed an appeal against a tax assessment in the UK and has obtained a stay on the payment of the tax demand from HMRC.” Narayana Murthy is no longer involved in the direct management of Infosys, after resigning from a senior role in 2014. Akshata Murty is also not involved in running the company, but retains shares worth almost £700m, which form a large share of the Sunaks’ family wealth. These have earned her tens of millions of pounds in dividends in recent years. The tax dispute comes at a sensitive time for the prime minister, who last week sacked the Tory party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, because of a breach of the ministerial code tied to a tax penalty. Sunak is still facing scrutiny over his handling of the affair. In April last year it was also revealed that Murty saved millions of pounds while living in No 11 by using non-dom status to minimise her tax bill. The tax break, which costs thousands of pounds to maintain, means that a person can be a UK resident but only pay tax on the British – rather than worldwide – income. Murty resigned her non-dom status for income tax purposes shortly afterward. It is possible to retain the benefits of non-dom status even after it has expired or been resigned via an offshore trust.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/infosys-uk-tax-dispute;guardian;business & economy;139
2721;2721;What’s it like to watch someone die? Ask a drone pilot | Adrian Chiles;2023-01-18T16:04:10Z;['Adrian Chiles'];['Drones (military)', 'Military', 'Technology', 'Post-traumatic stress disorder', 'Society', 'Mental health', 'Health'];;"Microphone in hand, making radio, I don’t half find myself in some odd places. The inside of a shipping container, for example. This one was in an aircraft hangar at an RAF base somewhere in England. What it contained was the cockpit of a drone flying high above Syria and Iraq. For company in there, as I remember it, I had the pilot, the person in charge of firing whatever weapons this drone carried and a lawyer whose job it was to advise on who and what were legitimate, legal targets. And there was an RAF press officer, of course – I hadn’t just snuck in there. I don’t want to get into the morality or otherwise of drone warfare here – you may or may not be minded to put inverted commas around the words “legitimate” and “legal” above. It’s just that this whole fascinating, unsettling, disorientating experience came back to me during the furore over Prince Harry’s book and what he had to say about his experience of visiting death and destruction upon, it is to be hoped, legitimate and legal targets from Apache helicopters. One of the drone pilots I met on that RAF base contacted me a few years later. By then, tormented by post-traumatic stress disorder, he said he had been medically discharged and was being refused compensation on the grounds that he had not been “exposed to death”. His point was that death, in appallingly high definition, is precisely what he had been exposed to, as he saw the before, during and after of the Hellfire missiles he was unleashing. “When you are killing the enemy, you see it in so much detail because you are watching them, sometimes for hours or even days on end, then lingering afterwards, watching the impact of what you have just done. Your brain can’t tell the difference between 3,000 miles and three feet,” he said. It fascinates me that, seen like this, technology might be taking us back to something approximating what warfare was once all about. That is, while not engaged in hand-to-hand combat, nevertheless having to see at close quarters your enemies dying. While more acts of war have become detached – long-range missiles and so on – in the interests of precision some have become devastatingly intimate. I think this is what our prodigal prince was getting at with his thoughts on the “chess pieces” he was toppling. As my pilot said: “This takes us back by about 300 years to a man with a crossbow targeting the enemy: you feel like you are only a matter of feet away. You’re seeing everything in detail – and that’s the problem.”
I wonder if the dark sides of social media will take us to the same place. In the analogue age, haters were in the main restricted to hating face to face – in physical or emotional combat. Then along came texting and Twitter and whatnot, and the means of delivery widened. The cruise missiles and cluster bombs of online abuse have visited untold harm but at a distance and, at the moment of impact, out of sight of the perpetrators. What comes next? What’s going to be analogous to drone pilots being forced to see exactly the impact of their actions? Perhaps smartphones will be equipped to monitor the widening of the eyes of the recipient as the online abuse lands. Or their heart rate, or tear ducts. Pardon all this dystopian stuff. Again, it’s down to the beautiful random oddness of radio – I have just been reading A Clockwork Orange at the behest of the chap from Heaven 17 for A Good Read on Radio 4. So blame Anthony Burgess, or Martyn Ware. I’m seeking a ray of light. Perhaps more intimate exposure to the moment of harm will lead to conscience kicking in, or at least a smidgen of squeamishness, to lighten the darkness of man’s heart. Here’s hoping.

3778;3778;UK economy grew by only 0.1% in November;2023-01-13T07:34:07Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Economic growth (GDP)', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Economics', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Office for National Statistics', 'Jeremy Hunt', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Inflation', 'Interest rates', 'Hospitality industry', 'Politics', 'Retail industry'];;"The UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the men’s World Cup. Raising the government’s chances of avoiding a long recession, City economists said hard-pressed consumers had proved more resilient than forecast despite the cost of living crisis. However, business groups warned that the economy was likely to suffer over the coming months as higher mortgage rates and the withdrawal of state support for energy bills begin to hit disposable incomes further. A downturn in the manufacturing sector also limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was significant that the boost to consumer-facing industries, including retail, wholesale and hospitality, had failed to overcome a dramatic loss of sales compared with pre-pandemic levels. “The figures provide further evidence that UK economic growth is heading in the wrong direction despite this period normally being among the busiest for the retail sector. “While month-on-month GDP grew by 0.1%, this is a volatile measure. The three-month average, standing at –0.3%, sends a clearer signal of the current trajectory of the economy,” it said. The ONS said that sectors selling directly to consumers had suffered an 8.5% fall in income since February 2020 and that unlike other G7 countries, the whole economy remained smaller than it was three years ago. Cost of living pressures are likely to become more acute this year as tax rises and the withdrawal of government subsidies take effect.
Ministers are poised to increase unit gas and electricity prices for consumers from April, pushing the average bill to £3,000, up from £2,500. Meanwhile, interest rate rises by the Bank of England mean average annual payments for millions of mortgage holders will increase by £3,000. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the verdict “hangs in the balance” but it was almost certain a recession was coming in the first half of 2023. “Looking ahead, we continue to think that GDP will drop substantially in the first and second quarters of this year.” James Smith, a senior economist at ING, downplayed the prospect of the UK suffering a bigger downturn than other developed nations. “We’re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale,” he said. “And despite the UK’s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren’t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack.” Analysts have warned that some of the trends in the data were difficult to judge after a series of events that distorted the usual pattern. November’s 0.1% rise represented a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, caused in part by the closure of many businesses for the Queen’s funeral. A Reuters poll of City economists predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. Jeremy Hunt said his priority was to bring down inflation to alleviate the cost of living crisis and revive the economy. “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world,” the chancellor said.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/13/uk-economy-grew-in-november;guardian;business & economy;3778
3271;3271;Child mortality from trauma and sudden death rising in England, study shows;2023-01-16T06:00:36Z;['Hannah Devlin'];"['Poverty', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', ""Children's health"", 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Inequality', 'Society', 'England', 'UK news', 'Health']";;"Child mortality from trauma and sudden unexpected death increased last year, according to figures highlighting the stark impact of poverty on child health. The analysis, which tracked all child deaths in England between 2019 and 2022, found overall mortality dipped during the pandemic due to a decrease in infectious illnesses, but that numbers of deaths have since returned to pre-pandemic levels. This included a 32% increase in trauma deaths and a 13% rise in sudden unexpected death in infancy or childhood (Sudic) last year compared with pre-pandemic rates. Prof Karen Luyt, the programme lead for the National Child Mortality Database, based at the University of Bristol, said the figures could be “the first mortality signal” from families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “This is worrying and I think we’re likely to see things getting worse,” she said. “Certainly for childhood illness and mortality, we know there’s a strong social gradient and we know that more families are now living in poverty.”
Sudic deaths are defined as being unexplained and unexpected at the point death is registered, but may be subsequently found to be due to cardiac arrest after infection or an asthma attack, for instance. It is a broader category than sudden infant death syndrome (Sids), where the cause of death often remains a mystery even after postmortem examination. Of the children who died in the Sudic category, four times as many came from the most deprived fifth of the population, compared with the least deprived fifth. The findings cover a period up to March 2022 and Luyt said the team was projecting worse figures for the latest year, given high levels of infection this winter and growing cost of living pressures on families.
Prof Monica Lakhanpaul, at University College London, who has studied the effects of homelessness on child health, said the link between child mortality and poverty was well-established and described the latest figures as a “tragic” result of worsening inequalities. “The poorer the children, the higher the risk of mortality, but nothing’s been done,” she said. “We’re in a high-income country and this is on our doorstep.” Lakhanpaul said malnutrition and unheated homes left children in worse health and less able to fight off infection. And unsuitable accommodation was a growing problem that posed separate risks, she said. Co-sleeping with a baby can be unsafe under certain circumstances, and in some cases families are placed in accommodation without cots or without suitable beds for young children, Lakhanpaul said. “We talk about paterntal neglect a lot … but I see this as societal neglect.” The study, published in the journal Jama Network Open, used data from the NCMD cohort, an initiative to collect detailed information on every child death in England. It covered 9,872 child deaths over three 12-month periods spanning 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022. Of these deaths, 6,257 (63%) occurred under one year of age, the majority (56%) were male (5,534 deaths), and 8,766 (89%) lived in an urban area. There were 3,409 child deaths recorded in England in 2019-20, the first period studied, but this reduced significantly to 3,035, due to fewer infections in younger children during the first year of the pandemic (2020-21). However, since the pandemic (2021-2022), the number has risen again, to 3,428. It is less clear what is behind the increase in trauma deaths, which rose steadily over the whole three-year period, and covers a wide range of causes from car accidents to knife injuries, drowning and accidents in the home. The findings follow a report this week that revealed homelessness may have been a contributing factor in the deaths of at least 34 children in England between April 2019 and March 2022. Dr Laura Neilson, an A&E doctor who led the findings on homelessness, described the figures as “heartbreaking”. “We were shocked by the number of children this initial research identified as dying with them being in temporary accommodation,” she said. “This data shows the children we’ve lost, the families forever changed because of temporary housing and poverty. As a doctor this is a health issue caused by social factors that can be prevented and stopped.” • This article was amended on 17 January 2023 to clarify remarks regarding the safety of co-sleeping with a baby.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/16/child-mortality-from-trauma-and-sudden-death-rising-in-england-study-shows;guardian;health;3271
173;173;‘Monster from the sky’: two years on from coup, Myanmar junta increases airstrikes on civilians;2023-01-31T09:00:42Z;['Rebecca Ratcliffe', 'Min Ye Kyaw'];['Myanmar', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Myanmar coup'];;"It was early evening, and people had gathered at a local pandal in Moe Dar Lay village, in Myanmar’s Sagaing Region, to prepare for a Buddhist novice ordination ceremony the following day. Just as they began to cook, fighter jets appeared in the sky. Then the sound of explosions boomed through the air. “The jets dropped the bombs out of nowhere,” said Naing Ko*, who was just a few houses from the pandal when the attack happened on 19 January. He recalled grabbing his wife and son and rushing to see what had happened. His parent’s home, a few kilometres away, was engulfed in flames. His mother, 68, was among eight people killed. She died instantly.
Military violence intensifies Such attacks have become an almost daily occurrence across Myanmar, where the military junta, which seized power in February 2021, is increasingly launching airstrikes across swathes of the country in an attempt to suppress a determined opposition. A report by Myanmar Witness identified 135 “airwar” incidents over the last six months of 2022 – with each most likely representing more than a single airstrike. “The count of airwar incidents in the report are almost certainly conservative,” said Daniel Anlezark, Deputy Head of Investigations, Myanmar Witness. Regular internet shutdowns, the remoteness of some events and the fear of reprisal all hinder the reporting of airstrikes. The junta, which relies upon Russian and Chinese aircraft, has launched airstrikes in 10 out of 14 of the country’s administrative divisions, according to Myanmar Witness. Schools, medical facilities and religious sites have all been struck. Separate data, collated by the monitoring group Acled, suggests the military increasingly launched attacks from the skies in 2022. According to its data, which are based on local media reports and other sources, the number of asymmetrical air or drone strikes by the military, meaning attacks launched outside battles, more than tripled, to 312 incidents in 2022. Each incident can include multiple airstrikes. People are living in a constant state of fear, said Aung Myo Min, human rights minister of the National Unity Government, which was set up to oppose junta rule. “They call them a kind of monster from the sky,” he said of the airstrikes. Some call the planes, now an omnipresence, “the deadly dragonfly”. On Wednesday, which will mark two years since the military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, its expected that the public will find ways to signal opposition to the junta, and its pledge to hold elections this year. In Yangon, where military violence means it is not safe to take to the streets, “silent strikes”, where the public will stay home, are planned. “One voice and one round. Fight the illegal election by proving your silence,” said the slogan of protest artwork shared online. Since the coup, the military has faced dogged opposition from both peaceful protesters and armed resistance groups, which have received support from some ethnic armed organizations. In September, the Special Advisory Council on Myanmar estimated that the junta had stable control over just 17% of the country – while opposing groups have effective control over more than 52%. The junta’s ability to launch airstrikes, however, gives it an asymmetrical advantage over its opponents. Myanmar’s military is hedging its weaponry portfolio between Russia and China and has moved closer to both countries since the coup – voicing support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and backing Beijing’s claims to Taiwan, said Hunter Marston a researcher and analyst at the Australian National University in Canberra. “They have been relying on their air advantage and using it indiscriminately,” he added.
For Naing Ko, the violence of the airstrike has had a lingering effect on his family and his community. His father, who was out at the time of the airstrike, was hit by shrapnel and remains in hospital. “We have not told him about my mother in case he gets shocked and something might happen to him,” said Naing Ko. “I cannot lose both of them now.” The family can barely sleep at night, afraid the military will come again. Naing Ko’s son, 7, is afraid to be away from his parents. “He becomes shaken as soon as he hears the sound of a gunshot or the word “Sitthar” (soldier),” he says. Scorched earth tactics The military’s strategy of airstrikes has been deployed in tandem with scorched earth tactics. December 2022, a month that saw an above average number of airstrikes, also accounted for the highest number of intentionally lit fires since monitoring by Myanmar Witness began in September 2021, with more than 132 such incidents recorded. Sagaing Region, a heartland of the Bamar ethnic majority, and now a hotbed of resistance, has been heavily targeted by both. Shoon Lei*, who lives in Nyaung Hla village, in the east of Sagaing’s Depayin township, said her area has set alight multiple times. The village was struck by an airstrike last July, only to be burned down six months later on 3 December, and then again on 13 and 25 January. “Our village once had 700 houses, but there are now only a hundred left. We cannot count the list of houses that were burned now, but only the list of the remaining houses,” she said. According to the UN, an estimated 1.5 million people are internally displaced within Myanmar. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has soared, from 1 million before the coup, to an anticipated 17.6 million in 2023. Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a prominent anti-coup activist, said the international response since the coup has been “slow and not coordinated”. She welcomed the assistance given to Ukraine, but noted the same help was not offered to Myanmar. “For resistance forces in Myanmar we don’t get any support, even from our neighbouring countries,” she said. “People are blatantly killed in broad daylight just because they can’t defend themselves.”
Shoon Lei believes Sagaing region is being heavily targeted because of the strength of resistance there. In her village, people are now living in shelters made with burnt iron sheets and palm leaves; they fear there is no point in rebuilding, in case their homes are targeted again. “Everything is temporary in our lives now-clothing, food, shelter. We need to leave these things behind once they enter the village again. Now we put our bedding into bags every morning when we wake up, just to be ready when we have to flee,” said Shoon Lei. Despite the repeated attacks, she vows to defy the military’s attempts to hold elections. “None of us will participate,” she said. “We will make sure they fail.” *Names changed.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/monster-from-the-sky-two-years-on-from-coup-myanmar-junta-increases-airstrikes-on-civilians;guardian;politics;173
2640;2640;Blue review – Thomas Weatherall gives finely tuned performance in gripping one-man show;2023-01-19T04:05:02Z;['Steve Dow'];['Stage', 'Sydney festival', 'Theatre', 'Culture', 'Australia news', 'Heartbreak High'];;"Thomas Weatherall, 22, is best known to television audiences as Malakai, from the reboot of the television series Heartbreak High. In Blue, the play Weatherall began writing in his own high school years, he is on stage alone as Mark, in a fictional work informed by his own experience, which opens a deep vein of trauma. Mark is 20, an aspiring writer who wants to emulate his mother, an unpublished author. He is not her favourite child, but when he moves out of home they begin penning letters to one another – perhaps because writing to him with her painful news is easier than speaking about it.
Blue, which Weatherall wrote as the 2021 Balnaves fellow at Belvoir Street Theatre, is a captivating work, not least because he knows how to hold an audience and work a stage. The set, made of white polystyrene panels shaped like a large wave, is effective, with textured videos of tides and water ripples projected across it. This scenic richness reflects Mark’s happiest childhood memories swimming in the ocean, a salty balm for the depression he began experiencing around age 12. We soon learn that Mark has suffered significant losses and worsening mental health from his adolescence onward. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Weatherall’s relatable, accessible performance as Mark makes the events feel drawn from real life. However, while Weatherall has spoken in interviews of his own experiences with depression and learning to manage his mental health, he emphasises Blue is a “very personal fiction”. The author’s intention is to produce a “kind of unprescribed therapy”, to spark discussions about grief, untimely death and suicidal ideation.
Weatherall moves gracefully across the set, perhaps reflecting years of the Kamilaroi performer’s childhood dance training and the influence of the play’s director, Deborah Brown, a Bangarra Dance Theatre alumnus. It is curious to reflect that he considers himself introverted off stage, as he boldly removes his singlet and splashes about in a water-filled moat eventually revealed in the set’s floor. Weatherall’s keen sense of physicality is matched by a wide acting range finely calibrated to his writing’s rhythms and quite a few surprisingly funny lines that land just as they should. Just occasionally, Weatherall speaks too fast when portraying Mark’s more anxious moments, and as gripping as the work is, the script reveals its first tragedy a little too soon. The basis of the relationship between Mark and his mother is also little underwritten: why, for instance, does Mark say she looked at him sorrowfully, as though he had disappointed her? Two actors are credited in the roles of the mother and Mark’s brother, John, but they are only seen as subtle elements in the final edit of the projections: a blurred torso shot and a pair of hands disappearing below the water surface. Putting them in the program seems odd, creating a false expectation that their characters will be developed in some way, or that the play might shift from its monologue structure.
I also wanted more on Mark’s happy times with John, from whom he was inseparable. With only 10-and-a-half-months’ difference in their ages, they were dubbed with the non-sequitur “Irish twins”, says Mark, although “we knew fair fuckin’ well we weren’t Irish”. Ultimately, however, Weatherall’s performance, strong in its brave vulnerability, is life-affirming, even if loss has left his creation jaded beyond his years and feeling “love is like a car crash you can’t look away from”. For in the blunt words of Mark’s brother John: “Life may be shit, but it’s also pretty great. It’ll get better.” Blue is at Belvoir Street Theatre until 29 January, as part of Sydney festival In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

4519;4519;Zambia has killed the death penalty, but other rights remain on death row |  Sishuwa Sishuwa;2023-01-09T06:15:09Z;['N/A'];['Global development', 'Zambia', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Capital punishment', 'Law'];;"When President Hakainde Hichilema announced in May 2022 that Zambia would soon abolish the death penalty, few took him seriously. Not only had he said little about it before, but he had shown a lack of urgency in honouring his election pledges to repeal repressive laws that undermine Zambians’ human rights and fundamental freedoms. Many were therefore caught by surprise on 23 December, when he made the pledge a reality, deservedly attracting plaudits from rights groups. The death penalty was introduced in colonial Northern Rhodesia in 1931 as the punishment for anyone convicted of murder, treason or aggravated robbery. It was given effect by the criminal procedure code (CPC) two years later, backed by article 12 of the country’s bill of rights, unchanged since 1963. Since independence from Britain in 1964, Zambia has executed 72 people, with 380 currently on death row. The country’s founding president, Kenneth Kaunda, sanctioned 64 executions, while his successor Frederick Chiluba approved eight. Since 1997, Zambian presidents have refused to sign execution orders, choosing instead to commute sentences to life imprisonment. The removal of capital provisions from the penal code is a positive step that marks the end of the use of a cruel, inhuman and degrading method of punishment. It also makes Zambia compliant with the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Also on 23 December, Hichilema assented to the repeal of a 1965 law on defamation of the president, which made it an offence – punishable by up to three years’ imprisonment – to publish “any defamatory or insulting matter … with intent to bring the president into hatred, ridicule or contempt”. This provision had been used to deter criticism through the threat of arrest and numerous convictions, including under Hichilema’s presidency. Its abolition is a victory for free speech and another positive step towards the promotion of human rights. However, the president has left a number of repressive laws on the statutes. A key example is the Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Act, which was hurriedly enacted by the Edgar Lungu administration on the eve of the 2021 election, allowing the authorities to tap and confiscate electronic devices without proper safeguards. Some Zambians are already facing prosecution for breaching this law under Hichilema, who, in opposition, had promised to repeal it as his first act in office. Another example is the Public Order Act, requiring any person who intends to convene a public meeting to give at least seven days’ notice, and conferring discretionary powers on the police to ban a meeting if they are unable, for any reason, to manage it. This colonial-era law has long been used in Zambia to restrict rights to assembly and free speech. Under Lungu, meetings of opposition parties and peaceful demonstrations by civil society were repeatedly curtailed. Violations are punishable by up to six years’ imprisonment. Even the Penal Code Act, yet another colonial-era relic, contains provisions that criminalise libel and outlaw homosexuality, while its text is full of derogatory terms such as idiot, imbecile, vagabond and prostitute. None of this is arcane knowledge. Hichilema came into office when the statutory Zambia Law Development Commission had just finalised a 10-year comprehensive review of the penal code and the CPC. The commission handed its report to the minister of justice last February and recommended the immediate removal of several archaic provisions that restrict human rights, including capital punishment and the criminal defamation of the president. A year later, the government is yet to provide any clear roadmap for comprehensive legal and constitutional reforms. The removal of the insult law and the death penalty – the latter of which is a change opposed by the majority of Zambians (one consultation found that nine out of the country’s 10 provinces favoured retaining it) – occurred only after western pressure. Since the president has weakened civil society by co-opting into government nearly all the civic leaders who acted as a check on power under Lungu, the pace and direction of legal reforms appear to be at the mercy of western powers and actors. These include the US, the EU, the UK, and a gaggle of advisers from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, who have been working with the president’s office since March 2022. Western influence on policy remains a thorny matter. It has led to important reforms, but raises challenging questions about how to untangle good outcomes from bad process. A law on access to information – defined by the UN as “the right to seek, receive, and impart information held by public bodies”, and widely accepted as a core part of freedom of expression – was promised yet not delivered by successive governments. Hichilema’s has followed suit, raising questions about the president’s commitment to fighting corruption; he has refused to publish the value of his assets despite being elected on a platform of accountability and transparency. The failure to release his net worth is especially concerning given his extensive business interests and makes it difficult to work out to what extent his economic policies are benefiting companies in which he has a stake. Hichilema’s sporadic delivery of promised democratic reforms is part of a wider failure to act on his election pledges, including subsidising agricultural fertiliser, reducing the cost of living, tackling corruption, resolving problems in the mining industry that have left tens of thousands of jobs under threat, and addressing persistent shortages of drugs and other medical supplies in public hospitals. The resumption of crippling 12-hour daily power cuts has made a mockery of his assurances only a few months ago that his administration had ended the energy crisis. In this context, public opinion of Hichilema in Zambia contrasts with the praise he is receiving from the west.

4448;4448;Students face £1,500 inflation shortfall in maintenance loans, universities warn;2023-01-09T13:03:28Z;['Sally Weale'];['Students', 'Universities', 'Student finance', 'Education', 'Higher education', 'England', 'UK news'];;Hard-up students in England, who are struggling to pay their rent and bills as the cost of living soars, will lose out on as much as £1,500 a year if maintenance loans fail to keep up with inflation, university leaders have said. The warning from the Russell Group of universities came as the government prepared to announce loan increases for 2023-24, amid fears that growing numbers of students will drop out because they cannot afford to stay in higher education. Maintenance loans are taken out by students, in addition to loans for tuition fees, to cover their living costs while they study, though many take on part-time work alongside their degree to supplement their loans. The reason for the shortfall, the Russell Group says, is that the Department for Education (DfE) calculates annual increases to maintenance loans using out-of-date projections, which do not take into account sudden increases in inflation from factors such as the pandemic and war in Ukraine. University leaders say government forecasts have been inaccurate in each year since 2020-21 and with no mechanism in place to correct for inflation, it means a “significant real-terms cut” has been baked into the system. According to Russell Group calculations, if the DfE increases loans in line with the most recent projection for inflation for the first quarter of 2024 – for example 2.8% – a full-time student living away from home outside London will receive £9,978, which is £1,523 short of the £11,501 the loan would be had it increased by the actual rate of inflation. Prof Charlie Jeffery, the vice-chancellor of the University of York, said universities have been providing additional support to help students through grants, emergency loans and other financial packages. “Now it is time for the government to step up through Covid-style hardship payments and a meaningful increase to maintenance loans. “For some students, this is going to mean the difference between going to university or not, between continuing their studies or not. If we don’t see this support from the government, we fear more and more students will have to make significant sacrifices in their studies, compromising their education and impacting on their mental health.” Sultan Chaudhury, the union development officer at the University of Nottingham students’ union, said financial hardship was not just confined to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. “Students from middle-income households, with limited access to bursaries or scholarships, have also become increasingly vulnerable as parents are now unable to compensate for the growing gap between maintenance loan value and real living costs. As a result, we have seen an increase in students undertaking additional work alongside their studies.” The Russell Group is calling on the government to increase maintenance loans so they reflect actual inflation and to make the change in-year to help students who are struggling with the rising cost of living. University leaders also suggested a review of the parental earnings threshold, which has been frozen at £25,000 since 2008, which means fewer students are entitled to the maximum level of support each year. Many would also like to see the reintroduction of maintenance grants for those in most need. The Russell Group chief executive, Dr Tim Bradshaw, said: “Students are struggling with the rising cost of living and while our members are doing what they can to help, including investing millions of pounds in hardship support, we are concerned about the impact on students’ wellbeing and their studies. “It’s particularly frustrating to see those challenges exacerbated by the use of a model that means students are set to be £1,500 worse off next year, especially when it can be so easily fixed and it relates to a loan that is paid back by the student.” A DfE spokesperson said the government increased the amount students can access through loans and grants for living and other costs every year, and universities could draw from a £261m fund for students facing hardship, which is available this academic year through the Office for Students.;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/09/students-face-inflation-shortfall-maintenance-loans-universities-warn-england;guardian;business & economy;4448
1862;1862;Coalition playing ‘spoiling game’ with Indigenous voice to parliament, Noel Pearson warns;2023-01-23T02:15:03Z;['Lorena Allam'];['Indigenous voice to parliament', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Labor party', 'Liberal party', 'Anthony Albanese'];;"The Coalition’s demand for more detail on the Indigenous voice to parliament is a “complete diversion” and a “spoiling game” that threatens to end the chance for reconciliation for ever, the First Nations leader Noel Pearson warns. Pearson, one of the key architects of the Uluru statement from the heart, says the details were a matter for parliament to determine after the referendum on the voice. “The referendum is about the constitution. Legislation is for the parliament,” Pearson told ABC radio.
Pearson said that the shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, “may be just choosing to play a spoiling game”. “It’s very concerning,” Pearson said. “I hope they are not.” He said 2023 was “the most important year” for reconciliation since the arrival of the first fleet. “We’ve got to understand what is at stake – and that is the chance for reconciliation,” Pearson told ABC radio. “And if the referendum is kiboshed through game playing and a spoiling game by the opposition, we will lose the opportunity for ever.” Leeser, the Coalition’s leading supporter of the voice to parliament and its spokesperson for Indigenous Australians, has warned the Albanese government was in danger of “losing him”. He urged the government to share more information on the voice to help supporters make their case. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It is very hard to explain how it will work when the government is not providing the detail,” he told a Young Liberals convention on Saturday. Pearson said the Coalition had been in power for nine of the last 12 years and after commissioning a 2019 report on how a voice to parliament would work have had “three years to generate their version of the detail and they didn’t do it”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Monday said more detail would be released by the referendum working group, which is due to meet again on 2 February. Guardian Australia understands more information about the process of the vote will be released soon after. Albanese said the opposition has had more than six months to comment on the government’s draft wording of the referendum question, announced at the 2022 Garma festival. “There hasn’t been any suggested changes to that draft from the Coalition.” A group of Indigenous leaders from 14 communities across Australia wrote to Albanese and Dutton at the weekend asking them to “show leadership” and find common ground on the voice. Their letter warned the nation is “at a crossroads” on the issue. “To close the gap, it is local people not just politicians who need to have a say,” they wrote. Ian Trust, a Gidja man and chair of the Indigenous leaders group Empowered Communities, said every prime minister since John Howard has supported the need for recognition of First Nations people in the constitution. “Are the politicians really saying they can’t work together now, in the lead-up to the referendum, to prepare the details that can satisfy both parties for when we need them after the successful referendum?” Trust said.
Fiona Jose, a Kuku Yalanji and Torres Strait Islander woman from Cape York and another signatory of the letter, said if the Coalition does not support the voice constitutional recognition, “it is not because they have the answers for Australians, or for Indigenous people”. “Twenty-one of 26 years in government with much failure and backward momentum is testament to that,” Jose said. Jose urged politicians to take a non-partisan approach to the Indigenous voice to parliament, “which will give us a say in matters that impact our lives”. “That’s the commitment we need now from all political leaders – our expectation is that you will work together,” she said. The letter is signed on behalf of Aboriginal community leaders from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and the NPY Lands in South Australia and the Northern Territory.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/23/indigenous-voice-to-parliament-referendum-noel-pearson-warns-coalition-spoiling-game;guardian;politics;1862

3210;3210;California’s rainstorm hell ‘among the most deadly disasters in our history’ ;2023-01-16T11:00:06Z;['Dani Anguiano', 'Gabrielle Canon'];['California', 'Flooding', 'Extreme weather', 'US news'];;"As more dangerous storms bear down on California, the state is only just beginning to grapple with the destruction and death left by weeks of extreme weather that wreaked havoc in nearly every region from the northern coast to Los Angeles. The series of storms that have pummeled California since late December have killed at least 19 people, brought hurricane force winds that toppled trees and power lines, cutting energy to thousands, and flooded roads and rivers, covering swaths of land in dense mud and debris that stretches for miles. Entire communities have been forced to evacuate while road closures and power disruptions left some rural regions isolated and almost cut off from the outside world.
Authorities are still documenting the toll of the disaster, an effort that’s been hampered by a fresh onslaught of more storms. Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations from 41 of California’s 58 counties. “These storms are among the most deadly natural disasters in the modern history of our state,” Nancy Ward, the director of the governor’s office of emergency services said at a briefing on Friday. After a grueling drought and California’s driest years on record, the latest turn of extreme weather, which some experts have called hydrological “whiplash”, has highlighted the challenges that come with such a rapid deluge, particularly in a state more accustomed in recent years to disasters related to heat and wildfire.
California has received an average of more than 9in of rainfall since late December and some areas have already seen the amount of rain they typically get in the entire year, according to the National Weather Service. But one of the greatest impacts from the recent weather is also the intense and widespread wind damage that far exceeds that seen during typical wind events, climate scientist Daniel Swain said in a video update on Friday. In central California’s Calaveras county, a tornado with 90mph winds uprooted a barn. “This has been a deadly storm sequence. The damage will probably be at least in the hundreds of millions if not higher before all is said and done,” Swain said. “And the disruption to people, even people who have stayed relatively safe – there are a lot of folks who have been without power and without road access to where they live for a long time.” ‘Catastrophic impacts’ The damage wrought by the storms could be seen in central California’s San Luis Obispo county where search and rescue teams have spent days trying to find a missing five-year-old boy who disappeared in floodwaters. In photos posted online, the sheriff’s office showed the thick mud, brush piles and debris teams have trudged through while searching for Kyle Doan.
Doan was swept away after floodwaters overtook the car he was traveling in with his mother. There were no signs on the road warning of closures, his father told the Guardian, and water rapidly overtook the vehicle, pulling it toward a nearby creek. As the pair evacuated the vehicle, the currents pulled the kindergartner from his mother’s arms and forced her underwater. Residents were able to rescue Lindsy Doan with a rope, but the water quickly carried Kyle away before rescuers could get to him. “Days have now gone by, we still haven’t found him yet,” Brian Doan said on Thursday. “We went over there today about a mile downstream from where my wife was picked up and you can just see the aftermath the water receded there’s just so much debris that was wrapped around trees.” The storms also highlighted the grave risks extreme weather poses to more than 116,000 people living outdoors in the state. Two unhoused people in Sacramento died earlier this month when trees fell on to their tents. “It’s horrifying. You’ve got 7,000 people or more trying to survive the rain and high winds. The little survival gear they have – it gets blown away pretty easily,” Bob Erlenbusch, the executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness, told the Guardian. “People get wet, their belongings get wet. These are really difficult conditions.”
The impacts of the storms have been far-reaching. More than 96,000 people were placed under evacuation orders or warnings as the National Weather Service issued flood watches for roughly 90% of the state’s sprawling population. Hundreds of harrowing water rescues had to be performed by emergency workers as submerged streets shuttered highways and other transportation corridors. On the central coast, more than 10,000 people were ordered to evacuate seaside towns last week, including all of Montecito – the wealthy community that is home to Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities. Officials in Santa Barbara shut down schools and public transit systems due to the extreme weather. Further south in Los Angeles, a sinkhole swallowed two cars and flooded a downtown transit hub. The storm also caused a sewage spill of more than 14m gallons into the Ventura River, prompting authorities to post warning signs along the river and beaches. Workers with Cal Trans have spent recent weeks clearing trees, rocks and mud from state highways after the storms closed as many as 60 roads. “We’re doing everything we can to keep the highways open,” the department’s deputy director Michael Keever said Friday.
With rain expected through the week, authorities are warning Californians to listen to local officials, stay aware of their surroundings and not attempt to drive or walk in water – just 6in of fast-moving water can knock over and carry an adult while just a foot of water can carry away a small car. “We’re not out of the woods – we expect these storms to continue at least through the middle of next week with a minimum of three more atmospheric rivers hitting our state,” Governor Gavin Newsom said as he toured the damage in Santa Cruz, just south of the Bay Area. “California is soaked and even an inch more of rain can bring catastrophic impacts like flooding and mudslides.” The rains did do some good, offering a reprieve from the state’s devastating drought conditions. Reservoir levels rose significantly this week and the snowpack swelled significantly, which will secure the state’s water resources through the spring and summer. But new dangers lurk in the seasons ahead. Vegetation seeded during these winter storms can quickly turn to wildfire fuel when the weather warms and dries. For now, the sodden state waits in anticipation for drier days, when the immense cleanup process can commence.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/16/california-weather-rainstorms-deadly-atmospheric-river;guardian;environment;3210
7906;7906;When bread becomes deadly - paying the allergy premium in a cost of living crisis;Saturday 21 January 2023 01:41, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];['cost of living'];['costs', 'price', 'premium', 'living', 'weekly', 'deadly', 'bread', 'glutenfree', 'food', 'allergy', 'allergies', 'cost', 'crisis', 'paying'];"For most people, the type of bread they buy is rarely a matter of life and death.

But for millions of Britons living with allergies eating the wrong food could see them hospitalised - or worse.

Amid the rising cost of living - and spiralling food prices that mean customers are left with little change from a fiver for a mere loaf of specialist bread - it is these families facing particular pressure.

Cost of living latest: What does inflation falling mean for interest rates?

The Bolton family, from Southampton, faces a double whammy of food restrictions.

Eli, aged 14, is allergic to dairy and soya while his older sister, Darshi, aged 17, has coeliac disease - which means a single crumb of gluten can leave her feeling like ""all her internal organs are being squeezed"".

This means the family cannot eat something as simple as the same loaf of bread.

A comparison of foods by Allergy UK in December found it costs on average 157% more for some free-from alternatives.

Bread had one of the sharpest price differences, with the allergy alternative up to 254% more costly.

""All gluten-free bread normally has egg or soya in it,"" said mum Lisa. ""So I have to buy two loaves.

""We have to have different milk, we have to have separate butter - my daughter has to have her own butter because the smallest grain of bread will make her so ill, so she can't even use the same knife.""

And getting it wrong can quickly turn deadly.

""My son has anaphylaxis so he could potentially die if he ingested dairy or soya,"" said Lisa, adding that they are ""generally not taken seriously, and that breaks my heart"".

Image: The Bolton family

Families spend an extra 40 days a year dealing with allergies

All of this specialist food comes at a cost.

The Food Standards Agency found food hypersensitivity households - those living with a food allergy, intolerance and coeliac disease - spend an additional 12 to 27% more on their weekly food shop.

They also spend an additional 40.37 days per year on activities related to food, including researching, shopping for suitable items and discussing their condition.

For Lisa, there is no such thing as a single weekly shop.

""I have to go to at least three on a weekly basis,"" she told Sky News.

When her son was first diagnosed she said she ""could have cried every time"" she stepped into a supermarket.

The number of products that listed food as ""may contain"" was ""soul-destroying"", she said.

While some people living with allergies may be able to eat food that is made in the same factory - and labelled ""may contain"" - for those with more severe reactions, this is not possible.

Around 2.6 million people in the UK live with a diagnosed food allergy, affecting between five and seven percent of children.

From pre-baking birthday cake and freezing it so her four-year-old daughter isn't left out, to providing her own sweets at the end of term, Rebecca Bull is always on alert to the risk of allergies.

""I think of every scenario where food might crop up, but occasionally you miss something.

""I've been at a party where an entertainer just threw sweets out to the kids, I hadn't anticipated that.

""And when you do that to a four-year-old, the temptation is massive. She just grabbed one and I had to jump up straight away.""

Why it is more expensive

""When manufacturers and brands swap out ingredients, the allergen-friendly option will often be more expensive,"" said Bari Stricoff, a registered dietitian.

""This is due to the increased difficulty in sourcing the ingredients, as well as the demand.

""Your average gluten-free flour will be nearly double the price as the standard flour, and almond flour could be 3x as high as the standard plain flour.

""Many allergen-friendly foods are produced by speciality brands.

""Because these are often smaller or newer brands, it means their costs are higher. They're not able to produce their items at scale and struggle to get into the larger retailers. This means they’ll have higher price tags to cover their margins.""

Image: Darshi and Eli Bolton

Knives, forks, and extra dishwashing

Hand-in-hand with the need to buy different food for each child comes a hidden energy cost.

""We have the cost of cooking most things twice,"" she said.

""If we cook pizza, we have to do them in two separate ovens.

""If we are making sandwiches to go out, we have to use about five different knives because you have to use a different knife for each person.""

Alongside that comes the extra fuel cost for the multiple supermarket visits.

Shopping with allergies - how to keep costs down Bari Stricoff, a registered dietitian who works at WellEasy – an online platform aimed at making specialist diets easier – advises buying in bulk and cooking from scratch to keep costs down. ""Sometimes, stocking up on the specific ingredients you need can be a cost effective method,” he told Sky News. ""When something is on offer or it makes financial sense to avoid multiple shipping charges. ""If you need to avoid specific foods due to an allergy or intolerance, cooking from scratch is a great option. ""An IBS friendly far of pasta sauce can cost you £3.95, where you can make it at home in double or even triple quantities for half of the price."" WellEasy stocks 3,500brands and offers 35% off the RRP to members, with filtering options to find the best food for allergies and intolerances.

'We don't have a choice': Food on prescription

In England, some gluten-free bread and flour mixes are available on prescription, although this can be a postcode lottery.

While Darshi does qualify, Lisa said: ""When you go to the chemist you have to order in batches of 20 loaves, so it's not practical to do that.

""And then when you order stuff they can't tell you when it's coming in.""

There is currently no similar programme for those living with food allergies.

""I think it should be anybody who has food restrictions,"" said Lisa.

""I understand that it's more expensive for manufacturers to make. So they should have some help in bringing it into line with everybody else.

""Because it's not a choice. We don't have any choice.""

52 fewer bagels: The allergy premium

Holly Holland, co-founder of Financelle - an online financial wellness platform, said she is ""new to the allergy and intolerance game"" and can't eat gluten or lactose.

""People don't realise how much stuff they are in,"" she told Sky News.

""Even if you pick up a pack of Doritos, lactose is used as a coating and powder. It's in cakes, it's in biscuits.

""And nine times out of 10 the package will just say 'may contain' anyway, so if you are battling a serious allergy, you can't even risk it.""

Image: Holly Holland

For Holly, bagels are a prime example of the allergy premium.

A pack of five from Asda costs her 95p, yet going gluten-free will set her back £2.50 for a pack of four. That's 63p a bagel compared to 19p.

""If I bought a pack of bagels each week for the rest of the year that's £130 compared to my gluten-eating friends forking out just £49.40,"" she said.

""And I would have 52 less bagels in 12 months.""

She said bread items are some of the most expensive because they are so ""heavily processed"".

The extra costs have forced Holly to be more creative with cooking.

""Arguably, it forces you to have any more fresh things because you can just pick up a packet of fish fingers or whatever it might be,"" she said.

But her weekly shop, which used to be around £40 for a family of four (with top-ups during the week) has now gone to £60.

Over the course of the year, this seemingly small amount adds up to £780 extra.

'It's not a good thing the gap has narrowed'

Sarah Knight from The Allergy Team - who also lives in an allergen household - said when the basics of your weekly shop remain so high, it's hard to keep costs down.

""Whether that's fortified dairy-free milk, whether that's gluten-free or wheat-free bread or dairy-free spread, when they are so high then makes it really hard to get the sort of overall price of your shop down.""

The organisation tracked the price of 10 of these basics at the four main supermarkets last year.

Food inflation hit a record annual rate in December as cash-strapped households prepared for Christmas.

""At the beginning of last year the allergy stuff was going up disproportionately higher,"" she said.

""Now that other food has sort of caught up. It's not a good thing that the difference between an allergy basket and a non-allergy basket now is narrower because it is only because the non-allergy basket has also gone up.

3;3;Everton’s barren window prompts angry fans to protest at training ground;2023-01-31T23:26:52Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Everton', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Everton endured a dreadful end to the transfer window with numerous attempts to strengthen Sean Dyche’s relegation-threatened squad resulting in failure and angry fans gathering outside the club’s training ground in protest at the board’s ongoing mismanagement. The new manager wanted two attacking additions to help in the fight for Premier League survival but none were forthcoming as Everton ended the window as the only top-flight club not to make a signing in January. Everton are in talks with the former Swansea and West Ham forward Andre Ayew. The 33-year-old Ghana international is a free agent after his contract with the Qatar club Al Sadd was recently terminated by mutual consent and can therefore sign after Tuesday’s deadline.
Despite promises from the owner, Farhad Moshiri, that Everton would secure a much-needed striker in January, the club ended the window with a weaker squad than when it opened. Anthony Gordon was sold to Newcastle for an initial upfront payment of £40m but the money was not reinvested in a team that have struggled for goals all season and are immersed in another relegation battle. Everton had a bid worth £20m plus add-ons rejected for the Udinese striker Beto Betuncal. The 25-year-old’s release clause is in excess of £30m but Everton refused to increase their offer and, with no time to find a replacement, the Italian club refused to lower their valuation. A loan move for Watford’s Ismaïla Sarr was rejected, despite Everton proposing an obligation to buy the Senegal international in the event of staying up, while the Rennes winger Kamaldeen Sulemana, a longtime target of director of football Kevin Thelwell, chose to join Southampton for a club record fee rather than move to Goodison Park. Nathan Jones’s side also completed an £18m deal for the Genk forward Paul Onuachu, who had been offered to Everton. Michy Batshuayi rejected the turmoil at Goodison to stay with Fenerbahce while Thorgan Hazard preferred a loan move to PSV Eindhoven. Conor Gallagher did not want to leave Chelsea for a relegation struggle while a late move for the Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta also failed.
Everton had accepted their striking options needed to improve before Frank Lampard was sacked and missed out on several targets before deadline day. Kevin Schade, Georginio Rutter and Danny Ings joined Brentford, Leeds and West Ham respectively while Arnaut Danjuma, having agreed a loan move from Villarreal, refused to submit his registration form to the Football Association when Lampard was dismissed and joined Tottenham 24 hours later. The shambolic end to a fruitless transfer window prompted some fans to visit the club’s Finch Farm training complex late on Tuesday to express their anger at the board.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/barren-window-leaves-everton-with-a-weaker-squad-for-relegation-scrap;guardian;sports;3
3690;3690;Ange Postecoglou’s VAR complaints feed familiar Old Firm biases;2023-01-13T14:20:23Z;['Ewan Murray'];['Scottish League Cup', 'Celtic', 'Kilmarnock', 'Rangers', 'Aberdeen', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Ange Postecoglou'];;"Boredom will reach Ange Postecoglou eventually. Any manager or player with aspiration of competing in a challenging environment, where there are more than two horses – at most – sees life beyond Celtic. Had Postecoglou not arrived in Glasgow with a reputation for occasionally taking issue with the sporting world, onlookers would be entitled to sense the Australian is already chasing self-created excitement. Postecoglou claimed he was more interested in his dinner options than Rangers’ appointment of Michael Beale. Harmless enough and a decent soundbite but bordering on petty. Shortly before Christmas, Postecoglou railed against the general failure to “differentiate” between his Celtic team and Rangers. The grouping together of the Old Firm is apposite; no other side have been Scottish champions since 1985. Ticket pricing alone tells us Celtic and Rangers have long since realised theirs is a partnership that is good for business. Yet Postecoglou, over this utterly trivial point, expressed unhappiness.
Postecoglou’s reaction to VAR’s October arrival in Scotland was literally to laugh it off. “I’m totally ambivalent to it,” he said. “That stuff doesn’t rock my boat.” Suddenly there is motion in Postecoglou’s ocean. Last week he described Scotland’s version of VAR as “a bit of a mess”, which is causing “confusion”. Celtic’s manager believes there is no chance of decisions levelling themselves out owing to a handful of calls he is adamant have unreasonably gone against his team. Only days earlier, before Celtic travelled to Ibrox, Postecoglou told the media he could “deal with” any decision-making “mistakes”. One debatable penalty call later, Postecoglou changed tune entirely. The frenzy had been fuelled, which turned focus on a 2-2 draw desperately low on quality. Postecoglou has of course ignored acts of officialdom that have worked in Celtic’s favour, including since VAR’s introduction. They do exist. He has also fallen into the trap of using binary language to assess application of the – entirely subjective – laws of the game. So too, incredibly, did the Scottish Football Association’s chief executive, Ian Maxwell. “VAR across the world has taken the number of correct decisions from 92% to 98% and that is exactly where Scotland is,” Maxwell claimed. It was a baffling comment, bereft of context. Football exists with grey areas.
This is a country that, even before VAR, had an unhelpful and unhealthy interest in the mechanics of refereeing. Postecoglou’s newfound angst plays into the hands of a noisy chunk of his club’s support who believe Scotland’s football authorities – including referees – are out to get them. Fans will spend this weekend obsessing over VAR calls not only in Celtic’s League Cup semi-final meeting with Kilmarnock on Saturday but when Rangers face Aberdeen on Sunday. Celtic pander to the same group when briefing that they are pursuing “clarity” over VAR; it is apparently beyond executives at a business of this supposed stature to put their name to a statement or address the media over what precisely they want. The notion that Celtic or Rangers are hard done by when it comes to refereeing calls triggers roaring laughter among followers of other teams. Given the on-field gulf between the clubs – Celtic remain Scotland’s dominant force, with Rangers scrambling – perhaps manufactured grievance is deemed necessary. Which does not prevent it from being tiresome.
None of this is to suggest VAR has been a success story in Scotland. Far from it. Its arrival during a season – agreed to by clubs – was bizarre. A series of penalties were awarded from October to the World Cup break, largely for handball, which would never have been granted early in the season. Competitive fairness is therefore open to question. Those in high office screamed about the value of the paying fan when desperately trying to reopen turnstiles during Covid. And yet no widespread canvassing of supporters over this project was undertaken. The in-game experience for spectators has been consistently – and Postecoglou is correct here – muddled. Scotland’s lack of refereeing resources and the added demands created by VAR mean top officials are spread far too thinly. The sense that matches are being refereed by an individual in the VAR compound has been unavoidable. Limits on technology inside stadiums and cameras at games that are not subject to live broadcast are additional problems. There are many who would rather this scheme were ditched. That group, crucially, does not include the referees who want their broader status assisted by routine use of VAR. Rangers have been conspicuous by their silence. No wonder, Celtic’s fans will say; the Ibrox club have not had a domestic penalty awarded against them since January 2022. It is a remarkable run, a statistical anomaly, which feeds entirely into injustice harboured across the city. As and when Rangers concede a penalty, their support will cite pressure towards referees from Celtic. History tells us Rangers will not be slow to act should referees and VAR not perform the way they would desire. In 2019 Rangers issued a stinging statement against the referee Willie Collum, who was duly not seen at one of their fixtures for months. Job done. Steven Gerrard was one game into his Rangers tenure when bleating about perceived historical injustices. Celtic have the personnel to comfortably see off Kilmarnock, who are rated 20-1 shots to prevail in 90 minutes. It would be a shock if Rangers do not earn a final berth at the expenses of Jim Goodwin’s floundering Aberdeen. An Old Firm League Cup final would whet appetites while only encouraging the kind of background noise that is growing ever louder.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/13/celtic-ange-postecoglous-var-complaints-feed-familiar-old-firm-biases;guardian;sports;3690
2081;2081;Elizabeth Holmes tried to ‘flee’ US with one-way Mexico ticket, prosecutors say;2023-01-21T17:42:37Z;['Maya Yang'];['US news', 'Mexico', 'Theranos', 'World news', 'Technology', 'Elizabeth Holmes'];;The disgraced founder of Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, made an “attempt to flee the country” by purchasing a one-way ticket to Mexico after she was found guilty on four counts of fraud last January, according to prosecutors. In the new filing on Thursday, prosecutors said that “contrary to defendant’s assertion that she has a ‘flawless record with US Pretrial Services’ and claim that no evidence suggests she will flee while she pursues her appeal … the incentive to flee has never been higher and defendant has the means to act on that incentive.” “As an initial matter, defendant’s record with Pretrial Services and the court does not account for her attempt to flee the country shortly after she was convicted. The government became aware on 23 January 2022, that Defendant Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on 26 January 2022 without a scheduled return trip,” it said. Once the government became aware of Holmes’ planned trip, prosecutors emailed Holmes’ attorneys. In an email sent from Holmes’ legal team to the government, which ABC News reviewed, Holmes’ attorneys said: “The hope was that the verdict would be different and Ms Holmes would be able to make this trip to attend the wedding of close friends in Mexico.” “Given the verdict, she does not plan to take the trip – and therefore did not provide notice, seek permission, or request access to her passport (which the government has) for the trip. “But she also had not yet cancelled the trip, amidst everything that has been going on. We will have her do so promptly and will provide you confirmation.” Prosecutors in the filing said that “it is difficult to know with certainty what defendant would have done had the government not intervened”. They also revealed that Holmes’ partner William Evans departed on the scheduled date with a one-way ticket. Evans did not return until about six weeks later “from a different continent”. Evans’ activities during the trip were not disclosed by prosecutors. In November, Holmes was sentenced to over 11 years in prison over her role in Theranos, the blood testing firm she founded which was once valued at over $9bn and was later discovered to be mostly fraudulent. Holmes was convicted on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In a statement prior to the sentencing, federal judge Edward Davila condemned Holmes and Theranos, calling the whole debacle a “fraud case where an exciting venture went forward with great expectations and hope, only to be dashed by misrepresentation, hubris and plain lies”. During Holmes’ sentencing, she was ordered to self-surrender to prison on April 27. The new filing comes as part of prosecutors’ argument that Holmes, who is currently pregnant with her second child, should start serving her prison sentence instead of living on a California estate with an alleged monthly upkeep of over $13,000, prosecutors claim.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/21/elizabeth-holmes-mexico-plane-ticket-prosecutors;guardian;science & technology;2081
6473;6473;Excess deaths reach highest level since pandemic peak - how much are NHS failings to blame?;Thursday 5 January 2023 17:51, UK;['daniel dunford', '@danieljdunford'];['data and forensics', 'nhs'];['failings', 'week', 'excess', 'level', 'blame', 'data', 'hours', 'delays', 'average', 'ae', '12', 'deaths', 'pandemic', 'peak', 'highest', 'number', 'reach', 'nhs'];"Almost 2,500 more people died in the week to 23 December than expected, 20% more than the five-year average for the same period, new figures from the ONS reveal.

It's the highest number of additional deaths in a week since February 2021, during the pandemic's most deadly period.

There have been over 30,000 more deaths than expected in the past six months alone, equivalent to 1,155 a week.

Even excluding the 8,000 deaths caused by COVID in that period, there are an average of 848 more people dying every week than the average from 2016-19 and 2021 (excluding the pandemic-affected 2020).

Analysis from LCP Actuaries suggests that a significant number of these deaths could be due to the current NHS crisis and delays in emergency treatment.

More deaths at home

Many of the recent excess deaths are occurring at home, as opposed to in hospitals or care homes.

In the week to 23 December, 1,120 more people died at home than usual, 37.5% higher than the five-year average.

In total over the past six months 81,804 people have died at home, 19,270 (30.8%) more than the five-year average from 2015-19. That's a much bigger difference than the change in other settings.

Stuart McDonald, Head of Longevity and Demographic Insights at LCP Actuaries, said that while part of the increase in deaths at home could be attributed to NHS delays, it can also be attributed to patient preference.

""During the pandemic more people decided they wanted to live out their final days at home rather than in hospital where access from friends and family may prove difficult. This trend has continued, supported by the NHS.

""As well as this, working from home has potentially allowed more people to give full-time care to seriously ill relatives instead of requiring care homes or other support.

""However there are more sudden deaths where the fact they are occurring at home is more concerning. Waiting times for Category 2 ambulances - those for things like heart attacks and strokes - have been over an hour rather than the 18 minute target.

""We don't know how many of these additional deaths at home are the 'acceptable' kind led by patient preference and how many are those concerning ones.""

The data on where this balance lies doesn't exist as yet, but Mr McDonald said England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, was aware of the issue and trying to find out more.

Why are these extra deaths happening?

As well as these potential extra deaths at home, analysis by LCP Actuaries suggested that as many as 500 deaths a week could be caused by delays in A&E.;

In November, almost half of people attending major A&Es; had to wait more than four hours to be seen - the worst level on record. And more people had to wait over 12 hours to be admitted to hospital after being assessed in A&E; than did over 10 years from the start of 2011 to end of 2020.

The LCP's 500 deaths a week are based on an academic study which showed that for every 72 people waiting 12 hours to be admitted to hospital after arriving at A&E;, there would be one additional death.

Multiplying this number by the number of waits over 12 hours produces a figure of 497 deaths a week attributed to long A&E; waits alone. This is still lower than the total number of excess deaths we're seeing at the moment.

A spokesperson for NHS England told Sky News they didn't recognise the figures: ""While services are under significant pressure across the NHS, there are a number of different reasons why we may see higher mortality levels than normal, including from things like inclement weather and rising population numbers.""

Rising population numbers are taken into account by the Continuous Mortality Investigation. Instead of using the average from previous years for their baseline, in their calculations they project the number of deaths expected.

Using these figures the number of additional deaths in the week to 23 December would be 2,170 (18%). That's slightly lower than the ONS figure, but still represents a really significant number of people dying in just a week, who would still be alive in more typical circumstances.

Mr McDonald also told Sky News that the figures LCP attributed to A&E; delays are likely to be a low estimate rather than too high.

Due to data limitations they didn't include people who waited between four and 12 hours, which the study also suggests leads to extra deaths (although at a lower rate).

And the one in 72 figure they used is for waits of exactly 12 hours. There are likely to be more deaths when people wait longer than 12 hours - of which there have been thousands.

What's happening in other countries?

NHS England chief strategy officer Chris Hopson has pointed out that the UK isn't the only country experiencing a higher number of deaths than normal at the moment.

He said: ""We won't know [if delays at A&E; are causing the excess deaths] that until we've done the detailed work, which we're in the process of doing.""

""We are seeing, like Germany, like Italy, like Spain, we are seeing higher levels of mortality than we would expect. But we know that's due to a number of different factors.""

Figures from Our World in Data suggest that other countries have indeed seen excess deaths in recent months, although most not to the same extent as the UK.

The level of excess deaths in Germany remains similar to the UK's, but the likes of Italy, Spain and France have been lower more recently.

Each percentage point difference is equivalent to thousands of additional people dying each year.

2334;2334;Zar Amir Ebrahimi: ‘If you lose everything, it’s easier to rise up’;2023-01-20T11:00:36Z;['Emma Graham-Harrison'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Women', 'Feminism', 'Cannes 2022', 'Oscars 2023', 'World news', 'Oscars'];;"Fourteen years before she was named best actress at Cannes, Zar Amir Ebrahimi sat alone in her flat in Tehran, contemplating the wreckage of her life and wondering if she had the strength to keep going. An intimate video of the actor and her boyfriend had been stolen by a man she once considered a friend, and was being sold on streets across the country. Iranian authorities were drawing up a criminal case. Sex outside marriage is illegal in Iran, and she faced lashes and years in jail if convicted. Ebrahimi was only 26, and even if she was spared prison, she knew she would never be allowed to act again inside the country. She drew on that shattering experience for her award-winning performance in Ali Abbasi’s thriller Holy Spider, as the journalist Arezoo Rahimi, who hunts down a serial killer in the north-east Iranian city of Mashhad. The cops have been largely ignoring the murderous spree on their patch, because the attacker targets only sex workers and claims to be “cleansing” the area around Iran’s most sacred shrine. Meanwhile, Rahimi’s own career in Tehran has been derailed by misogyny, after her editor sexually harassed her, and office gossips turn the assault into an “affair”. She channels this fury into a reckless search for justice for the women of this dusty pilgrimage city. “It is strange, sometimes I [almost] kill myself to interpret a character, but this film didn’t happen like that, I knew it. She existed in me,” says Ebrahimi, from her home in Paris. Perhaps not surprisingly for a woman who had her privacy so brutally stolen, she gives nothing away; visible behind her is only a blank white wall. “I think I found the reason and the motives [for her character risking her life to find the killer] in myself, in my life,” she says. “I lost everything once, and then at some point when you lose everything once, it’s easy to lose and lose and rise up again, and that’s life, that’s the adventure of life.”
She also recognises Rahimi’s fierce will in the young women and men who have taken to Iran’s streets to demand their rights since last autumn, in the most widespread uprising against the Islamic Republic since it seized power in 1979. The movement was sparked by the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, detained by morality police who said she was not properly covered up. Holy Spider, which is based on a real case, was written, shot and released before the movement began. Watched now though, it is impossible not to see the film as prophetic, a skewering of a rotten system and a celebration of defiance, particularly women’s defiance in the face of heavy costs. “When you see you have nothing to lose, and you have no future and you have no hope … why don’t you fight for your satisfaction for five minutes in your life? I think this is the thing that happened to Iranian people everywhere,” she says. “But maybe women first of all. Because as women in Iran you are suffering every day.” Ebrahimi understood with a terrifying intimacy from her own ordeal, how Iranian authorities police women’s lives and their bodies, plus the toll the system tries to extract from those who defy it. Some of the protesters have been killed in the streets, or hanged in prisons after perfunctory trials. Thousands have been beaten, detained, or simply disappeared. But Ebrahimi also knew the freedom that comes from deciding to claim her independence. Her performance has helped carry the film to the Oscars, where Holy Spider is up for best foreign language feature, submitted by Denmark, director Abbasi’s home country. The role would seem to have been written for Ebrahimi: delicate but steely, battered but never broken by the daily battles of life as a woman in Iran, the reporter’s character informed by her own trauma. In fact her brilliant turn was a very last-minute accident. She spent three years working as a casting director on the film, looking for a younger, more physically strong actor to fit Abassi’s original vision. But that was a struggle. The film, shot entirely outside Iran, was always likely to be controversial inside the country for its caustic depiction of the authorities. The script also required Rahimi to appear with her hair uncovered in a couple of scenes, which would end the domestic career of any Iranian actor. Dictators perhaps understand the power of art better than demagogues of the democratic world, who so often mock “elite” culture. Dictators are afraid of it, and persecute those who make it. Still, Iranian actors gambled on joining the cast. “I have so much respect, especially for Mehdi Bajestani [who plays the serial killer Saeed Hanaei],” Ebrahimi says. “He really put his life at risk, he can’t go back now to Iran. He has no papers, no work … But he did this for something much more precious.”
However, the Iranian actor who had signed up to play Rahimi, opposite Bajestani, got cold feet, and pulled out a week before shooting started. With the production in jeopardy, Ebrahimi stepped up. She already knew Rahimi, because she had helped shape the character over years, pouring her own experience in to the crafting of everything from interrogation scenes to the reporter’s #MeToo backstory. “The most important thing I brought to this character when I took the role, I think, was my [physical] weakness,” Ebrahimi says. “I just found a balance between the way she should be determined, and the way she is weak in this society, and she is fighting for something that maybe will never happen. With every step she takes there is a problem, with everyone in this society. It seems exaggerated but it is like this [in Iran].” Ebrahimi brought her own most profound traumas to the role. During the filming of one improvised scene, where Rahimi goes undercover as a sex worker, she is asked her name. After a second’s pause, the pseudonym Ebrahimi alights on is Zahra, the name she used professionally, then left behind in Iran. “Just in that moment I thought symbolically, I, as Zahra, was judged by people the same as these prostitutes,” she says. “Even my closest friends, the whole society, in exactly the same way, no one wanted to hear me, no one wanted to know the story. They just judged me.” But part of the strength that animates Ebrahimi and the journalist she plays is their absolute refusal to accept society’s judgment of their lives and their values. That determination was evident even as her world fell apart in 2006. It was, she says now, “all about the night that I decided to stay alive”, the third night after she found out her private tape was circulating. She cried as she wondered how to break the news to her parents, and grappled with the reality that images of her naked body were being watched by tens of thousands of people.
“Then I just asked myself: honestly, Zar, is it a problem for you, if you don’t think about all this patriarchal mindset? And I thought, no,” she says. “This is my body, I love it, there is nothing more beautiful than having sex with a person you love, and I have nothing to be ashamed of. And then I decided to fight.” She braced for what she now calls the “biggest role I ever had”, a public performance to save her life. It initially included denying, through a Guardian interview, that it was her in the video. “The article saved my life, saved my ass really. Because the government couldn’t touch me. That was the only serious international interview I gave, and it just somehow protected me.” Ebrahimi survived repeated interrogations by security forces, then decided to flee into exile in France, to avoid jail and the lashing that would come if she was found “guilty”. Adapting was difficult. Her next film, White Paradise, is about an Afghan refugee crossing a mountain border into France, pursued by vigilantes, another role that spoke to her. “I heard about this Afghan girl who is [struggling to] cross borders, and I thought this is just exactly what I experienced in France. I was invited by the French government to live in this country, but for 15 years my whole life was a fight just to cross this [internal] border. “In France I didn’t have any time to think. I had one year without work, without money, without anything,” she says. “I had two, three friends, and that’s all.” They counselled her that, as a refugee, she should settle for something more practical, but she was determined to find a way into the film industry of her new home. “Somehow, through everything I stayed connected to cinema,” she says. “I learned how to work with a camera, how to edit. I did everything to not get any distance from this community. “My friends said to me many times: quit cinema, do something else,” she says with a wry grin. As so often in a life lived with fierce independence, she refused anyone’s counsel but her own. “I think that’s why I am alive. I just won’t ever say goodbye to cinema.” Holy Spider is in cinemas now.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/20/zar-amir-ebrahimi-holy-spider-interview;guardian;entertainment & culture;2334

5052;5052;Union fury as Rishi Sunak unveils anti-strike laws for ‘minimum service levels’;2023-01-05T19:42:11Z;['Pippa Crerar', 'Kiran Stacey'];['Industrial action', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Keir Starmer', 'Grant Shapps', 'Trade unions'];;"Rishi Sunak’s new anti-strike legislation to enforce “minimum service levels” in key public sectors including the NHS and schools has drawn a furious reaction from unions as the prime minister scrambles to get a grip on industrial disputes. The law, which the government plans to introduce in the coming weeks, will allow bosses in health, education, fire, ambulance, rail and nuclear commissioning to sue unions and sack employees if minimum levels are not met. However, government sources said that plans in the original bill, drawn up by the former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg – for tougher thresholds for industrial action to take place – would be dropped amid concerns over possible legal action. Keir Starmer said he would repeal the anti-trade union legislation if Labour formed the next government, setting out clear dividing lines with the Conservatives on workers’ rights in the run-up to the next general election. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: “Yet again, Rishi Sunak abdicates his responsibility as a leader. Whatever the latest scheme the government comes up with to attack us, unions will continue to defend workers.” Under the plans, first proposed by Liz Truss’s government, minimum service levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services, with the government consulting on the adequate level of coverage for these sectors, to address concerns that disruption to blue-light services puts lives at risk. However, it will also reserve the power to impose minimum service levels in the other three public services – health, education, nuclear – although ministers expect to reach voluntary agreements in these areas and say they would only impose the anti-strike law if this were not possible. Government sources confirmed that union members who were told by their employers to work under the minimum service requirement but refused to do so could lose their jobs. The new law will also back employers bringing an injunction to prevent strikes or seeking damages afterwards if they go ahead. The Guardian has learned that even the government has admitted its approach of using minimum service levels to curb strikes could backfire. In an impact assessment published last year, the transport department said the move could push unions into striking more frequently as a way to put pressure on employers. The same document also warned that it could lead to workers taking more non-strike industrial action, such as refusing to work overtime, which could still cripple certain industries. Ministers claim the plans are about ensuring public safety, in the case of the health service, rather than attacking the unions. However, nurses came to their own national agreement about providing a minimum level of service during recent strikes. The ambulance service did not, meaning some patients suffering a heart attack or a stroke did not know there was help on the way. The business secretary, Grant Shapps, who has previously taken a hardline position towards unions, said: “As well as protecting the freedom to strike, the government must also protect life and livelihoods. “While we hope that voluntary agreements can continue to be made in most cases, introducing minimum safety levels – the minimum levels of service we expect to be provided – will restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption.” With the country still facing further strikes this winter, which the new law would come in too late to prevent, ministers are also urging unions to cancel planned industrial action, suggesting that if they do so then pay rises could be on the table next year. Ministers invited union leaders to hold talks on next year’s pay review in an attempt to resolve current disputes “constructively through dialogue”. Sunak has already ruled out pay demands for this year despite millions of workers struggling with the cost of living. After a new year speech in east London, Starmer said: “I don’t think this legislation is going to work. I’m pretty sure they’d had an assessment that tells them that it is likely to make a bad situation worse. “We will look at what they bring forward but if it’s further restrictions then we would repeal it. The reason for that is that I do not think legislation is the way you bring an end to a dispute.” Unison’s head of health, Sara Gorton, said: “The public and health staff would welcome minimum staffing levels in the NHS every day of the week. That way, people wouldn’t be lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “But limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers when there are record vacancies in the NHS show proper patient care isn’t what ministers want. “The government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and their unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said: “A government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country.
“The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff, and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public.” The general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, Pat Cullen, said curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action was “always undemocratic” and the union would look closely at the government’s plans next week. She said: “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round, not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in the NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. Legislation exists in other parts of the UK and England is lagging behind. “The evidence is unequivocal: safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/05/uk-ministers-announce-anti-strike-legislation;guardian;politics;5052
8901;8901;Molly-Mae Hague reveals baby daughter's unique name;Tuesday 31 January 2023 18:43, UK;[];['molly-mae hague'];['reveals', 'fury', 'tommy', 'daughters', 'love', 'hague', 'island', 'bambi', 'youtube', 'instagram', 'world', 'unique', 'mollymae', 'baby'];"Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague has revealed her baby daughter's unique name is Bambi.

Announcing the news on Instagram, the 23-year-old shared a photo of her week-old baby laying in a crib in a nursery that featured the name Bambi in light-up lettering on the wall.

It was simply captioned with her daughter's name, followed by a white love heart.

Although the post initially allowed users to comment, the function later disappeared – suggesting Hague had opted to turn them off.

Her partner and father to Bambi, Tommy Fury, didn't post a name announcement on his feed at the same time, but did share a sweet message and photo on his Instagram story.

""The best mummy in the entire world. Watching how you take care of Bambi makes me love you more than I knew I could,"" he wrote, sharing a picture of Hague and their baby in hospital.

""You're everything I could have ever dreamed of for a mum and role model for our perfect girl. Thank you for making my dreams come true babe, I love you.""

""Luckily, when I met Tommy and I told him the name I've always dreamt of using, he absolutely loved it too,"" she said.

The pair, who met on the fifth series of ITV show Love Island, announced the birth of their first child on Monday, saying she was born on 23 January.

'I'll protect you forever'

Hague said becoming a mum was the ""best thing to ever happen"" to her.

""There is no feeling like holding you in my arms little one, my heart literally explodes,"" she said on Instagram.

""Thank you for entering this world safely for us and blessing us with the gift of being your parents. We promise to love and care for you conditionally forever.""

Fury, 23, added: ""I'll protect you forever, my little girl"".

3378;3378;Postpartum psychosis: new mothers speak out over need for support;2023-01-15T12:26:52Z;['Rachel Hall'];['Pregnancy', 'Family', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Parents and parenting', 'Mental health', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Northern Ireland', 'Scotland', 'Depression'];;"Orlaith Quinn was an outgoing, vivacious mother of two until halfway through her third pregnancy, when she became uncharacteristically withdrawn. She raised her anxiety in checkups, but doctors told her this was normal. When she became manic after giving birth and told her family she had tried to kill herself three times, she was assessed by a psychiatrist who determined she was not a suicide risk. Quinn had developed postpartum psychosis, which has good recovery rates, but an inquest determined earlier this year that her death in late 2018 at Belfast’s Royal Jubilee maternity hospital was “both foreseeable and preventable”. Her husband, Ciaran, believes that if the hospital had a specialist mother and baby unit, “the culture in the hospital would have been different”, and staff would have been more aware of and experienced in dealing with perinatal and postnatal mental health problems.
“It’s an absolute crime Northern Ireland doesn’t have a mother and baby unit – there are various in England, Wales and now Scotland. Why did the women here not have that service – why should women here suffer? Why are they not treated as equal? Why don’t they have the same services when we’re governed by the same people? It blows my socks off,” he said. The number of women dying in pregnancy or shortly after giving birth in the UK has risen sharply, with women three times more likely to die around the time of pregnancy compared with those in Norway. Suicide is the leading cause, accounting for 18% of deaths, and the WHO has now warned that the cost of living crisis is exacerbating the picture. A coroner ruled that there had been multiple failings in the hospital’s handling of Quinn’s case: she was diagnosed with obsessional neurosis, although the psychiatrist noted that postpartum psychosis couldn’t be ruled out. Despite this, she was not given medication or moved to a psychiatric ward, and was left unsupervised in a room. The impact of Orlaith’s death on the Quinns has been devastating. “The grief completely consumed me and overwhelmed every cell of my body to the point I couldn’t function day to day,” said Ciaran. “The nature of her death, how quickly it happened, how unforeseen it was for us and given my baby daughter was only one day old, I didn’t think I would ever come back from it,” he said.
Toni Evans, from Swansea, has seen first-hand the impact a mother and baby unit can have. She developed postpartum depression and psychosis after giving birth to her daughter in 2019. At the time, there were no units in her area, , one of the UK’s most deprived, or even in the whole of Wales. She had to travel 180 miles to Derbyshire to receive appropriate care, and believes if she had been unable to do that “100% I would not be here today”. While she was lucky to obtain weekly perinatal mental health appointments, she rapidly deteriorated after her daughter’s birth and developed suicidal thoughts. After a psychiatric evaluation Evans was placed in a mixed mental health unit in her local hospital, which she found a “scary” experience as she was separated from her daughter and surrounded by very unwell patients. “I didn’t feel like I belonged there. I felt I was already losing the bond with [my daughter] Sarah and I think us being separated made me deteriorate even further.” She was sent 180 miles away to a mother and baby unit in Derbyshire, which she found “fantastic” and a more comfortable and accommodating environment. However, travelling so far from home was upsetting: “I most remember going into that minibus and seeing my husband waving his newborn daughter and wife away and he was crying. That will stick with me for ever.” She remained there for seven weeks, but said she would have “struggled more” had it happened during the cost of living crisis. “We’re not made of money, we get by OK, but my husband had to keep filling up the diesel every time he came up, and in seven weeks that’s a lot to get through. Derby were great in putting my husband up in a hotel, but he had to feed himself and my little boy, they had to pay for breakfast, lunch and dinner.” Evans has since campaigned for a mother and baby unit to be opened in Wales, and there is now one at Tonna hospital in Swansea. “I hope there are no mothers who have to make that decision of going into another country, it adds a lot more pressure.” Sarah*, from Glasgow, is lucky to have access to a mother and baby unit after she struggled with suicidal thoughts during her first pregnancy, but she is worried her financial situation will take a further toll on her mental health now that she is about to give birth to her second child. “I’m on benefits because my mental health was so poor I couldn’t stick with a job, and I want to go back into training but I can’t because I have a child and I won’t be able to afford to do that. You’re trapped in this cycle and it’s really damaging,” she says. She lives with her soon to be four-person family in a small two-bedroom housing association flat in central Glasgow, and dreams of having a garden to play in with her children, but she can’t afford private rentals. She can no longer afford her coping mechanisms, such as paying for the bus fare to enjoy green space. “It’s quite terrifying how much your mental health can be affected when you’re pregnant. When my [first] wee girl was born I had images in my head of drowning her in the bath by accident, it was really awful, but it helped having people you felt you could talk to about that and get support,” she says. Without that support she thinks “my life would be finished”. The team is monitoring her carefully, but she worries about going into hospital for treatment, as her husband would have to stop working to look after the children. “I feel there’s a bit of me that wouldn’t be as honest because I’m so determined to stay at home because I’m needed here so much.” *name has been changed In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2930;2930;Plymouth shooting inquest: family of gunman speak of devastation at killings;2023-01-17T17:31:51Z;['Steven Morris'];['UK news'];;"The family of a gunman who killed five people, including his own mother and a three-year-old girl, in Plymouth in 2021 have spoken of their devastation and told an inquest jury that they wished they could turn back time to prevent the tragedy from happening. Jake Davison, 22, killed his mother, Maxine Davison, 51, after an argument. He then shot dead four others, among them Lee Martyn, 43, and his three-year-old daughter Sophie – who was pushing a buggy with a teddy inside as they walked the family dog, in the 12-minute attack. Stephen Washington, 59, and Kate Shepherd, 66, were also killed on the evening of 12 August 2021 in the Keyham area of the city before Davison, an apprentice crane operator, turned the pump-action shotgun on himself. At the start of inquests into Davison’s five victims at Exeter racecourse, pen portrait statements were read to the jury on behalf of the families of those who died. Josh Davison, the gunman’s brother, said his family was “appalled” by his actions. “We are grappling to understand and manage our own health, emotions and bereavement,” he said. “We think we share the feelings of despair, hurt and loss of the Martyn, Washington and Shepherd families knowing that it was a member of our family who was responsible for their loss. “No words can describe the pain or heaviness of feeling this situation has caused. Our involvement in this inquest is to help prevent this from happening in future; an event like this cannot and should not ever happen again. “If we had one wish, it would be that we could turn back time and allow everyone who had a part in the events leading up to this tragedy an opportunity to make changes to prevent it from happening at all.” The inquest was told that Davison had a firearms licence. This was revoked in 2020 but his shotgun was returned to him not long before the killings. In the statement, which was read by the barrister Nick Stanage, Josh Davison described his mother, who had worked on fishing trawlers, as a “complicated person”. He said: “She was thoughtful but impulsive. Reserved and quiet on the one hand, creative, adventurous and able to attract attention, on the other. “She was very much an independent, free-spirited soul and really was one of a kind. Sometimes unpredictable and stubborn and very much dancing to the beat of her own drum.” He said she was “slight and petite” but “could go off like a firecracker”, adding she had felt “safe and settled” in the cul-de-sac where the shootings began. Rebecca Martyn, the wife of Lee and mother of Sophie, described how they were killed by Davison as they walked their family pet. She said her husband was a talented footballer who had trials with professional clubs before beginning work as a carpenter at a yacht manufacturer in Plymouth. Martyn, a hospital worker, said: “Lee would protect his family if he was ever confronted with a violent situation” and described Sophie as “daddy’s princess”. On the evening of their deaths Lee and Sophie had taken their British bulldog, Mabel, for a walk, and Sophie pushed her buggy with her teddy in it. “It was a purple scruffy looking buggy and Sophie will always place either a doll or a toy in it,” Rebecca Martyn said in a statement read by her barrister Dominic Adamson KC. “I now know that Sophie had taken a teddy in the pram – a beige teddy wearing a white and green checked scarf.” Rebecca Martyn was out taking her son to a gym lesson and getting some shopping when she said a friend texted her at 7.14pm to say something was going on. Later that evening police told her that her husband and daughter had been fatally shot. Stephen Washington, a carer for his wife, Sheila, was shot dead as he walked his dogs, Poppy and Drift. Sheila Washington said she heard some bangs but thought it might be fireworks or children messing about. She said: “Then I heard a bang on the front door. I opened it and Poppy came running into the house with her lead still attached. She was shaking. Not long after that I started hearing sirens … Never could I imagine losing him in such horrendous circumstances.” John Shepherd, the husband of Kate Shepherd said he went to look for his wife, an artist, when she failed to answer her phone and came across the scene of the shooting. “A whole team of people from the emergency services were working on someone. It was Kate,” he said. “There were screens around her and I could only see her feet.” He added: “Her empathy, compassion and care for others was outstanding. I have made thousands of decisions in my life, but the best by far was marrying Kate.” The inquest continues.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/plymouth-shooting-inquest-family-of-gunman-speak-of-devastation-at-killings;guardian;entertainment & culture;2930
4378;4378;Fabulous felines: why female artists love stroking, painting and spoiling cats;2023-01-10T06:00:38Z;['Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett'];['Art', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Women', 'Cats', 'Pets', 'Society', 'Painting', 'Photography', 'Tracey Emin', 'Pablo Picasso'];;"When Tracey Emin’s cat Docket went missing in 2002, the “Lost Cat” posters she pasted around her east London neighbourhood were pilfered and valued at £500. Her gallery, White Cube, argued that they didn’t count as works, though some art historians said otherwise. Whomever you believe, they still occasionally turn up on eBay. It is Emin’s self-portrait with Docket that I love the most, however. (That and her handmade cat photo book, Because I Love Him, a dream art purchase should I ever make it rich.) In the photograph, Docket faces the camera with that deadpan, slightly morose expression that is particular to cats, his impressive whiskers shooting out beyond the artist’s fingers, which frame his face as she nuzzles him from above. It’s a strikingly maternal image, and indeed Emin has in the past referred to the cat, who has sadly now left this earthly plane, as her “baby”. It comes in a long line of artistic depictions of women or girls with cats.
Cats are almost as old a subject for visual art as art is itself – there are felines painted in the Lascaux cave. In antiquity, they graced ancient Egyptian tombs and the mosaics of Pompeii. The old, old association between cats and fertility, and their status as mother-goddesses from the ancient Egyptian Bastet to the Greek Hecate, means that women and cats have been seen as interlinked for millennia. So it’s no surprise that they have been so often paired together as a subject by everyone from Morisot to Picasso, Matisse to Kirchner, Kahlo to Freud. They pop up in annunciations by Rubens, Barocci and Lotto, representing femininity, domesticity and sometimes the devil – or what the Jungian psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz calls the “feminine shadow”, the dark side to the Virgin Mary, the mother of God. It’s no surprise that cats appear so frequently in paintings: artists tend to love them, maybe because they are so defiant and independent. Plus, it is easier to paint while caring for a cat than a dog: they do not require walking, though they can still get in the way, as a gorgeous photograph of the painter Lois Mailou Jones standing at an easel with a kitten on her shoulder shows. Leonor Fini, meanwhile, kept two dozen cats, so it’s no surprise that their fur sometimes ended up melded with the paint on her canvases.
There are some fabulous photographs of Fini with her pets. In a 1961 portrait by Martine Franck, her wild dark hair is an eccentric counterpoint to the white cat’s refined appearance, while in another image she is shown wearing an evening gown as she kneels to feed six cats in her kitchen. Dora Maar’s image is perhaps the most deliberately erotic. Fini wears a sort of low-cut corset, and a long-haired black cat is held between her open legs in a visual pun that is not lost on the viewer. As anyone who has owned one knows, cats are promiscuous and unfaithful, roaming the streets at night in ways that women historically could not, and in Japanese art cats and courtesans sometimes come hand in hand. One netsuke even shows two cats embodying the figures of sex worker and client. Maar, meanwhile, was a cat woman herself, and when Picasso painted his lover with a black cat on her shoulder, it could be read as a symbol of her sexual, passionate self. Their relationship was tempestuous, and Maar’s clawlike hands, to me at least, seem to allude to those of a cat. I used these images as a sort of visual mood board while I wrote my memoir, The Year of the Cat, which is about how adopting a cat made me think differently about motherhood, but also has a strong art-historical line running through it on the theme of female artists and their cats. One of the first paintings I saw of a woman with a cat was at school, by the artist Gwen John. In Girl with a Cat (1918-22), the subject sits with a black cat nestled in her arms. The young woman gazes off into the distance, her expression almost desperately sad. The cat, meanwhile, gazes directly at the viewer with yellow eyes. John loved her cat, Tiger, and when he went missing, she slept outside in the hope of tempting him home; like Emin’s Docket almost a century later, he did eventually return. The love that John felt for her cat, when she was so unhappy in love of the more human variety, has moved me ever since. Two of Picasso’s earlier pictures of women and cats have a similar emotional effect. In his 1900 Woman with Cat, the subject bends forward in her bed towards the small cat that she holds in her arms, as though trying to take solace in it. Meanwhile, his 1901 Nude with Cats, sometimes called Madwoman with Cats, feels to me merciless in its depiction of its vulnerable subject. In my book, I look at the myth of the “crazy cat lady”, which has its origins in the fear of witchcraft, and how it has been used to stigmatise single and childless women. This image, painted in an asylum, felt too uncomfortable to include, but I held it in my mind as I wrote.
Far more cheering are Suzanne Valadon’s cat paintings. Another cat lover – she used to feed them caviar – Valadon painted her cat Raminou several times, as well as other cats. Though she treats them with the respect due to a proper subject for a painting, there’s a playfulness in the way she conveys their stony expressions. She succeeds in capturing the daft haughtiness that is essentially the essence of cat. Her pictures of women with cats are even better, 1919’s Jeune Fille au Chat being my favourite, perhaps because the girl in it looks so happy to be holding the animal, while the animal itself appears to be merely tolerating the interaction, reminding me of my own cat Mackerel’s standoffish nature. To see Valadon herself with her cat – in this case a white one – we must rely on Marcel Leprin’s painting of her, in which she wears a formidable expression. She may not have claws, but much like the animals she so loved, Valadon, a laundry maid’s daughter who astonished Degas with her talent when she showed him her drawings, was rebellious and not to be trifled with – a far cry from the demure dancer she played when modelling for Renoir. That male artists should use cats as a means of eroticising the objectified female nude will come as a surprise to no one. In Félix Vallotton’s La Paresse, a naked woman is sprawled on a bed, her hand extended to stroke the cat. In a Masaya Nakamura photograph, we see only the curve of her backside and her pointed feet as a black cat gazes in the direction of her genitals. I’d far rather Pierre Bonnard’s more humane depiction of an irritated-looking woman, sitting fully dressed at the table with a plate of food while the “demanding cat” of its title harasses her. Or even better, Lotte Laserstein’s 1928 Self-Portrait with a Cat, wherein her head-on gaze appears to challenge the viewer as the disgruntled-looking animal she holds in her lap seems ready to pounce if necessary. It’s as though they are both daring you to say something: call Laserstein a crazy cat lady at your peril.
You could say that cats and artists have something in common: both groups have historically maligned and refused to adhere to the rules that society attempts to impose upon them. Women artists have, of course, been especially marginalised, and how one might go about juggling a creative career with motherhood remains a perennial question, one of the many I pose in my book. Emin, who does not have children, has said she would have resented leaving her studio for them if she had any. It would be rude to suggest that a cat can be a kind of surrogate child, had Emin not made this explicit herself. Centuries after the witch-hunts, the love that women – particularly childless women – have for cats is mocked and stigmatised to this day. That is why I take such delight in the photographs of Brooke Hummer, who asked various cat women to pose in the style of historical paintings, their styles ranging from 19th-century colonial to surrealist. These funny, celebratory images subvert the shaming stereotype of the cat lady. My favourite is a pastiche of a medieval painting of the Madonna and child, but instead of a baby, the Virgin Mary holds a tabby cat. Laugh if you like, she appears to be saying, but cat love is real love.

2138;2138;Ex-Arizona governor’s illegal makeshift border wall is torn down – but at what cost?;2023-01-21T11:00:07Z;['Melissa del Bosque'];['Arizona', 'US-Mexico border', 'Republicans', 'Wildlife', 'Environment'];;"Truck horns blasted and red dust billowed beneath the blue Arizona sky as surplus army trucks sped up and down a road along the US-Mexico border, hauling shipping containers out of the Coronado national forest. Piles of dirt and oak trees, bulldozed by construction crews, dotted the grassland of the San Rafael valley, south-east of Tucson, known as a vital wildlife corridor.
Former governor Doug Ducey had planned to build 10 miles of border “wall” made up of double-stacked old shipping containers through the federally protected forest.
But local residents and environmental groups occupied the construction site, running out the clock in December on Republican Ducey’s waning days in office. Ducey, under threat of litigation from the Department of Justice, finally agreed to remove the rusty hulking barriers installed near Yuma in the west and Sierra Vista in the south-east of the state. Environmentalists are now warning that the damage already done to the areas will require a huge recovery effort. Erick Meza, borderlands coordinator for the environmental organization Sierra Club, said a lack of accountability over the project means more destruction. “We just want to make sure that no further damage is done to the land due to the reckless operation of heavy machinery in a fragile desert ecosystem that will take decades to recuperate,” he told the Guardian this week. Now two related lawsuits between Ducey and the federal government are on hold as Arizona’s new governor, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, negotiates the project’s end. In early January, approximately 130 shipping containers near Yuma came down in less than a week. But the nearly 3.5 miles of barrier running across Coronado national forest land could take at least another month to dismantle, according to environmentalists monitoring the removal and damage. On 3 January, the US Forest Service closed off the area, citing concerns over public health and safety. It did so as AshBritt, the Florida-based company that installed the makeshift wall, worked to remove it, outside the gaze of the public or the press. Only five designated monitors from environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Wildlands Network and the Center for Biological Diversity, were allowed into the site, with permits issued by the US Forest Service. The five set about documenting environmental damage and sharing videos, images and notes with Forest Service officials, who will be tasked with restoring the wildlife corridor. It is one of the last on the Arizona border, where endangered jaguar, ocelots and other animals can migrate between Mexico and the US. Late last week, however, the Forest Service canceled those permits, citing safety issues, according to monitors Erick Meza; Kate Scott, who runs the nonprofit Madrean Archipelago Wildlife Center; and Russ McSpadden, of the Center for Biological Diversity. They said they were approached by a law enforcement officer from the Forest Service, part of the Department of Agriculture, who said their permits were no longer authorized.
The day before, Scott said, an armed security guard working for AshBritt had told her to leave. She showed him her permit and the guard, Scott recounted, told her it “didn’t mean shit to him” and warned her that “the Forest Service is coming to kick you out”. Robin Silver, cofounder of the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity, said he believes the permits were canceled because of the environmental harm, and that the federal agency did nothing to stop the construction even though it was illegal. “It’s highly embarrassing for the US Forest Service because of all of the damage that’s now being exposed,” he said. The center filed two lawsuits against Ducey and AshBritt, citing violations of the federal Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The latter is now moot because the barrier is being removed, but the Clean Water Act lawsuit is still active, so ongoing monitoring is needed, Silver explained. He added that damage done by excavators and trucks is “going to take a huge restoration effort”. In August, Ducey cited an “invasion” at the border by migrants seeking haven in the US as the reason for granting AshBritt an emergency no-bid contract to install the containers.
Judy Kioski, public information officer for Arizona’s department of emergency and military affairs, said 1,700 shipping containers will now be removed at a cost of $76.5m. “The containers are being transported to state facilities in Yuma and Tucson until a plan for them is determined,” she said via email. AshBritt’s original contract with the state included $123.6m to install the shipping container walls in Yuma and the Coronado national forest, and the company is now being paid to take them down. The Florida-based disaster remediation firm has given millions to both Democratic and Republican campaigns. The company’s founder and director, Randal Perkins, paid a $125,000 fine in August 2021 for illegally donating $500,000 to the America First Action Super Pac, one of many fundraising political action committees supporting Donald Trump or Trump-like candidates. At the time of the donation AshBritt had a $40m contract with the Department of Defense, and under federal law government contractors are prohibited from donating to political committees. Trump’s Super Pac refunded the money. Meanwhile, sheriff David Hathaway of Santa Cruz county had refused to allow the shipping container barrier in his county, so Ducey turned to nextdoor – and sympathetic – Cochise county instead. “They were violating the law by building on national forest land, they were tearing apart the hillsides,” Hathaway told the Guardian. “And it’s surprising to me that the federal government wasn’t willing to do anything about it. I told them if they entered my county to build it, I’d arrest them for illegal dumping.” It’s unclear how much the federal government will have to spend to repair the environmental damage, or even if it will. “What good are they [the Forest Service] if they’re not going to protect it? It’s still just us out here. We shut down the construction, and now we’re documenting the damage because no one else is,” said Scott.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/21/arizona-border-wall-shipping-containers-enivronmentalists;guardian;environment;2138

2742;2742;Cash for influence inquiry homes in on Brussels meeting days before World Cup;2023-01-18T14:18:53Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['European Union', 'Qatar', 'Europe', 'World news'];;"Belgian police seized nearly €1.5m in cash from homes and hotels in Brussels last month, allegedly paid by Qatar to sway decisions in the European parliament. Now a series of reports have suggested what that money may have been attempting to buy. Investigators have homed in on a meeting of the European parliament’s subcommittee on human rights on 14 November 2022, where Qatar’s minister for labour, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, defended his country’s record on workers’ rights. The meeting took place days before the World Cup in Qatar began. Marri told MEPs that reforms “have been undertaken in a short space of time so it is only natural we face difficulties”, and he criticised what he called “racism” against his country. It was a difficult crowd. MEPs from left and right lined up to criticise Qatar’s labour rights record. One football-loving MEP said he would not watch a single game, while another denounced the tournament as “the World Cup of shame”. Behind the scenes, it seems, Pier Antonio Panzeri, an Italian former MEP who is alleged to have taken large payments from Qatar and Morocco, was attempting to pull the strings. In a significant development on Tuesday, he struck a deal with prosecutors, agreeing to provide information on whom he bribed and the modus operandi of the corruption network, in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. Some confidential details from the investigation have already been reported. According to a judicial document cited by Belgium’s Le Soir newspaper, Panzeri wrote Marri’s speech for the 14 November hearing, advised him on how to position himself and called on old friends in the parliament to ask questions “to lead the minister of Qatar on a known path”. Panzeri is one of four people charged with money laundering, corruption and membership of a criminal organisation. Seated inside the modern, wood-panelled committee room 3G-3 in Brussels on 14 November was his close confidant and former assistant Francesco Giorgi, an Italian parliament staffer, who has also been detained pending trial. A few weeks earlier, the pair are said to have met a Qatari delegation, including Marri, at the Steigenberger Wiltcher’s, a plush five-star Brussels hotel. CCTV from the investigation shows the pair taking the lifts to a private meeting in suite 412 on 9 October. “The aim was to prepare the minister for this hearing scheduled at the parliament. By prepare, I mean explain to him the European point of view and how he should react,” Giorgi told investigators, according to testimony cited by Le Soir. The meeting broke up after an hour and a half. CCTV showed the Italians leaving with “a bag thicker than when they arrived”, according to the investigation report cited by Le Soir. Panzeri correctly anticipated damning criticism of Qatar’s record on migrant workers’ rights from several MEPs when the subcommittee met, and he allegedly made plans. According to the judicial document cited by Le Soir, Panzeri contacted serving MEPs, including Belgium’s Marc Tarabella and Italy’s Andrea Cozzolino, asking them to intervene in the debate. Both are members of the parliament’s Socialists and Democrat group, the former political home of Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP also charged in the case.
This week, the European parliament’s president, Roberta Metsola, launched a process to remove immunity from Tarabella and Cozzolino, after a request from Belgian investigators. In the meeting, Cozzolino apparently veered off script by asking the Qatari minister to provide further clarity on wages and working conditions, but ended by asking how the European parliament could be more involved in overseeing labour standards in Qatar. Tarabella denounced his fellow MEPs, alleging they had failed to criticise Russia and China over the Sochi Winter Olympics and Beijing summer Games. He accused critical MEPs of basing their assertions on outdated information, urging them “to actually respect [Qatar’s] journey”. Neither responded to a request for comment from the Guardian, but both have denied any wrongdoing in the Belgian and Italian press through their lawyers. Tarabella’s lawyer, Maxim Toller, has said his client failed to declare a trip to Qatar in February 2020, but that the MEP planned to rectify this. “Mr Tarabella is very, very clear that he has never received the slightest promise, slightest money or slightest gift in any form whatsoever” to support Qatar, Toller told Belgian TV last weekend. Cozzolino has also declared his “total innocence” through his lawyers, describing the request to lift his immunity as based on “a hypothesis of the investigation”. Authorities are also said to have examined the role of the person chairing the subcommittee that day, the Belgian Socialist MEP Marie Arena. She quit that position last week after it emerged she had failed to declare a visit to Doha in May 2022 paid for by the Qatari government. According to a leaked extract from the investigation team, “Marie Arena benefits from Panzeri’s advice and influence, while the latter uses Arena’s position as chair of the human rights subcommittee to exert his influence.”
Some people at the meeting, who declined to comment publicly, have raised concerns about Arena’s approach. She allegedly ran the meeting to a strict limit, cutting off some critics who overran their time, while not imposing constraints on the Qatari minister. Claudio Francavilla, a senior EU advocate at Human Rights Watch, who was at the meeting, said: “Regrettably, minister Marri seemed to be under no time constraint during the hearing, whereas Human Rights Watch representative Minky Worden only had five minutes to present and one minute to respond. But I have no element to connect such perhaps deferential attitude to any corruption of sorts, and time is always a constraint during committee hearings.” Miguel Urbán Crespo, a leftwing Spanish MEP, told the Guardian he was “not surprised at all” that investigators were studying the 14 November meeting. There were many interventions from MEPs who were “very accommodating” towards Qatar, he said. And he noted what he saw as an unusually large delegation from Qatar’s mission to the EU. “The impression I have is that this meeting is very significant for Qatar,” he said. But Urbán Crespo had no criticism of Arena. He said her chairing of the meeting was “normal” and she allowed his critical intervention to overrun. Arena did not respond to an email and phone calls to her office went unanswered, but in a media statement she has declared her innocence. “I proclaim loud and clear that I am in no way involved in this affair,” she said. She has also described the 14 November hearing as a “transparent and uncomfortable exercise for the Qatari authorities” and said it was “totally impossible” that Panzeri had got something from her, either as committee chair or as an MEP. In a statement to Politico, she blamed her office for failing to declare the May 2022 Doha trip. A lawyer for Panzeri did not respond to requests for comment, and Giorgi’s legal representative declined to comment. Lawyers for Kaili have denied all charges against her. Neither Qatari officials in Brussels nor the labour ministry in Doha responded to questions about the 14 November meeting, but Qatar has previously rejected all allegations. “Any association of the Qatari government with the reported claims is baseless and gravely misinformed,” Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs said last month.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/18/cash-for-influence-inquiry-homes-in-on-brussels-meeting-days-before-world-cup;guardian;sports;2742

By Ivor Bennett, news correspondent

Primary school teacher Clodagh Glaisyer-Sidibe is on strike in Lewisham with a placard designed ""to turn heads"".

It reads: ""I could make more £s on this pole.""

""As a slightly older woman, I didn't feel I'd be making a lot of money as a pole dancer,"" she told Sky News.

""So it's showing just how little we're getting.""

But behind the humour is a serious message. Like many of her colleagues, Ms Clodagh says she is actively considering taking a second job.

""I'm single parent with two kids of my own and two foster children. And it's very hard. We don't go out for meals and we live very carefully,"" she said.

Along with dozens of her colleagues, Ms Clodagh is making her way to the rally in central London, where thousands of striking workers will congregate.

""We're overworked and undervalued. We're stretched too thin and can't meet the children's needs. We're running on empty"" she said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201123454/http://news.sky.com/story/strikes-latest-rail-union-gets-new-pay-offer-as-train-drivers-walk-out-cost-of-strikes-to-economy-revealed-12615118;skynews;business & economy;3048

Tanya Brady, who competed for Britain in the World Rowing Championships in 2005, was thrown from the horse and died at the scene of the accident in Liss, Hampshire, in April last year.

An inquest in Winchester heard the 49-year-old army captain was riding her horse when a worker nearby spotted the animal acting ""erratically"".

The witness told the hearing: ""The female rider took to the grass with her horse and the horse gathered speed.

""I estimate it got to 35mph across the green with the female rider screaming as she tried to get control of the horse.

""She was ejected from the horse, I heard a crack as she fell.""

Brady was found in a 10ft-deep ditch, and while paramedics and police tried to save her, she was pronounced dead at the scene.

The cause of death was found to be multiple traumatic chest injuries.

A verdict of accidental death was recorded by Hampshire coroner Christopher Wilkinson on Monday.

He said: ""We cannot identify what triggered this horse as it entered on to the grass.

""It did get spooked and headed off at pace with Tanya still riding the horse before, I suspect, it came to an abrupt halt at the mound before the ditch and she was ejected from the horse and fell the 10ft into the ditch.""

Brady, from Liphook, Hampshire, served with the Royal Logistics Corp and became a full-time athlete and member of Team GB.

She married in 2004 and left the army the following year.

Mr Wilkinson added: ""Tanya was an accomplished Army officer, she was an accomplished sportswoman reaching an incredibly high level, she represented her country, the British Army, and she was a dedicated mother and wife.

""She led a life through passion and drive.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230110101700/http://news.sky.com/story/former-team-gb-rower-tanya-brady-died-after-being-thrown-from-spooked-horse-inquest-hears-12783515;skynews;sports;915
463;463;Oregon woman awarded $1m over racist discrimination at gas station;2023-01-29T20:58:09Z;['Samira Asma-Sadeque'];['Oregon', 'Race', 'US news'];;An Oregon woman has been awarded $1m by a jury after facing racist discrimination at a gas station where the attendant told her: “I don’t serve Black people.” A jury in Multnomah county reached the decision after a four-day trial in a case in which Rose Wakefield from Portland claimed an attendant at the gas station had refused to serve her because of her race. In March 2020, Nigel Powers, an attendant at the Jacksons gas station in Washington county, Oregon, kept passing over Wakefield to serve other customers, even those who had arrived after her. He repeatedly dismissed her as she attempted to get his service and she then walked inside the store to ask for assistance, according to surveillance camera footage. Even though another employee then helped her, Powers told Wakefield as she was leaving: “I don’t serve Black people,” and went on to laugh in her face. “I was like, ‘What world am I living in?’” Wakefield told KGW of her immediate feeling. “This is not supposed to go down like that. It was a terrible, terrible confrontation between me and this guy.” According to her lawyer Gregory Kafoury, she initially thought of forgetting about it. She shared with her friends that it was too unpleasant for her to think about. Eventually, Kafoury said, she realized she had to “do something about it”. Wakefield tried to file a complaint with the managers on two occasions the week after the incident, but the managers did not pay much heed to it. A message she left on the phone of the regional manager was deleted. The $1m also included a $550,000 punitive damage fee. Jacksons Food Stores said in a statement to KGW that they “respectfully disagree” with the jury’s ruling because upon “carefully reviewing” all the information, they believe that their “knowledge does not align with the verdict”.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/oregon-woman-awarded-1m-racist-discrimination-gas-station;guardian;entertainment & culture;463

6028;6028;Gas prices, interest rates, NHS waiting lists - charts reveal what may happen in 2023 I Ed Conway;Sunday 1 January 2023 04:02, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];['energy crisis', 'nhs', 'uk economy'];['lists', 'reveal', 'gas', 'question', 'prices', 'waiting', 'bonds', 'interest', 'europe', 'line', 'uk', 'market', 'rates', 'happen', 'ed', '2022', 'nhs'];"Given the drama of 2022, there is no guessing what 2023 will throw at us.

Still, that needn't stop us having a shot, so without further ado, here are some of the charts that might help tell the story of 2023.

1. The gas divergence

One of the most curious things about 2022 was that even as it faced a serious gas price spike, the UK was awash with natural gas. This was in large part a consequence of the industrial geography of the gas market, where prices and flows are in large part a consequence not just of supply and demand but of something far simpler: where the pipes are and where the gas comes in.

The UK typically tends to send gas across the pipelines running over the channel into the continent during the summer and sucks it back in the winter. The reason it was drowning in gas even as we faced a so-called ""shortage"" earlier in 2022 was that at that point, Europe was crying out for extra gas and one of the only places to get it was via big liquefied natural gas carriers, most of which had to dock in the UK before sending their cargo through British pipelines over to Europe to be stored.

There are a couple of interesting points here. First, the UK played quite an important role in helping provide the throughout for Europe to fill up its storage. But the other consequence was to cause a big gap between UK and European gas prices.

You can see the result in the accompanying chart. Both UK and European prices rose but the European prices (red line) rose far more than the UK prices. The interesting question for 2023 is whether this goes into reverse. Because the UK is now reliant on European gas during cold weather, does it face higher prices than Europe? Is Europe happy to send that gas over in the face of a shortage (or Russia cutting off its supply)? And, in the summer, does this pattern repeat, where the UK gets lower gas prices?

Much will depend on how quickly Europe can build its new terminals to suck in extra gas, but the important consequence of all this is clear. These wholesale prices influence the prices we all pay for our gas bills. The gas market's strange peccadilloes never mattered all that much before last year. All of a sudden they're all important.

2. The ever-growing waiting lists

Advertisement

One of the defining features of 2022 was the swelling ranks of people on NHS waiting lists, which mounted, all told, to over 7 million by the latter half of the year. The big question is how quickly the NHS will be able to clear these backlogs.

The likeliest prospect is that these numbers carry on rising this year and do not peak until 2024, making this another tough 12 months for the NHS. The problem is that not only is it trying to deal with the increasing burden of an ageing and less healthy population and the growing cost of pharmaceuticals, it is also facing this enormous overhang from the COVID period. Oh and this is before one considers the impact from the industrial action over the winter. In short, if you thought 2023 might be the year the NHS would disappear from the headlines, think again.

3. A tidal wave of bonds

This chart is quite complex but once you get your head around it it's pretty astounding. The back story here is that the government bond market, once upon a time one of the most boring corners of the financial system, became very exciting in 2022 following the mini-budget and it might continue to be exciting (and not in a good way) in 2023.

The overarching point here is that this market, where the government auctions bonds (IOUs - sometimes called gilts) in order to raise money, is facing a potential spate of indigestion.

The bars are showing you the amount of UK government debt entering the market in the coming months. Anything above the line is money being sold to private investors. Anything below the line is bonds being bought off private investors.

And you can see a few things emerging here. Look first of all at the dark blue lines. That's debt being issued by the UK government - it's all those bonds they auction to finance much of their spending (remember they still borrow a lot more than they raise in taxes). You can see a few big peaks in bond issuance: around the 2008 crisis and recession and then again in 2020 when COVID struck. It's the flip side of saying there were big deficits those years.

But there's something else going on too. Look at the light blue bars. These are the bonds the Bank of England is buying/selling. And you can see how, through its quantitative easing (QE) programme it was buying up LOTS of government bonds in years gone by. That 2020 splurge of debt by the government was almost entirely ""cancelled out"" by the fact that the Bank of England was simultaneously buying hundreds of billions of pounds of bonds off investors via its QE scheme.

Now roll onto 2023 and because the Bank of England is no longer buying up those bonds from investors but reversing quantitative easing and selling them, the light blue bars are now above the line. The upshot is that the private sector is being asked to absorb an unprecedented amount of government debt. The red line - which nets out the blue bars - is the one that matters here. It's higher than ever before in the coming years. No one knows how easily the market will digest that debt but we're about to find out. It could be a bumpy ride.

4. Interest rates

For many households, this is the main chart that matters this year. We became quite used, over the past few years, to interest rates at rock bottom levels. But that has begun to change. The only question now is how high those rates get.

While it's hard to know for sure where they'll end up (just as it's hard to know what Vladimir Putin is planning next) the market has some guesses. But what's striking is how much those guesses have evolved in recent years.

Think about it. Less than a year ago traders in money markets were still expecting that rates would rise no higher than about 1.5% in the coming years. That of course began to change as the year wore on, a combination both of rising inflation and of the change in government in the UK. Even so, what happened after the mini-budget was quite extraordinary: the expected peak rose from around 4.5% to as high as 6.4%.

Now, the Truss government didn't last long and the rates dropped back thereafter. All the same, money markets still expect interest rates to get to 4.5% by the middle of next year. The question, then, is whether this turns out to be right, or whether the Bank stops short of this, as it has frequently hinted it would. The other question is whether rates begin to fall quickly thereafter.

The consequence for many households, however, is that the cost of borrowing, for a decade or so something they rarely had to think that much about, will be considerably higher. Mortgage misery - the subject of many discussions in the 1990s - will be back again. On the one hand, a sizeable number of older households are now lucky enough to have paid off their mortgages. On the other hand, for those who have mortgages (or for that matter those renting) property costs are only going in one direction. In much the same way as the cost of living dominated 2022, this is very likely to be one of the stories of 2023.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101041340/https://news.sky.com/story/gas-prices-interest-rates-nhs-waiting-lists-charts-reveal-what-may-happen-in-2023-i-ed-conway-12772424;skynews;business & economy;119

3336;3336;The Circus Train by Amita Parikh review – magic and brutality in the shadow of war;2023-01-15T16:00:17Z;['Lucy Popescu'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];;"In her impeccably researched debut, which opens in 1938, the Canadian author Amita Parikh weaves a hypnotic tale about a circus troupe travelling through Europe on a luxury steam train. Lena Papadopoulos’s father, Theo, is a Greek illusionist with “the showmanship of [Harry] Houdini, the skill of [David] Devant and the intelligence of [Harry] Kellar”. He’s the headline act of the World of Wonders circus. Having contracted polio as a baby, Lena uses a wheelchair. She is friendless until a French Jewish boy, Alexandre, is discovered unconscious onboard the train. Theo persuades Horace, the circus’s self-serving American owner, to allow Alexandre, an orphan, to stay, promising to school him in the art of illusion. Lena studies hard with a private governess and finds herself increasingly drawn to the world of science and medicine. Together with her doctor, she explores the possibility of regaining mobility in her legs. As her friendship with Alexandre fizzes into something more, the dark clouds of war threaten to envelop everything she has worked so hard for. The SS increasingly patrol the train, and Horace strikes a dangerous deal with them that will shatter their fragile peace.
As historical fiction, Parikh’s scope is ambitious, spanning the prejudice endured by disabled children in the 1930s and 40s, the allure of magic and illusion at the time, and the brutality of the Terezín transit concentration camp. Having anticipated an overstuffed plot, I was pleasantly surprised by the novel’s structure. Parikh takes time to introduce us to her diverse cast, ensuring they earn our sympathy and that we’re fully invested in their journeys. The Circus Train is unashamedly romantic, but Parikh is never mawkish. Lena is an intelligent, feisty heroine and her rite of passage is compelling. Her European settings are vividly drawn, her characters are credible – many are flawed, and not all find redemption – and she works hard to create a good balance of light and shade. In the end, this is an uplifting, often page-turning read and a welcome escape from our turbulent times. • The Circus Train by Amita Parikh is published by Sphere (£16.99).

6930;6930;Rail strikes: Pay deals to avoid further industrial action a 'long way off', unions say;Wednesday 11 January 2023 11:37, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];['rail strikes'];['train', 'industrial', 'say', 'union', 'offer', 'unions', 'rdg', 'avoid', 'deals', 'network', 'aslef', 'long', 'rail', 'pay', 'way', 'rmt', 'strikes'];"Rail union leaders have told MPs there is much left to agree if further national strikes are to be averted, with one accusing the government of ""sabotage"" in its negotiations.

RMT leader Mick Lynch said in evidence to the transport committee his members were ""a long way"" off securing deals on the core pay issue.

He said Network Rail and train operating companies were separately offering well under half what his members deserved to navigate the cost of living crisis, after years of pay freezes.

Watch and follow live as rail union leaders appear before MPs - strikes latest

His colleagues at the Aslef and TSSA unions declared they were as far away as was possible to be from deals to end their separate disputes, when asked to give a score on a scale of one to 10.

When asked about the state of play in its row with train operators, Mick Whelan, general secretary of the drivers' Aslef union, told the MPs: ""I think you can include zero. We are further away than where we started.""

THE OFFERS ON THE TABLE TO RAIL UNIONS The national rail disputes that have disrupted travel involve two unions and multiple employers. The larger RMT union is locked in a pay and work reform battle with Network Rail and 14 operating firms. It is seeking a pay rise to shield its members from the cost of living crisis. The good news here, for simplicity purposes, is that the 14 train operators are represented by a single entity, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG). The RMT has dismissed a pay offer of 4% for 2022 and 4% for 2023 from the RDG. This includes a rejection of a demand for driver-only operated trains. The union has also rejected an offer from Network Rail (which manages the signalling and track maintenance) of a 5% pay rise for 2022 and 4% for 2023. The Aslef union, which represents train drivers, is yet to respond to a RDG offer of a 4% pay rise for 2022 and 4% in 2023. This offer is, however, expected to be rejected when the union's executive committee meets next week.

RDG chair Steve Montgomery and Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's chief negotiator, were more optimistic about securing deals to end the various disputes.

Both are due to hold more talks with the RMT and TSSA in the coming days but Mr Montgomery admitted ""more work"" was needed with Aslef as the dispute was in its infancy.

RMT leader Mr Lynch was particularly vocal on the role of the government, saying ministers had engineered the dispute.

He said it had deliberately provoked his members through ""reckless policy"" over many years and inflicted ""loads"" of damage on the rail system as a result.

He accused the Department for Transport of taking a back seat role in the negotiations, and seeking an expansion of driver-only train operation in its talks with the RDG, adding the union would never agree to such a move.

""It's daft. To me, it's sabotage. They wanted these strikes to go ahead,"" he claimed when describing how nine clauses on the issue were added to a draft document ahead of the walkouts last week.

Mr Whelan backed the RMT's position, saying that Aslef also fiercely opposed driver-only trains on the grounds they are unsafe.

The TSSA has agreed a pay deal with Network Rail but remains in dispute with train operators - with London's Elizabeth Line set to be hit by a first walkout on Thursday.

3506;3506;Amsterdam calls for crackdown on menace of souped-up e-bikes;2023-01-14T16:00:13Z;['Senay Boztas'];['Netherlands', 'Cycling', 'Cycling', 'Road safety', 'Europe', 'Life and style'];;"Debby Nieberg was cycling home from the dentist last October, when she was knocked to the pavement and broke her shoulder. According to her police report, the youngster on an e-bike – overtaking Nieberg on Amsterdam’s narrow cycling lanes – got up and cycled off, a crime in itself. “This unfortunately has become a big part of my life because of the ‘need for speed’ of those on e-bikes,” says the 56-year-old freelance translator, who has just started cycling again. “The bike situation is definitely unsafe.” The Netherlands, once famed for being cycle-friendly, is facing a surprising threat: souped-up electric bikes speeding at up to 42kph (26mph). Nieberg is one of a growing number involved in traffic accidents, to the concern of councillors, MPs, the police, cycling advocates and many of your everyday, cycling Netherlanders. Nieberg flagged her accident to the Fietsersbond, a cyclists’ union that is campaigning to crack down on speedy e-bikes and “fat bikes” – those with extremely wide tyres. These should only use cycle paths with a maximum speed of 25kph – but some of the bikes are designed to go faster or are being altered by the user to allow them to do so. Last June, Dutch MPs voted to ban people from boosting factory-programmed e-bike speeds, and cycling experts warn that nations rapidly adopting them, such as the UK, will soon face the same issues. Recent Dutch government research found e-bikes typically travel at almost 24kph, 3kph faster than normal bicycles, but a quarter of e-bikers exceed the limit – especially young adults. Mopeds and racers might be worse, but the Netherlands has an estimated 5m e-bikes, for a population of 17.8 million, and users include primary school children.
Esther van Garderen, director of the Fietsersbond, is campaigning for quick enforcement of the speed-boost ban and prohibiting fast e-bikes in bike lanes. “The problem is not normal e-bikes, but ever more souped-up bikes that are basically illegal mopeds,” she said. “In the Netherlands, since January, moped users must wear a helmet and young people don’t like this. They also need to be 16 and have a driving licence, but illegal ‘fat’ bikes are just sold, youngsters under 16 use them on the roads going at 40kph, without a helmet. This isn’t allowed, but there is no enforcement.” She added that a plan by Amsterdam-Zuid district council to research whether child cyclists should be obliged to attach a flag to their bikes to improve road safety made her blood boil: “To think that the solution is that children need to have a flag is blaming the victim to the max.” Her concerns are shared by Amsterdam D66, a liberal democratic party. “Research from the police showed that traffic accidents have increased and as we suspected, e-bikes play a role,” said Elise Moeskops, a D66 councillor. “On the one hand, they are great for the city: more people can cycle to work and that’s fantastic, but we see the speeds are a problem in our infrastructure. We want to look at obligatory helmets for people on e-bikes, manufacturer geofencing so you can’t go faster than 15kph, a maximum speed on the cycling lanes, and for e-bikes to go on the roads.” This autumn, Amsterdam will reduce speed limits from 50 to 30kph on 500 roads and the city is also researching “intelligent speed adaptation” systems to warn speeding cyclists or even force e-bikes to slow down. “Traffic safety and safe biking are areas where I really want to break ground in the coming years,” said Melanie van der Horst, deputy mayor for traffic. “Two-thirds of Amsterdammers tell us they don’t feel safe in the traffic. So more than 80% of roads will become a 30kph zone and we are researching a speed limit on the bike lanes. The growth of electric vehicles means there are huge speed differences on bike lanes and studies show that this creates risks.” Helmets are a bugbear, however. Dutch cyclists are notoriously resistant to wearing helmets, despite recommendations by the country’s road safety research foundation based on a global meta-analysis showing they reduce head injury by 48%. Patrick Beerepoot, a counsellor at a medical rehabilitation centre in Amsterdam working with people with brain injuries, said: “We noticed in the last year more and more e-bike accidents. It’s not only the people on the bike but people on the bike path who are hit by the bikes that are just going too fast.” E-bike manufacturers, meanwhile, have started to adapt their software to limit speeds, sometimes to the annoyance of users. VanMoof, a popular brand, said that in 2022 it changed its app to stop clients setting a higher speed limit. “Of course, our rider, and the safety of the rider come first,” a spokeswoman told the Observer. “We are aware of developments around speed limits for e-bikes, so VanMoof e-bikes can no longer be set to a higher speed from the VanMoof app. We cannot speak for third-party apps.” A spokesperson from Rad Power Bikes said its European fat-tyred bikes could not be ridden motorbike-style, had rigorous testing and EU certification. “The wide tyres do not accelerate the speed of the bike but slow it down due to increased friction,” the brand pointed out. The international cycling advocacy foundation BYCS believes that slightly slower cities might be better ones. “Technology is praised as progress, but it’s not about progress,” said Maud de Vries, the chief executive. “It’s about urban health and a system where people are more active, healthy and cross each other’s paths, in a good way.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/amsterdam-crackdown-souped-up-e-bikes-dangerous-streets;guardian;entertainment & culture;3506
5742;5742;The hidden underwater forests that could help tackle the climate crisis;2023-01-02T06:00:07Z;['Lucy Sherriff'];['Oceans', 'Marine life', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Food security'];;"Bubbles stream furiously behind Frank Hurd as he gently parts the curtains of giant kelp. Green and gold ribbons reach upwards through the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean towards the sun. Hurd, a marine biologist with environmental organisation the Nature Conservancy, is diving in a kelp forest off Anacapa Island, one of the protected rocky volcanic islets that form the Channel Islands national park, an archipelago off the coast of southern California. This thick, healthy kelp – a type of seaweed – forms a small part of underwater forests that blanket the coastline of nearly every continent. Some are relatively well-studied, including the Great African Sea Forest, a rich stretch of giant bamboo kelp spreading north from Cape Town to the Namibian coastline that was the setting for the film My Octopus Teacher; and the Great Southern Reef, a giant kelp forest hugging Australia’s southern coastline. But many more of these forests are unnamed and unknown – hidden underwater.
Despite being one of the fastest growing plants on Earth, kelp has historically been difficult to map because of the difficulties of measuring ocean depths with satellites. However, research published in September found that seaweed forests are far more extensive than previously realised. An international group of scientists from eight countries, led by Dr Albert Pessarrodona from the University of Western Australia, manually sifted through hundreds of studies – including local plant data records, online repositories and citizen science initiatives – to model the global distribution of ocean forests. They found that underwater forests cover between 6m and 7.2m sq km – an area comparable to the Amazon rainforest basin and twice the size of India.
Seaweed forests can act as a vital buffer against the climate crisis, absorbing carbon dioxide from seawater and the atmosphere. Ocean forests may store as much carbon as the Amazon rainforest, according to one analysis. Yet there is still a sizeable gap in understanding of seaweed’s long-term ability to sequester carbon, because it lacks a root system to lock the carbon into the ground, unlike other marine plants such as mangroves and seagrass. Whether carbon stays locked up also depends on what happens to the seaweed, and there is still scientific debate on how effective it is at storing the element.
Marine ecologist Dr Karen Filbee-Dexter, one of the study’s 10 authors, said the research was a “major step forward” in understanding the potential role that seaweed can play in mitigating climate breakdown, “because it calculates the productivity – growth and carbon uptake – of the largest marine vegetated ecosystem”. It can also help estimate the carbon-sink potential of the world’s marine forests, she added. Kelp, the largest seaweed species, able to grow tens of metres high, also plays a vital role in marine ecosystems, providing food and shelter for fish, other marine animals and birds. In Australia, native kelp is home to the weedy seadragon – a purple-hued creature with leaf-like appendages that look like kelp fronds – which only lives along the country’s coastline. Kelp forests along North America’s Pacific coast provide vital habitats for southern sea otters. In addition, the mighty grey whale uses kelp forests as a haven from predatory killer whales and as vital feeding grounds for their young during their migration to Alaska waters from Baja California in Mexico.
Underwater forests could also have a role in efforts to alleviate the world’s food security crisis, thanks to their rapid growth. The scientists examined hundreds of individual studies from around the world where seaweed growth had been measured by scuba divers. “We found ocean forests are more productive than many intensely farmed crops such as wheat, rice and corn,” the study noted. It defined productivity in terms of how much biomass – the fronds, stipes and holdfasts of the seaweed – was produced by crops and seaweed. On average, ocean forests in temperate regions, such as Australia’s southern coast, produced between two and 11 times more biomass by area than intensely farmed crops, a productivity that could be harnessed for the food system.
Seaweed has been mass-consumed in Asia for centuries, and now western markets are catching on, albeit on a small scale, with more European and North American companies manufacturing seaweed products for human consumption. The Cornish Seaweed Company has a seaweed salad range; Marks & Spencer has a “coconut seaweed crunch” snack, and there are numerous lines of kelp burgers. “Although there is evidence of seaweed being consumed as food 14,500 years ago, it has not been a part of the diet for large swaths of the world’s population,” says marine biologist Amanda Swinimer, who has been wild harvesting seaweed for decades through her company, Dakini Tidal Wilds. However, she adds, as food security becomes more of an issue, “people are looking for other sources of nutritious food. If harvested properly, seaweeds have the potential to be a very sustainable and nutrient-dense food source.” Seaweed is also being used as animal feed, in place of corn and soya beans, thanks to its high nutritional value.
Yet these underwater forests face multiple threats, including rising sea temperatures, pollution and invasive species. Along the northern California coast, kelp has declined by more than 95% over the past several years, decimated by sea urchins – whose population has exploded as vast numbers of starfish, their main predators, have been killed by a wasting disease linked to warming waters. The Great Southern Reef along Australia’s coastline, and forests in the north-west Atlantic, along the coasts of Maine, Canada and Greenland, are also showing concerning signs of decline. Seaweed forests are often overlooked and less studied compared with coral reefs, making it difficult to understand how they are changing. “Most of the world’s seaweed forests are not even mapped, much less monitored,” says Filbee-Dexter. While corals are found in warm, calm and easily accessible areas, making them fairly easy to study, kelp is in cold waters on some of the choppiest, roughest coasts in the world.
Filbee-Dexter believes that the more scientists understand about these vital but fragile marine ecosystems, the easier it will be to help them survive. “I hope that more awareness about these forests will lead to more protection and restoration.” In California, Hurd continues to dive among the kelp forests, monitoring their progress and hoping their decline can be stemmed. “The loss of these incredibly productive ecosystems is devastating for both nature and people,” he says. However, as science continues to develop smarter technologies to track kelp, such as drones, satellites and AI, he remains hopeful that research can shed light on the role of kelp in fighting climate breakdown. “The one thing that kelp in particular should never be underestimated for is the productivity and biodiversity it supports around the world. It should be protected and restored with a great sense of urgency.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/02/kelp-seaweed-forests-research-climate-crisis;guardian;environment;5742

US vice president Kamala Harris and celebrated civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton urged Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act at Mr Nichols's funeral in Memphis today.

RowVaughn Wells, the mother of the 29-year-old who died three days after being beaten by police, said: ""We need to get that bill passed. The next child that dies, the blood is going to be on their hands.""

She paid tribute to her son, saying: ""Tyre was a beautiful person and for this to happen to him is unimaginable.

""The only thing that’s keeping me going is thinking my son was sent here on assignment from God. I guess now his assignment is done and he’s been taken home.""

Mr Nichols's siblings also paid tribute to their brother. His sister said: ""He was robbed of his life, his passions and his talents but not his light.""

She said when she heard the news, ""I lost my faith, I cried, I screamed at God asking how he could let this happen"".

""My cries turned to anger and my anger turned to deep sorrow when those monsters murdered my baby brother. They left me completely heartbroken.

""My family will never be the same and I will always love my baby brother forever.""

Ms Harris praised the ""courage and strength"" of Tyre Nichols's family.

""We mourn with you and the people of this country mourn with you.

""Mothers around the world when their babies are born pray to God when they hold that child that that body and that life will be safe for the rest of his life.

""Yet we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today.

""They have a grandson who now does not have a father. His brothers and sisters will lose the love of growing old with their baby brother.

""When we look at this situation, this is a family who lost their son and their brother through an act of violence at the hands and the feet of people who had been charged with keeping them safe,"" she said.

""Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe?""

Rev Al Sharpton criticised the police officers who beat Tyre Nichols.

Recalling the death of Martin Luther King in Memphis 55 years ago when he was campaigning for the rights of black workers, he asked: ""In the city that they slayed the dreamer, what has happened to the dream?""

""Five black men who wouldn't have had a job in the police department... in the city that Dr King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death.

""There's nothing more insulting and offensive. You didn't get on a police department by yourself. People had to march and go to jail and some lost their lives to open the doors for you.

""How dare you act like that sacrifice was for nothing,"" he said.

The families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by police officers in 2020, as well as Oscar-winning director Spike Lee were among hundreds of mourners in the church.

The funeral took place in Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis with the church's celebration choir singing a chorus of ""we love you Tyre"" as mourners entered the church.

Photographs taken by Mr Nichols, as well as images of him as a child and doing his beloved hobby of skateboarding were shown to mourners along with a quote attributed to the 29-year-old: ""My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens.""

The investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda when justice ministers from across the world meet in London this year.

Deputy prime minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab will host the meeting in March at Lancaster House alongside his Dutch counterpart.



The group will hear from the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan, about the court's work and the role of the international community in supporting its investigations.

Mr Khan is currently investigating accusations that Russian soldiers have carried out war crimes during Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, with claims from Kyiv that civilians have been executed and civilians raped.

Mr Raab said: ""Russian forces should know they cannot act with impunity and we will back Ukraine until justice is served.

""Almost a year on from the illegal invasion, the international community must give its strongest backing to the ICC so war criminals can be held to account for the atrocities we're witnessing.""

The meeting will allow countries to determine how to provide further help to the court, the Ministry of Justice said.

240;240;‘Much bigger than a game’: A-Leagues’ Pride Cup seeks to drive change;2023-01-30T22:42:02Z;['Joey Lynch'];['A-League Men', 'A-League Women', 'Football', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];;"Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United’s A-Leagues Pride Cup will serve as an important opportunity to drive change at both a professional and community level, its organisers have said. The clubs’ men’s and women’s sides will meet at AAMI Park on 16 February, a year on from the league’s first iteration of the Pride Cup at Hindmarsh Stadium.
According to Pride Cup CEO James Lolicato, whose organisation has partnered with the clubs to organise the fixture, only 6% of LGBTI+ young people are involved in a team sport. In his view, these games serve as an important opportunity to encourage welcoming and safe environments in a professional setting, and foster changes at a community level that will see increases in this figure. “What’s really important is that players know the stats behind LGBTI+ inclusion,” he said. “They know why it’s important and they know what they can do to be the best allies possible. “For those who are watching on for the very first time, but also for all the games following and for all the community events that they’re going to so they can be the voices of the [LGBTI+] community.” Both Victory and Adelaide have commissioned special kits for the event, while Victory and Pride Cup will work together to stage a series of events promoting education, inclusion, and celebration of the LGBTI+ community. A “Victory Pride Village” will be erected on Gosche’s Paddock next to AAMI Park on matchday and it is expected that free tickets will be made available to the LGBTI+ community amongst further announcements in the lead into the event. Beyond educational work that has been undertaken across all levels of Victory and Adelaide’s organisations for almost two years – ensuring buy-in and engagement from the two clubs – security and stadium staff at the venue will also receive training on inclusion and how how to create a safe environment for LGBTI+ attendees at both the Pride fixture and future games. “With any round, it’s important that the announcement needs to be made at the right time, as well that the work needs to go on behind the scenes,” said Lolicato. “There needs to be that development process that is encouraged, so everybody understands why these games are important, why they’re needed and everybody can be on the same level playing field when going in. “We encourage a Pride Cup [to have] 12 to 18 months of work that goes in behind the scenes. So players, committees, boards, as well as operation teams, all understand why this game exists. And they’re going in for the right reasons with the right mindset and ready to really help the LGBTI community feel more and more engaged in sports when they need it most.” Melbourne United centre Isaac Humphries came out as the NBL’s first openly gay player in November, and the league recently staged basketball’s first pride round, which despite its success was overshadowed by the Cairns Taipans’s decision to opt out of wearing jerseys with a rainbow decal to mark the event. Humphries told ESPN he was “disappointed” with the events, sentiments echoed by Adelaide’s Josh Cavallo, who became the only openly gay active male top-flight footballer in the world when he came out in October 2021. “It is disappointing. I know and I’m prepared that we’re going to come across that,” he said. “In the A-Leagues, it’s phenomenal because everyone got around [2021-22’s Pride Cup]. “If we do something special as we’re doing in the A-Leagues and continue to grow that, I think leagues like basketball we’ll see the difference and the effect that’s happening not only in their sporting game but around the world and around Australia. “For me, this is much bigger than a game. This is people’s lives we’re talking about and if we can help affect it in a better way then why wouldn’t we?” Reports have indicated that the Australian Professional Leagues, the A-Leagues’ administrators, were seeking to stage a full Pride Round to coincide with Victory and Adelaide’s fixture.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/much-bigger-than-a-game-a-leagues-pride-cup-seeks-to-drive-change;guardian;sports;240
5215;5215;Energy efficiency ‘war effort’ needed to cut bills and emissions, say MPs;2023-01-05T06:00:13Z;['Damian Carrington'];['Energy efficiency', 'Energy', 'Energy bills', 'Energy industry', 'Household bills', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Consumer affairs', 'Politics', 'Wind power', 'Solar power', 'Renewable energy', 'Fossil fuels', 'Business'];;A national “war effort” on energy efficiency is required to cut energy bills, reduce climate-heating emissions and ensure energy security, according to a cross-party committee of MPs. Boosting efficiency in homes and businesses is the fastest way to cut energy use but the government missed a “crucial window of opportunity” last summer, the report from the environmental audit committee (EAC) said. The energy bills crisis was sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, while political turmoil in the UK resulted in three prime ministers in office between July and October. The report called for onshore windfarms to be rapidly rolled out, for solar panels to be required on new buildings and for the government to set a date to end the licensing of new oil and gas fields. The EAC said the UK’s reliance on imported fossil fuels made it vulnerable to price shocks and that the report’s recommendations would accelerate the transition to clean energy. The MPs said the government’s current energy strategy essentially focused only on supply. While welcoming the government’s promise of £6bn in future efficiency funding to cut demand, they said: “Those in fuel poverty cannot afford three winters of delay. It is a false economy to hold this money back at a time when households are struggling and the taxpayer is having to spend billions to subsidise energy bills.” The report said some of the windfall tax on energy companies’ profits should be used to bring forward efficiency funding and fulfil the government’s 2019 manifesto commitment to invest £9bn in energy efficiency: “A national ‘war effort’ on energy saving and efficiency is required.” The number of UK energy efficiency installations, such as insulating lofts and cavity walls, peaked in 2012 at 2.3m. Subsequently, the then prime minister, David Cameron, slashed efficiency programmes amid claims he wanted to get rid of the “green crap” from energy bills. By 2021, annual installations were 96% lower, at fewer than 100,000. The EAC called for at least 1m installations a year by 2025 and a target of 2.5m by 2030. “Bold action is needed now,” said the EAC chair, Philip Dunne. “We must fix our leaky housing stock, which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and wastes our constituents’ hard-earned cash. The government could have gone further and faster.” Ministers were split over a public information campaign on energy efficiency, which finally launched in December. “The UK has enormous renewable energy potential and sectors such as offshore wind are booming,” Dunne said. “But more must be done to harness the opportunities which onshore wind, tidal and solar technologies provide.” Renewable sources provided 40% of the UK’s electricity in 2022 and are far cheaper than power generated by burning gas. Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “With the price of fossil fuels the main driver of the cost of living crisis, many of these recommendations are no-brainers.” “There are also costs to not following the EAC’s recommendations,” she said. “Our analysis suggests that if the UK had adopted net zero technologies more rapidly in the past, households could have saved around £1,750 [each] on energy bills last year. And with the gas crisis set to continue until the end of this year and possibly longer, the billions spent on bailing out bill payers makes the transition away from fossil fuels even more urgent.” Juliet Phillips, at the E3G thinktank, said: “MPs have correctly identified that accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels is the only permanent solution to solve the interlocking climate and energy crises.” The EAC report noted that fossil fuels still provide 78% of the energy used by the UK’s buildings, vehicles and industries. But some witnesses examined by the MPs questioned whether licensing new oil and gas projects was compatible with global efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris agreement. The committee said the UK could demonstrate climate leadership by setting a date “well before 2050” after which no new projects would be approved. Denmark ended the licensing of oil and gas exploration in 2020. The EAC also said companies should no longer be allowed to burn off gas: “The routine flaring of unwanted fossil gas must be banned outright, as it has been by Norway since 1971.” A government spokeswoman said it had committed £6.6bn this parliament and a further £6bn to 2028 to make buildings more energy efficient. “With Russia weaponising energy across Europe, it is vital we boost our homegrown energy supply,” she said.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/05/energy-efficiency-war-effort-needed-to-cut-bills-and-emissions-say-mps;guardian;business & economy;5215

Authorities received a call at 3.38am on Monday about multiple shots being fired at a residence in Goshen, a town some 170 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

Police said a gunman fired multiple rounds into the skull of 17-year-old Alissa Parraz and killed her child, Nycholas, as they tried to run away from the attack.

The other four victims, who are all related, ranged from 19 to 72 years old, including Ms Parazz's grandmother who was shot as she slept.

Police are looking into whether a gang or drug cartel targeted the family and are on the hunt for two suspects.

Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said a forensics investigation revealed that Ms Parrazz tried to run away but the gunman stood over her and fired multiple rounds at her.

He said: ""It is very clear that this family was a target.

""None of this was by accident…It was deliberate, intentional and horrific,"" he said at a news conference on Tuesday.

He added that there was ""no reason"" for the gunmen to kill the young mother and her child.

Authorities said they were searching for two suspects and offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to their arrests.

Mr Boudreaux said that the home is linked to gangs and drugs, but on Tuesday he walked back his earlier comments that the violence was likely a cartel hit, saying that investigators are still looking into that possibility.

The sheriff cited gang activity that occurred in the past at the home, but said not everyone who was shot was a drug dealer or gang member.

It was unusual for a journalist to become personally, even emotionally involved, in a dispute he was reporting professionally, in my case for the Guardian. But this was a dispute like no other. With no evidence, Thatcher claimed union membership at the agency presented a “conflict of loyalties”. Years of talking, debating, and drinking with Mike made it abundantly clear to me that nothing was further from the truth. He never betrayed the agency, he kept sensitive official information to himself, as GCHQ security staff knew, as they listened to our conversations on the phone, and tried to intimidate us by sitting at a corner table in a Cheltenham pub where we arranged to meet. Throughout what became one of the longest trade union disputes, Mike, impish and modest almost to the point of self-deprecating, travelled around Britain on behalf of his union, accompanied by his trademark large plastic bag with a “GCHQ Unions” logo. “I’d never addressed a public meeting in my life”, he recalled. “I remember sitting on a train to Newcastle where I was going to address 200 people alongside the leader of the Durham miners. I rewrote my speech three times on the way up. A pint beforehand soothed my nerves!” Public speaking got easier as the dispute went on. Addressing a rally in Westminster in protest at the sackings, Mike said to loud applause: “We resent utterly and completely the accusations that the trade unions we are proud to belong to are any threat to national security.” Mike was the son of John Grindley, a scientist who helped clean up the Thames, and Irene (nee Healy). He was educated at Gravesend grammar school in Kent. During his national service in the RAF, he took a course in Chinese before he was posted to Hong Kong, where he spent his time monitoring communications. He won a scholarship to Cambridge University, where he studied Mandarin but did little academic work, scraping through the course. He was quickly recruited by a GCHQ headhunter and became a technical Chinese linguist. He later recalled: “I knew about GCHQ from my time in the RAF and it was the only place I could think of where I could use my Chinese in a modern, up-to-date fashion”. By the time he was sacked, he had pioneered valuable research and helped to build up a Chinese-English technical and scientific dictionary. One of his proudest moments was when he re-entered GCHQ’s gates in 1997 after the Blair government restored unions there, but by then he was close to retirement. Isabel (nee Hills), Mike’s beloved wife, whom he married in 1961, died in 2006. He is survived by their three children, Helen, Tim and Neil, and his sister “Biff”.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/mike-grindley-obituary;guardian;entertainment & culture;4304

3703;3703;Writing wrongs: how true crime authors can fall victim to tragedy;2023-01-13T14:00:18Z;['N/A'];['Books', 'True crime books', 'Culture', 'Truman Capote'];;“Countdown to DEATH”, “MURDERED by my boyfriend”, “Falling for a KILLER” … the language of true crime lost its potential to shock long ago, yet we continue to be drawn in. High-profile cases, solved or unsolved, seem to provide a bottomless well of fresh evidence and further mystery. What drives so many of us to consume true crime is a need to understand the extremes of humanity from the safe distance of the page or headphone. But for those who write in this genre, a “safe distance” can be hard to find. Michelle McNamara is the most recent, and most tragic example. In 2013 McNamara, a journalist and writer, took up the case of the Golden State Killer, a term she coined to bring together a series of murders committed over a wide area of California during the 1970s and 80s. She opened up a trail of cold cases, made links police had missed at the time and often felt herself close to uncovering who the prolific serial killer might have been. Her book, I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, is a beautifully written tribute to the passion and determination with which she approached her subject, but it was published posthumously. By 2016 McNamara was torn between finishing the book and solving the case. She felt she couldn’t do one without the other and had amassed a vast body of research. She was joined in her obsession by other enthusiastic amateurs, whose collective efforts helped keep them all engaged in what must have felt an overwhelming and endless task. McNamara was found dead on the morning of 21 April 2016, her death ruled an accidental overdose, brought about by a dependence on opioids. The book was finished by crime writer Paul Haynes, investigative journalist Bill Jensen and McNamara’s widower, Patton Oswalt, and published in February 2018. Two months later, former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested and confessed to being the Golden State Killer. In August 2020 he was sentenced to life without parole for 13 counts each of murder and kidnapping – which, between the statute of limitations and plea bargaining, represented a mere fraction of the crimes he had committed. McNamara’s investigation was credited with raising awareness, but not generating evidence that resulted in DeAngelo’s arrest. In the end, it was modern DNA technology that linked the historical crimes to his family and eventually to him. Striking a balance between giving your all to an investigation and maintaining a healthy distance from traumatic subject matter is something true crime writers ignore at their peril. This delicate line has been trod from the very first instance of modern true crime reportage: In Cold Blood by Truman Capote. First serialised in the New Yorker in 1965 and published in book form the following year, it established its author as not only the father of the genre, but also its first casualty. In the spirit of “New Journalism” Capote immersed himself in the tragic mass murder of a well-to-do farming family in the rural Kansas town of Holcomb. The story consumed him. He shadowed the investigation from police hunt through high-profile trial all the way to the executions six years later of the convicted murderers. His relationship with Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the drifters who planned and carried out the killings, was the subject of much speculation at the time and since. In his bid to understand what drove them to such extreme acts, Capote befriended Hickock and Smith through the bars of their cells. With Smith especially he seemed to build a particular rapport. Yet as the years dragged by, the harrowing case took its toll and he eventually found himself longing for the execution date, to complete the project, free himself from the claustrophobic confines of Holcomb and the tyranny of the book’s ever-retreating deadline. Capote would say afterwards of the town: “If I had realised what the future held, I would have driven straight on. Like a bat out of hell.” He would live for another 18 years, but never finished another major book. How does a true crime author give voice to a victim without embellishing the facts with conjecture – or put another way: making things up? It was an accusation levelled at Capote by fellow writer Jack Olsen, who said of In Cold Blood: “I recognised it as a work of art, but I know fakery when I see it. Capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes.” Arguably, readers want a full account that paints the case vividly and engages their emotions. Are they happy to trade the facts for that buzz? Because what is left when you take the “true” out of “true crime”? “Techniques in fiction and true crime overlap,” says David Collins, who published The Hunt for the Silver Killer in May. “You’re getting inside the characters’ heads, engaging with their feelings, finding the jeopardy and becoming emotionally connected.” Collins’ book documents his investigation into the suspicions of two coroner’s officers who spotted subtle links between a series of murder-suicides across the north-west of England during the late 1990s and early 2000s. His findings make compulsive reading, suggesting that a serial killer who murdered at least six elderly people is still at large. But he admits that spinning such stories can be murky: “There’s real emotion at play and it’s an ethical minefield – because there’s always the temptation to ascribe thoughts and feelings to a victim based purely on speculation.” Yet that dilemma is not an issue for every true crime author. Some of the best and most evocative books in this genre are by writers who already have a strong personal connection to a case. Is writing about personal traumatic events cathartic, or does it compound the trauma? Maggie Nelson wrote The Red Parts in 2005, 36 years after her aunt’s murder. Jane Mixer had been a Michigan law student in 1969, 23 years old and engaged to be married when she was brutally killed. For the best part of 30 years her death was ascribed to multiple murderer John Norman Collins, until DNA tests in 2002 revealed a link to local man and former nurse Gary Earl Leiterman. It’s a fascinating case that spans two eras in detection: old fashioned shoe leather and fast, “failsafe” 21st-century DNA. The Red Parts is an astonishing read. Much more than a book about the case and its surprising conclusion, it’s an intimate account of Nelson’s family and how they lived in the shadow of her aunt’s murder. The 2005 trial that reopened the case also reopened the family’s wounds and exposed what Nelson described as their “faulty grief” both for Jane and the future they all lost. Did unpacking such personal material help the grieving process, or not? “I felt horrible after I finished it,” she told the Guardian in 2017. “But the irony is that my catharsis was in writing down that there is no catharsis. The stories we tell ourselves don’t heal us, but I also think if I hadn’t written it, I wouldn’t have processed the experience.” Alligator Candy is David Kushner’s 2016 memoir charting the 1973 abduction and murder of his 11-year-old brother, which became headline news when Kushner himself was just four. Like Nelson, Kushner is driven by a need to capture what it means for a family to experience such a terrible, transformative experience, alongside an account of the case as it was handled by law enforcement and the local community at the time. Speaking in advance of his podcast launch in 2021, he said, “it was difficult for me to tell the story, but I hope by doing so, it facilitates other people telling their own.” Perhaps this is where a writer with a personal connection has the advantage over a reporter. They write their way out of the trauma, while an observer must write their way in. Penny Farmer was 17 when her 25-year-old brother Chris and his girlfriend Peta were murdered while traveling in Guatemala. Her book Dead in the Water (published in 2018) is a thorough and highly personal account of what her family believe happened in 1978, the dark years that followed and the extraordinary story of how she used social media to track down the killer almost 40 years later. For Farmer the process of recording her family’s story on the page was absolutely the right thing to do. “My primary aim in writing the book was for it to stand as a lasting memorial to a very dear brother. I felt it was my family’s story to tell,” she told Deborah Kalb in 2019. “It seemed natural I should write it. As a family we felt very protective of Chris’s memory and I wanted to take rightful ownership of it. The book is like bringing him home.” While the popularity of true crime as a literary genre shows no signs of waning, the same traps Truman Capote fell into nearly 60 years ago lie in wait for the unsuspecting writer today. Falling prey to obsession, becoming too close to the people involved, embellishing the facts and being driven to distraction by pressure to deliver a full account and meet a deadline. Perhaps readers should be aware of those traps too. The last word belongs to Michelle McNamara. About writing I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, she said: “I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane.” • The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels by Janice Hallett is published on 19 January by Viper.

4356;4356;Quietly quitting: Osaka’s unapologetic hiatus is a small act of rebellion | Jonathan Liew;2023-01-10T08:00:40Z;['Jonathan Liew'];['Naomi Osaka', 'Tennis', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];;"A long time ago, I took a part-time job in a high-street clothing store. It was late November, and amid the chaos of the Christmas rush I quickly discovered that nobody had the faintest idea what I was meant to be doing or whether I was actually doing it. One morning I overslept and queasily awaited the shrill phone call from a supervisor. It never came. The day passed. More days passed. Days turned into weeks. The payslips continued to hit the doormat. If there was any faint paroxysm of guilt or shame at taking this multinational giant for £5.15 an hour while watching movies and eating toast in my pyjamas, then let’s say it passed. In early February, the cheques finally stopped. No words were ever exchanged between us. I haven’t set foot in the shop for almost 20 years.
It was with a faint nod of recognition, then, that I greeted the news that with the Australian Open just days away Naomi Osaka was nowhere to be found. Not in the sinister Peng Shuai sense, although there was a similar tone of alarm to much of the accompanying coverage. “Australian Open officials scrambling to find two-time champion,” read one headline. “Concerns mount for Naomi Osaka,” this newspaper reported after it was finally confirmed that she would not be contesting the tournament she won in 2019 and 2021. But of course, Osaka had not really disappeared. Last week she posted photos on Instagram of a recent holiday to Paris with her boyfriend, the rapper Cordae. They visited the Louvre and saw the Mona Lisa. (“New RENAISSANCE OIL PAINTING lead in frantic tennis star search”.) On Wednesday she was tagged in a picture at a Pilates studio in Los Angeles. (“Fears grow over two-time champ’s FRIGHTENING core strength”.) Osaka has not played competitive tennis since September. And, of course, there is at least as much that we don’t know here as there is that we do. We don’t know what shape she’s in physically or emotionally. We don’t know how much time she’s spent on the practice court. We don’t really know what she wants, and we don’t even know if she does. As ever, compassion and empathy are the handiest of utensils.
But game recognise game. I think I have an inkling of what may be going on here. And if you’re one of those squalid media chatterboxes who gets his kicks from tearing down a 25-year-old woman with a history of mental health issues, who laid into her when she decided to skip a few press conferences a couple of years back, who sees the world in vivid shades of black, white and puce, then you’re not going to like it. For Osaka’s hiatus bears all the hallmarks of “quiet quitting”. Quiet quitting started to gain traction as a term last summer, but in reality the concept has been around for generations. It is not so much a schism or a resignation as a kind of mental detachment from one’s work, a refusal to let it define you. You do not storm into your boss’s office and cause a scene. You simply sit quietly, fulfil any routine contractual obligations, and spend the rest of your time enjoying your newly liberated headspace. Because – whether or not she decided to turn up in Melbourne – Osaka is still going to get paid. In the post-Serena era, she is probably the most famous and bankable star in women’s tennis. She has a new children’s book out, a galaxy of endorsements, a huge following and platform. Last year, according to Forbes, she turned over £42m, of which just £900,000 was earned on a court. At which point it is worth asking a sharp question: does any of this require an actual tennis career? In a way, Osaka’s ambivalence – her refusal to label her status, to apologise or explain herself – is simply the logical conclusion of a wider trend. Serena Williams was content to pick and choose her adventures during the latter stages of a career that even now is neither finished nor unfinished. The former Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard has been bobbing around the edges of the sport for three or four years. Elina Svitolina and Angelique Kerber both took a break to start a family.
And for every Ash Barty and Jo Konta who retired in their peak years, there are several other players whose commitment to the game feels conditional: still there, still competing, but without the murderous, masochistic quality that might drive them to the top or drive them over the edge. What links them all is rejection: a rejection of the 12-month grind and churn of the tour, its carousel of interchangeable room-service meals and late-night doom scrolling, the restless fidgety sensation that afflicts the never-rooted, the sort of horrific online abuse that young female players attract more than anyone else. A rejection of the idea that they owe us anything beyond their own wellbeing. The final point to make is that women’s tennis will be fine. There will always be new content to create and new stars willing to create it. Ons Jabeur and Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek are the present, and afterwards doubtless there will be someone else. Meanwhile all we can really do is wish Osaka well; perhaps even admire her small, quiet act of rebellion. You can’t smash the system, so make it work for you. The days pass. The cheques continue to hit the doormat. And the toast you have just prepared at 1pm in your pyjamas tastes suspiciously like freedom.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jan/10/quietly-quitting-why-naomi-osaka-is-happy-to-drift-away-from-tennis;guardian;sports;4356
5152;5152;‘There are icicles on the taps’: living in a home without central heating;2023-01-05T12:49:44Z;['Sammy Gecsoyler'];['Energy bills', 'Household bills', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Poverty', 'Society', 'Money', 'Business', 'UK news'];;Icicles sometimes appear in the bathroom, and an old television is used as a source of heat in the flat that Lisa Appleton, 48, shares with her friend in Fallowfield, Manchester. Appleton is one of the more than 700,000 people in England and Wales who live in homes without central heating. Her home’s only real heat sources are two oil-filled radiators and an electric wall heater. “It’s been cold to the point where there are icicles appearing on the taps,” she said. Appleton’s flatmate took her in when she was made homeless. “He’s a friend I met through work,” she says. “He took me in when I needed him. I was only supposed to be here six months but it’s just gone two years. He’s my knight in shining armour.” Their electric bills have increased from £50 to £200 in the past two years. “We only have the TV on, we boil the kettle when we have to and put in as little water as we can.” Appleton says the old TV that sits in the living room has become another heat source. “I’m old school, I’ve been using blankets, hot-water bottles and sleeping bags to keep warm,” she says. “I remember doing that as a kid back in the 80s, so to be having to do that again now, you think: what the hell is going on in the world?” Appleton works at a local arts venue where she describes her role as a “jack of all trades”. “I work in the cafe, I clean and I steward.” She works in the daytime while her flatmate works nights. “We work out the sleeping arrangement. I usually sleep in a camp bed.” They use one radiator to keep the flat warm. “That to heat a one-bedroom flat is not enough,” she says. The lifting of the energy price cap is “going to put people over the edge”, Appleton says. “[The government] need to sort out the situation and get the energy companies to agree to a lower rate or take it out of their own pocket, because they earn enough, don’t they.” She adds: “I don’t even know what half of [MPs] do. Obviously, the prime minister, the health secretary and cabinet, I understand what they do, but the rest, no clue. And they can earn for second houses and second this and that and you think: why is that fair? You’re already earning enough.” Appleton says the next few months are “gonna be tough but I’m a survivor. I’ve seen too many people giving up and I ain’t giving up.” She says: “I feel sorry for all the homeless people on the street. At least I’ve got a roof over my head. It might not be the warmest roof, but it’s a roof.”;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/05/icicles-on-taps-living-in-home-without-central-heating;guardian;business & economy;5152
1897;1897;Vatican investigating rumours of ‘sex party’ at Newcastle cathedral;2023-01-22T17:22:32Z;['Robyn Vinter'];['Catholicism', 'UK news', 'Christianity', 'Religion'];;The Vatican is investigating rumours of a “sex party” at a British cathedral which is alleged to have happened during lockdown. As part of an investigation into the circumstances of Robert Byrne’s resignation as the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, the Catholic church is looking into claims one of his priests invited worshippers to a private party at his lodgings. Multiple people are said to have complained that Father Michael McCoy, dean of Newcastle Cathedral, approached them to attend a party at a time when gatherings were not permitted. A diocese source told the Sunday Times said: “A number of complaints were made by individuals within the diocese after information came to light about a sex party taking place in the priests’ living quarters attached to Newcastle Cathedral.” McCoy, 57, killed himself in April 2021 four days after finding out he was subject to an investigation by Northumbria police’s child and adult protection department for child sexual abuse. He had been appointed by Byrne in 2019, replacing the popular Father Dermott Donnelly, the older brother of TV presenter Declan Donnelly. Father Donnelly has since died after an illness in July 2022. While there is no suggestion Byrne attended the party, he resigned as bishop in December, telling worshippers his office “has become too great a burden”. In a letter to clergy, which he read in St Mary’s Cathedral in Newcastle, he said: “My own discernment has caused me to recognise that I now feel unable to continue serving the people of the diocese in the way that I would wish.” He was appointed in 2019, after previously serving as an auxiliary in the archdiocese of Birmingham and as provost of the Oxford Oratory from 1993 to 2011. In a letter seen by the Sunday Times, the archbishop of Liverpool, Malcolm McMahon who is running the diocese until Byrne’s successor is appointed and is leading the investigation into his resignation, said he has been asked by the pope’s advisers to prepare “an in-depth report into the events leading up to Bishop Byrne’s resignation”. The Catholic Safeguarding Standards Agency (CSSA) last week began an “unscheduled safeguarding audit” at the diocese. Steve Ashley, the CSSA chief executive officer said the body was independent and had “full autonomy”. He said: “The scope of the investigatory work will cover any reported abuses, alleged abuses, safeguarding concerns and the culture of safeguarding in the diocese as a whole.” Ashley added: “The scope of the investigatory work will cover any reported abuses, alleged abuses, safeguarding concerns and the culture of safeguarding in the diocese as a whole.” The former chief prosecutor for the north-west of England, Nazir Afzal, chair of the CSSA, added: “There should be no doubt that we will leave no stone unturned when it comes to keeping people safe, and this includes investigating the safeguarding culture in Hexham and Newcastle.” The diocese said it voluntarily referred itself to the CSSA and the Charities Commission and it would “continue to work productively and swiftly with both organisations, learning where it needs to, not from rumours and misinformation, but from the facts and evidence provided”. It added that it “remains fully committed to safeguarding as an integral part of the life and the ministry of the church”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/vatican-investigating-rumours-of-sex-party-at-newcastle-cathedral;guardian;politics;1897
349;349;Tory peer accused of ‘racially charged’ attack on BBC Modi documentary;2023-01-30T12:22:19Z;['Aubrey Allegretti', 'Kiran Stacey'];['House of Lords', 'BBC', 'UK news', 'India', 'Narendra Modi', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'Media', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];;A Conservative peer has been accused of using “deplorable” and “racially charged language” in a scathing attack on the BBC’s recent documentary about the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Rami Ranger, who is already under investigation by the standards commissioners in the Lords, was criticised for comments made about Pakistani journalists at the corporation. He hit out at a documentary that has caused significant controversy in India and been banned from YouTube and Twitter by authorities there over the depiction of Modi’s role in riots in 2002. Lord Ranger wrote to the BBC director general, Tim Davie, to complain about the film and demanded to know “if your Pakistani-origin staff were behind this nonsense”. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, he called the production “insensitive” and one-sided, accusing the BBC of having “opened old wounds by creating hatred between British Hindus and Muslims”. Ranger also branded the film an insult to Modi, saying he had been exonerated from being involved in the riots in any way. The two-part BBC documentary revealed memos showing that Modi’s conduct was criticised by western diplomats and the British government in the aftermath of the 2002 religious riots that broke out when a train was set on fire, killing dozens of Hindu pilgrims. Modi has been haunted for decades by allegations of complicity in the violence that followed, in which more than 1,000 people – mostly Muslims – were killed. Modi has previously denied accusations that he failed to stop the rioting, and in 2013 a supreme court panel said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. India’s ministry of information and broadcasting recently issued directions to ban any excerpts of the documentary being shared on social media under legislation introduced in 2021 that allow for the “blocking of information in case of emergency”. Ranger’s attacks on the BBC closely aligned with those made by the Indian government, which has dismissed the documentary as colonial propaganda. Another Tory peer, Dolar Popat, wrote to Davie on the day the second part of the documentary was released, calling it “heavily one-sided” and urging for the film to be pulled. Meanwhile, Ranger continues to mix in senior Conservative circles, despite the open inquiry into his behaviour about alleged bullying and harassment of a freelance reporter and women’s rights campaigner. Earlier this month, the peer hosted a lavish dinner in support of the Maidenhead and Beaconsfield Conservative Associations, at which Theresa May, who nominated Ranger for a peerage when she was prime minister, was the guest of honour. The event took place at London’s Carlton Club, where guests drank champagne, ate dinner and listened to speeches from Ranger, May and others. In response, Ranger said he had paid for the event, adding that it was held to “celebrate the cultural and historical ties between the UK and India – especially with the impending free trade agreement between the two countries, which will bring immense economic benefit to both nations.” He defended his singling out of certain journalists. “I referred to ‘any Pakistani origin’ staff of the BBC as, unfortunately, the politics of the subcontinent has been known to impact the UK, which again not conducive or helpful to our social cohesion and fragile race relation in building greater community relations,” he said. Chris Elmore, Labour’s vice-chair, said that for the Tory peer to “put pressure on the BBC in this way is unacceptable” and called Ranger’s comments about Pakistani journalists “racially charged” and “deplorable”. Elmore said the allegations that Ranger was already being investigated over were “extremely serious” and called on May to “explain why she thought him a suitable person for a fundraising event”. He urged the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to explain “what he is doing about the scandal and sleaze engulfing his party from all angles and how this meets his promise of integrity, professionalism and accountability.” A spokesperson for May said: “It would be inappropriate to comment while this matter [the allegations against Ranger] is under investigation.” The BBC said it had yet to receive the letter, but it defended the journalists behind the Modi documentary. A spokesperson said the film was “rigorously researched according to highest editorial standards” and added that the corporation was “committed to highlighting important issues from around the world”. They added: “A wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions – this includes responses from people in the BJP [Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party]. We offered the Indian government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series – it declined to respond.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/30/tory-peer-accused-of-racially-charged-attack-on-bbc-modi-documentary;guardian;politics;349
136;136;Ukraine war ‘opening eyes’ to need to reform England’s libel laws, says lawyer;2023-01-31T12:38:54Z;['Dan Sabbagh'];['Libel reform', 'Human rights', 'England', 'Law', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Freedom of speech'];;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped “open eyes” to the idea of reforming England’s increasingly draconian libel and privacy laws, according to one of the country’s leading media advocates. Geoffrey Robertson KC, author of a new book on efforts by the rich and powerful to suppress free speech, Lawfare, said the war revealed the cynical way wealthy Russians – and others – have exploited the English legal system. The unprovoked invasion ordered by the Kremlin last February has, the barrister said, “brought up the way in which oligarchs, as rich people, have been able to intimidate British journalists and British publishers” in costly libel actions. “Eyes are opening,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. Robertson highlighted the case of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who acknowledged he was the founder and boss of the Wagner mercenary group in September, but who, until May, was suing the investigative journalist Eliot Higgins in London for tweeting articles linking the Russian oligarch to the same paramilitary organisation. Last week it emerged that British lawyers acting for Prigozhin, who had been put under sanctions by the UK in October 2020, were given special dispensation by the Treasury to bring the lawsuit against Higgins personally, and for two lawyers to spend £4,000 in travelling to St Petersburg to take instructions. “It’s in my view, ironic and ridiculous that the UK’s Sanctions Act permits oligarchs who are sanctioned for their human rights abuses, and therefore have no reputation, you would think, [to] bring in money to pay their lawyers to repair their reputation that they don’t have,” Robertson said. The barrister also criticised the soaring costs of defending libel cases in London – Higgins said last week his costs in defending himself against Prigozhin were £70,000. “Britain is not a land of free speech but expensive speech,” Robertson said. “Law is a market,” Robertson added, in which KCs “can charge upwards of £900 an hour” and junior barristers “half that” while solicitors who specialised in Russian clients can earn “even more than some of the KCs per hour”. The result is that “a simple libel case that takes two or three days in court is certain to run into over £1m in costs for either side,” Robertson said, adding that “it’s absurd to talk free speech in that context, where publishers risk £1m if they fight” in court. In December 2021, Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea FC, settled a libel case he had brought against Catherine Belton, author of Putin’s People, an acclaimed account of the Russian president’s era. Had the case gone to a full trial, the legal bill was likely to have exceeded £10m. In the end, Belton and the book’s publishers, HarperCollins, agreed to amend the text to make clear that comments that Abramovich had bought Chelsea at the behest of the Russian president did not represent a statement of fact. Robertson said that the power of “reputation lawyers”, who seek to bring libel and privacy actions, “has been increased” and needed to be brought “under reasonable control”. He highlighted legal letters issued by the law firm Osborne Clarke on behalf of the former UK minister Nadhim Zahawi, sacked by the prime minister on Sunday. Zahawi’s lawyers had sent the tax specialist Dan Neidle, who had raised questions about the minister’s finances, letters marked confidential and “not for publication” last year. That prompted the Solicitors Regulatory Authority to issue guidance in November that such a label should only be used if private or confidential information was being used to disprove statements intended for publication. “A lot of people have been hoodwinked into thinking that letters from reputation lawyers have to be kept secret,” Robertson said, when in fact the SRA guidance makes clear it is possible for recipients to “publicise your threatening letter”. Privacy law has expanded, the barrister complained, to the point where it had become rare to name people arrested or subject to criminal investigation, following a supreme court judgment in a case involving a businessman known only as ZXC. “Now you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when you are in a police station,” he said. Last year big UK media outlets largely declined to name a wealthy Russian businessman arrested by the National Crime Agency in London on suspicion of money laundering. A proposed but controversial bill of rights, currently being put forward by the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, would “leave the UK in a worse position than at present”, the barrister said, adding that the minister, himself the subject of bullying complaints, “seems to be taking us completely down the wrong way”. One section in the bill, marked 4.1, directs the court to give “great weight” to “protecting freedom of speech”. But Robertson said another section, 4.3, makes clear that 4.1 “does not apply” in criminal proceedings, privacy cases and matters of national security, meaning the free speech provision amounts to “bogus rhetoric”. Robertson’s book, published earlier this month, lists several ways in which he believes the law can be reformed, of which the most important, he argues, is reversing the burden of proof so that it falls on the complainant, not the journalist, writer, newspaper or publisher, to prove their case. “Libel is the only civil action where a claimant coming into court to demand money throws the burden of proof on the other side,” Robertson said. He also suggested that Russian and other foreign oligarchs should only be able to bring cases “closely connected” to the UK. Other libel reforms that could bring cases under control, Robertson said, would be to bring back juries in defamation cases, abolished in a 2013 reform, and to broadcast cases. “Claimants want their reputation publicly vindicated, the media argues for the public interest – why should the public be deprived,” the lawyer writes in his book.;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jan/31/russia-ukraine-war-reveals-englands-draconian-libel-laws-says-lawyer;guardian;politics;136
4068;4068;Health unions refuse to give evidence to ‘rigged’ NHS pay review system;2023-01-11T18:34:12Z;['Denis Campbell', 'Pippa Crerar'];"['NHS', 'Industrial action', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Health policy', 'Trade unions', 'Public services policy', ""Workers' rights""]";;"The system for setting NHS staff pay is under threat after health unions refused to submit evidence to the two bodies that advise ministers on how big annual increases should be. The role and credibility of both the NHS pay review body (NHSPRB) and the review body on doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration (DDRB) have been brought into question by the move. Unions representing more than 1 million nurses, ambulance workers and other personnel have refused to submit joint evidence in the usual way to the NHSPRB about the pay for 2023/24 unless ministers first settle the bitter dispute over this year’s salary increase that has triggered a wave of strikes. The British Medical Association, the main doctors’ trade union, said it was also taking similar action and would not submit evidence to the DDRB because “the process is rigged from the start”. Health unions’ trust in the pay review system has become strained in recent years as a result of recommendations from the review bodies leading to NHS personnel receiving rises below the level of inflation at the time and thus suffering year-on-year real-terms falls in their income. But their faith has collapsed in recent weeks. That has coincided with the health secretary, Steve Barclay, repeatedly justifying his refusal to increase his offer of a £1,400-a-head salary rise for 2022/23 by insisting that he cannot go beyond what the NHSPRB recommended, even though it proposed the £1,400 sum before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent inflation soaring. The unions’ break with the longstanding system of setting NHS pay comes as the Labour government in Wales is reportedly preparing to offer health service staff there on Thursday a one-off payment – reportedly of £1,000 – to resolve the row over their 2022/23 pay deal. Some union officials said privately that £1,000 might be enough to persuade their members to stop striking but others believed that the sum may still be too little to break the deadlock. The Scottish government has submitted a “best and final” offer to NHS staff of a £2,205 pay rise for 2022/23. However, while some unions have accepted it, others – including the Royal College of Nursing – have rejected it.
The Westminster government is also looking at the idea of a one-off payment, which would be non-consolidated and therefore not added to staff’s baseline salaries, to end the impasse over 2022/23. However, recent reports said that neither the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, nor Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, were keen on it. The NHSPRB’s eight members are chosen by ministers and include no union representatives, leading to claims that it is not truly independent of government. Representatives of 14 health unions said they would not submit evidence about 2023/24 to it because “the lengthy pay review process is not able to deliver what is needed right now”. They want to hold direct talks with ministers to agree pay rises instead. “The pay review body process doesn’t fit the current context”, said Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health and the chair of the NHS group of unions. Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the BMA, said: ‘The medical profession has long lost faith in the fairness or independence of this process. Neither junior doctors nor consultants will even submit evidence this year, knowing the process is rigged from the start.” No 10 said they were disappointed that the health unions, which wanted to set up the pay review bodies, have decided not to take part in the process. The PM’s official spokesperson said: “It is disappointing that they have taken this step. We do think it’s in everyone’s interests for the unions to contribute.” He said the government had committed to “properly” consider a one-off payment and backdating the 2023/24 pay deal to this month as potential ways of ending the dispute. Meanwhile, physiotherapists will soon join nurses and ambulance staff in striking in pursuit of a better pay deal for this year. They will stage their first strike at 30 NHS trusts in England on 26 January with a second planned – this time at 60 trusts – unless Barclay increases the £1,400 offer.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/11/health-unions-refuse-to-submit-evidence-to-rigged-nhs-pay-review-system;guardian;politics;4068
7824;7824;Jacinda Ardern 'driven from office' by constant abuse and unprecedented hatred, politicians say;Friday 20 January 2023 10:49, UK;[];['jacinda ardern', 'new zealand'];['prime', 'say', 'received', 'abuse', 'jacinda', 'unprecedented', 'constant', 'ms', 'minister', 'ardern', 'driven', 'party', 'hatred', 'zealand', 'politics', 'politicians', 'leader', 'office'];"Jacinda Ardern said she ""slept well for the first time in a long"" after announcing she was stepping down as prime minister.

The New Zealand leader revealed she was resigning from the role on Thursday telling reporters she had ""nothing left in the tank"".

Ms Ardern said: ""I'll have to admit I slept well for the first time in a long time last night. But yes... still a range of emotions. So of course I feel, you know sad, but also I do have sense of relief.

""I actually feel deeply humbled by the response that I've received. To have those messages of gratitude has been really moving for me and for my family.

""I'll go home for a little bit and just pack, get ready for a bit of time in Wellington. Focus for the team obviously is on selecting a new leader of the Labour Party and therefore a new prime minister for New Zealand.

""It's an incredibly important decision and the team is very, very focused.""

And some political allies in New Zealand have suggested she took the decision to leave due to the level of abuse she received during her time in power.

Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said she felt ""deep sadness"" on learning of the resignation.

""The pressures on Prime Ministers are always great, but in this era of social media, clickbait, and 24/7 media cycles, Jacinda has faced a level of hatred and vitriol which in my experience is unprecedented in our country,"" she said.

""Our society could now usefully reflect on whether it wants to continue to tolerate the excessive polarisation which is making politics an increasingly unattractive calling.""

Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, Maori party co-leader, thanked Ms Adern for her service, but said she had faced ""ugly attacks"".

""It is a sad day for politics where an outstanding leader has been driven from office for constant personalisation and vilification,"" she said.

""Her whanau [family] have withstood the ugliest attacks over the last two years with what we believe to be the most demeaning form of politics we have ever seen.""

Ms Ardern has received widespread praise from leaders around the world after announcing she would be stepping down but has faced mounting political pressures at home in recent months.

Her Labour party has been struggling in the polls, with a Taxpayers Union-Curia poll released on Friday using data before Ms Ardern stepped down saw the party's popularity fall to 31.7%, down from 1.4% last month, with the opposition New Zealand National Party on 37.2%.

Nevertheless, Ms Ardern's announcement that 7 February would be her last day as prime minister after five and a half years in office came as a shock to the nation of five million people own.

Asked if misogyny played a role in her decision to leave, Ms Ardern said: ""No, it did not, and my strong message to women in leadership, and girls who may be considering leadership in the future is: This is a place where foundations have been laid long before me to make it possible for us to be in these roles in a way that in the past it just wasn't in the same way.

Lawmakers in her Labour Party will vote for a new leader on Sunday.

If no candidate gets at least two-thirds support from the caucus, then the leadership contest will go to the wider party membership.

Ms Ardern has recommended the party chose her replacement by the time she steps down.

2943;2943;UK weather: heavy snow could trigger power cuts as country freezes;2023-01-17T16:24:10Z;['Jessica Murray'];['UK weather', 'Snow', 'Flooding', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'England', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland', 'Road transport', 'Rail transport', 'Transport'];;"Heavy snow could cause power cuts and road closures in parts of the UK as the country is hit by freezing weather that has caused widescale disruption. The Met Office issued a number of yellow and amber weather warnings for snow and ice on Tuesday, with Scotland expected to be the worst hit. An amber warning for heavy snow is in place for parts of eastern Scotland, including Inverness and Aberdeen, from 3pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office warning drivers are expected to become stranded. With up to 15cm of snow expected in the area, it said some rural communities could become cut off, there will be rail and air cancellations, mobile phone coverage may be affected and power cuts were likely. Yellow warnings for snow and ice are in place for Wales, Devon and Cornwall, the West Midlands, the north-west, south-western Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the public was urged to travel only if “absolutely essential” in some parts of the country. Avon and Somerset police said it was advising the public to stay off the roads after receiving more than 100 reports of road-related incidents in five hours. Fifty-three road traffic collisions were reported to police between 6-11pm on Monday, the majority a result of the freezing weather conditions. On Tuesday morning, a serious incident was declared after a doubledecker bus carrying 70 passengers overturned on the A39 in Somerset, leaving dozens injured. Supt Mark Runacres said: “We are advising the public to only travel where absolutely essential due to the treacherous driving conditions. If travel is necessary, we ask the public to take extreme caution and allow additional time to travel.” The Met Office said Monday night was the UK’s coldest of the year so far, with a low of -9.8C recorded in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, and all of England is expected to experience cold weather until 9am on Friday. Jason Kelly, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Cold, icy and sometimes snowy conditions are in the forecast this week with the UK seeing more of a north-westerly regime, with temperatures well below average for the time of year. Wintry showers are likely at points through the week in the north of England.”
The UK Health Security Agency has also encouraged people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency (EA) said its officers were working around the clock to protect homes and businesses along the River Severn, with more than 25 flood warnings in place across Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. Across England, there were 83 flood warnings in place on Tuesday afternoon, meaning flooding is expected, with East Sussex, the Isle of Wight and other areas in south-east England predicted to be affected. The EA said rivers in the West Midlands and north-east England were likely to remain high for the next four days and could lead to further flooding.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/uk-weather-travel-disrupted-by-freezing-temperatures-snow-and-floods;guardian;environment;2943
5779;5779;Everton’s Etihad hero Demarai Gray hails ‘massive boost’ in relegation fight;2023-01-01T19:00:03Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Everton', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Demarai Gray has described Everton’s draw with Manchester City on Saturday as a “massive boost” in their attempt to arrest a poor run of results and pull away from relegation trouble. Gray’s spectacular 64th-minute equaliser secured a point for Frank Lampard’s side at the Etihad Stadium – it was only their second point from the last possible 15 and followed the damaging 2-1 defeat by Wolves at Goodison Park on Boxing Day. “It will be a massive boost for the squad on the back of the last performance,” said Gray. “Manchester City are one of the best in the world so credit to us, we showed our quality and thanks to the fans, obviously, supporting us all the way through but as a team we take that performance into the next game. On the back of our last performances, football-wise it was a massive improvement.
“Obviously when you come to the Etihad you have to change your gameplan a little bit but we stuck to it well. We got our reward with the goal and after that we dug deep, so there are a lot of positives to take. I don’t think it’s just when we play City, it’s part of our character and the club’s DNA, fighting and digging deep for results. We left everything out there.” Everton next host Brighton on Tuesday and Gray is insistent that the players remain behind Lampard and are determined to endure a second successive campaign spent fighting the drop, after surviving last season with one game to spare. “We have gone through a lot of tough moments,” the 26-year-old said. “Last season we showed our character and don’t want to be in that situation again this year. “It’s been a bit up and down but we have shown a real quality with our performances this season, it’s just about keeping our standards high and performing to that sort of level as much as we can and if we do that we will get more good results.” Dominic Calvert-Lewin impressed against City in his first start since late October after long-term injury problems. “He is a massive part of our gameplan,” Gray said of the centre-forward. “It was one of those games where you can’t really do much attacking-wise, he had to put in a shift and work for our moments but it’s good to have him out there and I am happy for him to get some minutes. “He has had a tough time. It’s unfortunate because he has done everything right, he looks after himself. He has had a bit of bad fortune so I am happy to have him back.” Lampard, meanwhile, has called on his players to replicate the way they performed against City in the game against Brighton. “We need the same approach regarding mentality and work ethic: this has to be standard but also it is a very good possession team who will play,” he said. The manager is hopeful the knee injury Michael Keane suffered during the warm-up on Saturday does not keep the defender out of action for too long.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/everton-etihad-hero-demarai-gray-hails-massive-boost-in-relegation-fight;guardian;sports;5779
4132;4132;Self-driving sleds? Australian scientists look to robots to delve deeper into Antarctica;2023-01-11T14:00:20Z;['Henry Belot'];['Antarctica', 'Climate science', 'Australia news', 'Robots'];;"Robots could soon collect tissue samples from whales off the coast of Antarctica or fly long distances over the icy continent with surveillance cameras, allowing Australian scientists to observe dangerous and previously inaccessible areas. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has partnered with Prof Peter Corke, a robotics expert, to develop a shortlist of new technologies that could improve safety and scientific research on the continent. This process also has a strategic motivation; the federal government has a 10-year plan to boost its presence in the 42% of Antarctica where Australia has a historical territorial claim.
“Antarctica is where the impacts of climate change are very strong and very easy to discern, so it is important to study the changes in this environment,” said Corke, who is a researcher at Queensland University of Technology. “But doing this work in Antarctica is just incredibly challenging. It’s very cold. It’s very windy. It’s very remote. Getting people to do this type of work is expensive and there’s an element of risk.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Corke, who has developed prototypes used at the International Space Station, spent three months with AAD scientists in Hobart researching opportunities for robots. His report has now been presented to the federal government. The division is already using robots to study remote Adélie penguin colonies and to map the ocean floor. Corke’s proposals include autonomous vehicles that could service remote campsites. “You can imagine a smallish robot – smaller than a regular passenger car – that can tow a sled without a driver. You just tell it where to go and it will do its thing and then come back to you,” Corke said. “The problem is that when humans do something like this, you can’t just have one person out there for safety reasons. There has to be two people at least. And then if something goes wrong, a search and rescue team need to be deployed.”
Brett Chatwood, a manager in the AAD’s technology and innovation branch, said work had already started on using robots to monitor whale populations in the Southern Ocean. “We are looking at collaborating with international partners to develop the ability to deploy tagging devices from drones and to take biopsies of whales,” Chatwood said. “At the moment, that work is done by putting scientists into small boats in the Southern Ocean and trying to get close enough to have that interaction with the whales. “From a safety point of view, doing that work with a drone is going to be a lot safer for our people and less disruptive for the animals.” The federal government’s 10-year plan set aside $109m for the development of a new drone fleet, autonomous vehicles and medium lift helicopters. Chatwood said long-range drones would be tested from the research vessel Nuyina, once it returns from repair work.
“The drone itself is a bus. It’s a bus that allows us to take sensors to places that we have not been able to take them before, either off a research vessel or stations or field camps,” he said. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the development of robotics was vital to ensuring Australia’s environmental record in Antarctica. “Australia’s science in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean provides a window into past and present climate that helps informs us about the extent and consequences of climate change,” Plibersek said. “Academia and industry are working together to develop and adapt robotic technologies for the harsh Antarctic environment in the delivery of globally important climate and ecosystem science.” Corke said many of the technologies needed already exist, but must be strengthened to survive in the harsh Antarctic climate.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/12/cold-remote-and-risky-why-australia-is-turning-to-robots-to-boost-its-presence-in-antarctica;guardian;science & technology;4132
3107;3107;Rishi Sunak blocks Scotland’s gender recognition legislation;2023-01-16T18:05:20Z;['Pippa Crerar', 'Libby Brooks'];['Gender', 'Scotland', 'UK news', 'Alister Jack', 'Transgender', 'Scottish politics', 'Politics', 'Society', 'Rishi Sunak'];;"Rishi Sunak’s government has blocked legislation passed by the Scottish parliament that would make Scotland the first part of the UK to introduce a self-identification system for people who want to change gender. The Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, announced that he would use section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998 for the first time to halt the gender recognition bill after a review by UK government lawyers. Westminster’s decision to use the “nuclear option” of blocking the bill from going for royal assent represents a significant escalation of tensions around the issue, and will enrage supporters of the changes and nationalists. UK ministers, who met in Westminster on Monday to consider how to approach the legislation, are concerned the bill will have an “adverse impact” on UK-wide equalities law. Sources said blocking it would protect the devolution settlement and denied claims they were trying to inflame tensions as part of a culture war.
Nevertheless, Nicola Sturgeon has said there were “no grounds” for the UK government to block the legislation, claiming that it did not affect the operation of the Equality Act. Scotland’s first minister has said her government was likely to mount a legal challenge in response, saying the use of section 35 would create a “very, very slippery slope indeed” and would embolden the UK government to do the same in other areas. After the announcement, she tweeted: “This is a full-frontal attack on our democratically elected Scottish parliament and it’s ability to make its own decisions on devolved matters. @scotgov will defend the legislation and stand up for Scotland’s parliament. If this Westminster veto succeeds, it will be first of many.” A court battle would inevitably be presented by the SNP as Westminster denying Holyrood its democratic right to make its own laws – hot on the heels of the supreme court verdict on another referendum – and could bolster the independence cause. The Scottish secretary, who will lay the order in the Commons on Tuesday, said: “After thorough and careful consideration of all the relevant advice and the policy implications, I am concerned that this legislation would have an adverse impact on the operation of Great Britain-wide equalities legislation. “Transgender people who are going through the process to change their legal sex deserve our respect, support and understanding. My decision today is about the legislation’s consequences for the operation of GB-wide equalities protections and other reserved matters. “I have not taken this decision lightly. The bill would have a significant impact on, amongst other things, GB-wide equalities matters in Scotland, England and Wales. I have concluded, therefore, that this is the necessary and correct course of action. “If the Scottish government chooses to bring an amended bill back for reconsideration in the Scottish parliament, I hope we can work together to find a constructive way forward that both respects devolution and the operation of UK parliament legislation.” The law, first proposed by Sturgeon six years ago, was passed by the Scottish parliament by 86 votes to 39, with the overwhelming support of the SNP, Labour, the Greens and the Lib Dems in December, after years of consultation and debate. During the bill process, which culminated in an unprecedented two days of late night sittings as MSPs worked cross-party to address concerns about abusive males potentially taking advantage of the new system, questions were also raised about how the new legislation would affect UK-wide equality law. This became a particular concern after a judgment from Scotland’s highest court, only a few weeks before the final vote, which ruled that – for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act, the meaning of “sex” should include transgender women in possession of a gender recognition certificate. The legislation would make it easier for transgender people to obtain official gender recognition certificates, including by reducing waiting times, removing the need for a medical diagnosis and bringing the minimum age down from 18 to 16. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Monday that 16-year-olds should not legally be able to change gender, putting him at odds with his party in Scotland. The shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, said the issue were “too important to be reduced to the usual constitutional fight”, and questioned why ministers at Westminster and Holyrood did not work together on an amended bill “to avoid this unnecessary stand-off”. Speaking to reporters earlier on Monday, Sturgeon accused Sunak’s government of “using trans people as a political weapon”. UK government sources, however, claimed that the legislation could have an adverse impact across the UK in areas like equal pay, single sex spaces and prison transfers. They believe that Sturgeon underestimated the degree of opposition to her bill. A YouGov poll for the Times after the law was passed claimed that two-thirds of Scots are opposed to its main features. Some Tories believe they can boost their vote in Scotland at the next election if they reduce politics to culture wars. The Scottish Greens, who made gender recognition reform one of their red lines for going into partnership with the SNP government after 2021 Holyrood election, said that it was “a dark day for devolution, democracy and trans rights”. Green MSP Maggie Chapman said: “Only one month ago, MSPs voted overwhelmingly for gender recognition reform. It was a proud day for equality, and for our parliament. To see a reactionary Tory government trying to block or overturn it is nothing short of outrageous, and we will resist them every step of the way.” Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, said: “It is a matter of grave and profound regret that the prime minister has allowed trans people’s lives to be used as a political football. This is not governing with compassion.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/rishi-sunak-blocks-scotlands-gender-recognition-legislation;guardian;politics;3107
5462;5462;Colombia’s ELN guerrilla group denies agreeing to national ceasefire;2023-01-03T19:17:45Z;['Luke Taylor'];['Colombia', 'Americas', 'World news'];;"Colombia’s largest remaining guerrilla group has contradicted government claims that they had agreed a national ceasefire, in a setback to plans to bring peace to the Andean nation after decades of violence. President Gustavo Petro had announced on New Year’s Eve that the country’s five largest armed groups had agreed to a six-month truce, but on Tuesday the National Liberation Army (ELN) rejected the claims, saying it had not been consulted on any such plan. “The ELN Dialogue Delegation has not discussed any bilateral ceasefire with the Gustavo Petro government, therefore no such agreement exists,” the guerrillas said in a statement. The ceasefire was supposed to usher in a peaceful beginning to 2023 and kickstart Petro’s ambitious promise to bring “total peace” to Colombia after more than six decades of brutal conflict and several false dawns.
An estimated 450,000 Colombians have been killed and 8 million displaced, making Colombia’s internal conflict one of the deadliest in modern history. A 2016 peace agreement removed the country’s biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, from the many-sided conflict, but the country has failed to prevent smaller, less ideological organisations from filling the power vacuum that demobilisation left. On taking office in August 2022 as the country’s first ever leftist president, Petro promised to finally deliver peace by bringing armed groups to the negotiating table. The former rebel said the ceasefire was a “bold act” and would initially last six months, with national and international mechanisms monitoring the truce’s progress, but the pact was shot down before it could get going. “This whole fiasco demonstrates how improvised many of the government’s announcements are, declaring things without thinking them through with all the relevant stakeholders,” says Sergio Guzmán, director of Colombia Risk Analysis. Though Petro has made finally ending Colombia’s six-decade long conflict a central issue and began peace talks in Caracas with the ELN in November, security analysts are sceptical that he can deliver. Ten thousand combatants are believed to be spread out across myriad competing armed groups who are warring for the control of lucrative drug trafficking routes and gold mining regions. The ELN’s announcement also adds to evidence suggesting that the group will be tough to negotiate with. Unlike most of the other purely criminal organisations operating in Colombia, the ELN has ideological origins. The insurgency was founded in 1964 by Catholic priests who sought to emancipate the country through Marxism. The group is believed to have approximately 3,000-5,000 fighters but unlike most other armed factions it has a loose structure and flatter hierarchy, which makes the organisation harder to negotiate with. Their rebuttal is likely a demand to be distinguished from the other, smaller criminal organisations and to receive special treatment, Guzmán says. “This takes the air out of Petro’s sails and his very broad efforts to declare victory for total peace,” he says. “It’s going to be very challenging to deal with these guys.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/colombia-guerrillas-deny-national-ceasefire;guardian;politics;5462
1960;1960;Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? review – Elizabeth McGovern cracks the whip ;2023-01-22T11:30:34Z;['Clare Brennan'];['Theatre', 'Theatre Royal Bath', 'Edward Albee', 'Elizabeth McGovern', 'Culture', 'Stage'];;Edward Albee’s first short play, The Zoo Story, premiered in Germany in a double bill with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape in 1959. Albee admired Beckett and shared his taste for the absurd, along with a love of music hall and vaudeville. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a grotesque expansion of the familiar comic double act, given an absurdist twist and pummelled to fit a classic, naturalistic set-up: the unfulfilled marriage. Director Lindsay Posner deploys these influences effectively through the dynamics of the play, especially via the rhythms of the dialogue (even though, on a pre-press night, tempos occasionally faltered). George and Martha have finessed their patter over 23 lacerating years of wedded blistering. Their young guests, Nick and Honey, become the unwitting fall guys to the older couple’s private routines, and unwilling audience to an excoriating exposition of a relationship in which love is indistinguishable from hate. As their early-hours, alcohol-fuelled encounter develops, though, the boundaries between the couples become blurred. Are Nick and Honey the image of what George and Martha once were? Are George and Martha are the prediction of what Nick and Honey will become or, terrifyingly, of what any of us might become if we settle for a life based on illusions? Elizabeth McGovern (Lady Cora in Downton Abbey) is superb as Martha, delivering whip-sharp dialogue, making every vicious, emotional punchline land well below George’s (and, later, Nick’s) belt. Without sentimentality she opens the cracks in her character’s carapace to reveal how her love-hate world centres on George. The tragedy for both of them, suggested through Dougray Scott’s performance (initially stuttering, but increasingly assured), is that George’s world centres on himself. Charles Aitken’s Nick, like his character, is strong in parts but not yet fully formed, while Gina Bramhill’s Honey conveys depths beyond first-impression shallows. In this world of illusions, only the brave or the mad are not afraid to face reality.

Hence easy and natural is ideal. That said, “natural” is totally subjective; for some, natural is a full face of maquillage – contouring, powder, falsies, the works. For those with a minimalistic outlook, here’s the tip. A foundation or concealer that feels and – when applied – looks like skin, an elevated, grownup lip balm that you can use sans mirror, a mascara that gives you full, thick lashes in seconds (Sculpted by Aimee is phenomenal) and a highlighter to dot on your cheekbones so you don’t look as dull as January. 1.

But I barely read the blurb on this retinoid serum before covering my face in it. I had immediate trust. That’s because the woman behind the brand is Caroline Hirons – the skincare guru with more than 25 years of expertise. What Hirons doesn’t know about skincare is probably not worth knowing. And so Skin Rocks, her skincare line, is founded on all the principles that have made Hirons one of the most powerful voices in beauty: transparency, honesty and education. Her initial launch includes two products which are retinoids – an ingredient every skincare expert will tell you we should all be using to get the best skin ever. Retinoids are a much-lauded wonder ingredient because they are excellent for everything from fine lines to hyperpigmentation. However, many are really harsh and leave you looking tight, red raw and shedding like a snake in a heartbeat. While many are still happy to go through that, Hirons has created two retinoid products so you don’t have to. If you have never tried retinoids before, or you’ve never got on with them, or are prone to sensitivity or a little bit terrified, try Retinoid 1. It is a fantastic entry-level serum.

Pompeo’s memoir of his time in Donald Trump’s presidential administration, Never Give an Inch, was published on Tuesday. One of a slew of books from likely contenders for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination – if in this case one who barely registers in polling – the book recounts Pompeo’s time as CIA director and secretary of state under Trump. The Guardian obtained and , a copy last week. In its own review, published on Tuesday, the Post called Pompeo’s book “vicious … a master class in the performative anger poisoning American politics”. The reviewer, the Pulitzer prize-winning reporter Tim Weiner, added: “Hatred animates this book. It’s got more venom than a quiver of cobras.” The murder of Khashoggi caused outrage around the world and stoked criticism of the Trump White House over its reluctance to criticise the Saudi regime, particularly the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who grew close to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. US intelligence believes the prince approved the killing of Khashoggi, whose remains have not been found. On the page, Pompeo deplores Khashoggi’s murder. But he also writes that Khashoggi was not a journalist but “an activist who had supported the losing team” and criticises what he calls “faux outrage” over a killing that “made the media madder than a vegan in a slaughterhouse”. On Monday, Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, told NBC News: “Whatever [Pompeo] mentions about my husband, he doesn’t know my husband. He should be silent and shut up the lies about my husband. It is such bad information and the wrong information … This is not acceptable.” Elatr Khashoggi also said she wanted “to silence all of these people who publish books, disparage my husband and collect money from it”. On Tuesday, Ryan said it was “shocking and disappointing to see Mike Pompeo’s book so outrageously misrepresent the life and work of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. “As the CIA – which Pompeo once directed – concluded, Jamal was brutally murdered on the orders of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. His only offense was exposing corruption and oppression among those in power – work that good journalists around the world do every day.” Pompeo responded on Twitter, writing: “Americans are safer because we didn’t label Saudi Arabia a pariah state. I never let the media bully me. Just because someone is a part-time stringer for the Washington Post doesn’t make their life more important than our military serving in dangerous places protecting us all. I never forgot that.” Ryan said Khashoggi, who wrote for the Post while resident in the US, “dedicated himself to the values of free speech and a free press and held himself to the highest professional standards. For this devotion, he paid the ultimate price.” • The image on this article was changed on 25 January 2023.

In his column, which was published in December, he said he was ""dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her"".

The remarks sparked a huge backlash, with Clarkson's daughter Emily, as well as many others, speaking out against him.

The column became the most complained about ever and was removed from The Sun's website at Clarkson's request, with the publisher also apologising.

Following the backlash, Clarkson wrote: ""Oh dear. I've rather put my foot in it. In a column I wrote about Meghan, I made a clumsy reference to a scene in Game of Thrones and this has gone down badly with a great many people. I'm horrified to have caused so much hurt and I shall be more careful in future.""

He is also set to lose his shows on Prime Video, The Grand Tour and Clarkson's Farm, following the comments, according to Variety, which says Amazon is likely to part ways with the broadcaster, claiming the streamer was unhappy with the incident.

Amazon has not commented on the report.

His comments came after the release of Harry and Meghan's Netflix documentary, in which they talked about their split from the Royal family, and their relationship with the monarchy.

In his latest statement, he said: ""It was a slow rumble to start with, and I ignored it. But then the rumble got louder. So I picked up a copy of The Sun to see what all the fuss was about.

""We've all been there, I guess. In that precise moment when we suddenly realise we've completely messed up. You are sweaty and cold at the same time. And your head pounds. And you feel sick. I couldn't believe what I was reading. Had I really said that? It was horrible.

""I knew what had happened straight away. I'd been thinking of a scene in Games Of Thrones, but I'd forgotten to mention this. So it looked like I was actually calling for revolting violence to rain down on Meghan's head. I was very angry with myself because in all those controversial days on Top Gear, when I was accused of all sorts of things, it was very rarely sexism.

""We never did 'women can't park' gags for instance. Or suggested that powerful cars were only for men. And I was thrilled when Jodie Kidd and Ellen MacArthur set fastest-ever laps in our reasonably-priced car. I'm just not sexist, and I abhor violence against women. And yet I seemed to be advocating just that.

""I was mortified and so was everyone else. My phone went mad. Very close friends were furious. Even my own daughter took to Instagram to denounce me.""

'The landmine exploded'

He went on to add: ""I really am sorry. All the way from the balls of my feet to the follicles on my head. This is me putting my hands up. It's a mea culpa with bells on.

""Usually, I read what I've written to someone else before filing, but I was home alone on that fateful day, and in a hurry. So when I'd finished, I just pressed Send. And then, when the column appeared the next day, the landmine exploded.

""I therefore wrote to everyone who works with me saying how sorry I was and then, on Christmas morning, I e-mailed Harry and Meghan in California to apologise to them too. I said I was baffled by what they had been saying on TV but that the language I'd used in my column was disgraceful and that I was profoundly sorry.

5734;5734;England’s care crisis forces 1,200 children to move over Christmas;2023-01-02T07:00:08Z;['Helen Pidd'];['England', 'Social care', 'Children', 'Charities', 'Voluntary sector', 'UK news', 'Society'];;More than 1,200 children in care were uprooted and had to move placements over Christmas last year, figures from councils in England show. The “shocking and upsetting” numbers, collated by the national care charity Become, showed that an average of 79 looked-after children had to change foster carer or children’s home each day over the 2021-22 festive period. Some had to move more than once, prompting particular upset at a time of year when children in care can feel especially lonely and unloved. One young person told Become that Christmas “often reminds me that I don’t have a ‘normal’ family … I am reminded of how different my experience of the world is from them.” The charity said the figures showed the need for “urgent and ambitious action to ensure children in care are able to thrive”. Freedom of information requests revealed 1,257 children in care moved homes between 18 December 2021 and 3 January 2022. The data covers 144 of 151 local authorities in England. While some councils said they had not moved any children over the Christmas period, Kent moved 54 (3% of the county’s looked-after children), Brent in London moved 23 (6.7%) and Oldham in Greater Manchester moved 25 (4.6%). Moving over Christmas can present practical challenges. While local authorities have staff supporting children in care over the festive period, regular services are less likely to be available. With schools closed, children do not have the same distractions and contact with their existing network of friends may be more limited, Become said in its Home For Christmas report. Some local authorities reported a higher number of moves than children, meaning some children had been moved more than once during the festive period. The instability faced at Christmas reflects the picture across the year. In 2021-22, 10% of children in the care system were moved three or more times (8,030 children in total), with almost one-third of children in care (31%) moved two or more times. While there can be valid reasons for children being moved, moves can often be due to a lack of appropriate places, poor planning or unsuitable matching or places, Become said. Katharine Sacks-Jones, the charity’s chief executive, said: “These statistics are as shocking as they are upsetting. For children and young people in care, Christmas can already be a difficult and isolating time, without the family around them that many of us take for granted. “But to move young people at Christmas, when their friends are enjoying presents, family meals and the usual festive joys, delivers yet more isolation and uncertainty. Care-experienced children are being moved into unfamiliar surroundings, leaving behind relationships they have managed to build and into an environment they do not know. “Become is calling on the government to take urgent and ambitious action to ensure children and young people in care have greater stability and the same opportunities as other children to thrive.” She called on the government to announce a national commitment and target to reduce the number of moves children in the care system experience. Become also wants the government to fund more children’s homes in areas that need them and invest in recruiting more foster carers. In 2021-22, there were 54,620 placement changes in England, an average of 150 per day, underscoring the instability and insecurity vulnerable young people face.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/02/children-in-care-moved-christmas-2021-figures;guardian;politics;5734
5496;5496;Republicans fight over speaker of the House – but whoever wins, the party loses | Robert Reich;2023-01-03T16:35:31Z;['Robert Reich'];['US politics', 'US Congress', 'Republicans'];;"On Tuesday, as Republicans in the US House of Representatives convulse over electing one among them as speaker of the House, with Kevin McCarthy attempting to outmanoeuvre his hardcore Maga detractors, the civil war in the Republican party comes into the open. But it’s not particularly civil and it’s not exactly a war. It’s the mindless hostility of a political party that’s lost any legitimate reason for being.
For all practical purposes, the Republican party is over. A half century ago, the Republican party stood for limited government. Its position was not always coherent or logical (it overlooked corporate power and resisted civil rights), but at least had a certain consistency: the party could always be relied on to seek lower taxes and oppose Democratic attempts to enlarge the scope of federal power. This was, and still is, the position of the establishment Republican party of the two George Bushes, of its wealthy libertarian funders and of its Davos-jetting corporate executive donor base. But it has little to do with the real Republican party of today. In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich and Fox News’s Roger Ailes ushered the Republican party into cultural conservatism – against abortion, contraception, immigration, voting rights, gay marriage, LBGTQ+ rights, and, eventually, against transgender rights, teaching America’s history of racism and, during the pandemic, even against masks. At the same time, cultural conservatism was for police cracking down on crime (especially committed by Black people), teaching religion with public money, retailers discriminating against LBGTQ+ people, and immigration authorities hunting down and deporting undocumented residents. Gingrich and Ailes smelled the redolent possibilities of cultural conservatism, sensed the power of evangelicals and the anger of rural white America, saw votes in a Republican base that hewed to “traditional values” and, of course, racism. But this cultural conservatism was inconsistent with limited government – in effect, it called on the government to intrude in some of the most intimate aspects of personal life. The party line became confused, its message garbled, its purpose unclear. It thereby created an opening for a third and far angrier phase, centering on resentment and authoritarianism. The foundation for this third phase had been laid for decades as white Americans without college degrees, mostly hourly-wage workers, experienced a steady drop in income and security. Not only had upward mobility been blocked, but about half their children wouldn’t live as well as they lived. The middle class was shrinking. Well-paid union jobs were disappearing. Enter Donald Trump, the con artist with a monstrous talent for exploiting resentment in service of his ego.
Trump turned the Republican party into a white working-class cauldron of bitterness, xenophobia, racism, anti-intellectualism and anti-science paranoia, while turning himself into the leader of a near religious cult bent on destroying anything in his way – including American democracy. A political party is nothing more than a shell – fundraising machinery, state and local apparatus and elected officials, along with a dedicated base of volunteers and activists. The base fuels a party, giving it purpose and meaning. Today’s Republican base is fueling hate. It is the epicenter of an emerging anti-democracy movement. What we are seeing played out today in the contest for the speakership of the House involves all of these phases – what remains of the small-government establishment, the cultural warriors and the hate-filled authoritarians – engaged in hopeless, hapless combat with each other. They are also in combat with the aspirations and ideals of the rest of America. The Republican party will continue in some form. It takes more than nihilistic mindlessness to destroy a party in a winner-take-all system such as we have in the United States. But the Republican party no longer has a legitimate role to play in our system of self-government. It is over.

Not only for the stated reason – that the practice of writing a 4,000-character essay about yourself is seen to favour middle-class kids (and the genetically smug) – but also because the temptations of help from artificial intelligence are increasingly hard to resist. Who is going to labour for days over a side of cringeworthy A4 about the formative influence of a Saturday job when ChatGPT and its rivals can do the job in five seconds? “Overcoming difficulties has been a defining aspect of my life,” the app, when prompted, suggests of its struggles. “I grew up in a low-income household and my family struggled to make ends meet. This made it difficult for me to afford the necessary resources to excel academically. However, I refused to let my circumstances define me. I volunteered at local schools and tutored my peers.” Or, prompted differently: “Growing up in a middle-class background, I have had opportunities to help me excel academically and personally. As I have grown older, I have come to realise the importance of giving back to those who are less fortunate. I have been actively involved in community service both locally and internationally.

If software might sometimes promise us more time, it will no doubt also be employed to check up on what we are doing with it. There was a chilling aspect to the case of Canadian woman Karlee Besse who, in suing her employer for wrongful dismissal, was ordered instead last week to compensate her bosses with a payment equivalent to £1,600. Her company had been using tracking software called TimeCamp, which spied on the hours Besse claimed to have been working from home on her laptop. According to the data, Besse had charged for 50 hours that “did not appear to have been spent on work-related tasks”. Reading Besse’s story prompted me to look up something the polymathic physicist Carlo Rovelli once said to me, when I interviewed him about that famous loafer Albert Einstein: “You don’t get anywhere by not wasting time.” Or how, as Billy Liar might have idly wondered to himself, do you put a price on daydreaming?

The advance publicity for Russell T Davies’s miniseries Nolly, in which Helena Bonham Carter plays Crossroads star and 1970s “Queen of the Midlands” Noele Gordon, prompted a strange recovered memory. As a kid, I once went up to our local VG convenience store and encountered Gordon, then pulling in 12 million viewers a night, in full Meg Richardson makeup and fur coat buying something for her tea. At the time, this was about as close as suburban Birmingham came to Sunset Boulevard. Gordon, the first woman ever to appear on colour television, had been such a fixture on the ATV schedules of my childhood that it was disturbing to discover her in daylight. She seemed slightly unsure of the possibility herself. Crossroads ran for 18 years before it engineered its star’s drugged-up demise in a motel fire. If you were ever in doubt that the past was another country, look back at the Guardian’s front page of 5 November 1981, the night after Gordon’s departure. There, the story of television switchboards being jammed with calls from weeping viewers distraught about the end of an era competes for space with Mrs Thatcher promising far better times ahead in her Queen’s speech. • Tim Adams is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/14/whats-the-point-of-personal-statements-when-chatgpt-can-say-it-so-much-better;guardian;science & technology;3508
545;545;Former education ministers attack plan to reduce vocational qualifications;2023-01-29T12:29:36Z;['Richard Adams'];['Vocational education', 'David Blunkett', 'Education', 'Politics', 'Further education', 'Higher education', 'UK news'];;"A coalition of former education ministers has attacked the government’s “disastrous” plan to scrap dozens of popular vocational qualifications in England and push students into taking its favoured new T-levels. David Blunkett, the former Labour education secretary, said he feared that widespread scrapping of qualifications such as BTecs from 2025 could backfire and lead to more 17 and 18-year-olds opting to take A-levels rather than the vital vocational qualifications the country needs. “At this moment in time, every high quality route to employment and filling the vast vacancies which exist should be encouraged rather than abolished, and clear commitments given in parliament should be honoured,” Lord Blunkett said.
A joint letter from the group to the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, accuses the Department for Education (DfE) of breaking earlier pledges that only a small percentage of the applied qualifications would have their funding cut off and replaced by T-levels. The signatories alongside Blunkett and Ken Baker, who served as education secretary under Margaret Thatcher, include David Willetts and Jo Johnson, the former Conservative education ministers, and Sue Garden, the Liberal Democrat peer and deputy speaker of the House of Lords. A copy of the letter, seen by the Guardian, states: “These qualifications are popular with students, respected by employers and valued by universities. Removing them will have a disastrous impact on social mobility, economic growth and our public services. “For example, it is difficult to think of a worse time to scrap the extended diploma in health and social care. Given their importance to the healthcare workforce, it would be very damaging to the NHS to remove funding for these qualifications.” BTecs are the most well-known applied general qualifications, with about 200,000 students each year taking BTec qualifications at level three, the equivalent to A-levels. The qualifications are nationally accepted for entry to apprenticeships and technical training, and for entry to university. The government wants more students in England to take its T-level qualification, introduced in 2020 but so far only available in seven vocational areas, including education and childcare, construction and health and science. More subjects will be added later this year but colleges remain reluctant to teach them, because of lack of demand and extra expense as well as the substantial work placements they require.
Critics also say T-levels are too narrowly focused, with each T-level the equivalent of three A-level or BTec subjects, meaning students can take only a single course after they finish GCSEs. The government had promised that the funding of BTecs and similar qualifications would be protected while T-levels were being rolled out. In April last year, both Nadhim Zahawi, the then education secretary, and Diana Barran, the education minister in the Lords, said during debates in parliament that only “a small proportion of applied general qualifications would be removed”. But in January, a DfE guide included a list of subjects where ministers had made a “conscious choice” to axe funding, which researchers found would mean cutting 75 out of 134 relevant qualifications. The letter urges Keegan to exempt all 134 qualifications from the cull, saying that they remain “a vital pathway to higher education and employment” for many young people. Blunkett said: “A failure to listen to what business is saying and ensure there is real choice – which of course would include T-levels – is damaging to the economy, and a complete contradiction to the thrust of Jeremy Hunt’s speech last Friday.” The Labour peer warned that reducing student choice to A-levels or T-levels could backfire. “I fear that government has still not understood that the route to T-levels is now being toughened to the point where applying for A-levels is actually easier,” he said. Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association – which is leading a campaign to protect student choice by retaining BTecs – said scrapping so many valued qualifications in the space of two years was “utterly unacceptable”. “Unless the government reverses this decision, and starts to incorporate some evidence and transparency into its policymaking, tens of thousands of students will be left without a pathway to higher education or employment, and many employers will be left without the skilled workforce they need,” he said.

7887;7887;Politics latest: 'Hapless' Rishi Sunak's photo-op blew up in his face, Labour says as PM accepts seatbelt fine;;[];['live'];['pms', 'labour', 'mr', 'fine', 'enemies', 'claim', 'photoop', 'sunak', 'number', 'politics', 'seatbelt', 'latest', 'hapless', 'face', '11', 'sunaks', 'months', 'rishi'];"Analysis: Enemies could exploit Sunak's latest slip-up to claim he's out of touch

Downing Street will be hoping that once the PM has paid up, voters and journalists will move on and forget this rather embarrassing unforced error.

To Rishi Sunak's credit, he put his hands up and admitted the error almost immediately.

But it is a reminder that in the top job, with a permacrisis of strikes, NHS delays and high inflation, mistakes can slip through the Number 10 net.

Failing to wear a seatbelt is illegal, but filming it and publishing the evidence on social media suggests a lack of checks within the PM's team.

This is the second police fine Mr Sunak has received in nine months, after the Met Police punished him for attending a lockdown-busting birthday gathering for Boris Johnson.

In recent months Mr Sunak has struggled with contactless payments, had an awkward conversation with a homeless man about financial services, and demonstrated a fondness for using private jets to travel around the UK even for relatively short journeys.

Added together, such slip-ups may be exploited by the PM's enemies to claim he is out of touch.

There is certainly a danger these small missteps distract from Rishi Sunak’s attempts to stabilise the economy and sort out seemingly intractable issues like migrant crossings and delayed discharges.

Like many occupants of Number 11, Rishi Sunak was a 'submarine chancellor'. Invisible below the waves for months on end, he occasionally rose from the deep to launch a killer economic intervention: his ""whatever it takes"" COVID budget, the furlough scheme, Eat Out To Help Out.

But as Gordon Brown (the last politician to move from 11 to 10) found, similar manoeuvres are not possible as prime minister.

5340;5340;‘I’m an icon’: Sol Campbell says he deserves recognition in honours list;2023-01-04T13:19:28Z;['Andy Martin'];['Sol Campbell', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Sol Campbell believes his status as an “icon” of English football demands recognition and says he is baffled by being overlooked once more in the new year honours list. The former England, Arsenal and Tottenham defender became embroiled in a Twitter row on Tuesday after again failing to gain notice despite, he says, winning two Premier League titles and being the first black player to score for England in a World Cup. The 48-year-old is also involved in charity work.
The latest honours list, the first of the king’s reign, included four of the England women’s team – captain Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Ellen White and Lucy Bronze – and their head coach, Sarina Wiegman, in recognition of their Euros 2020 triumph. Campbell told GB News on Wednesday: “When it comes to honours lists, if it comes to a popularity contest, there’s a lot of unpopular people who are Sirs or have OBEs and MBEs. If you look at what I’ve done, and what I’ve gone through playing football and the consistency I’ve hit over the course of two decades, under severe pressure, I’m up there with some of the sporting greats of our country. “I’m a proud Englishman, I have done a lot of football and work on and off the field for racism. “I’m up there with all of them. I don’t know why I get overlooked on these kinds of occasions. I’m not the only sporting great that has been overlooked. It would be an honour for me to have a Sir, OBE or MBE for my sport, which I’ve committed to for over two decades.” Campbell also pointed to his work beyond football. “I ran a charity helping out disadvantaged kids from all over London, helping them kind of go to sporting events.
“I’ve done a hell of a lot for this country. I’ve been an icon. When I go abroad people recognise me for what I’ve done as a footballer. It would be nice if I could have something just saying hey, I’ve been recognised in my own country.” Campbell said on social media on Tuesday that he would “challenge anyone who says I don’t deserve” to be honoured. “I’ve seen a lot of people get MBEs, OBEs [and] Sir’s for services to sport [and] I will put my name down and reasons why [I should’ve been included]. “First, the 56 [Premier League] games without losing is an [individual] record. Two, invincible Arsenal team 49 games without losing [is] a record. Three, first black player to score in World Cup for England. Four, first black captain to lift a cup at Wembley “Five, first black English speaking player to score in a Champions League final. Six, I played two decades and over 500 games in the Premier League. “Seven, I stood up for racism in football here and abroad. Eight, only English player to play in six consecutive tournaments for England. Nine, got into the World Cup best team 1998 and 2002 and one European team [in] 2004, so at one stage I was pound-for-pound the best defender in the world – how many Englishmen can say that?
“I also had a charity called Kids Goes Live which took schoolchildren from underprivileged backgrounds to watch live sporting events! I challenge anyone who says I don’t deserve it? It will be silent out there!” Campbell’s opinion was supported by his former England teammates Rio Ferdinand and John Terry, who replied: “You get my vote, Sol.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/sol-campbell-recognition-honours-list;guardian;sports;5340

Constable Ravi Canhye, 46, will appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday following the charges.

The rape charges relate to two women and allegedly took place while the officer was off duty in early 2022, Dorset Police said.

The force added that Canhye was suspended at the time the allegations were made.

A Dorset Police spokesman said on Monday: ""A serving Dorset Police officer is to appear in court charged with rape.

""Police Constable Ravi Canhye, aged 46, was charged with offences on Tuesday 24 January 2023 and will appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday 3 February 2023 charged with eight sexual offences including two charges of rape.

""We understand that charges of this nature will quite rightfully cause concern within our communities.

""However, due to the ongoing legal proceedings, we are prevented from commenting on this matter any further at this time.""

Last week, the Met Police commissioner said around two to three criminal cases against officers were expected to go to court every week in the coming months following the charges against PC David Carrick.

PC Carrick, who was revealed to be one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after admitting 49 criminal charges, including 24 counts of rape. was first arrested back in October.

The charges relate to the rape of nine different women, but some are multiple incident counts, meaning they cover more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes.

Earlier this month, two retired Met officers were with offences related to the possession of images showing child sex abuse.

2555;2555;Shell to spend $450m on carbon offsetting as fears grow that credits may be worthless;2023-01-19T11:09:57Z;['Alex Lawson', 'Patrick Greenfield'];['Carbon offsetting', 'Shell', 'Deforestation', 'Fossil fuels', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Business'];;"The fossil fuel firm Shell has set aside more than $450m (£367m) to invest in carbon offsetting projects, and plans to spend the equivalent of half the current market for nature offsets every year, the Guardian can reveal. But a joint investigation by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Source Material into Verra, the world’s leading carbon standard for the rapidly growing $2bn voluntary offsets market, has found, based on analysis of a significant percentage of the projects, that more than 90% of their rainforest offset credits – among the most commonly used by companies – are likely to be “phantom credits” and do not represent genuine carbon reductions. Shell, one of the five largest oil companies in the world, has said it plans to ramp up spending on measures to counterbalance its polluting activities in an effort to decarbonise. Its strategy is to have a “philosophy of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate”, in theory putting nature-based carbon credits at the back of the queue in its efforts to decarbonise. But it appears that the company has, in fact, built offsetting into its climate strategy. The scale of Shell’s plans is striking, with a target of using nature-based solutions (NBS) – its term for the projects which generate carbon offsetting credits – to “mitigate emissions of around 120m metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year by 2030”. That figure is roughly half the size of the current entire annual market for nature offsets, which is about 227.7m MtC02e. Shell has set targets to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 27m tonnes, from 68m in 2021 to 41m in 2030, through a number of strategies including the use of renewable power and improvements in efficiency. The company expects NBS to account for between 2m and 7m tonnes of this reduction, underlining its importance to Shell’s decarbonisation plans. In 2020, Shell invested about $90m in nature-based projects and bought an Australian company that works on developing and monitoring carbon sequestration projects. The following year, Shell announced ambitions to invest about $100m a year in nature-based projects, although it said these plans were being slowed by the Covid-19 outbreak. That year, it allocated more than $480m to various projects – more than $456m of it for NBS projects – to be deployed across the length of the contracts. The company has also referred to offsetting as part of its carbon-reduction strategy in its appeal against the landmark judgment by a Dutch court last year that Shell must reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030. And it has been intimately involved in the development of the carbon market, with staff sitting in key advisory posts. At least three Shell staff sit on advisory groups for Verra, a US non-profit that operates the world’s leading carbon standard. Verra’s former director of programmes is a carbon offsetting manager at Shell, while the oil major’s former head of nature-based solutions has just co-founded a new carbon credits rating agency that helps companies find supposedly high-quality credits with a Verra advisory group member. Global carbon offsetting markets have grown rapidly, with many companies turning to them as part of their net zero plans and emphasising the benefits they can offer. Mark Carney, the ex-governor of the Bank of England, headed a plan to make offsets work, describing them as a way of helping companies get to net zero and “an incredibly important market”, although cautioning that they could not be “a silver bullet that removes responsibility from anyone for reducing absolute emissions”. But there have also been significant concerns raised about whether all offsets really work. The Guardian investigation analysed the findings of three scientific studies that used satellite images to check the results of a number of forest offsetting projects, known as Redd+ schemes, and found that, based on the results of two of the studies, about 94% of the credits the projects produced should not have been approved. Verra strongly disputes the findings and argues that the methodology used by the scientists means that the results are incorrect. They also point out that their work since 2009 has allowed billions of dollars to be channelled to the vital work of preserving forests. A Shell spokesperson told the Guardian: “As part of our efforts to become a net-zero energy business by 2050, we are investing billions of dollars in lower-carbon energy, including investments in low-carbon fuels, renewable power and hydrogen. “Where we use carbon credits, it is in line with our philosophy of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate emissions. They can help protect or restore natural ecosystems, and offer a near-term solution for addressing emissions that cannot be immediately abated. The carbon credits Shell uses and invests in are independently verified by third parties. We are working in collaboration with government, business and civil society to help strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of the carbon market.” The findings of the investigation will raise serious questions for Shell, and for many corporations that are counting on rainforest-based carbon offsets as part of their plan for reducing their emissions. As businesses race to declare their plans for reaching net zero, carbon offsets have been a critical part of their plans, and the market has grown exponentially. Lavazza, for example, says its coffee pods are carbon neutral using one project in Peru that stopped no deforestation, according to the analysis. Leon used the same scheme to claim its burgers were carbon neutral; the housebuilder Berkeley Group used it to say it was the UK’s first carbon-positive builder; and easyJet used it for carbon-neutral flying until changing its policy. Gucci, BHP, Salesforce.com and Pearl Jam all used offsets from another Peruvian scheme that only avoided around a 10th of the emissions it was claimed, according to the analysis. Disney used credits from a Cambodian scheme that was about nine times less effective than claimed. Boeing bought credits from a Colombian project estimated to stop no deforestation for its net-zero manufacturing claim, according to the studies, and smaller companies have also bought the offsets, including a UK tipi rental company and a financial services firm. When asked to comment Gucci, Pearl Jam, BHP, Berkeley Groupand Salesforce did not comment, while Lavazza said it bought credits that were certified by Verra, “a world’s leading certification organisation”, as part of the coffee products company’s “serious, concrete and diligent commitment to reduce” its carbon footprint. It plans to look more closely into the project. The fast food chain Leon no longer buys carbon offsets from one of the projects in the studies, as part of its mission to maximise its positive impact. EasyJet has moved away from carbon offsetting to focus its net zero work on projects such as “funding for the development of new zero-carbon emission aircraft technology”. And Boeing said that although it does buy offsets its reduction strategy is focussed on conserving energy resources and increasing the use of renewals, so that the number of offsets it buys fell by nearly 19% between 2020 and 2021. Thomas Crowther, professor of ecology at ETH Zürich and co-chair of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration who reviewed the findings of the investigation, told the Guardian: “Limiting deforestation is absolutely essential for achieving our climate and biodiversity targets. But transparency remains a key challenge, and it is critical that we use the best available scientific approaches to ensure the accountability of environmental commitments at scale” “Companies and citizens need to be able to support projects they can trust. We need to urgently create a system where this is a reality.” • This article was amended on 20 January 2023. The subheading was amended to clarify that the concerns over carbon offsetting schemes relate to the market generally rather than to any specific Shell projects. The main text was amended to state that offsetting is part of Shell’s climate strategy, rather than at “the heart of” this strategy as an earlier version said. And the definition of Shell’s “nature-based solutions” was also clarified.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/19/shell-to-spend-450m-on-carbon-offsetting-fears-grow-credits-worthless-aoe;guardian;environment;2555

I plan – and perhaps you’ll join me – to embrace the oldest me I can find. Improvements, upgrades, in a cost of living crisis? Are you joking? In a time when simply staying warm and fed is a struggle, we’re expected to add value? We’re expected to tone our bodies and refine our minds when the weather is horrid and the trains are off and the tap water tastes like violence? And God, honestly, who has the time, especially when time itself is unreliable, sometimes a viscous fluid that runs slowly through the days, other times it transforms into a rolling dice, likely to tumble very fast before getting stuck behind a sofa. Change… it’s not for me. Instead, I will try digging into the very guts of me, the laze and the slime, the most awful honesties and grim-witted shames. I will wallow there for a while, in a bath of my own soups. Isn’t this, in fact, what people want when they employ anti-ageing products? Or invest in plastic surgery and fillers? Aren’t they trying to see themselves again? To journey back in time and reunite with their truest selves, who nine times out of 10, they recall as looking like a 26-year-old trust-fund manager with big naturals? Our true self, our authentic self, is hidden (we’re encouraged to believe) by our jowls or cankles, or the soft belt of flesh that sits over our jeans. It’s compromised by the back passage of time. To this, I object. Your authentic self, surely, is unphotogenic at best, and at its worst a bird trapped in a kitchen, flailing awfully between murderous and needy. It is chaos, but a chaos in which you and only you know where everything is. Apart from the traumas, of course, which you filed haphazardly away in a hurry and which have the tendency to spill out at the strangest times, like when you sing Happy Birthday or hear the sound of scissors. While the new you might start to learn such skills as “posture” and “small talk”, the old you can be found covered in a towel typing into the comment box from a foetal position. At parties you are the one standing alone in the frigid garden pretending to vape in order to avoid the worst question in the world: “So, what have you been up to?” Where would you even start? What have you been up to? You worked that poppy seed from your teeth. You mastered the fine art of drinking coffee through a KitKat finger. You amused yourself at the table with candle wax for almost a whole hour. These replies never seem acceptable in the wild, but at home, in the bath of your own soup, it’s blindingly clear that if people want better answers they’ll need to start asking better questions. We call this: liberation. “Do one thing every day that scares you!” No, that sounds horrible, and the exact opposite of the life I aspire to, which involves – and this is top line stuff – remaining almost exclusively unterrified on a day to day basis. “Push your limits!” Limits exist for a reason, man. “Do the work!” Ever heard of labour shortages? “Step out of your comfort zone!” How about, instead of that, I crawl right back into it and make a nice cosy den there out of fleece and biscuits? How about I dig even deeper into that sweet old zone and build an entire city down there, with cinemas, and wall-to-wall carpet, and little bowls of chocolate buttons scattered around on welcoming surfaces? How would that be? Would all my pain be transformed into graceful and important works of art? Unlikely. Would I win a marathon or sail across the world on an eco dinghy made of milk bottles? Maybe not. Would I enjoy all nine seasons of The Office while gossiping on WhatsApp in my pyjamas? Perhaps! And who’s to say which is more rewarding? After many decades, when it becomes clear that every January demands a new you, eventually we must question how many we have in us. A baby girl is born with about 1m eggs, a baby boy born with about 300 bones – the numbers fall rapidly as time passes, and it’s the same with yous. At some point the effort of conceiving, producing and birthing yet another new you becomes treacherous. You run the risk of destroying the original you, now simply a host to all the prawnish enhanced versions emerging annually from its ruins with their abs and therapy words. Enough. Enough of all this – enough self-help (let’s help each other), enough self-improvement (find the joys hidden beneath the rocks in our existing if flawed little lives), enough struggling to be better when most of us are almost absolutely fine exactly as we are. Would you care to join me in a nap? Or a gentle stroll through the arcade, or up the high street? Would you like to sit comfortably for a while here on the sofa and marvel at the telly, and the comfort of our slippers, and the way our bodies instinctively know when to breathe in and out, and the gentle setting of the sun through the curtains, and the fact that both of us have lived to see another January?

2067;2067;What are we worrying about when we worry about TikTok? | Samantha Floreani;2023-01-21T19:00:15Z;['Samantha Floreani'];['TikTok', 'Social media', 'Digital media', 'Internet', 'Technology'];;"Is there any platform that creates as much collective angst as TikTok? For some, TikTok is just a silly video app. For others, it’s a symbol of our most potent social and political fears. What are young people engaging with? Isn’t it collecting a huge amount of data? Are they being dragged down dangerous rabbit holes? And is China spying on them? Concerns about data privacy, hyper-personalisation and exposure to content that could be harmful are all reasonable. But sensationalist headlines, reactionary calls for stricter content moderation – or banning the app entirely – risk missing the forest for the trees.
TikTok is not some strange aberration; it’s the logical next-step on the pathway of platform capitalism that was laid down by those that came before it. It’s a product of a privatised internet that best serves applications ultimately designed not for people, but for profit. I confess: I really like TikTok. For me, it’s become a place of joy and absurdity among the rage, horrors, and tedium of its competitors. As a digital rights and privacy advocate, admitting this feels like a dirty little secret. The thing is, it’s possible to simultaneously hate a platform but love the people on it and the things they create. But my experience of TikTok is likely to be completely different to yours; that’s by design. TikTok’s commitment to algorithmically curated content is one of the reasons it stands out from the rest. The “For You’” page is responsible for its popularity and profitability – but also its harm. As with all social media, there are myriad horrendous marks against TikTok. From TraumaTok and content encouraging disordered eating and self-harm to influencer propaganda attempting to recruit Gen Z to the military, there is no shortage of reasons to worry.
There are also plenty of examples of TikTok being used for social good. Labourers have used it to gain visibility and criticise their working conditions; it’s the home of a growing Indigenous creator community; and many young people use it to organise and amplify their voices on critical political issues. What are we really worrying about when we worry about TikTok? Most concerns seem to be misdirected anxieties about the broader status quo of the platform ecosystem. Almost all widely used digital platforms threaten the privacy and security of users. They share information with various governments, have the capacity for cultural and ideological influence, and exploit user data for profit. TikTok has shifted emphasis away from mass virality and toward maximum niche-ification. Once it has determined what keeps someone on the app, it takes them deep into the obscure content trenches. Perhaps they lingered on a couple of sad heartbreak videos and now they’re being bombarded with depression content, or re-watching a controversial political video led them to conspiracy theories. Wherever they end up, once there, it can be incredibly hard to get out. This is partially why online anonymity is so important – it gives people the grace of exploration and inquiry. It allows people to make choices, change their minds, learn, and grow. TikTok doesn’t make room for this kind of internet exploration; it makes it impossible to have curiosity without consequence. TikTok isn’t alone in using engagement and recommender algorithms to curate personalised content feeds, but it does take it to the extreme. This is profitable both because it keeps people scrolling and because there’s very little difference between being able to personalise content and personalise ads. Because of its monumental success, other apps are attempting to follow in TikTok’s footsteps, giving us a glimpse into the current trajectory of social media. Instagram recently faced backlash when it started prioritising recommended short-form videos, and just last week, Twitter made the algorithmic feed the default. With a business model this lucrative, it’s not enough to fight TikTok alone.
Let’s go down our own rabbit hole: if you’re worried about algorithms showing people problematic content, you should be worried about targeted advertising. The logic of personalised engagement is the same. And if you’re worried about targeted advertising, you should be worried about the way data is collected for profit under surveillance capitalism. That’s what enables it. And if you’re worried about surveillance capitalism, you should be worried about regular old capitalism. Profit is what drives companies toward invasive data collection and developing algorithms that keep people on their apps for longer. But online spaces run for profit aren’t preordained. This is a choice, and we could make a different one. What might social networking look like if the incentive to make money was removed? What might be built if it was in the hands of the people, with the motive being connection, creativity, or community, rather than market competition? This is not a call to apathy, but rather, to think bigger. It’s an invitation to take those concerns about TikTok and reorient them. It’s time to broaden our collective political imagination of the kind of online experiences that could be possible if we break the profit-motive stranglehold and make room for publicly owned and collectively controlled social technology.

6377;6377;Billie Eilish: Singer says 'I feel like my body was gaslighting me for years';Wednesday 4 January 2023 21:36, UK;[];['billie eilish'];['eilish', 'injury', 'felt', 'suffered', 'body', 'feel', 'billie', 'injuries', 'vogue', 'song', 'singer', 'gaslighting'];"Billie Eilish has said she felt like her body was ""gaslighting"" her, as she reflected on her struggles with injuries she suffered as a teenager.

The 21-year-old pop sensation sustained a hip injury aged 13 and after subsequent lower body injuries, she was diagnosed with hypermobility.

Eilish spoke about how her relationship with her body changed over the years in an interview with Vogue magazine.

The American singer told Vogue: ""Going through my teenage years of hating myself and all that stupid s**t, a lot of it came from my anger toward my body, and how mad I was at how much pain it's caused me, and how much I've lost because of things that happened to it.""

After coming to terms with her injuries, Eilish revealed she had developed a new relationship with her body having previously felt at odds with it.

""I felt like my body was gaslighting me for years,"" she said.

""I had to go through a process of being like, my body is actually me. And it's not out to get me.""

According to the Collins Dictionary, gaslighting is an attempt to manipulate a person by continually presenting them with false information until they doubt their sanity.

The Grammy-winning singer, who first gained attention at the age of 13 after sharing her song Ocean Eyes on music platform SoundCloud, suffered a growth plate injury in her hip, which subsequently meant she could no longer take dance classes.

Reflecting on the timing of the injury, Eilish said: ""I got injured right after we made Ocean Eyes, so, music kind of replaced dancing.""

Hypermobility, according to the NHS, means sufferers have highly flexible joints, allowing for an unusually large range of movement, which can lead to stiffness and pain.

5570;5570;Antitrust target Ticketmaster spends big on lobbying amid woeful 2022;2023-01-03T08:00:38Z;['Tom Perkins'];['Music industry', 'Business', 'Taylor Swift', 'Bad Bunny', 'Music', 'Consumer affairs', 'Culture', 'US political lobbying', 'US news'];;"Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation had a calamitous 2022 – managing to anger everyone from Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny to Joe Biden and Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. As calls grow for action to rein in the concert monopoly in the US and abroad, the company seems to have hit on a new strategy: spending big in Washington. Live Nation’s spending on lobbying jumped from about $250,000 in 2018 to nearly $1.3m in 2021, federal records show, and it may top that peak in 2022 and beyond. It has focused its lobbying campaign on the department of justice, as well as legislation aimed at greater transparency around ticket sales.
The spending is a response to the “serious challenges” Live Nation faces, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of campaign finance analyst Open Secrets. “The spending has a lot to do with them playing defense because they have been accused for several years of behavior that has been anticompetitive, they have been accused of being a monopoly company and they have the DoJ investigation, so they are fighting on a number of fronts,” Krumholz said. The political spending comes amid mounting frustration among concertgoers and sports fans over alleged price gouging, soaring fees and Live Nation’s practice of withholding tickets that are then sold on the secondary market at inflated cost, among other issues. In the US, the problems escalated after a chaotic November rollout of Taylor Swift Era tour presale tickets left thousands of fans without access to her shows. The controversy ignited bipartisan outrage among lawmakers who have called for Ticketmaster and Live Nation to be split, and led to a lawsuit that accuses Live Nation of fraud and antitrust violations. In the mess’s wake, news broke of a justice department antitrust investigation that opened earlier this year, and within weeks the company was back in the headlines after at least hundreds of Bad Bunny fans were locked out of a Mexico City concert. Meanwhile, Live Nation’s “dynamic pricing scheme” dramatically drives up ticket prices for popular events, and its fees, which critics say are excessive, sometimes top the cost of a ticket. Live Nation has worked closely with secondary market brokers and set up its own secondary market, where ticket prices are increased by an average of 50-150%, depending on the type of event, a government report found. Consumer advocates, a growing number of lawmakers and attorneys general say the problems stem from Live Nation’s stranglehold on live entertainment, which has eliminated meaningful competition and, they claim, harmed artists and consumers. Since merging with Ticketmaster in 2010, Live Nation has controlled most of the US’s ticketing, and is among the largest promoters, venue owners and artist managers. When it doesn’t control one of those elements, it uses its leverage to force companies to work with it, critics say. “The approval of the Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger led to a marketplace and concert space where there is a complete inability to go up against this company,” said Krista Brown, senior policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project, which is helping lead a campaign to reverse the merger. The justice department investigation started months before the Swift debacle, and Live Nation’s 2021-2022 lobbying records show the company spending $960,000. However, the nation’s vague lobbying laws make it impossible for the public to know how much was spent specifically on lobbying the department.
Regardless, the Department of Justice has drawn criticism for how it has handled Live Nation in recent years. As part of the terms of its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster, Live Nation had to enter into a 10-year consent decree with the justice department. Among other provisions, it prohibited the new company from retaliating against venues for working with other ticketing services or forcing them to accept its terms in exchange for access to Live Nation artists. The justice department found in late 2019 that Live Nation had repeatedly violated those rules but industry observers say it took little meaningful action. Though the justice department extended the consent decree for five years, the problems persist. “Ticketmaster and Live Nation have come out on top every single time – even when the consent decree was reviewed and it was established by the DoJ that Live Nation violated it, very little changed,” Brown said. “Their control of the regulatory environment, whether overt or covert, seems quite strong.” Live Nation’s lobbying records from the current election total $1.7m. The increase came after the introduction of the Boss Act, though vague reporting requirements make it impossible for the public to know how much of that sum was spent specifically on the act. The Boss Act was named after Bruce Springsteen’s nickname and drawn up following a 2009 controversy in which fans were prevented by Ticketmaster from buying tickets to Springsteen’s tour. If passed, it would increase transparency around ticket sales and impose some new restrictions on secondary market sales. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced in October that it intended to develop new rules around “junk fees” and charges imposed on “captive” customers across the economy. The rules aim to address “the black box nature of the fees”, Brown said. That would probably have implications for the entertainment industry and Live Nation, which imposes facility, convenience and processing fees that consumers must pay because Ticketmaster is the only company selling tickets to an event.
Live Nation’s recent financial filings show the number of tickets sold increased from 117m to 135m, or 15%, from Q3 2019 to Q3 2022. The revenue it collected from fees during the same time period jumped by about 65%, from $355m to $588m. Meanwhile, its revenue jumped by 87% during the same period, fueled by increased ticket fees, higher ticket prices, more lucrative sponsorships and a push into the festival market. After the company boasted of the spike during a 3 November earnings call with investors, shareholders repeatedly asked about legislation and the justice department investigation. The chief financial officer, Joe Berchtold, and other executives downplayed any potential threat. Berchtold said the discussion centered around “transparency” and did not pose a risk to the company’s revenues or structure. “The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up,” he said. “That’s been looked at, and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard.” Executives said in the earnings call that they were supportive of “all in” pricing that is part of the Boss Act and would require companies to show the full price of a ticket up front, including fees. Though no lobbying records are available for the period since the FTC made its announcement, Live Nation’s Berchtold assured shareholders there was no need to worry: “We will work with the FTC,” he said in the earnings call. The company is also politically active at the state level, and spent $90,000 in Florida on legislation aimed at loosening regulations around secondary ticket market sales, Open Secrets found, while executives said they “worked with” the New York attorney general on the state’s implementation of “all in” pricing. Still, Brown from the American Economic Liberties Project said consumer advocates are optimistic now that the Biden administration and the justice department have in place a much more serious antitrust team than the Trump administration had, which put up “weak guardrails”. The new antitrust team may be willing to take on the structural changes needed to protect consumers and artists, despite Live Nation’s lobbying, Brown added. “It’s a pretty hopeful time,” she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/03/ticketmaster-live-nation-lobbying-taylor-swift-bad-bunny;guardian;entertainment & culture;5570
5390;5390;Assistant referee Bhupinder Singh Gill to make Premier League history;2023-01-04T08:00:12Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Premier League', 'Referees', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Bhupinder Singh Gill says he hopes to “inspire the next generation” as he prepares to become the first Sikh-Punjabi to serve as an assistant referee at a Premier League match. The 37-year-old, who qualified as a referee at the age of 14, will run the line when Southampton host Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, a groundbreaking achievement. “This has to be the proudest and most exciting moment in my refereeing journey, but I’m not getting carried away as it is just another step in the direction to where I want to get to,” said Singh Gill, known as Bhups.
“Hopefully, this is another moment to help inspire the next generation to sign up to a refereeing course and get into officiating. My dream has always been to reach the top of the game, be a role model for future officials and encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into officiating, especially from a South Asian background just like me.” Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, said Singh Gill had proven himself as a talented official in the EFL. “I’m delighted that Bhupinder has been given this appointment in the Premier League – for him as an individual, and for the recognition of the talented and dedicated official he is, having worked his way through the levels,” Webb said. “Bhupinder’s appointment to the Premier League and the best league in the world will show an even greater audience about what’s possible for people from different backgrounds. It will give other British [South] Asian boys and girls an opportunity to see somebody who looks like them doing something that they thought wasn’t possible for them previously.” Webb told Sky Sports News. “It’s a great opportunity to use Bhupinder’s expertise in the capacity as a role model, but also for us to have his ability as an official – because he’s good at what he does.” Bhupinder’s brother, Sunny, is the highest-ranked referee of South Asian heritage in England and joined the EFL referees’ list this summer. Bhupinder made history alongside Sunny in 2021 when the pair worked on the same Championship fixture. Bhupinder was an assistant referee and Sunny the fourth official when Bristol City hosted Nottingham Forest.
They are the sons of the trailblazing referee Jarnail Singh, who took charge of 150 EFL games between 2004 and 2010. He was the first official to wear a turban in senior English football. “My family are also really proud and excited for me,” Bhupinder said. “I wouldn’t be in this situation if it wasn’t for my dad, who has supported me throughout my journey and been a role model for me. He’s taken leave from work to make sure he attends the game alongside my wife and son. It’ll be special to have them there.” Webb worked with Singh Sr in the EFL in the early noughties. “I go back with their dad for quite some time,” he said. “Jarnail Singh, in addition to being a really, really good referee, is just a wonderful guy. He was always a pleasure to work with.” Of the sons, Webb said: “They are athletic, they know how to manage people, all these skills that you need to be successful. If you don’t have them, you don’t survive in the professional game. These guys have done more than survive, they’ve excelled and I think will continue to do so.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/assistant-referee-bhupinder-singh-gill-to-make-premier-league-history;guardian;sports;5390
547;547;Nadhim Zahawi: the extraordinary rise and fall of ‘the boy from Baghdad’;2023-01-29T12:23:07Z;['Josh Halliday'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Conservatives'];;As the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, Nadhim Zahawi talks proudly of representing the birthplace of William Shakespeare. His own political downfall has all the makings of a tragedy in five acts. The Kurdish-born Iraqi refugee, who arrived in Britain aged 11, was sacked as chair of the Conservative party on Sunday after he was found to have committed a “serious breach’” of the ministerial code over his tax affairs. His dismissal follows days of mounting pressure after the Guardian revealed that the former chancellor had agreed to pay a penalty to HMRC as part of a multimillion-pound settlement last year. He was sacked by Rishi Sunak after an investigation found that he had failed to declare this investigation by HMRC when he was appointed chancellor last July. The prime minister’s ethics adviser found that he had breached the ministerial code again when he failed to declare the tax penalty when appointed to the governments of Liz Truss and Sunak. It caps an extraordinary downfall for a man who less than a year ago ran to be Conservative party leader and, with it, prime minister of the UK. Zahawi is, by some measures, one of the most remarkable politicians of his generation. Born in Iraqi Kurdistan, he came to England in 1978 when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. The “boy from Baghdad,” as Zahawi calls himself, initially struggled to settle in his new country and his parents were warned he may suffer from learning difficulties due to his initial inability to speak English. He overcame those difficulties and entered local politics, serving for 12 years as a borough councillor in Wandsworth, south-west London. At this time, in the late 1990s, he worked for the Conservative MP Jeffrey Archer (who referred to Zahawi as “lemon Kurd”). Zahawi advised Archer during his London mayoral bid in 1999, a campaign that ended in scandal. Two years later, Archer was jailed for four years having been convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. In 2000, Zahawi co-founded the polling company YouGov with fellow Conservative Stephan Shakespeare. It floated on the stock market five years later. The row surrounding Zahawi centred on a tax bill over the sale of shares in YouGov – worth an estimated £27m – which were held by Balshore Investments, a company registered offshore in Gibraltar and linked to Zahawi’s family. After becoming an MP in 2010, he joined government as an education minister under Theresa May in July 2018, but it was under her successor, Boris Johnson, that his stock rose to new heights. He oversaw the rollout of Covid vaccines as a health minister between 2020 and 2021 before being appointed education secretary in September that year, charged with clearing up the mess left by Gavin Williamson. The 55-year-old has for years faced questions over his links to offshore investment firms and whether they were appropriately declared. He responded by threatening to sue journalists and tax lawyers as recently as last summer, when he was chancellor, insisting that he had paid “all due taxes” on his multimillion-pound fortune. In fact, he had been under investigation by HMRC since April 2021 and had agreed by last August to pay a tax penalty as part of a settlement totalling nearly £5m. Tax investigators held a face-to-face meeting with Zahawi in June 2021, when he was a business minister, but the MP failed to declare it and claimed he did not realise it was a formal investigation. In July 2022, in the dying days of the Johnson administration, he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer – a role that put him in charge of the UK’s tax policy. Despite the glaring conflict in his new role, Zahawi again failed to declare the ongoing HMRC investigation and instead went on the attack, describing reports of the investigation “inaccurate, unfair and clearly smears”. Zahawi was chancellor for only two months, from 5 July to 6 September 2022, but it was during this time that he arranged a settlement of nearly £5m with HMRC. The Guardian understands this settlement is made up of a £3.7m in tax due, plus a 30% penalty, taking the total to £4.8m. Again, he did not declare this payout until 16 January after further questions. At the same time Zahawi was resolving his tax affairs with HMRC, he was running for leader of the Tory party with a pledge to slash taxes if he became prime minister. He was knocked out of the leadership race after the first round. He was appointed chair of the party last October, with sources telling the Observer that Sunak was warned by senior officials that the government faced a reputational risk over Zahawi’s tax matters. The prime minister sacked Zahawi on Sunday, three months after appointing him. In a letter to Sunak after his dismissal, Zahawi said it had been “the privilege of my life” to serve in the government. He added: “I arrived in this country fleeing persecution and speaking no English. Here, I built a successful business and served in some of the highest offices in government. I believe that in no other country on earth would my story be possible. It reaffirms my belief in the greatness and compassion of our nation.” Zahawi’s memoirs, titled A Boy from Baghdad: My Journey from Waziriyah to Westminster, are due to be released later this year. He now has time to write the latest act of his own political tragedy.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/nadhim-zahawi-sacked-tory-party-chair-the-extraordinary-rise-and-fall-of-the-boy-from-baghdad;guardian;politics;547
4755;4755;Atom Valley: Andy Burnham’s vision for regenerating Greater Manchester;2023-01-07T16:00:23Z;['Larry Elliott'];['Manufacturing sector', 'Greater Manchester', 'Andy Burnham', 'Technology sector', 'Business', 'Research and development'];;"Greater Manchester is Britain in miniature. It has pockets of great prosperity and areas of serious deprivation. It has world-class companies but not enough of them. It has too many poorly skilled people in low-productivity jobs. And it has, as Andy Burnham, frankly admits, its own north-south divide. The mayor of Greater Manchester says there was once an industrial arc running from Wigan in the west to Rochdale in the north and Oldham and Tameside in the east. When coal and cotton went into decline, these towns did too, and they have never really recovered. But Burnham says he has a plan – called Atom Valley – that can help. He says: “I’ve always been clear since I came into this role – I remember Howard Bernstein saying to me when I was first thinking about doing it, he said that in the end Greater Manchester’s devolution will be judged by what it can do for Oldham and Rochdale, and we have done things for Oldham and Rochdale. This is us levelling up Greater Manchester ourselves.”
Atom Valley is a public-private partnership with plans to build an advanced manufacturing hub and create 20,000 jobs across three separate sites in Bury, Rochdale and Oldham. The name references Manchester’s role in splitting the atom (Ernest Rutherford, in 1917) with a deliberate nod to California’s Silicon Valley. Whether business parks in Bury, Rochdale and Oldham will ever spawn the global success stories of the US big tech sector remains to be seen. As everyone involved in the project admits, there is a long way to go and many obstacles to overcome. The idea is to emulate the success of Salford’s media city: that creative hub grew out of the BBC’s decision to move thousands of jobs there from London. Manchester’s economy is bigger than Wales’s, but it still underperforms the London area and comparable European cities such as Lyon and Munich. “The region has a productivity problem,” says Neil Eccles, head of innovation at Rochdale Development Agency. Jobs are concentrated in so-called foundational sectors – low-wage work such as taxi driving and hairdressing that exist to serve local residents.
On the plus side, Greater Manchester has a tradition for innovation stretching from John Kay’s flying shuttle in the 18th century (a key contribution to the Industrial Revolution) to graphene, an ultra-thin material made up of a single layer of carbon atoms developed by two researchers from Manchester University in 2004. Yet while the potential for spinning out businesses from academics with bright and marketable ideas is there, the limited nature of Britain’s manufacturing base is affecting the ability to commercialise graphene, according to Prof Richard Jones, an innovation expert at Manchester University. “The most interesting applications will be in electronics and we don’t have an electronics industry any more,” he says. “Manchester is not doing well as a whole. You can’t have booming businesses downtown and people in the northern boroughs left high and dry. Greater Manchester should be driving the economy of the whole north-west.” The answer, Jones says, is to boost R&D spending, set up research centres to translate ideas into new products, and develop clusters of manufacturing excellence. Britain should learn from countries such as Germany and Taiwan, which have had success using this model. Ben Smart, managing director of Rochdale mechanical engineering firm Whitham Mills, agrees: “We are focusing on what the region is good at, what it has in its bag of tricks. The great thing about Manchester is that it has a world name. We can define the northern part of the city as the manufacturing centre of Britain.” On the downside, competition for inward investment is ferocious. Negotiations with Tesla to build a giant gigafactory on the biggest of the three development sites – the Northern Gateway – ended in disappointment when the company chose Berlin instead. Burnham remains upbeat about the prospects for his mayoral development zone. “We have been clear from the start of the regeneration that this could be of national significance. Our job as Greater Manchester is to fully realise this ambition. It has already attracted a lot of interest and I am really confident about what it can be.” Better transport connectivity will be vital, as will the ability of firms to find workers with the right skills. The Greater Manchester mayor is pressing Whitehall to devolve power over vocational training to him. “The nature of the industries we are trying to create means we will have specific requirements regarding skills, and that can’t be delivered by Whitehall.” He says trailblazer negotiations about a new devolution deal are under way, with technical education the biggest priority: “The question potential investors ask most frequently is, ‘Can we get the skills?’. If they are serious about regional growth they [ministers] have to devolve power over vocational education to us. You can’t build your system from the top down; it has to be from the bottom up. “Nowhere in the country has cracked technical education, and I want us to be the first in the country to do so. The question is whether the government is serious about levelling up these ‘red wall’ areas and, if it is, give us Atom Valley. This is a flagship project of international importance. It needs backing.”
The need to improve Greater Manchester’s stock of human capital is not lost on the staff of Rochdale’s Hopwood Hall further education college, where 1,200 of the 3,000 students are doing catch-up courses in English and 1,300 are doing the equivalent for maths. Andrea Murphy, the deputy principal, says: “To level up, we need to put academic and vocational qualifications on a par with each other.” Given the structural nature of the challenge, progress will not be instant. Paul Ormerod, chair of the Atom Valley development zone, says: “You do get businesses springing out of Manchester University, but there are not enough of them. It’s not like MIT in the US; it’s good but nowhere near good enough.”
Ormerod believes the Greater Manchester combined authority can help by lobbying the government for money and an extension of its power. “Atom Valley is a large task, which is why it has to operate on a number of fronts, including further education and transport, and it needs to get a kickstart from public funding.” Jones says his vision of success would be the arrival in Atom Valley of two or three big international companies with major manufacturing capability, along with R&D functions. These would act as a magnet for smaller companies, spin-outs from the university, and a translational research facility that can adapt groundbreaking discoveries into marketable technologies. Existing businesses would flourish, colleges would work with companies to provide skills, and there would be jobs at all levels. Burnham is convinced it can happen. “There is belief in this place. Devolution has made a difference. Investors have confidence in us. People speculate about whether I am planning to get back to Westminster and the answer is ‘no’. Here is much more exciting. “Our generation had to leave to get on in life but that’s not the case any more. You can get on by staying here.” • This article was amended on 7 and 10 January 2023. The headline was amended to correct the name of Greater Manchester; and the text was amended to clarify that Andy Burnham was quoting Howard Bernstein when he referred to Greater Manchester’s devolution being judged by what it could do for Oldham and Rochdale.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/07/atom-valley-andy-burnhams-vision-for-regenerating-great-manchester;guardian;business & economy;4755

Two hours later, the Liverpool Riverside MP returned to the Commons and told the House she wanted to ""apologise unreservedly for the intemperate language"".

Ms Johnson added: ""I was wrong to use the term fascist in relation to the Israeli government and understand why this was particularly insensitive given the history of the state of Israel.

""And while there are far-right elements in the government I recognise that the use of the term in this context was wrong.""

She also apologised for using the term ""apartheid state"", saying: ""While I was quoting accurately Amnesty's description I recognise this is insensitive and I would like to withdraw it.""

Tensions have been rising between Israel and the Palestinians in recent weeks, with escalating violence in the region.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in the country earlier this week and appealed to ""everyone to take steps to calm tensions rather than inflame them"".

Labour grandee Dame Margaret Hodge called Ms Johnson's language ""unacceptable and dangerous"", adding: ""With violence escalating in recent weeks, this careless remark only makes it harder to bridge the divide.""

3491;3491;Revealed: cabinet split over NHS pay disputes piles pressure on Sunak;2023-01-14T18:00:15Z;['Toby Helm'];['Industrial action', 'NHS', 'Steve Barclay', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Health', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Trade unions', 'Unison', 'Nursing', 'Health policy', 'Industrial policy', 'England', 'Wales', 'Society'];;"The health and social care secretary Steve Barclay has privately urged trade unions to help him make the case to the Treasury and No 10 for extra money for nurses, ambulance workers and other NHS staff in an extraordinary twist to the escalating crisis over health service strikes, the Observer can reveal. A serious cabinet split has opened up, with Barclay now wanting more money for all NHS staff except doctors – while Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, are refusing to budge from their insistence that no more can be offered. Barclay’s call for the unions to help him present a convincing case to Sunak and Hunt was made at a meeting between the unions and ministers last Monday. Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, who chairs the 14-strong NHS group of unions, and who was present, told the Observer: “On Monday he talked about asking us to help make the case to the Treasury for the investment needed.” Gorton said that after weeks of stonewalling Barclay’s tone was “very different” in the meeting and that he was willing to talk about more pay, including for this year. But just as surprising to union leaders was that Barclay requested help from the unions to make an argument to Hunt and Sunak that more money would help stop the rapid exodus of NHS staff to other jobs, and increase efficiency. “He asked for our assistance in making the case about how improving pay and investing in the workforce could lead to greater efficiencies and productivity.” Gorton, who has been involved in every pay round on behalf of Unison members in the NHS for the past 20 years, explained that in order to reach deals with Conservative governments she had found that ministers needed to be able to convince the Treasury that any extra money spent would lead to savings in the medium and longer term. “All of the agreements I have been involved with in the past have involved a certain amount of showing the benefits of investing,” she said.
“He [Barclay] offered to be the advocate for health workers inside the cabinet. My interpretation of what he said was that he was prepared to make the case for us for investment in pay.” Gorton has written to Barclay this weekend asking him to organise a meeting with the prime minister, the chancellor and Unison’s general secretary Christina McAnea. The aim, she said, would be to secure extra funding for an improved settlement for NHS staff from outside existing budgets. Gorton’s account was confirmed last night by senior Whitehall officials who had been briefed on the meeting, as well as several other sources from the health unions. One Whitehall official briefed on the discussions said: “Everything Sara Gorton has said in public has turned out to be fair and accurate and this is a true reflection of what was said in the meeting.” Downing Street said No 10 and the Treasury continued to hold the view that ministers would not move beyond the pay review body recommendations, although a spokesman said Barclay had made clear that his “door was open” for more talks. No 10 said it would respond to the letter from Gorton. The Observer understands that while Barclay has stuck doggedly to the official government line for months, he made the case inside government for higher pay for NHS staff early on in the dispute, only to be told by the Treasury that making an exception for NHS workers would lead to rash of other unaffordable claims across the public sector. Barclay is now understood to be concerned that the NHS’s capacity crisis, and lengthening waiting times for ambulances, could lead to the collapse of the service and more staff quitting. With the unions feeling increasingly confident that they are winning the argument, the Royal College of Nursing said last night that it would pull double the number of nurses out on strike in February compared with previous strikes before Christmas, and involve more hospitals. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that public support for nurses and ambulance staff remains solid, with many more voters blaming the government for the crisis than the unions. Some 57% of voters supported nurses striking, compared with 31% who opposed the action. Striking ambulance staff were backed by 52%, against 35% who opposed them taking action.
Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “The government will be disappointed if it was hoping the public would blame striking nurses and ambulance workers for the situation in the NHS. Although support for strikes in general has fallen slightly since before Christmas, the public are still overwhelmingly supportive.” Despite Sunak’s attempts to make political capital from the crisis by claiming Labour is in the pockets of the striking unions, Keir Starmer’s party has increased its lead over the Tories in the Christmas period. Labour is on 45% (+1) compared with the Conservatives, who are unchanged on 29% since three weeks ago. The nurses’ strike will continue this week with staff at more than 70 NHS trusts in England that were not part of December’s first wave of industrial action walking out on Wednesday and Thursday. The RCN will announce new strike dates for the start of February in the 48 hours before its second strike this week. Nurses’ leaders said that if progress was not made in negotiations by the end of January, the strikes in February would include all eligible members in England for the first time. Pat Cullen, general secretary of the RCN, said: “The public supports nurses because of just how much nurses give to the public. Rishi Sunak’s intransigence is baffling, reckless and politically ill-considered.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/14/steve-barclay-nhs-unions-rishi-sunak-pay-health-secretary;guardian;politics;3491

Is that really progress?, 25 January). My mother had a recurrent lecture series when I was a teenager listing all the reasons why she wouldn’t be sticking around to clean my abscesses when I inevitably grow into a bed-ridden monster. Not exactly affirming, nor particularly helpful, feedback from your primary care giver as a moderately overweight teenager. I’m not sure if I’m really up for an evening of Brendan Fraser opening up that particular wound just yet, despite agreeing that his empathy on the matter seems genuine. I’ve always thought that the sign of real progress in how fat people are portrayed in the media will be when a fat actor is, earnestly and successfully, the object of active romantic desire by a protagonist in a mainstream movie. Fat people, and the people who love them, live in a world that has taught us that our love is at best niche, at worst hilarious. I’m a BAME woman, so at this point, add that discrimination to the tab. What’s harder to stomach, however, is the feeling that the world sees my husband as some pervert for finding me attractive. I’d love to see representation of what we have, for him as much as for myself.

5111;5111;Greggs workers get 10% pay increase amid ‘material cost inflation’;2023-01-05T15:08:32Z;['Sarah Butler'];['Greggs', 'Retail industry', 'Food & drink industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Inflation'];;"Greggs has handed a 10% pay increase to workers as it warned of “material cost inflation” that prompted a third rise in the price of its sausage rolls in a year. The bakery chain said its shop workers would be paid at least £10.60 an hour from 1 January, up from £9.62 rate brought in last year. The new rate is being introduced three months earlier than the usual pay review and is above the legal minimum wage for people aged 23 and over, which will increase from £9.50 to £10.42 on 1 April. The Greggs pay rise comes in just days after the company said it had been forced to increase the prices on a number of its products by between 5p and 10p, taking the price of its sausage rolls to £1.20 each, up from £1 a year ago. Greggs said it expected its overall costs to rise by about 9% this year, in line with 2022 as inflation on energy and food continued. Roisin Currie, its chief executive, said the pay rise had been brought forward as Greggs always tried to “look after people”. She said there were no plans to put the price of its goods up again but warned that with continued high energy costs, food inflation, which was “significant throughout 2022”, would continue in 2023. The company plans to open 150 more stores this year – including several more Tasty outlets in Primark – as the chain benefits from the search for bargains during the cost of living crisis. Greggs said sales surged by 18% in established outlets in the run-up to Christmas as it shrugged off the impact of rail strikes and the cold weather to bounce back from a poor year, when Omicron prompted many people to avoid high streets and offices. Total sales rose by 23% to £1.5bn in the three months to 31 December, helped by the opening of new stores as well as strong trading in established outlets. Greggs said its festive bakes, mince pies and salted caramel lattes had sold particularly well, with early evening experiencing the fastest rise in sales as it opens more outlets for takeaway dinners such as pizza. It said use of its app, which offers discounts, had also increased.
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Greggs was benefiting as shoppers “flock to value” during the cost of living crisis. “Greggs is so confident its strong trading will continue, it’s planning to open 150 shops this year, and is continuing with extended opening hours at over a fifth of its sites,” she said. “Essentially, Greggs has a lot going in its favour because it exists at the end of the value spectrum, and the group is capitalising on this. However, it will be crucial to closely monitor how out-of-home spending shapes up, because any worse-than-expected drop offs would be bad news for profits when combined with soaring costs.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/05/bargain-hunting-shoppers-bring-new-year-cheer-to-greggs-and-bm;guardian;business & economy;5111
4925;4925;‘Every day is like a party’: the Melbourne cafe where people with a disability set the tone;2023-01-06T14:00:01Z;['Benita Kolovos'];['Disability', 'Melbourne', 'Victoria', 'Australia news', 'Industrial relations'];;"As the hospitality industry continues to struggle with staff shortages, a cafe in Melbourne’s south-east seems to have the opposite problem: a growing waitlist of people wanting to join its team. All Things Equal operates like every other cafe on Carlisle Street in Balaclava, though about half of its staff – from the front-of-house to the kitchen – have a disability. The cafe’s mission, according to general manager Bianca Stern, is to show that people living with disability are not only “ready, willing and absolutely capable” to work but should also be fairly compensated.
“There are hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities who are willing to work but they are too often overlooked,” Stern says. “I don’t think perhaps as a society we are educated enough to understand the benefits of employing someone with a disability or what they need to do to be an inclusive employer. “I’m hopeful we are slowly changing that.” All Things Equal is the brainchild of Jonathan Wenig, a partner at the Melbourne law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler. He was concerned about the challenges his daughter, who has special needs, would face finding meaningful employment after she finished school. Wenig set up a charity, created a board and raised almost $200,000 – from philanthropists and his own funds – to open the cafe in January 2021. Among those to join the board was the property entrepreneur Sam Herszberg. “Who can’t remember their first job and the person who gave them their first chance?” Herszberg says.
“People with a disability deserve that same chance.” The cafe began with 12 staff with a disability but has since expanded to 25. They include Harley and Paul, who have been at All Things Equal since it opened and have become good friends. “I love it. I enjoy the work and it teaches me independent living and it makes me feel happy,” Paul says. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He began in the kitchen but now works two days a week front-of-house, which involves serving customers, cleaning and making milkshakes, smoothies and toasties, though his favourite aspect of the job is the team work. Harley, who is also front-of-house, says he enjoys talking to the customers and revving up the kitchen team. He has become known for applauding both during his shifts. “Every day is like a party,” he says. There are about 60 people on a waitlist for a job at the cafe. “I hope business owners read that and think, ‘Oh, wow, I can also do something about this,’” Stern says. Still left out Almost 2.1 million people with disability are of working age in Australia, but research has shown 93% of unemployed people aged 15 to 64 with a disability have faced difficulty finding employment. The unemployment rate for people with disability is more than double that of working-age people without disability and this has remain unchanged for decades. It’s a statistic the 2022 Australian of the Year, Dylan Alcott, cited several times as he made improving employment outcomes for people living with a disability a focus of his tenure. He told the disability royal commission in December people with disability “always get left out of [the] economic conversation because people think we can’t do anything”.
Alcott recalled having a job interview cancelled when he was 19 because the employer found out he was a wheelchair user. “That happens every day still to so many people with disability and that sucks,” he said. Herszberg says for many young people with disability, a job at All Things Equal is the first time they have had paid work. All staff are paid the hospitality award rate – a marked contrast with other employers, including some Australian Disability Enterprises, which provide supported work to people with moderate to severe disabilities. The disability royal commission last year heard some people with disability were paid as little as $2.27 an hour at ADEs, compared with the national minimum wage of $20.33. The Disability Employment Service (DES), a $1bn-a-year government scheme that pays companies and non-profits to get people with disability into work, is also under review, having been described as ineffective. All Things Equal is not affiliated with either scheme. Its staff are required to follow a recruitment process that includes writing a CV and sitting an interview.
Throughout the process, the cafe makes an effort to understand potential employees’ capabilities and their support requirements. This can entail providing a more accessible uniform, the implementation of visual resources, adapting shift and break times or splitting a staff member’s time between serving customers and kitchen work. It also offers in-house cooking lessons to people with a disability, and runs an ice-cream truck, a small cafe in an aged care facility in neighbouring Windsor, and a Sunday canteen at a junior football club in South Caulfield. It hopes to launch catering and events packages, as well as a social night. “Work is so important but one of the things we keep hearing is people with a disability really want a safe, inclusive space to socialise too,” Herzberg says.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/every-day-is-like-a-party-the-melbourne-cafe-where-people-with-a-disability-set-the-tone;guardian;entertainment & culture;4925
3203;3203;The Traitors US review – pure, evil, shout-at-the-TV brilliance;2023-01-16T11:29:56Z;['Alim Kheraj'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];;"There’s nothing like a bit of backstabbing to liven up the doldrums of January. Clearly, someone at the BBC agrees, as arriving on iPlayer in its entirety is the US version of 2022’s best reality show, The Traitors. A word-of-mouth hit, this bum-clenchingly tense gameshow revitalised the watercooler moment, set group chats alight and garnered huge iPlayer numbers. For those who missed it, the gameplay went something like this: 22 contestants headed to a castle in the Highlands where, joined by the host, Claudia Winkleman, they competed to win a cash prize. Sowing seeds of discontent were the traitors, three members of the group who were chosen to “murder” their fellow contestants and thereby reduce the player pool. The rest of the players – the faithful – were tasked with unhooding the traitors at nightly roundtable discussions, where accusations and paranoia rose to the surface. During the day, meanwhile, they worked as a team to win money. If the faithful successfully eliminated all the traitors before the final, they got to share the prize pot. If a traitor remained, they won everything. While a second series has yet to be officially commissioned, the US version of the show, which is based on the Dutch series De Verraders, has already been filmed. Replacing Winkleman is the debonair actor Alan Cumming, who switches the former’s collection of knitwear for a patchwork of tartan suits and a wild mid-Atlantic Scottish accent. Unlike in the British version, the contestants are a mix of normal people and former reality TV stars, from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Below Deck, The Batchelor, Survivor and US Big Brother plus, for some reason, the Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte.
Anyone who delighted in the camaraderie between contestants on the British show might find the dynamic between almost-famous faces and normies difficult to begin with. This is a group of people who, from the off, are at odds with each other, and they remain so until the last few episodes. Part of this, perhaps, is down to the inclusion of so many big personalities. The former Real Housewife Brandi Glanville and Below Deck’s Kate Chastain are the most divisive characters by far, bringing a wicked but entertaining quality to the round tables and hushed gossip sessions. Kate’s feud with Rachel Reilly, a contestant from US Big Brother, becomes particularly barbed, albeit with some fabulous one-liners from Kate, who at one point says Rachel’s outfits look like community theatre costumes. This hostility runs over into the round tables, where allegations of deceitful gameplay morph into personal attacks. “If I’m incorrect,” Kate says after voting for Rachel, “I’m OK with it, because I find you really offensive.” The slanging matches aren’t solely between these two, though: one early suspect for traitor, a 35-year-old office manager called Michael, is pummelled from every angle, his personality dissected and criticised over numerous round tables. You would feel sorry for him if he hadn’t spent one of the challenges whispering ultimatums to the other contestants to convince them to banish a 29-year-old actor, Geraldine, who, much to Michael’s chagrin, turns out to be a faithful. There is far more scheming and duplicity among these contestants. While UK players often resorted to groupthink during round tables, here you see faithful and traitors manipulating weaker players throughout the day, setting them on anyone perceived as suspicious. The traitors are far more distrusting of one another, which results in some jaw-dropping plot twists.
Overall, it’s a far more vicious approach, which only highlights how dynamic and unpredictable the format is. No two people will play the same way, even when they are meant to be working in tandem. The misstep here is the decision to drop all episodes at once: The Traitors feels best enjoyed through the communality of linear broadcasting. Still, by the time you reach episode eight (which could already scoop the award for the year’s best hour of reality TV), the tension is so unbearable that you will be glad the last two episodes are there for binging. Just be prepared for the stress-inducing final episode, which is pure shout-at-the-TV brilliance. As one contestant says in episode nine: “Everybody’s all in love now, but there will be blood later.” They are not wrong.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-traitors-us-review-pure-evil-shout-at-the-tv-brilliance;guardian;entertainment & culture;3203
5747;5747;When is a Vermeer not a Vermeer? Reputations on the line over authenticity of artwork;2023-01-02T05:00:06Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['Johannes Vermeer', 'Art and design', 'Netherlands', 'US news', 'Culture', 'World news'];;Johannes Vermeer of Delft left behind fewer than 50 paintings when he died aged 43 in 1675. Those that survived have beguiled art lovers for more than a century: intimate domestic scenes, such as a girl reading a letter at an open window, or a maidservant absorbed in pouring milk, bathed in soft, gentle light. As Vermeer’s output was so small, it is an event when a painting is declared to be by his hand. But there are few precedents for a recent tussle over the artist. One painting has been declared definitively “a Vermeer” by one museum, while another has downgraded it. In October, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC announced the results of painstaking research into a work in its collection, long credited to Vermeer. Girl with a Flute was not by Vermeer, but an associate, it said. Less than a month later the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which is borrowing that painting for a major new Vermeer exhibition in 2023, reached the opposite conclusion about the same work. It was “crystal clear”, the Rijksmuseum said, Girl with a Flute was a Vermeer. Painted on a small wooden panel, Girl with a Flute shows a woman wearing a boat-shaped hat and fur-trimmed jacket seated by a patterned tapestry, holding an instrument. While it has similarities to another work attributed to Vermeer, experts have long had doubts. “I never considered it as satisfying as other paintings by Vermeer,” Marjorie E Wieseman, the head of the department of northern European paintings at Washington’s National Gallery, told the Guardian. “What makes a Vermeer a Vermeer is his really uncanny ability to engage the viewer, to evoke a mood, a sensation, a presence that somehow transcends time,” she said. The women in his paintings, she said, have “a deliberate reserve … rather than extending something out to you, the viewer, they’re pulling you in.” Girl with a Flute, quite simply, does not, according to the Washington team. But it was only when Covid lockdowns forced the museum’s closure that the team had an opportunity to put their Vermeer collection under the microscope, using pioneering imaging technologies also used to map minerals on the moon and Mars. Close examination revealed awkward brushwork. The paint had been handled in a heavy-handed way that “pooled and almost dripped”, the team wrote in the Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art. Pigments used in the final paint were coarsely ground, rather than the fine top layers favoured by Vermeer. There were also broken bristles lodged in the paint, suggesting the artist used unusual force, or an old or poorly made brush. Even the composition was blocky and awkward, they wrote. “Rather than venturing an oblique glance from over her shoulder, the woman looks at us straight on … with little attempt at intrigue or beguilement.” The team concluded the work was done by someone with intimate knowledge of Vermeer’s idiosyncratic style, who had observed his technique, but not mastered it. Their findings upended the conventional view of Vermeer as a lone genius, by suggesting he had a studio. Announcing that a Vermeer – held in the museum’s collection since 1942 – is no longer a Vermeer is a big step. Like Rembrandt or Van Gogh, Vermeer belongs to a category of “one-name artists that are the iconic touchstones of western European paintings”, Wieseman said. “There’s a lot at stake,” she said. “Whereas you know, when it comes to, [did] Pieter de Putter paint this still life of fish, or was it someone else? Nobody really much cares.” Determining who painted a work of art is routine work for any art historian, dealer or auction house, but the stakes are much higher when it comes to the greatest artists, said Eric Jan Sluijter, professor of art history emeritus at the University of Amsterdam. “There is so much invested in these paintings, literally, but also in reputations of art historians or museums.” Girl with a Flute will feature in the largest-ever exhibition of Vermeer’s work, opening on 10 February at the Rijksmuseum. The museum hopes to display at least 28 works, including loans such as Girl with a Pearl Earring and A Young Woman Seated at a Virginal. Before the exhibition, the museum has upgraded three disputed paintings, including Girl with a Flute, as works by Vermeer, increasing the tally of surviving works by the artist to 37. “Girl with a Flute is lent as ‘not Vermeer’, but we will hang it as a real Vermeer,” Pieter Roelofs, the co-curator of the upcoming exhibition told the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool. “The doubt disappears somewhere during the flight over the ocean.” Contacted by the Guardian, the Rijksmuseum said no one was available for an interview. Some think the Rijksmuseum has not done enough to show its workings on Girl with a Flute. “We don’t know their arguments yet,” Sluijter said. He disagreed with the museum’s “very strong position” and claims of certainty in attributing the painting to Vermeer, saying it had not presented detailed findings to scholars. “There are always uncertainties and you have to live with that as an art historian.” Sluijter said the Washington research was “hard to dismiss”, although he did not think they were indisputably right on all details. The National Gallery in Washington has attributed another work, Girl with the Red Hat, to Vermeer. Also painted on wood, it is a similar composition to Girl with a Flute and Sluijter considered it had similar deviations from Vermeer’s technique. If Girl with a Flute is not by Vermeer, another question remains open: the identity of the artist in his studio. The National Gallery in Washington has suggested several candidates. Perhaps the painter was an apprentice, or a wealthy amateur taking lessons who helped a hard-up Vermeer pay his bills. The Washington team is less convinced by the thesis that the artist was Vermeer’s eldest child, Maria. “We simply cannot know who did paint the work, or under what circumstances,” they concluded. Sluijter thought it was plausible that Vermeer’s daughter was responsible for Girl with a Flute. “It’s not that eccentric, it is a possibility. We know of other daughters working in their father’s studio in the 17th century,” he said. “Often they married and then stopped painting, so they didn’t go on to become independent artists.” With scant documents in the archives, the identity of the possible artist in Vermeer’s studio remains a mystery to unravel.;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/02/vermeer-row-authenticity-girl-with-a-flute-painting;guardian;entertainment & culture;5747
2441;2441;Keir Starmer suggests Met explore changing name in ‘root and branch’ review;2023-01-19T19:05:31Z;['Aletha Adu'];['Metropolitan police', 'Keir Starmer', 'London', 'Police', 'UK news', 'Labour'];;"Keir Starmer has indicated the Metropolitan police might need to change its name as part of a much-needed “root and branch” review in the wake of the David Carrick case. The Labour leader likened the scale of change needed within the force to the policing reforms in Northern Ireland which took place after the Good Friday agreement. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was eventually replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
Starmer said the crimes committed by the serial rapist Carrick, a Met firearms officer, were “jaw-droppingly shocking”, but highlighted that there had been a number of scandals within the force prior to this. He told the News Agents podcast: “It needs a root and branch review, cultural change, because this is not just the perpetrators, it’s those that have allowed this to happen … not taken action when they should have done. “With the police service in Northern Ireland … that was root and branch, that was stripping it down. “It was also very important that it was called the Police Service of Northern Ireland because it changed the way in which the force was looking, it was a service to the public, not a police force.” Pressed on whether the Met should change its name, Starmer added: “If changing the name signals a change, then perhaps, but it was very important to what we were trying to achieve in Northern Ireland that it was the Police Service of Northern Ireland.” The Carrick case followed a series of damaging scandals for the Met, including the murder of Sarah Everard by then serving officer Wayne Couzens, offensive messages exchanged officers mainly based at Charing Cross police station and the strip-search of a teenage girl at school while she was on her period. When asked if he would encourage his daughter to get advice from a serving Met police officer if she was lost, late at night, he said “yes”, before adding: “I think it’s really important that we say that. I understand the concerns that many people might have about that. But yes, I would. But, do we need to strip it down? And look again? Yes.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/19/keir-starmer-suggests-met-explore-changing-name-in-root-and-branch-review;guardian;politics;2441
7922;7922;Ukraine war: Russian mercenary Wagner Group suffers heavy losses as their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, steps firmly into the spotlight;Friday 20 January 2023 20:48, UK;['diana magnay', '@dimagnaysky'];['russia', 'ukraine'];['men', 'steps', 'mercenary', 'kremlin', 'prigozhin', 'russia', 'yevgeny', 'ukraine', 'suffers', 'sledgehammer', 'wagner', 'russias', 'spotlight', 'fighters', 'russian', 'war', 'group'];"The graves are all fresh. Row after row of them, almost identical. The same mound of sandy soil, the same black, red and yellow wreath mounted with a golden star.

The same wooden, orthodox cross to mark the grave, though there are some Muslim headstones too. Just the names and the dates on a small bronze plaque to distinguish the lives extinguished. None of them lived to a ripe old age.

This is a cemetery for Wagner mercenaries near Krasnodar in southern Russia. Krasnodar region is the Wagner Group's heartland. Their training ground is nearby in a village called Molkino.

There is a newly built chapel not far away which houses the urns of cremated fighters. And there is space available for still more graves in this cemetery, when the next wave of bodies come home.

Wagner is heavily involved in Russia's offensive around Bakhmut and Soledar in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Its fighters have died, Ukraine says, in their thousands.

Most likely the bulk of those were convicts, sent in to die like cannon fodder and be buried in a Wagner cemetery far from home. Perhaps after time in Russia's penal colonies they no longer had homes to speak of.

""The area near Soledar is covered with corpses of the invaders… This is what madness looks like,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said in one of his nightly addresses.

Image: The rows of graves of Wagner fighters are almost identical

Russia claims to be in control of Soledar, a victory that Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declares as his own.

In the past few days he has also claimed to be behind the capture of the village of Klishchiivka about nine kilometres south of Bakhmut, though that has yet to be confirmed from the Ukrainian side. The Russian defence ministry has been less gracious about Wagner's role but it has conceded that they played a role in capturing Soledar.

There are rumours, dismissed by the Kremlin as media speculation, that army boss Valery Gerasimov was brought in to replace Sergey Surovikin as head of Ukraine operations partly to keep Prigozhin in line.

Putting the top military commander in charge of Russia's ""special military operation"" could be interpreted as a way of reinforcing army hierarchy and reminding Prigozhin and his band of mercenaries who is ultimately in charge.

Prigozhin, who only a few months ago refused to confirm the well-known secret that he ran the Wagner Group and sued anyone who suggested otherwise, has come out in public all guns blazing. There is no longer a need for the ""regime of silence"", he said.

There are videos of him now in the salt mines around Bakhmut, where US officials believe he has an eye on the mineral spoils.

There are videos of him handing out medals to his fighters. There are videos of him surveying piles of body bags behind the frontlines and attending funerals back home. He has not shied away from his losses, demanding the same burial rights for his men as for regular army soldiers.

He has shown himself willing to be a presence at the frontlines, quite the battleground commander, which is more than can be said for the ultimate commander-in-chief who, unlike Ukraine's president, has paid no visits to the front.

Prigozhin's PR team provide quick responses, purportedly from the man himself, to media questions. In a recent salvo, he takes aim at Kremlin bureaucrats who he says are longing for Russia to lose the war and for the US to start calling the shots in Russia. But the US ""won't take you in"", he writes to these supposed Kremlin traitors. ""And then you will come to us, where the Wagner sledgehammer will be waiting for you.""

Image: It is getting harder for the Wagner Group to recruit fighters after heavy losses

The sledgehammer is no idle threat. In November, video appeared purporting to show a Wagner mercenary bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer for defecting to Ukraine. When asked to comment, Prigozhin replied, ""a dog receives a dog's death"".

Later that month, a bloodied sledgehammer in a violin case was presented to the European Parliament as they debated declaring Russia a terrorist state, a sinister message from the group also known in Russia as ""The musicians"".

But losing that many men creates problems and the recruitment drive in Russia's prisons is reportedly drying up.

Paul Whelan, a US citizen (who also holds British citizenship) and was jailed in 2018 on espionage charges, told his brother David that Wagner recruiters had little luck the last time they came round his prison colony. ""Everyone else has a clear picture of what happens to prisoners who go to fight the Kremlin's war in Ukraine"", David Whelan wrote in his regular email updates. This time round, they reportedly managed to sign up just eight men, compared with 115 on the previous occasion.

Prigozhin is a powerful man. He is unashamedly critical of both Russia's senior military command and of the Kremlin elites though he does not say a bad word about Vladimir Putin.

Wagner has played a key role for years already as an unofficial arm of Russian foreign policy in Syria, Libya and other African countries.

Now in Ukraine, the group is out in the open. But Ukraine is a far bloodier battlefield and the fight more existential, both for the Wagner Group and for Putin's Russia, which has enabled men like Prigozhin, with his brutal, sledgehammer tradecraft, to flourish.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121110212/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-russian-mercenary-wagner-group-suffers-heavy-losses-as-their-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-steps-firmly-into-the-spotlight-12790830;skynews;politics;2013
2573;2573;The 99% sober movement: should we keep dry January going all year?;2023-01-19T10:00:05Z;['Emine Saner'];['Alcohol', 'Health', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Life and style', 'Canada', 'Cancer', 'Heart disease'];;"If you are halfway through dry January, and counting the days until you can drink again, the latest news from Canada might make you rethink. Its new alcohol guidelines suggest people drink no more than two alcoholic drinks a week. Two small glasses of wine or a pint and a half of beer a week is what is considered by Canadian health experts as low-risk – a sharp drop from the previous guidelines of no more than 10 drinks a week for women and 15 for men – while no alcohol at all is the only safe limit. In the UK, our limits are more generous, though the direction they are going in is towards Canada’s. When they were last updated in 2016, the upper limit for both men and women was set at 14 units: the equivalent of seven pints of lower-strength beer or nine small (125ml) glasses of wine. Previously, men had been advised to stay below 21 units a week. The UK’s chief medical officers also made it clear that “there is no level of regular drinking that can be considered as completely safe”. Should we, then, be following Canada’s lead and cutting the upper limit drastically? A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care says there are “no current plans to update the alcohol limit guidelines”. However, Richard Piper, the chief executive of Alcohol Change, a charity that campaigns to reduce alcohol harm, says: “There are some elements of the Canadian guidelines we should definitely copy. The first is the clear statement that the less you drink the better, from a health point of view. The second thing that I think is incredibly helpful is they’ve presented a scale.” It shows, he says, “increasing risk as you drink more, in a stepped approach”. In the UK, with the focus on 14 units, there can be a tendency to think “over 14, bad; under 14, good”, he continues. “But actually under 14 can be bad if all those units are on one night. I understand the chief medical officers in the UK are trying to present something really simple, but I think that simplicity is too crude. I think the Canadian guidelines are simple, but more helpful.” They allow people to decide, says Piper. “To say, ‘I really enjoy alcohol, I’m going to embrace moderate risk.’ They tell you what the risk levels are at different levels, and leave it to you to make that choice.” It’s the reason he would like to see better and clearer alcohol labelling – not necessarily the scary images that cigarette manufacturers were forced to adopt, but a health warning and a clear indication of the number of units. “I think guidelines and labels are part of the same story,” says Piper.
With alcohol such a central part of British culture, could we ever get to the point where two drinks a week is considered normal? It is already, among large parts of the population, Piper points out. “Twenty percent of the population don’t drink at all; 60% drink under 14 units a week and often way under. So you probably find that the majority of the population is drinking close to two drinks a week, or less. If you go into most British homes, most adults won’t be having a drink most evenings.” At least 130,000 people take part in dry January every year, and younger people are drinking less. There have been low-drinking trends, such as “mindful drinking”, the “sober curious” movement and people going “99% sober” – those who rarely drink, but make occasional exceptions. It can make sense for people who don’t want to put pressure on themselves to give up completely. So there might not be quite the uproar politicians fear if our upper limits were drastically cut. Anyway, says Piper, “This is where they should be delegating this to the chief medical officer, exactly like they did in the pandemic: let science lead the way.” It is “absolutely reasonable” to conclude, says Gautam Mehta, an associate professor in hepatology at University College London, “the safest amounts of alcohol to drink is zero. There’s no absolute safe level of consumption – the data is good on that. There’s a very small benefit in ischemic heart disease, with a very small volume of alcohol, but that’s completely offset by cancer and other risks.” The problem is, how well is this known by the public? “Probably not very widely,” says Mehta. “Guidelines definitely have an impact. I don’t think we should shy away from the fact that there is no safe limit – that message does need to get out there. We have an issue with alcohol in this country. After the pandemic, the number of alcohol-related deaths in the UK has gone up by 20%.” Is the upper limit of 14 units too high? “My view is that education, rather than top-down guidance, is the best way to keep people engaged,” says Mehta. We know, in ways we didn’t even 10 or 20 years ago, how harmful alcohol can be. “Alcohol increases blood pressure, [which can lead] to stroke and heart disease,” says Mehta. Alcohol is linked to cancer, especially “to digestive tract cancers; breast cancers are a significant [alcohol-related] harm. Overall, there are more than 200 diseases that alcohol is associated with, but those are the top ones: cancer, heart disease, stroke. Liver disease occurs at higher levels, so if you were drinking within the current guidance, liver disease wouldn’t be a major concern if you had no other risk factors.”
Binge drinking is worse for you than spreading the units over the week (those “99% sober” drinkers should be wary of this if they intend to consume large quantities, even occasionally). “Pattern of drinking does matter,” says Mehta. “It has an impact on the gut. We think the gut is very important in many chronic diseases and underlies inflammation. You induce what we call ‘gut leakiness’, which essentially means there’s more inflammation from proteins that should stay within the gut, but don’t. When you get beyond the threshold, on a relatively regular basis, we think you’ll have long-term consequences.” The definition of a “binge” is probably lower than you think. “It’s about six units for women – that’s only two large glasses of wine – and eight units for men.” Mehta was involved in a study comparing drinkers doing dry January, who had previously been drinking about 20 units a week, with a control group who didn’t give it up. “The changes were quite marked,” he says, describing how people’s blood pressure reduced by approximately the same amount as you would expect had they taken blood pressure medication. Their risk of diabetes went down by about a quarter, and they lost weight. “We also saw changes in growth factors that are connected with cancer. You can’t reduce your cancer risk hugely in a month, but the proteins that are linked to cancer fell by about 70%, a huge reduction. That was the most numerically striking finding.” There were many potential benefits, and although Mehta acknowledges it was a short-term study (and small in terms of participants), “you’d expect, if you carried that on, that that would translate to real health benefits”. It’s a wonder that anyone drinks anything at all. But many of us do, including Mehta (and me). “I still have a drink,” he says. “It’s about knowing those risks.” If you drink alcohol, and enjoy it – perhaps while socialising with friends, which comes with its own significant health benefits – it’s something to think about over your weekly pint-and-a-half.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/the-99-sober-movement-should-we-keep-dry-january-going-all-year;guardian;entertainment & culture;2573
1258;1258;Suspicious death of ‘Pin’ the vulture adds to Dallas zoo’s mysterious woes ;2023-01-25T18:31:38Z;['Erum Salam'];['Dallas', 'US news', 'Birds', 'Animals'];;A lappet-faced vulture at the Dallas zoo has died from a suspicious wound in its Wilds of Africa habitat. Officials called the mysterious death of 35-year-old Pin “devastating” and are offering a $10,000 reward for any information. The announcement follows a bout of unusual activity at the zoo. Last week it shut down after it reported one of its two clouded leopards, Nova, was missing. A zoo spokesperson assured the public the 25lb cat didn’t pose a threat to humans and Nova was found later that day on zoo grounds near her habitat. The zoo announced additional cameras and increased overnight security patrols were added throughout the zoo. “We will continue to implement and expand our safety and security measures to whatever level necessary to keep our animals and staff safe,” it said in a statement. Dallas Police’s Animal Cruelty Department has asked anyone with information to contact their unit. According to the US department of agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, vultures are migratory birds that are federally protected. They are scavengers, with a diet that primarily consists of the decaying flesh of dead animals like poultry and small mammals. The Dallas Zoo’s website says “globally, vultures are the most endangered group of birds” and “16 of the 23 vulture species in the world are considered threatened, endangered, or critically endangered.” Unlike Pin, Nova the leopard was found safe and sound. “The vet & animal care teams say she shows no signs of injury and has settled right back into her routine,” the zoo said. A hole was found in its enclosure and zoo officials believe the leopard used it to escape. The next day, a similar hole was found in the enclosure of the langur monkeys, but all primates are accounted for.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/dallas-zoo-pin-vulture-dies-suspicious-wound;guardian;environment;1258

The new weapons are being developed for deployment on the Belgorod nuclear submarine and have been described by both the US and Russia as a ""new category"" of retaliatory weapon.

They are supposedly capable of triggering radioactive ocean waves that would render coastal cities uninhabitable.

""The first set of Poseidons have been manufactured, and the Belgorod submarine will receive them in the near future,"" Russian state news agency TASS quoted an unnamed defence source as saying.

TASS said the main components of Poseidon, including a nuclear reactor to give the torpedo its own power source, had been successfully completed.

The crew of the Belgorod nuclear submarine has also completed tests with models of the torpedo, TASS said.

Putin first announced what would become known as Poseidon in 2018, saying it was a fundamentally new type of strategic nuclear weapon, confirming it would have its own nuclear power supply.

There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon publicly available, but what is known is that it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230116161328/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-ex-wagner-group-member-prepared-to-divulge-everything-after-seeking-asylum-in-norway-12541713;skynews;politics;1493
2532;2532;A tale of two captains: Donald and Stenson make strong Abu Dhabi starts;2023-01-19T12:55:43Z;['Ewan Murray'];['Golf', 'Ryder Cup', 'Luke Donald', 'Henrik Stenson', 'European Tour', 'Sport', 'LIV Golf Series'];;"In the space of 12 fraught months Henrik Stenson has gone from Ryder Cup captain elect to accepting the role, effectively being dismissed and finding himself in legal dispute with the very group he was briefly representing. Stenson’s scenario rather sums up golf’s madcap times. Nothing outside the ropes is straightforward any more. As Luke Donald, who will lead Europe against the United States in Rome in September, surged to the top of the Abu Dhabi Championship leaderboard on Thursday it felt poetic that Stenson came hot on his heels.
“Stranger things have happened,” said Stenson when the prospect of turning up at the Ryder Cup as a player was put to him. But if a case between Stenson, his fellow LIV rebels and the European Tour Group in early February goes the circuit’s way, back-to-back events in the Middle East could deliver the last sightings of certain players on their home Tour. Stenson posted a 68 on his first DP World Tour start since last year’s Scottish Open. “I made my decision and Ryder Cup Europe made theirs,” said the Swede. “It’s not great, but it is what it is. “The Ryder Cup has been a huge part of my career. I wish Luke all the best with the team going forward and we’ll see where we all end up in the long run with this. There’s a lot of people that I have spent many years with and they continue to be my friends no matter where I play my golf.” There are, however, those who believe players who succumbed to LIV’s riches should stay well clear of this tour. Stenson said “absolutely, no question” when asked whether he felt welcome at Yas Links. “The way I look at it, when all of us went to play on the PGA Tour back in the day, we shouldn’t have been welcomed back either then. “There’s multiple tours in the world and as far as I’m concerned, as long as you fulfil your criteria and earn your right to be there, you should be able to play in as many tournaments as you like. But I haven’t had one player step up to me and vent those thoughts.” It has been easy to forget Donald was a longtime world No 1, after a decline that has left him sliding to 541st in the rankings. He has featured in two majors since the start of 2017. Elevation to Ryder Cup captaincy has perhaps given Donald new focus. His first-round 64 here inevitably triggered questions over whether he could qualify for his own side. “I’m just making myself the aim for the guys that are trying to make the team,” he said with a smile. “If they can’t beat me, then what the hell are they doing? Hopefully I’m inspiring them. “It would be tough to be a playing captain. I’ve been a vice-captain twice. I’ve been around other captains. There’s a lot going on. It’s early days and a nice start to the week. But nothing more.” Two players with strong aspirations of joining Donald in Italy started promisingly. Guido Migliozzi eagled the 1st, his 10th, courtesy of an 88-yard hole out when en route to a 65. Séamus Power, the US-based Irishman, is a stroke adrift of Migliozzi and Jason Scrivener. Shane Lowry looked content with a 67 while Tommy Fleetwood celebrated his 32nd birthday by posting a 68.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/golf-luke-donald-henrik-stenson-ryder-cup-abu-dhabi-championship;guardian;sports;2532
2437;2437;Stockport hospital failed woman who took poisonous substance, inquest finds ;2023-01-19T19:49:21Z;['Tom Ambrose'];['Health', 'Hospitals', 'Mental health', 'Greater Manchester', 'UK news'];;A private psychiatric hospital provided “inadequate care” for a woman who killed herself by swallowing a poisonous substance, a jury has found. Beth Matthews, a mental health blogger, was being treated as an NHS patient for a personality disorder at the Priory hospital Cheadle Royal in Stockport. The 26-year-old, originally from Cornwall, opened the substance, which she had ordered online, in close proximity to two members of staff and told them it was protein powder, BBC News reported. An inquest jury concluded she died from suicide contributed to by neglect, after hearing Matthews was considered a high suicide risk. She had a history of frequent suicide attempts, the inquest heard. A BBC News investigation also found that two other young women died at the Priory in Stockport in the two months before her death. A spokesperson for the Priory Group said: “We fully accept the jury’s findings and acknowledge that far greater attention should have been given to Beth’s care plan. “At the time of Beth’s unexpected death, we took immediate steps to address the issues around how we document risk and communicate patients’ care plans, alongside our processes for receiving and opening post. “We want to extend our deepest condolences to Beth’s family and friends for their loss. Beth’s attempts to overcome her mental health challenges had been an inspiration for many. Although unexpected deaths are extremely rare, we recognise that every loss of life in our care is a tragedy.” Matthews had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act last March and was not supposed to be allowed to open her own mail, the inquest at Manchester South cornoner’s court was told. Jurors also heard how only weeks before her death she told a Priory employee that she could order something “to do the job”. The jury found “it was evident there were serious inconsistencies across all levels of her care plan” while she was a patient at the facility. The Priory Group admitted her plan had not been followed. Matthews was described in court as “vivacious” and “bright” and had tens of thousands of social media followers due to her blogging. The assistant coroner Andrew Bridgman offered his condolences to her family and, after the jurors’ verdict, concluded: “There are no words to express for the loss of your daughter. The loss of a child is something no person should have to suffer.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2190;2190;‘We’re not done’: abortion opponents hold first March for Life since fall of Roe ;2023-01-21T02:22:05Z;['Lauren Gambino'];['Abortion', 'US news', 'Roe v Wade', 'Republicans', 'US politics'];;"Thousands of abortion opponents descended on Washington DC for the annual March for Life on Friday, the first time since achieving its foundational objective: persuading the supreme court to overturn Roe v Wade. Every year since the landmark 1973 decision, anti-abortion activists have come to the nation’s capital to march, plead and pray for a post-Roe America where abortion wasn’t just banned but was “unthinkable”. A half-century later, they gathered again on the National Mall in Washington, this time to celebrate movement’s greatest victory. But they also came with a new mission to fighting the battles now playing out in their states.
“While the march began as a response to Roe, we don’t end as a response to Roe being overturned,” Jeanne Mancini, the president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, told a jubilant crowd. “Why? Because we’re not yet done.” Since Roe fell, movement leaders have urged Republicans to use their new House majority to pass federal restrictions on abortion, while they press for new bans and restraints at the state level. On Friday, they warned activists against complacency, with one speaker acknowledging that the decision had ushered in “challenging times of unrest and new threats to human life” as a reinvigorated reproductive rights movement pushes back. “This is not the end of our journey,” the Mississippi attorney general, Lynn Fitch, whose office brought the supreme court case – Dobbs v Mississippi – that overturned Roe, said from the stage before the march. “It is our charge today, in this new Dobbs era, to channel that same determination and hope and prayer that has led you to these streets for 50 years.” From the White House, Joe Biden marked the occasion with a vow to protect abortion access and a proclamation recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision, which falls on Sunday 22 January. “Never before has the court taken away a right so fundamental to Americans,” Biden said in the statement. “In doing so, it put the health and lives of women across this nation at risk.” He called on Congress to codify abortion rights and pledged to continue to use his limited executive authority to protect access wherever possible. In the seven months since the supreme court ended the federal protections guaranteed by Roe, abortion access in America has become a patchwork of state-by-state policies. More than a dozen states have enacted sweeping bans on abortion, while several more aim to take similar actions when state legislatures reconvene this year. Pending legal challenges have added to the uncertainty. Their efforts to advance new measures at the state level have been met with fierce opposition from abortion rights advocates. Initiatives have sprung up to help women seeking abortions travel to states where it remains legal or to access abortion pills. At the ballot box, abortion opponents have suffered a string of significant and unexpected defeats, including in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky, while several Republican candidates who supported abortion bans without exceptions lost high-profile races in the 2022 midterm elections. But at Friday’s march, the mood was undeniably joyful. Busloads of high school students, a hallmark of the event, carried signs proclaiming: “I am the post-Roe generation.” They marched alongside seasoned activists exulting in a victory that had once seemed unimaginable. “We did it,” the Rev Lalita Smith said, recounting her “exuberance” when the Dobbs decision was handed down. “But in doing so, we brought more battles to the forefront because now every state has a right to decide what their position is going to be.” Activists from states where abortion remains legal said they were working toward a more complicated goal that required changing not only the laws, but hearts and minds, too. “If anything, the pro-life movement is more important than ever before because now it’s up to the states,” said Katie, a 19-year-old college student from Massachusetts who preferred not to give her last name. The theme of this year’s gathering was “Next Steps: Marching Forward into a Post-Roe America”, a recognition that the fight to end abortion in America has moved to Congress and all 50 state legislatures. To further underscore the shift, the march charted a slightly different course. Instead of finishing at the foot of the supreme court, they concluded at a spot located between the court building and the US Capitol.
At the rally, the speakers presented a united front, committed to the march’s overarching vision to end abortion. But the post-Roe landscape has exposed fault lines in the anti-abortion movement as Republicans, elected officials and activists press ahead with varying demands, tactics and approaches. “What is the most ambitious we can be?” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America (SBA), a leading anti-abortion group, told reporters this week. Dannenfelser said she would like to see Congress enact a “federal minimum standard” that would ban abortions after a certain point early in a pregnancy, though she was clear-eyed that the prospects of such action were dim as long as Democrats held the Senate and the White House. The House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, welcomed the marchers to Washington, pledging: “You now have a Congress that is standing up for life.” Addressing the crowd, Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, touted a pair of anti-abortion measures that passed the chamber earlier this month, among the first actions taken by the new Republican majority. “That’s what difference elections make,” he declared. Speaking next, the Republican congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, co-chair of the congressional pro-life caucus, said the House would soon take up a third measure that would block federal funding for abortion, known as the Hyde Amendment. The gathering also drew opposition. On Thursday, the abortion rights group Catholics for Choice unfurled large banners from the rooftop of a Planned Parenthood in Washington, as anti-abortion activists demonstrated below. One read: “Most people of faith support legal abortion”. On Friday, abortion rights activists disrupted a prayer service organized by the March for Life. “These extremists lied, cheated and stole seats on the supreme court in order to overturn Roe,” Mini Timmaraju, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a statement. “It’s never been clearer that they are the minority: that’s why they had to cheat to win, and that’s why they were defeated handily in the midterm elections.”
Public opinion polls since the Dobbs ruling in June have repeatedly found that a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion. A Pew poll conducted in July found that nearly six in 10 Americans disagreed with the supreme court’s decision eliminating a constitutional right to abortion, while just four in 10 approved of it. Public support for abortion has largely remained unchanged, even as the partisan divide on the issue has deepened. On Sunday reproductive rights activists will commemorate what has now become a bitter milestone, the 50th anniversary of the Roe decision, with rallies in state capitals around the country. The events are being held under the banner: “Bigger than Roe” and organizers say they hope to build on their successes in the 2022 midterms. Vice-President Kamala Harris will mark the anniversary on Sunday with a speech in Florida, where she will rally reproductive rights supporters to fight state-level efforts to ban abortion while calling on Congress to enact federal protections. In Florida, Democrats are bracing for new attempts to restrict abortion after Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, signed into law a bill banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Dannenfelser, the SBA president, said Florida was a model for what is possible across the country as a new generation of emboldened abortion opponents take charge. “This year, we march with fresh resolve as a brand-new pro-life movement,” she said, adding: “We’re more expectant than ever that we will make new gains for women and children.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/march-for-life-anti-abortion-roe-v-wade-fall;guardian;politics;2190

5273;5273;Fay Weldon: the fearless glass ceiling cracker who loved being outrageous;2023-01-04T18:21:56Z;['Jenny Colgan'];['Books', 'Culture', 'Fay Weldon', 'UK news', 'Publishing', 'World news', 'Fiction'];;"I have worked with a lot of writers on the festival circuit, most of them delightful – but I have never seen such an adoring literary audience as I did when I was on stage with Fay Weldon. These were second-generation feminists, working mothers, divorcees, and they absolutely loved her for pouring her rage and impish sense of fun into her books – not just The Life and Loves of a She Devil but The Hearts and Lives of Men, Down Among the Women and more. She was prolific, which she always complained meant nobody took her seriously (although Praxis was shortlisted for the Booker prize). Fay loved appearing before crowds, she loved being outrageous and cheeky and – let us not be euphemistic about this - she quite often spoke a load of absolute rubbish designed to get her into the papers. She was completely open that this was entirely a strategic move. When I had had two books published she leaned towards me and said: “Now, look. Anyone can START a literary career. Getting it to carry on is the tricky bit!”, which was some of the most useful advice I’ve ever heard. Her own method was to say something utterly controversial and newsworthy whenever she had a book out, which generally worked like a charm. I was once approached by a chocolate company to mention their chocolate bar in one of my novels after Fay had agreed to a product placement deal with a jewellery company for her book The Bulgari Connection. I asked her if I should do it. She thought this was an absolutely hilarious and incomprehensible question. Of course I should!
Her pronouncements could overshadow her achievements. She was one of the early glass ceiling crackers; a legend in the 1960s advertising world, even if the slogan “Go to work on an egg”, famously attributed to her, was rather a joint effort. “Vodka gets you drunker quicker” was hers though, even though they weren’t allowed to use it. She was not, as she would put it, “the only true feminist” there was – but she was there. When teaching, if she felt she couldn’t help a student with their work she would occasionally give them a recipe, so that at least they’d have learned how to make a creme brulee. The Life and Loves of a She Devil was huge; both the book and the extraordinary television series with Patricia Hodge, Julie T Wallace and Dennis Waterman as the prize they’re fighting over. For many of my generation it was by far the rudest thing they’d seen their mothers watch on television. But every one of our mothers did; it was a cultural phenomenon. Fay was noisy in an era when women were expected to be quiet. She used her voice and took up space; she said what she felt, she brought energy and fun. And she was, as her book festival audiences could doubtless confirm, that very best and most attractive type of person: someone who is utterly, fearlessly and for ever true to themselves, to hell with the consequences. We will miss her. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023.

5023;5023;Legacy of Japan’s Nakagin Capsule Tower lives on in restored pods;2023-01-06T04:00:39Z;['Justin McCurry'];['Japan', 'Architecture', 'Art and design', 'Asia Pacific', 'Culture', 'World news'];;"Tatsuyuki Maeda had more reason than most to feel a pang of regret as he joined admirers and passing office workers to watch Nakagin Capsule Tower being dismantled. The building was not just one of Tokyo’s most famous structures; for more than a decade it had been Maeda’s occasional home – a pied-à-terre in the heart of the city he had coveted since he first set eyes on it from his nearby workplace. Its creator, the celebrated architect Kisho Kurokawa, had intended for the capsules to be removed and replaced every 25 years at the end of what he saw as their natural life cycle – an innovation rendered impracticable by a design fault that made it next to impossible to remove single pods. In 2021, as the building neared its half century, the ravages of time, coupled with disagreements among owners over its future, helped seal Nakagin’s fate. The capsules, originally painted white, had become discoloured, and netting had to be installed to keep dislodged rust fragments from falling on to the street. There was concern about the large quantities of asbestos inside the building, which no longer met Japan’s strict earthquake-resistance regulations. After the management company and capsule owners agreed to sell the plot, work began last April to remove the asbestos, rip out the pods’ interiors and demolish the building.
“I have an office nearby, so I went out and took some photos when they started taking it apart,” Maeda, who owned 15 of the pods, said. “We weren’t able to save all of the capsules, but we were determined to spare at least some of them.” The 55-year-old had already started making plans to secure the tower’s architectural legacy after conceding that the 13-storey building would not survive in its original form. He leased some of his pods and conducted guided tours to raise money. Built in 1972, Nakagin was an architectural curiosity tucked away in a corner of the city’s Ginza district – an asymmetric stack of 140 identical concrete boxes that became home to a community of artists and designers, and ordinary tenants who could not face long weekday commutes home to the suburbs. From the outside, the capsules resembled giant washing machines, complete with a single circular window and a blind that fanned out to shield their occupants from the glare of the city lights. Each 10-sq metre space came with a unit bathroom, a Sony Trinitron TV, a reel-to-reel tape player and a rotary dial phone. The tower was an early example of metabolism, an avant garde architectural movement formed in Japan in the late 1950s whose disciples viewed buildings as organisms that could be adapted or removed over time. For Kurokawa and his fellow metabolists, architecture needed to accommodate the radical changes Japan was undergoing during its postwar economic and cultural transformation.
Maeda and other members of the nonprofit Nakagin Capsule Tower preservation and regeneration project saved 23 capsules, which now sit in a warehouse in Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo. Fourteen are being restored to their original state, complete with the electric appliances and unit bath – although not all of the retro gadgets are in working order – while the remaining nine are being stripped down to their basic structure, giving prospective owners a blank canvas on which to design a new interior. Maeda expects some of the restored units to appear in hotel and company lobbies and museums, although talks with potential owners are still in the early stages. He has also received inquiries from Asia, Europe and the US, but would say only that an agreement had been reached with an entity in Germany. “And at some point next year it will be possible to see one of these pods in its original state somewhere in Japan,” he said, adding that restoration work is now in the final stages. Nakagin in its original form gained legions of admirers from around the world, featured in films and as a backdrop to fashion shoots, and became a must-see for tourists intrigued by a building whose appeal only increased as it grew more incongruous with its surroundings.

4335;4335;Scotland’s teacher strikes begin after last-ditch talks fail ;2023-01-10T11:33:31Z;['Libby Brooks'];['Scotland', 'Schools', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'Public sector pay', 'Industrial action', 'UK news', 'Public services policy', 'Society', 'Politics', 'Education', 'Trade unions'];;Almost every school in Scotland will be closed on Tuesday or Wednesday as part of a fresh wave of new year strikes over pay, despite warnings from the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, that her government has “no more money” to offer teachers, as well as nurses and midwives. Primary schools are closed all day on Tuesday, with secondary schools shutting on Wednesday, after members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT and the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) rejected a 5% pay increase, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid, arguing for 10%. Last-ditch talks between the Scottish government and teaching unions on Monday failed to avert this week’s strikes, though the EIS said it was still hoping for a resolution before further strikes planned for next week. The latest school closures come after the biggest Scottish teachers’ strike in decades last November. Speaking on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, Holyrood’s education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, described the unions’ pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. She added: “We’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” The EIS general secretary, Andrea Bradley, said of Monday’s talks that it was “disappointing, though not surprising, that no new offer was presented, despite some positive progress in discussions”. “The union side remains willing to talk, at any time, with a view to reaching a resolution to this dispute,” she added. Following a further meeting with the Holyrood health minister, Humza Yousaf, on Monday, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are expected to announce their first strikes in Scotland shortly in an ongoing dispute over a pay settlement imposed on NHS staff in December. On Monday, as Sturgeon unveiled a package of emergency measures to ease pressure on overwhelmed Scottish hospitals, she admitted she was pessimistic about the chances of averting strikes, stating her government had no more money to offer health unions. “We have no more money this year,” she said. “I think this will be a very, very hard thing to achieve but I am very, very clear about the priority I attach to avoiding industrial action.” She told reporters that Scottish NHS staff had been given 7.5% on average, compared with 4.5% in England and Wales, but indicated a fresh offer to improve terms and conditions could be made, with talks on next year’s pay due to start soon. The RCM said it was continuing discussions with the health minister and the other unions, and attending an emergency round table on pressures on NHS Scotland on Wednesday.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/scotland-teacher-strikes-begin-after-last-ditch-talks-fail;guardian;business & economy;4335
690;690;Jack Harrison sets Leeds on way to rare fifth-round place against Accrington ;2023-01-28T14:42:07Z;['Aaron Bower'];['FA Cup', 'Accrington Stanley', 'Leeds United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"When your FA Cup record in recent years includes defeats at Sutton United and Histon, days like these feel like a case of win at any cost. That is exactly what Leeds were able to do as they booked their place in the fifth round for the first time in seven years. It is only the third time they have gone this far in 20 years. They were given a real test in a thoroughly entertaining cup tie. Accrington Stanley more than played their part in an extremely watchable game but must now turn their attention back to avoiding relegation from League One. Leeds have their own survival battle to contend with in the months ahead but, with so many Premier League sides already out, they may start to fancy a rare cup run.
“I was pleased with the mentality because we knew it wouldn’t be easy,” said the Leeds manager, Jesse Marsch. “We knew there’d be a lot of hectic moments, but we handled it.” Their top-flight quality came to the fore at crucial moments as goals from Jack Harrison, Junior Firpo and Luis Sinisterra were more than enough to ensure safe passage. Marsch took no chances with his lineup despite almost 50 league places separating the sides, handing a debut to Leeds’s record signing, Georginio Rutter, who caught the eye. But it was Harrison who proved the catalyst for what turned out to be a comfortable victory on a day when transfer speculation continued to surround the 26-year-old, with reports Leeds have rejected a £20m bid from Leicester. The hug Marsch gave Harrison when he was substituted after a dominant display spoke volumes. “We like him here and we want to keep him,” Marsch said. “I’m happy he was so sharp on the day. When things start circulating it’s never easy to focus on your job, but I’ve tried to have open dialogue and be very honest with him. He does like it here, it’s not like he’s itching to leave.” It was a wonderful long-range strike from Harrison that broke the deadlock midway through the first half. Before that, Accrington had enjoyed their fair share of chances, with Illan Meslier required on several occasions to deny Sean McConville and Shaun Whalley. The hosts, cheered on by a boisterous capacity crowd, did not let Harrison’s 25-yard finish past Toby Savin deter their spirit. They began the second half well and boyhood Leeds fan Harvey Rodgers spurned two glorious opportunities to level the tie, first firing over from close range before shooting wide after Meslier dropped a cross. That proved costly as within five minutes, Leeds had doubled their lead when some expert hold-up play from Patrick Bamford, whose return to fitness continued, freed Firpo to score his first Leeds goal.
Two minutes later, Leeds put the tie beyond doubt. Harrison broke down the left before delivering a pinpoint cross for Sinisterra to make it three. Savin then denied Bamford and the substitute Rodrigo to prevent the visitors from racking up a scoreline that, given Accrington’s effort and endeavour, would have been harsh. Leeds were given a shock when the hosts claimed a deserved consolation with nine minutes remaining as substitute Leslie Adekoya converted, but Leeds rode out some late pressure to ensure they would be on the right side of an FA Cup headline for once.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/28/accrington-stanley-leeds-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report;guardian;sports;690
3821;3821;In the Footsteps of Killers review – Emilia Fox’s disrespectful crime show will make your soul recoil;2023-01-12T23:05:04Z;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Emilia Fox'];;When the gulf between subject matter and approach is as wide as it is with In the Footsteps of Killers (Channel 4), it is hard not to get the ick. That’s a technical critical term, but I hope you understand. It’s when the soul recoils instinctively, like a snail touching salt. The lip curls, the eyes narrow and the hand reaches for the remote control. The subject matter is cold cases, where someone was abducted or killed but the perpetrators were never caught. The first series – of three programmes, this second series comprises six – covered the 1967 murder of 19-year-old servicewoman Rita Ellis along with the 1986 disappearances of Patrick Warren and David Spencer – “the Milk Carton Kids” – and Suzy Lamplugh. As with the new series, they are investigated – if that is the word – by criminology professor David Wilson, whose MO seems to be to recap the events, tut over what could have been done better, bemoan the lack of forensic technology in the past and identify the prime suspect as someone the police interviewed at the time but never had enough evidence to prosecute. Emilia Fox is there, too, to react to the recapping and bemoaning, ask tortuously scripted questions and look suitably tragic about the whole abducted children/murdered women thing, and because she plays a forensic psychologist in the long-running drama Silent Witness. In the opening episode of the new series, it is the turn of the Templeton Woods murders to be re-examined for our … what, exactly? Delectation? To further our sense of despair about the world? To pander to our very worst voyeuristic impulses? Unconvincing efforts are made to gloss it as a chance to jog people’s memories or to encourage witnesses to come forward, as if the chance of this happening were not so infinitesimal as to be nonexistent. In 1979 and 1980, the bodies of two women were found in Templeton Woods, Dundee: Carol Lannen, a young single mother who had been in the care system and who was last seen getting into a man’s car on a street known to be used by men looking for paid sex, and Elizabeth McCabe who was a nursery nurse who lived at home with her parents and vanished after being separated from her friend on a night out. Snowfall destroyed any clues the killers might have left. Or was it – as the press was particularly keen that it should be – a single killer? The short answer was no. The longer answer was no, there was absolutely no similarity between the murders or the victims, the police had a likely suspect for McCabe’s murderer but the evidence was contaminated so no dice, and there wasn’t one for Lannen’s at the time but one cropped up thereafter. His name was Andrew Hunter and he was convicted of killing his second wife, Linda, and dumping her body in his local woods a year after Lannen was found in Templeton. A journalist wrote an article thereafter pointing out that Hunter’s first wife died by what was considered to be a very unlikely suicide and that his girlfriend Betsey was found dead the day after the police informed him of Linda’s death. Which is what might happen, the programme ponderously explains, if you were a girlfriend who maybe knew about your boyfriend’s first wife’s suspicious death, too, and might start airing your concerns to the police. The professor and the woman who plays a pathologist on TV gather together all the information other people give them, look sombre for a bit, then chase down a few genuinely new if ultimately meaningless leads. They find a neighbour who identified Hunter’s car as the kind Lannen was seen getting into and who had never liked the cut of Hunter’s jib, and care home employment records that suggested Hunter probably met the young, pregnant Carol there. “It’s chilling, isn’t it?” says a sombre Fox, her brow carefully furrowed. “Another serial killer?” “I wouldn’t,” says Wilson, carefully out-sombreing Fox, “bet against it.” The leading questions, the set-ups, the banal exchanges between Fox and Wilson, the sudden appearance of journalists who happen to have written reams on the subject and have done most of heavy lifting, the dragooning of Fox because she plays something related on television – the workings of it all are so nakedly on show, the beady-eyed calculations behind everything so blatant that it is hard not to feel as a viewer that you are being lightly spat on by the entire production team. More importantly, it feels at times borderline contemptuous of the stories on show and the suffering being picked over once again. The ick is what you get at best.

The emergency services were called to the scene in Cambridge Circus just after 1pm and a rescue operation was mounted. The Metropolitan police said: “We’re sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene. “His next of kin have been informed. Cordons remain in place at the location.” An ambulance crew, members of the hazardous area response team and a tactical response unit were dispatched, in addition to London’s air ambulance. The trapped man was freed using a winch after nearly two hours. A spokesperson for the London ambulance service said: “Sadly, despite the best efforts of our crews, a man was pronounced dead at the scene.” Earlier, a Met spokesperson said the man was thought to have sustained crush injuries while working on a telescopic urinal. The incident occurred at the junction of Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road close to Leicester Square. Telescopic urinals, or open-air public urinals, have been rising out of London streets for more than a decade. A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “Firefighters were called to a person trapped on Charing Cross Road in central London. A man was trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal. Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. “He was left in the care of London ambulance service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The brigade was called at 1.05pm and the incident was over by 3.41pm. Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters from Soho, Euston and Dowgate fire stations were at the scene.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/man-crushed-and-injured-while-working-on-open-air-urinal-in-london;guardian;entertainment & culture;812
3246;3246;Man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder over London church shooting;2023-01-16T07:58:55Z;['Harry Taylor'];['UK news'];;A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a drive-by shooting outside a church in London that left a seven-year-old girl with life-threatening injuries. It is the first arrest linked to the shooting outside St Aloysius church near Euston station on Saturday. Six people, four women and two children who had been attending a memorial service for a woman and her mother, were injured in the attack. A 22-year-old man was arrested on Sunday after a car was stopped in Cricklewood Lane in Barnet, north London. He has been taken into custody for questioning. Police said shotgun pellets were fired from a black Toyota C-HR at about 1.30pm on Saturday before it drove off. Scotland Yard issued a plea to anyone who may have seen the car in the area on Saturday to come forward with information. The service being held at the church in the Somers Town area of Camden was for Fresia Calderon, 50, and her daughter Sara Sanchez, 20. Both had died within weeks of each other at the end of 2022. Calderon had returned from Colombia in November and died from a blood clot after landing at Heathrow. Her daughter died three weeks later from terminal leukemia. Mourners had reportedly left the church to release white doves on Saturday when the incident happened. The seven-year-old girl, taken to hospital after the shooting, is in a serious but stable condition. A 48-year-old woman was left with potentially life-changing injuries after the shooting, and three other women, aged 21, 41 and 54, were taken to hospital where their condition is deemed to be non life-threatening. A 12-year-old girl who sustained a leg injury is expected to make a full recovery. The shots sent mourners running and screaming, with many of them sheltering inside the church, witnesses said. Footage posted on social media showed chaotic scenes after the shooting began. One resident of an estate across the road from the church, who did not want to be named, said: “I heard the gunshots. I was having a quiet day on my balcony and I heard this almighty bang and I thought this was not normal, and the next minute everyone was screaming and shouting.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/16/euston-shooting-man-arrested-london-funeral-church;guardian;entertainment & culture;3246
8959;8959;Louise Kam: Two men jailed for murder and fraud plot;Wednesday 1 February 2023 11:19, UK;[];['london', 'crime'];['louise', 'ms', 'kams', 'fraud', 'elabboud', 'kam', 'plot', 'aljundi', 'judge', 'jailed', 'murder', 'life', 'day', 'men'];"Two men have been sentenced to 35 years each in jail for murdering a 71-year-old businesswoman in a £4.6million scam to plunder her life savings.

Mohamed El Abboud, 28, and Kusai Al-Jundi, 25, targeted trusting mother-of-two Louise Kam, who had previously owned a catering business with her ex-husband before going into rental properties.

Al-Jundi, a chef from, north-west London, spent months attempting to trick Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, into giving him control of two properties she owned in Willesden and East Barnet by offering her millions of pounds.

He also aimed to gain control of her finances by convincing her to sign a Lasting Power of Attorney document.

But the scam came to a head when Ms Kam made it clear she would not sign over the properties.

The pair then lured her to her three-bedroom property in Barnet on 26 July last year. There she was strangled with a hairdryer cord during a ""violent struggle"".

Her body was then wrapped up in a duvet, dumped in a wheelie bin and covered with garden rubbish.

The following day the pair moved the bin to a road in Harrow where they lined it up with other bins showing the same number on the front in what the court heard was a plot to ""cover up"" the pair's ""atrocity"".

Image: A photo issued by Metropolitan Police of the wheelie bin where the body of Louise Kam was found

El Abboud and Al-Jundi were convicted at the Old Bailey on 19 January after officers untangled their lies and found evidence linking them to her murder.

On Wednesday the pair were both sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years years, by Judge Mark Lucraft KC, who said the murder of Ms Kam was motivated ""by greed"".

Phone used to pretend victim was still alive

Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, was last seen by a family member near the Spires Shopping Centre in Barnet on 26 July 2021.

She was reported missing to police the following day and an investigation was launched to find her.

Her black BMW was recovered by police on 28 July in Edgware. Her body was discovered on 1 August 2021 in a wheelie bin on Wood End Road, Harrow.

Investigators said the following day Al-Jundi sent Ms Kam's family and friends messages pretending she was alive and that she had gone on holiday.

On the same day El-Abboud sold Ms Kam's BMW and bought new clothes with the proceeds.

He also posted a TikTok video of him dancing and gyrating to music in the driveway of her Barnet home.

The judge had told how Al-Jundi had been described as a Walter Mitty character who falsely claimed to be a ""person of means"" with the backing of a multi-millionaire girlfriend when he set about tricking Ms Kam out of her property.

Having resolved to murder her to get hold of her assets, he promised El-Abboud a share ""as a reward for killing her"", the judge said.

Motivated by 'greed'

In sentencing both to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years, Judge Mark Lucraft KC said: ""El-Abboud, it might be said that Al-Jundi played the lead role in the long-running defrauding of Louise, but I draw no distinction on the sentence to be passed on the two of you.

""The evidence clearly shows what you did and did willingly and that you, along with Al-Jundi, did what you did out of greed.""

Catherine Gould, prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This horrific crime is a tale of greed taken to extremes. Al-Jundi and El-Abboud selfishly and brutally ended Louise Kam's life for their own ends.

""These defendants hatched a plan to kill Louise and profit from her death.""

In a victim impact statement, Ms Kam's son Gregory Kam said the family had been left in a state of ""disbelief"" at what happened to his mother.

He said: ""I deeply regret I was not able to do enough at the time to prevent my mother from falling for the lies of his wolf in sheep's clothing.

""In addition to the initial shocking news of our mother's disappearance and subsequent news of her murder, I was not only shocked but further angered and sickened to discover defendant one (Al-Jundi) enlisted the help of an accomplice (El-Abboud) to trick, entrap, overpower and murder a pension-age woman in her own home under the guise of what was supposed to be a business deal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201124930/http://news.sky.com/story/louise-kam-two-men-jailed-for-murder-and-fraud-plot-12800016;skynews;entertainment & culture;3050
4754;4754;The ChatGPT bot is causing panic now – but it’ll soon be as mundane a tool as Excel | John Naughton;2023-01-07T16:00:23Z;['John Naughton'];['Artificial intelligence (AI)', 'Technology', 'Chatbots', 'Computing', 'Consciousness', 'Silicon Valley', 'World news', 'ChatGPT'];;"So the ChatGPT language processing model burst upon an astonished world and the air was rent by squeals of delight and cries of outrage or lamentation. The delighted ones were those transfixed by discovering that a machine could apparently carry out a written commission competently. The outrage was triggered by fears of redundancy on the part of people whose employment requires the ability to write workmanlike prose. And the lamentations came from earnest folks (many of them teachers at various levels) whose day jobs involve grading essays hitherto written by students. So far, so predictable. If we know anything from history, it is that we generally overestimate the short-term impact of new communication technologies, while grossly underestimating their long-term implications. So it was with print, movies, broadcast radio and television and the internet. And I suspect we have just jumped on to the same cognitive merry-go-round. Before pressing the panic button, though, it’s worth examining the nature of the beast. It’s what the machine-learning crowd call a large language model (LLM) that has been augmented with a conversational interface. The underlying model has been trained on hundreds of terabytes of text, most of it probably scraped from the web, so you could say that it has “read” (or at any rate ingested) almost everything that has ever been published online. As a result, ChatGPT is pretty adept at mimicking human language, a facility that has encouraged many of its users to anthropomorphism, ie viewing the system as more human-like than machine-like. Hence the aforementioned squeals of delight – and also the odd misguided user apparently believing that the machine is in some way “sentient”. The best-known antidote to this tendency to anthropomorphise systems such as ChatGPT is Talking About Large Language Models, a recent paper by the distinguished AI scholar Murray Shanahan, available on arXiv. In it, he explains that LLMs are mathematical models of the statistical distribution of “tokens” (words, parts of words or individual characters including punctuation marks) in a vast corpus of human-generated text. So if you give the model a prompt such as “The first person to walk on the moon was ... ” and it responds with “Neil Armstrong”, that’s not because the model knows anything about the moon or the Apollo mission but because we are actually asking it the following question: “Given the statistical distribution of words in the vast public corpus of [English] text, what words are most likely to follow the sequence ‘The first person to walk on the moon was’? A good reply to this question is ‘Neil Armstrong’.”
So what’s going on is “next-token prediction”, which happens to be what many of the tasks that we associate with human intelligence also involve. This may explain why so many people are so impressed by the performance of ChatGPT. It’s turning out to be useful in lots of applications: summarising long articles, for example, or producing a first draft of a presentation that can then be tweaked. One of its more unexpected capabilities is as a tool for helping to write computer code. Dan Shipper, an experienced software guy, reports that he spent Christmas experimenting with it as a programming assistant, concluding that: “It’s incredibly good at helping you get started in a new project. It takes all of the research and thinking and looking things up and eliminates it… In 5 minutes you can have the stub of something working that previously would’ve taken a few hours to get up and running.” His caveat, though, was that you had to know about programming first. That seems to me to be the beginning of wisdom about ChatGPT: at best, it’s an assistant, a tool that augments human capabilities. And it’s here to stay. In that sense, it reminds me, oddly enough, of spreadsheet software, which struck the business world like a thunderbolt in 1979 when Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston wrote VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, for the Apple II computer, which was then sold mainly in hobbyist stores. One day, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak woke up to the realisation that many of the people buying their computer did not have beards and ponytails but wore suits. And that software sells hardware, not the other way round. The news was not lost on IBM and prompted the company to create the PC and Mitch Kapor to write the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program for it. Eventually, Microsoft wrote its own version and called it Excel, which now runs on every machine in every office in the developed world. It went from being an intriguing but useful augmentation of human capabilities to being a mundane accessory – not to mention the reason why Kat Norton (aka “Miss Excel”) allegedly pulls in six-figure sums a day from teaching Excel tricks on TikTok. The odds are that someone, somewhere is planning to do that with ChatGPT. And using the bot to write the scripts.

5674;5674;‘A dead cemetery’: the forgotten necropolis hidden among Port Fairy’s sand dunes;2023-01-02T14:00:19Z;['Nino Bucci'];['Victoria', 'Australia news'];;"Walk for about a kilometre along a rugged stretch of beach at Port Fairy, in Victoria’s south-west, and you will come across a sand dune. It is indistinct to the dozens of others along the coast. But should you decide to clamber up and over it, fighting your way through marram and sword grass that becomes thicker by the step, your eyes will fall on something peculiar: a marble headstone, almost 170 years old, appearing to be sucked into the undergrowth. There were as many as 200 people buried here in what was known as the sandhill or new cemetery after it opened in 1855. Now, there’s only a handful of headstones that can be seen without hacking through metre-high scrub. It was once a 240sq-metre site divided into two separate plots, with a row down the middle for a wagon. But it soon became obvious this strip of land was not ideal for a cemetery. It was buffeted by ferocious winds and only accessible by the Old Portland Road – little more than a track that was frequently muddy in winter and a haven for insects in summer. It was permanently closed in the 1880s.
By 1901, the Belfast Gazette (Port Fairy used to be known as Belfast) was declaring it “a neglected burial place”. “The sand-drifts raised by the westerly winds are gradually creeping over the deserted looking spot,” the paper reported in July of that year. And so started more than 120 years of wondering what to do to fix a unique mistake: a cemetery being built in the wrong spot. The Eastern Maar have been burying people in the sand dunes outside Port Fairy for millennia. John Clarke, the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation’s general manager of biocultural landscapes, says his ancestors were generally buried seated upright, almost in the foetal position, facing towards Deen Maar, also known as Lady Julia Percy Island. It was believed their spirits went to the island after their death. The early settlers buried at the sandhill cemetery do not face this way, but parallel to the ocean. The majority of the headstones that are visible are sandstone, probably milled at Warrnambool to the east, apart from a large marble headstone that belongs to Michael Connolly, one of the founders of the town and one of the men who sent John Batman to establish what would become Melbourne.
Even some locals don’t know the sandhill cemetery is there. There are no markers or tracks. Once you clamber up the dunes and fight through the scrub to the point where you can see some headstones, there’s a sign, which was only erected in the mid-2000s, outlining a brief history of the place. After the mission of gaining access to the site from the beach to the south, it is quite odd to look north from the top of the dune beyond the cemetery and see cleared farmland – in theory a far more sensible way of accessing the site – stretching as far as the eye can see. But that is private land. The only public access remains from the beach.
The lack of accessibility and awareness of the cemetery is by design, as it helps protect against vandalism or pilfering, local historian Marten Syme reckons. Syme says that when the cemetery was built, there was already one in town, on a 2,000ha (5,120 acre) parcel of land owned by the Sydney solicitor and entrepreneur James Atkinson. Atkinson bought the land for a pound an acre and planned to use it to attract workers from the UK. When Atkinson made the purchase, Syme says, there were only about 50 people in Port Fairy, the second European settlement in Victoria. But by the mid-1850s, there were almost 2,500 – a population that would remain the same until the 2000s. Port Fairy was booming and the sandhill cemetery was built as an alternative, in part to service those who did not live on Atkinson’s plots and also because it was believed the original cemetery was too close to town. The location was probably selected, Syme believes, because it was just outside the boundary of Atkinson’s land and on a main road. For a time, it seemed to work: even people from Hamilton, a farming community to the north, who came to the town for recreation bought plots in the new cemetery. “But it was not very sensible,” Syme said. “Within 10 years people were choosing not to be buried out there.” Syme is sitting around the dining table in a house built by one of the last people buried in the cemetery, Capt Lewis Grant. Grant built the house, Seaview, in 1852. Symes bought it more than 120 years later and worked to restore it.
He says his research shows Grant’s young daughter was buried in the early 1870s at the new cemetery and he believes Grant bought a plot for himself next to her at that time. Grant was buried there in January 1886 and the cemetery was officially closed the following year. Some of the interred were moved to the original cemetery but others stayed. Syme says records are incomplete about how many. Letters to the Belfast Gazette from the late 1880s show locals were fed up with the site and wanted something to be done. Nothing ever has been. Over the decades, headstones have been used as targets by shooters and cows have broken in, knocking over stone fences. There have been applications for heritage registration, funding applications and spats with state government departments about how to maintain the site.
A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning told the Warrnambool Standard in 2019 that access to the cemetery was better kept limited to ensure its “heritage values” were protected. The department did not respond to questions from the Guardian, including about whether a claim made in the same 2019 article that it would “work with other stakeholders to consider future management options” had materialised. Syme says that just as when locals appealed to the settlers of the town to fix the problem, it has been hard to make a case. “Are they going to spend money on – pardon the pun – a dead cemetery?” he asks.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/03/a-dead-cemetery-the-forgotten-necropolis-hidden-among-port-fairys-sand-dunes;guardian;entertainment & culture;5674
321;321;Race storm erupts after Andrea Riseborough’s best actress Oscar nomination;2023-01-30T14:02:04Z;['Andrew Pulver'];['Oscars 2023', 'Oscars', 'Andrea Riseborough', 'Awards and prizes', 'Race', 'Culture', 'Film', 'World news'];;"The Academy Awards has found itself at the centre of race row after Andrea Riseborough’s unexpected nomination for a best actress Oscar for her performance in To Leslie, seemingly at the expense of Viola Davis for The Woman King and Danielle Deadwyler for Till. Following the Oscars nominations announcement last Tuesday, Till director Chinonye Chukwu denounced the film industry for “upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women”, and in a lengthy comment piece in the LA Times film critic Robert Daniels wrote: “Although it’s easy to point a finger at Riseborough for taking a slot from Black women, broken systems persist when we focus our ire on individuals … what does it say that the Black women who did everything the institution asks of them – luxury dinners, private Academy screenings, meet-and-greets, splashy television spots and magazine profiles – are ignored when someone who did everything outside of the system is rewarded?” Social media has also seen a revival of the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag which first achieved prominence in 2016 after no non-white actors were nominated in any of the performance categories.
Riseborough’s Oscar nomination came largely out of the blue, as she had only rarely featured earlier in the awards season; on the other hand, both Davis and Deadwyler were nominated for the Screen Actors Guild awards, and Davis for the Golden Globes. Riseborough’s only prior nomination of significance is for the Independent Spirit awards, to be announced in March. However To Leslie’s profile was raised by a concerted campaign involving significant numbers of A-list actors, including Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston and fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett, who either hosted screenings and Q&As, namechecked Riseborough at awards ceremonies or posted on social media. To Leslie’s campaign was assisted by two PR companies, Narrative and Shelter, and appears to be self-funded, while Till and The Woman King were backed by deep-pocketed studios United Artists and Sony respectively. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas), the body that organises the Oscars, announced that it will meet on Tuesday to “review” its campaign regulations, saying it wanted “to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication”. Ampas guidelines on campaigning stress that it should be “conducted in a fair and ethical manner” – for example limiting the number of screenings that can be held, defining the kind of hospitality that can be offered, and banning nominees from contacting Oscar voters directly. The success of the campaign on behalf of To Leslie also appears to have backfired on Riseborough herself, with Variety quoting an anonymous Academy member saying: “No matter what happens, her reputation is being tarnished, whether her campaign did something or not.”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/30/race-storm-erupts-after-andrea-riseborough-best-actress-oscar-nomination-to-leslie;guardian;entertainment & culture;321

'Millennial' and 'Generation X' votes at risk if UK government follows France in raising state pension age

France has been paralysed by strikes today as much of the country, as predicted, makes clear its unhappiness at President Emmanuel Macron's push to raise the state pension age from 62 to 64 years of age.

Mr Macron argues that the measure, which would save the French government an initial €17.7bn (£15.5bn) per year, is necessary because otherwise, due to the ageing population, the state pension will become unaffordable.

The French president believes raising the state pension age is preferable to either cutting the state pension or retaining the status quo by either increasing government borrowing or putting up taxes.

UK state pension age rising to 68 by 2046

Events in France have prompted some to ask whether the pension age may also have to rise in the UK.

The answer is that it already is.

The pension age was set at 65 until November 2018, since when it has gradually risen to the current 66, which it hit in October 2020.

It is due to begin rising again from May 2026, again, on a gradual basis.

By the end of 2028 the state retirement age will be 67.

It is then due to begin gradually rising again from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.

Under the changes, anyone born after 6 April 1978 (in other words, someone who will celebrate their 45th birthday this year) will have to wait until 2046, when they hit 68, to qualify for the state pension.

State pension bill expected to exceed £100bn

It is worth noting how far that latter change is into the future but some fear the Treasury will seek to accelerate the process.

A government review of the state pension age is due to be published by May this year, with the cost of the state pension due to increase in coming years from the current £100bn per year.

Even bringing forward by one year the point at which the pension age rises to 68 would save £10bn.

Ministers have already indicated they would like to accelerate the process so that the change to 68 is brought forward to between 2037 and 2039 rather than between 2044 and 2046.

Image: Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said bringing forward the age at which the state pension rises to 68 would be fraught with danger

'Generation X' and 'Millennial' votes may be at risk

Moving more rapidly than that would be politically risky because it would alienate 'Generation X' voters, those born between 1965 and 1980, who would be the first to be hit.

It would involve, effectively, ordering them either to postpone the date of their retirement and work for longer than they had anticipated or get by on whatever retirement savings they may have accumulated until they qualify for the state pension - but giving them little time to build the extra savings they may need.

More explosive would be how such a move would further anger 'Millennial' voters, those born between 1980 and 1995, many of whom are already disgruntled at their inability to get on the housing ladder and at having been the first generation saddled with university tuition fees.

These are a cohort the Conservatives desperately need to keep onside if they are to avoid defeat not only at the next general election but the one after that in around 2028 or 2029.

So bringing forward the age at which the state pension rises to 68 would be fraught with danger.

Mel Stride, secretary of state for work and pensions, has already warned that to do so would be ""pretty hairy"".

It is more likely that the government will, instead, look to introduce a timetable to raise the state pension age again to 69 or even 70 sometime in the latter half of this century.

There have also been suggestions that ministers may give some thought to means testing the state pension as happens, for example, in Australia.

This, though, overlooks that the state pension is effectively means tested already.

'Baby boomers' already losing out

The generous pensions accumulated by the now-retiring 'Baby Boomer' generation, those born between 1945 and 1965, mean many of them are already seeing their state pension being clawed back in income taxes.

More than half of those currently in receipt of the state pension pay at least 20% of it back in taxes and, in a lot of cases, 40% or even 45%.

Such a measure would also be incredibly unfair on those now in or approaching their final decade in the workplace.

The state pension will have formed a big part of their retirement planning and to deprive them of it at relatively short notice would not give them enough time to accumulate further savings.

It might even have the opposite effect of making them stop saving for retirement, or burn through their existing savings, in order not to miss out on the state pension.

It is why Steve Webb, arguably the best pensions minister this country has had during the last half-century and certainly the most knowledgeable, has described means-testing of state pensions as a ""terrible idea"".

Accordingly, if it were to be introduced, it would need to be telegraphed many years in advance.

That also applies to any increase in the state pension age - or accelerating the current increase planned.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119160731/http://news.sky.com/story/millennial-and-generation-x-votes-at-risk-if-government-follows-france-in-raising-state-pension-age-12790239;skynews;politics;1832
2451;2451;The Guardian view on Jacinda Ardern’s departure: knowing when to quit | Editorial;2023-01-19T18:30:16Z;['Editorial'];['New Zealand', 'Jacinda Ardern', 'New Zealand politics', 'Asia Pacific'];;"Jacinda Ardern’s resignation has sparked shock and dismay, and not only at home, where Labour must now rush to replace the prime minister without an obvious heir in sight. “Jacindamania” waned in New Zealand, but has continued to flourish in the wider anglophone world. Yet her decision should be applauded as well as lamented. Convinced of their own indispensability, politicians often cling on too long. Even successful leaders need to know when it’s time to go. Nelson Mandela set the gold standard, stepping down after one term as president though so many were desperate for him to continue. The issue was less his ability to serve than the symbolic importance of a democratic transition in South Africa. In contrast, even admirers saw Winston Churchill’s return to office following his crushing postwar defeat by Labour as a mistake. He confided in Rab Butler that he felt “like an aeroplane at the end of its flight … with the petrol running out”. Ms Ardern echoed that sentiment with her remark that she “no longer [has] enough in the tank to do it justice”. The difference is that her judgment was not shared by others. Though her party’s ratings are the lowest since it took office in 2017 and her own approval ratings have fallen, she remained the most popular choice for prime minister in polls. Labour’s battle in this autumn’s election will be far tougher without her. Some supporters are likely to feel let down as well as disappointed, while recognising the unusual pressures she has faced. It was not only her empathy but her decisiveness in response to crises – the Christchurch terror attack of 2019 and the advent of Covid-19 – that won her admiration. She saw through firearms reform; a speedy and effective pandemic response; the Zero Carbon Act. She was a canny political operator as well as a charismatic leader. But the government’s extraordinary popularity plunged as the cost of living soared and, despite progress on housebuilding and child poverty, it has struggled with promises – perhaps unsurprising with so much else on its plate. There is no doubt that her leadership shone all the brighter as machismo and the deliberate fomenting of division appeared to be triumphing internationally. (Intriguingly, a new study suggests that greater female representation in legislatures may help to ameliorate political polarisation.) She filled a vacuum for progressives seeking hope in the age of Donald Trump, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson. The respect and admiration she received offered hope that female leaders, too, can triumph, albeit under tougher conditions, following the misogyny so openly dealt out to Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard. Many attempted to patronise Ms Ardern; even her resignation has been scrutinised through the bizarre, antiquated lens of whether women “can have it all”. None succeeded, though perhaps the greater challenges she faced have contributed to an earlier exit. Ms Ardern treated political office as a responsibility rather than a lark or rightful reward for her genius. Part of that responsibility, she noted on Thursday, is “to know when you are the right person to lead, and also when you are not”. Just as her “kind, but strong” style of leadership contrasted with the macho posturing seen elsewhere, so her departure looks all the more admirable in a world where Jair Bolsonaro and Mr Trump have sought to cling on even after the electorate voted to boot them out.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-jacinda-arderns-departure-knowing-when-to-quit;guardian;entertainment & culture;2451
2757;2757;Australia to consider European-style right to be forgotten privacy laws;2023-01-18T14:00:44Z;['Paul Karp'];['Australian politics', 'Privacy', 'Law (Australia)', 'Mark Dreyfus', 'Labor party', 'Business', 'Australia news', 'Data and computer security', 'Data protection'];;"The right to be forgotten and a right to sue for privacy breaches will be considered for the next tranche of Australian legislation, the attorney general has said. Mark Dreyfus made the comments on Monday, promising to consider European-style privacy reforms after his bill increasing penalties for companies that fail to protect customer data passed in 2022. After receiving a review of the Privacy Act conducted by the Attorney General’s Department, Dreyfus said in December that the former Coalition government had left it “out of date and not fit-for-purpose in our digital age”.
Dreyfus said this week that there would be a “whole range of … modernisations of the Privacy Act”. “I’ve already brought in … substantial increases to penalties which I hope has sent a message to corporate Australia that they have to take more care about the privacy of Australians … about the data of Australians that they have in their custody,” he told Guardian Australia on Monday. “Those changes should have been implemented years ago.” Dreyfus noted it was a “longstanding recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission to create a statutory tort of privacy”, meaning individuals could sue for damages for breaches of their privacy. The attorney said it was “among the matters to be considered”. Asked about the right to erasure – also known as the right to be forgotten – Dreyfus said “there’s a range of reforms [that] have already occurred in a number of developed countries particularly in the EU and obviously the reforms that were created by the general data protection regulation … are among the matters that will need to be considered”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The European Union’s general data protection regulation (GDPR) gives people the right to have their data erased if it is no longer necessary for the the purpose it was collected or, in some circumstances, where the person withdraws consent. The GDPR contains a range of other personal rights including the right to data portability; to object to data processing in some circumstances, including where it is used for direct marketing purposes; and not to be subject to automated decision-making and profiling. In September, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described requiring companies to dispose of data when they no longer need it as a “pretty commonsense proposal”. At that time, Dreyfus also raised the prospect companies could be required to delete data collected only for establishing a person’s identity. The managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc – whose members include Google, Apple, Meta, Twitter and TikTok – Sunita Bose told Guardian Australia it was “strongly in favour of reforming the Privacy Act”. “All companies have a duty to protect their customers’ personal information, and we need to modernise the law for the digital era,” Bose said. “Digi is broadly supportive of increased harmonisation between Australia’s privacy regime and the European GDPR which has a lot of strong elements, including consumer rights around data erasure which should be offered in Australia.” A Meta spokesperson said it “supports stronger privacy protections for Australian consumers … including the introduction of a statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy and a right to erasure in certain circumstances”. But breach of privacy could prove more controversial for media companies which fear the action can provide the rich and powerful further legal weapons to constrain freedom of the press. The Business Council of Australia opposed the law reform in earlier consultations, labelling it “premature to introduce a tort that would often overlap with the protections of the Australian Privacy Principles”. “We are yet to see compelling evidence that there is a need for these, particularly as the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has reported that its conciliation process has been largely successful in resolving complaints,” it submitted. In a wide-ranging interview, Dreyfus was asked about comments by the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, in November that the Australian Human Rights Commission is “not resourced” to do LGBTQ+ human rights work, while the president, Rosalind Croucher, told Senate estimates the AHRC “would dearly like to be able to put such a specialist role back in”.
Dreyfus said “the scope of work of the [AHRC] is something that remains under active consideration”. On Tuesday Dreyfus opened consultation for the creation of a federal judicial commission, to police what he described as the “relatively rare” instances of “problematic conduct by judges”. Dreyfus said the commission was “longstanding Labor policy” which he understood was “supported by the federal courts”. “I’m trying to do it in tandem with the establishment of the national anti-corruption commission because for constitutional reasons the [Nacc] cannot cover the courts,” he said. The commission was an “appropriate companion organisation” that should be up and running “soon after” the Nacc, which will open in mid-2023. Dreyfus said that calls for a commissioner to protect whistleblowers would be considered by a discussion paper in the second stage of whistleblower reforms. The government’s first whistleblowing bill is being considered by a Senate inquiry, to report in mid-March.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/right-to-be-forgotten-australia-europe-gdpr-privacy-laws;guardian;politics;2757

Kami Carpenter, 21, and Remy Gordon, 22, were charged on Saturday with killing Fisher, who was stabbed on the dancefloor at the Crane nightclub in Digbeth, Birmingham. The defendants spoke only to confirm their personal details and enter not guilty pleas to a linked charge of affray during a four-minute hearing at the city’s crown court on Monday. The case, heard by two magistrates, was one of several magistrates court cases switched to the nearby crown court because the lower court was closed. Carpenter, of no fixed address, and Gordon, of Birmingham, were not asked to enter any plea to the murder charge. Both defendants were ordered to reappear before a crown court judge on Wednesday. A further hearing was set for 30 January. Fisher, who played for Stratford Town FC, was on a night out with friends. The nightclub had its licence suspended for 28 days on Friday after accusations by police that there had been “serious management failings” at the venue on the night of the incident. Officers recovered a knife from the scene, and a postmortem confirmed that Fisher, 23, died of a stab wound. His girlfriend, Jess Chatwin, paid tribute to him with a message on Twitter the day after he died. She wrote: “You didn’t deserve any of this. I’m so sorry this has happened to you my baby please come home.

Fisher had spent some time at non-league Bromsgrove Sporting last season before returning to Stratford Town in the summer.

1162;1162;Living for Pleasure by Emily A Austin – an Epicurean guide to happiness ;2023-01-26T09:00:00Z;['Julian Baggini'];['Philosophy books', 'Books', 'Culture'];;No one today would dream of practising the physics, medicine or biology of the ancient Greeks. But their thoughts on how to live remain perennially inspiring. Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics have all had their 21st-century evangelists. Now it is Epicurus’s turn, and his advocate is American philosopher Emily A Austin. Living for Pleasure is likely to evoke feelings of deja vu. One reason why “ancient wisdom” is so enduring is that most thinkers came to very similar conclusions on certain key points. Do not be seduced by the shallow temptations of wealth or glory. Pursue what is of real value to you, not what society tells you is most important. Be the sovereign of your desires, not a slave to them. Do not be scared of death, since only the superstitious fear divine punishment. The more general such claims are, the easier it is to agree. But when we delve into what makes the various philosophers different, what sounds like universal good sense can suddenly seem a bit wacky. Epicurus’s distinctive feature is his insistence that pleasure is the source of all happiness and is the only truly good thing. Hence the modern use of “epicurean” to mean gourmand. But Epicurus was no debauched hedonist. He thought the greatest pleasure was ataraxia: a state of tranquility in which we are free from anxiety. This raises the suspicion of false advertising – freedom from anxiety may be nice, but few would say it is positively pleasurable. Still, in a world where even the possibility of missing out inspires fear, freedom from anxiety sounds pretty attractive. How can we get it? Mainly by satisfying the right desires and ignoring the rest. Epicurus thought that desires could be natural or unnatural, and necessary or unnecessary. Our natural and necessary desires are few: healthy food, shelter, clothes, company. As long as we live in a stable, supportive community, they are easy to achieve. We become anxious when we devote energy to pursuing things that are unnatural, unnecessary or both. Such desires are “extravagant”. They are not always bad, but they should only be enjoyed if the opportunity happens to arise, not actively sought out. Sex and fine food fall into this category. “Those who least need extravagance enjoy it most,” the philosopher writes. Believing that only haute cuisine is good enough for you is a recipe for dissatisfaction. Unnatural and unnecessary desires, such as for wealth, power, fame or eternal life, are considered “corrosive”, to be avoided like the plague. They deprive us of any chance of feeling that we have enough. There is always more wealth, life or power to be had and so if we want them, we can never be content. The clarity and concision of Austin’s prose means that she covers many more of the details of Epicurean thought in her 24 short chapters. Anyone seduced by the recent fashion for Stoicism should read her book to see why their biggest contemporary rival offers a better model for living. The Stoics tell us that the only thing that matters is virtue, we should be indifferent when loved ones die, and that the universe works providentially, so ultimately nothing in it is bad. Epicurus was realistic enough to accept that external circumstances can make life intolerable, grief is natural and real, and shit happens. He speaks to us all, but does not offer a universal prescription for the great life. Freedom from anxiety is good, all other things being equal, but many would say that a willingness to do without tranquility is what has enabled them to push themselves and live fuller lives. Austin ultimately shows that Epicurus is a pretty good guide on the journey of life, but you should let some other thinkers show you around too. • Living for Pleasure: An Epicurean Guide to Life is published by Oxford University USA (£16).

The UFC boss apologised after the incident, saying: ""You've heard me say for years there is never, ever an excuse for a man to put his hands on a woman, and now here I am talking about it.

""My wife and I have been married for almost 30 years, we've known each other since we were 12 years old, and we've obviously been through some stuff together. We've got three kids, and this is one of those situations which is horrible.

562;562;I love the UK. But I’m glad I’m running my small business in the US | Gene Marks;2023-01-29T11:00:47Z;['Gene Marks'];['US small business', 'Business', 'US news'];;My wife and I visit London a few times a year to see her family and our friends from university. We’re here again this time for the entire month of January living as Londoners, staying in a rented house, taking out the trash – sorry, rubbish – and buying our food at Waitrose. The stay has given me time to observe, talk to people and walk around, and here’s what I’ve learned: I need to stop complaining about how difficult it is to run a small business in the US. It’s much harder to run a small business in the UK. Particularly now. Imagine running a business where inflation isn’t 6.5%, as it is the US, but 10.5%. The cost of living here is pushing British consumers to buy less – so much so that, according to a recent poll, two-thirds of them are planning on cutting their spending in 2023. In a nation of shopkeepers this is not insignificant. Like the US, unemployment here remains low, so there’s still a shortage of workers and a continued demand to retain them which – combined with rising prices – is forcing business owners to increase wages. So a business owner in the UK is not only hit with slowing demand, but rising costs at the same time and at a rate higher than the US. Energy costs are also hitting people hard. All of my friends here have complained that their utility prices have more than doubled this year, despite some help from the government. I’ve seen portable heaters in restaurants next to tables and even our Airbnb host asked us to try to keep the temperature below 17C (62.6F) if possible. The good news is it seems that energy relief is coming but it’s not coming fast enough. How has this affected UK small businesses? Not great. According to a new survey from outsourcing platform Fiverr, business owners here are reporting they have lost on average £83,000 since the start of the economic downturn, which equates to half of their annual turnover with nearly one in five UK start-ups and small businesses polled losing over £100,000 since the start of the economic downturn. Some business owners across the country say they have had to “shut their doors” because of these higher costs. The Fiverr study also found that 92% of UK startups and small businesses are fearful about the future of their business and nearly one in five admitted to being “very fearful”. Confidence among UK small businesses has dropped, with another survey finding a 50% fall in the number of companies planning to expand this year compared with summer of 2022. All of that, and then there’s Brexit. Maybe there’s an argument that the UK’s new-found freedom to control its economic destiny will work out. But clearly there are a great many people who disagree. Particularly small business owners that rely on foreign sales, like this British entrepreneur in the biking industry that blames Brexit on a revenue loss of more than £100,000, and more than three quarters of British companies that say that the trade agreement has made it difficult for them to increase sales and grow their business, according to a British Chambers of Commerce survey. Even when the economy is strong, the UK regulatory environment for businesses far exceeds what we have to deal with in the US. Most workers who work a five-day week must receive at least 28 days’ paid annual leave a year. The government also requires employers to give their workers additional time off for when they’re sick. Employers are mandated to provide paid and unpaid maternity leave, as well as making contributions to their workers’ retirement, healthcare and liability (workers’ compensation) plan. Taxes – excluding the impact of state taxes – are higher here, too, with the country’s top rate being 45% for those earning more than £150,000 ($180,000) as compared to the US top tax rate of 37% for those earning more than $523,000. I’m not weighing in on whether or not it’s a good thing that the government requires all of these benefits from their business community. All I know is that none of this is required in the US, and that, even with all of these regulations, the UK economy remains the sixth largest economy in the world, even though there are 79 countries with more people. London is busy, as always. The pandemic has receded, there are few masks to be seen, most storefronts are rented, and most of the population are gainfully employed. But there’s a gloom hanging over the UK, and not it’s not due to the weather (which has been cold but clear – most of the time). The UK is a great country and London is a great city. But I’m glad I’m running my small business in the US and not here.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/29/london-uk-us-small-business-gene-marks;guardian;business & economy;562
4193;4193;Football transfer rumours: Tottenham in for Brentford keeper David Raya?;2023-01-11T08:39:16Z;['Barry Glendenning'];['Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"In what might be interpreted as bad news for Chelsea, Enzo Fernández, their main transfer target in this window, scored for Benfica in their Portuguese Cup win over Varzim on Tuesday night. By way of celebration, the Argentinian midfielder engaged in some performative “I’m staying here” nonsense, ostentatiously thumping the badge on his chest, before pointing to himself and then the Portuguese ground beneath his feet. “I can say that I expect Enzo Fernández to stay,” said his manager, Roger Schmidt. “I never doubted Enzo, his attitude and personality. He’s a great person, he’s at Benfica, he loves playing for Benfica.” Expect him to be unveiled at Stamford Bridge within the fortnight. In more positive news for the Premier League’s crisis club du jour, João Félix is reported to be in London to jog on a treadmill and cough for the doctors before the completion of his loan from Atlético Madrid. There are also whispers that Mauricio Pochettino is “waiting in the wings” to take over if Todd Boehly runs out of patience with Graham Potter and decides to sack him.
While they may not have a place in the Carabao Cup semis with which to entice him, Leicester remain hopeful of signing Nico González from Fiorentina for a fee of up to £27m. A winger who can also play as a centre-forward, the 24-year-old won a World Cup medal with Argentina despite being forced out of the squad after picking up an injury before the tournament started. It is one of several niggles González has struggled with during a season in which he has been limited to 11 appearances for the Serie A side. Youri Tielemans is out of contract this summer, which means the Foxes are open to offers for their Belgian midfielder but would quite like him to stay even if it means losing out on a fee in six months’ time. Craig Dawson is in a similar position at West Ham and, while demand for the 32-year-old central defender is unlikely to be as high, Wolves would quite like to sign him immediately in the hope of shoring up their defence. Nottingham Forest are hoping to sign Danilo from Palmeiras. Reports from Brazil suggest the two clubs are in “advanced talks” over a move for the 21-year-old defensive midfielder, have agreed a fee of £12m and are now just haggling over how best to structure the payments. It seems Tottenham are interested in signing Brentford’s David Raya as a long-term replacement for Hugo Lloris, in a state of affairs that has prompted the Get French Football News website to report Brentford’s interest in the Nantes and former France Under-21 goalkeeper Alban Lafont. And finally, Everton and Nottingham Forest are prepared to duke it out in a battle to sign the former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma on loan from Villarreal, while the delightful prospect of hearing someone with a strong Scouse accent managing loads of players with the letter “K” sprinkled liberally throughout their surnames is inching closer now that Steven Gerrard is being linked with the vacant Poland job.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-in-for-brentford-keeper-david-raya;guardian;sports;4193
2528;2528;UK lenders fear spike in mortgage defaults as cost of living hits home;2023-01-19T13:03:47Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Borrowing & debt', 'Housing market', 'House prices', 'Bank of England', 'Real estate', 'Property', 'Money', 'Business', 'Banks and building societies', 'Financial sector', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Mortgage arrears', 'Mortgage rates', 'Mortgages', 'Personal loans', 'UK news'];;Britain’s mortgage lenders fear a rise in the number of homeowners handing back their keys as the cost of living crisis forces more people to default on their loans. The Bank of England said a survey of lenders showed they were braced for a steep rise in the number of customers who cannot pay their monthly mortgage bills during the first quarter of the year. The number of people defaulting on credit cards and unsecured credit loans increased in the fourth quarter of 2022 and would climb further this year, the survey found. Anti poverty campaigners have said rocketing mortgage interest rates and double-digit inflation means many low and middle income families are likely to find their loans are unaffordable. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said earlier this month that the average mortgage payer re-financing their loan faced an extra £3,000 a year in higher interest charges after nine increases in the Bank of England base rate since December 2022. Households also face the extra costs of food and energy that have pushed the headline rate of annual UK inflation to 10.5%, well above the Bank of England’s 2% target. Buyers looking to get a first foot on the housing ladder or to move home were also likely to face a tougher time finding a home and a mortgage. The most recent mortgage data collected by the central bank showed house purchase activity continued to slow late last year, with the number of mortgages approved for home sales falling to 46,100 in November, down from 59,000 in October. This slump brought the level of sales to their lowest level since January 2011 if the collapse in June 2020 to 40,500 during the first Covid-19 lockdown is stripped out. Lenders reported that the supply of mortgages fell in the last quarter of 2022 and would slide again in the first three months of 2023. They expected to sell fewer mortgages for house purchases in the first quarter of this year and this would only be offset by a small increase in remortgaging by existing customers. Simon Gammon, managing partner in the finance arm of the estate agents Knight Frank, said lenders were beginning to cut mortgage rates in response to signs that borrowing costs were close to a peak. However, he said that while mortgage rates might be improving, “lenders are clearly expecting housing market activity to ebb over the coming weeks”. He added that existing borrowers could “clearly see that conditions are better than they were just a few weeks ago and rates, though declining, are unlikely to ease much further and now is a good time to act”. The estate agency expects UK mortgage rates to enter a “new normal, with the best five-year fixed products a little under 4.5%”. Lenders told the Bank of England there was likely to be a decline in the number of mortgages on offer in the first quarter of this year, presenting first-time buyers with a more limited choice of loans. The number of unsecured credit loans on offer would also decrease, the central bank said, limiting the access of households to regulated consumer credit such as credit cards and short-term loans to make ends meet.;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/19/uk-lenders-fear-spike-in-mortgage-defaults-as-cost-of-living-hits-home;guardian;business & economy;2528
4639;4639;In Santos’s district, reactions to brazen lies remain mixed: ‘I might let him slide’;2023-01-08T10:00:45Z;['Adam Gabbatt'];['New York', 'US news', 'US politics'];;It was only after George Santos was elected to Congress that the news broke: the New York Republican had told lies during his campaign. But these weren’t just little lies, or white lies. Santos appears to have lied brazenly, with abandon, about almost everything it’s possible to lie about: his career, his education, his faith, his relationships, his finances, 9/11. Santos, who in his telling is a real estate magnate and animal charity founder who graduated in economics and previously worked for Goldman Sachs – none of this is true – has refused to step down from the House of Representatives, despite calls for him to resign and criticism from his own party. But in Santos’s congressional district, which covers part of Queens, in New York City, and much of the neighboring Nassau county, in Long Island, the reaction has been more varied. Some people have defended the serial fibber, while others are adamant Santos must quit. “If you lie about one thing, that is OK,” said Gary Dhindsa, who owns One Stop Cards and Convenience in Farmingdale, Nassau county. “Anybody can expect that – maybe he misspoke or something. But if you lie about 100% of everything, people cannot expect that. “Politicians, when they speak they try to embellish their things. But not like this, when everything they tell you is totally bullshit.” It was the New York Times, in December, which broke the story of Santos’s web of deceit. Santos claimed that he graduated from Baruch College and New York University, only to later admit he hadn’t. He said he had worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but after both firms said they had no record of his employment, Santos said he had “never worked directly” for either institution. Santos tweeted in February 2021 that he and his family owned 13 properties, before confessing to the New York Post that he does not own any properties. During his campaign, Santos had referred to himself as a “proud American Jew”, but later said he had “never claimed to be Jewish”, only “Jew-ish”. He said four of his employees were killed during the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Florida, but the New York Times found that “none of the 49 victims appear to have worked at the various firms named in [Santos’s] biography”. Santos also claimed to have founded a charity called Friends of Pets United, but according to the Times: “The Internal Revenue Service could locate no record of a registered charity with that name.” The Republican had also claimed his mother was “in her office in the South Tower” in New York on the day of the 9/11 attacks, and that she died a few years later: “9/11 claimed my mother’s life,” he wrote on Twitter in July 2021. His mother had actually died in 2016, and the New York Times could find no evidence that she worked at the World Trade Center. “People are betrayed,” Dhindsa said. “They are feeling betrayed because he told complete lies. He manipulated everything. Not one or two things. Everything.” Santos had visited Farmingdale in the run-up to the election, and posted an Instagram photo of him enjoying an ice-cream at Charlotte’s, a couple of doors down from One Stop Cards and Convenience. On Wednesday, the owner of Charlotte’s remembered Santos as “very nice”, but had some questions. “On the surface of it, it sounds like he should resign,” Nick DeVito said. “He made up a bunch of stuff and got his job under false pretenses. That’s what it sounds like. But I would like to just hear him, you know, give us his side of the story, I guess, and after I heard that I would make my determination,” he said. DeVito said he had offered the ice-cream to Santos for free, but Santos had insisted on paying. DeVito voted for Santos a few days later, but said the newly elected politician needs to fully address the fabrication controversy. “If they are bold-faced lies, then I think he should resign and somebody else should take the spot. If he’s got some kind of an explanation, even a half-assed explanation. I might let him slide.” In the meantime, DeVito said: “He’s welcome back here. But I don’t know if I would give him anything for free.” Further along Farmingdale’s Main Street, florist Emily Ring was more dead-set in her Santos support. “There’s so many liars with politicians, it’s like: they all do, to a certain degree. But he got caught,” Ring said. “I don’t think he should resign.” Ultimately, it might not be Santos’s choice as to whether his political career continues. The Republican, who was due to be sworn in on Tuesday only for the GOP’s bonfire in the House to cause a delay, will take office amid a swarm of investigations. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Santos’s finances, while a local investigation in Nassau county began examining Santos in late December. The New York Times reported that “questions remain” about how Santos was able to loan his campaign $700,000. “I made a mistake, and I think humans are flawed and we all make mistakes,” Santos said in an interview with Fox News on 27 December. “The reality is that I remain committed to doing everything I set forward in my campaign. I’m not a fraud. I’m not a fake.” Asked if he feels “no shame” about telling “blatant lies” to the electorate, Santos said: “I can say the same thing about the Democrats and the party, look at Joe Biden. Joe Biden has been lying to the American people for 40 years, he’s the president of the United States,” he said. That excuse didn’t carry much weight with Marylou Albertini, a resident of the affluent Port Washington neighborhood in Long Island. “I think he’s a crumb,” Albertini said. “It’s really like he’s saying it’s OK to do it. Which is really wrong.” Albertini said she believed most politicians to be “crooks”, but said Santos’s actions went further than the usual political obfuscations. “I heard him say basically: ‘Why should that matter, because other politicians lie,’” Albertini said. “Well this isn’t about them. It’s about you, stupid.”;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/george-santos-district-queens-new-york-long-island-lies;guardian;politics;4639
1044;1044;Troops may be called into Northern Ireland if firefighters strike;2023-01-26T17:46:14Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Northern Ireland', 'Firefighters', 'Industrial action', 'Ministry of Defence', 'Military', 'UK news'];;Hundreds of troops could return to Northern Ireland as cover for striking firefighters, the Guardian can disclose. The head of the region’s fire service has said the army will be formally requested to provide cover unless unions agree to do so for “high risk calls”. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has refused to do so without an increased pay offer. Any request for troops would raise serious security concerns and could be politically explosive. Dissident republicans have in the past warned they would target any British troops who returned to the “island of Ireland”. The outcome of the FBU’s ballot of more than 33,000 members, who have been asked whether to take industrial action after rejecting the offer of a 5% pay rise, is due on Monday. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) is one of many fire services expecting a vote in favour of strikes starting as early as 23 February. Civil servants raised the possibility of seeking cover from the armed forces in December and January as they discussed how to respond to an expected ballot in favour of a strike in the region. Discussions have involved staff from the NIFRS and Northern Ireland’s Department of Health which covers the emergency services. The union has been asked by the local fire service to give emergency cover, but is minded not to do so. Each region can negotiate a separate settlement with the union. It is understood that the regional union has not received an increased pay offer. Andy Hearn, the NIFRS’s interim chief fire and rescue officer, said he may be forced to call the Ministry of Defence and ask for troops. “Discussions continue with the Fire Brigades Union to reach clarity about the special arrangements they are prepared to agree for NIFRS which would enable firefighters to respond to certain categories of high-risk calls should a strike go ahead. “Should agreement not be reached with the Fire Brigades Union, the need to request military aid to civil authorities from the Ministry of Defence will be progressed,” he said. Civil servants are concerned there are not enough managers, trained temporary staff and non-unionised firefighters to provide cover for emergencies. Government sources said “several hundred” extra staff would be needed to ensure an adequate service could be provided during a strike. When asked if troops would be called in, a spokesperson for Northern Ireland’s health department said “all options are open”. They said the department had been liaising with the NIFRS on contingency options. “The department has not requested back-up from the Ministry of Defence, however all options remain under consideration.” Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the FBU, said the union remained open to talking to the authorities in Northern Ireland, including the NIFRS. “We are confident we will win the ballots. We will have to receive a better offer than we have so far,” he said. “We registered our pay claim in May 2022. It’s outrageous that, eight months on, we still do not have an acceptable offer from our employers … The answer is for fire service employers to urgently make a new offer to significantly increase the pay of all firefighters across the country.” British troops left Northern Ireland in 2007, following approximately 3,600 killings during the Troubles. Since then, members of the armed forces have returned in low-key roles and army medics worked in clinics in Northern Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic. Troops helped to provide cover for firefighters in the country during a strike in 2002. Soldiers drove fire engines and were given police escorts and protection when called out to jobs. About 1,200 army personnel have been drafted in to help during previous public sector strikes, including during industrial action by Border Force and ambulance staff in the lead up to Christmas.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/26/troops-may-be-called-into-northern-ireland-if-firefighters-strike;guardian;politics;1044
5797;5797;Douglas Luiz delights Aston Villa and seals victory over error-strewn Spurs;2023-01-01T16:20:20Z;['Simon Mail'];['Premier League', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Aston Villa', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"The mood at Tottenham is never far from turning sour and the restless natives made their feelings plain after an unhappy start to the new year brought a dispiriting home defeat. Aston Villa struck the first blow after a mistake from the returning Hugo Lloris, with Emiliano Buendía taking advantage, before Douglas Luiz finished off a sharp move to continue their progress under Unai Emery.
Spurs supporters have never appeared to buy into Antonio Conte’s pragmatic approach and this dismal loss – greeted by vociferous boos from the masses – will do little to quieten talk of a change of coach with the Italian’s contract running only until the end of the season. Tottenham’s lack of attacking guile was starkly laid bare with Conte likely to need fresh ammunition in the January window if he is to guide them to another top-four finish. The joyous scenes elsewhere in north London, during Arsenal’s ascent to the top of the table, has only -deepened the gloom surrounding Spurs after their fourth defeat in the past seven Premier League games. Conte made four changes from the team that drew at Brentford, with Cristian Romero making his first appearance since his role in Argentina’s World Cup triumph. Romero and Ben Davies returned to the defence with Eric Dier and Japhet Tanganga demoted to the bench. Lloris also made his first start since returning from France’s run to the final in Qatar. Bryan Gil was handed his first league start and the influential winger Dejan Kulusevski, out with a muscle injury, was sorely missed.
Emery selected the same team that lost at home to Liverpool on Boxing Day, with the World Cup winner Emiliano Martínez on the bench and the goalkeeper Robin Olsen keeping his place after the maverick Argentinian returned to training on Friday. Villa created the first opportunity with a long ball releasing Ollie Watkins and the striker cut inside but dragged his low shot harmlessly wide. Spurs responded and their first sight of goal came from an unlikely source, Matt Doherty nutmegging Tyrone Mings, but the defender’s effort was deflected out for a corner off Boubacar Kamara. Tottenham were struggling to create openings, with Villa content to sit deep and frustrate. The game needed something to spark it into life and Romero’s lunging tackle on Watkins resulted in a brief skirmish between the teams and a yellow card for the Spurs defender.
Villa’s gameplan appeared to be working effectively with the onus on Spurs to open them up and the home fans were starting to become impatient as the half progressed. Ashley Young had already been on the receiving end of a strong challenge from Davies and a further lunge by the Spurs defender on the Villa veteran resulted in another booking. Young’s apparently everlasting energy was underlined before the break with the 37-year-old flinging himself on the goalline to prevent Harry Kane’s header, after a cross from Ivan Perisic, from opening the scoring. Son Heung-min floated in an ambitious attempt from a free-kick on the right edge of the penalty area but Olsen was safely behind it. At the other end, sightings were rare for Villa but Buendía curled a long-range shot past Lloris’s far post in a first half starved of attacking craft. Villa made the perfect start to the second half as they pounced to stun Spurs. Douglas Luiz’s long-range shot was not dealt with by Lloris, the goalkeeper parrying straight to Watkins, who set up Buendía for a low finish into the unguarded net. It was the 10th consecutive game in which Tottenham had conceded the opening goal but there was no comeback this time. Spurs looked for an immediate response but Perisic could only blast over the bar after controlling Yves Bissouma’s lofted ball. Conte’s attacking options from the bench were limited but he acted just after the hour by introducing Ryan Sessegnon in place of Gil. Kane had been afforded precious few opportunities and the frustrated striker could only lash a strike off target after a knockdown from Son.
Villa were increasingly growing in confidence and stamped their authority on the match with an exquisitely taken second goal. John McGinn chipped the ball over the static Spurs defence for Douglas Luiz and the Brazil midfielder controlled the ball and flicked a finish beyond Lloris’s flailing arms. It was the seventh successive league match in which Spurs had conceded at least two goals but their lack of creativity was the greater concern as they failed to put Olsen under any pressure. Emery’s team were playing with conviction, with a third goal almost arriving but the impressive Douglas Luiz’s shot was held by Lloris. Villa finished with a swagger, as Emery extended his unbeaten record against Tottenham to four league matches including his time in charge at Arsenal. A third win in four league games under Emery is a strong return after his October arrival at Villa but for Conte the storm clouds are gathering.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/01/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report;guardian;sports;5797
5235;5235;Cruises, crowds and fragile ecosystems: the delicate dance of Antarctic tourism;2023-01-04T23:22:52Z;['Peter Hannam'];['Antarctica', 'Polar regions', 'Travel', 'Cruises', 'Environment', 'Antarctica holidays', 'Conservation', 'Wildlife'];;"Down at the bottom of the Earth during this southern summer, a delicate dance is under way each day, as captains of cruise ships struggle to keep their vessels out of one another’s sight and so preserve the icy continent’s image of wilderness for their customers. “It’s a very orchestrated ballet as these tourist ships come and go,” says Dana Bergstrom, an ecologist with the Australian Antarctic Division. “There’s a type of cognitive dissonance where visitors pretend they are the only ones in Antarctica.” The region is home to rich but delicate ecosystems, many of which have been isolated from the rest of the world by the Southern Ocean for 30m years. Its remarkable natural appeal – enhanced by the novelty of fewer than one million people ever having visited – makes Antarctica an increasingly attractive tourist destination.
This summer a record 106,000 tourists will visit, up from 74,000 in 2019-20, the last pre-Covid season, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). “An Antarctica cruise is the ultimate journey,” the website of the tour operator Chimu promises. “Filled with awe-inspiring wildlife encounters and sensory experiences of indescribable beauty. To see Antarctica is to experience your place in the world from a whole new perspective.” Hanne Nielsen, a lecturer in Antarctic law and governance at the University of Tasmania, spent five seasons guiding visitors to the Antarctic peninsula and the sub-Antarctic islands administered by New Zealand. She says the opening of the schedule each year triggers “a mad scramble to book the different slots” by operators trying to secure landings at the permitted sites. “Antarctica is somewhere that’s remote and pristine and far away,” Nielsen says. “If you see a whole lot of other vessels, whether they’re fishing vessels or tour vessels, that can damage that illusion. “Vessels will try to stay away from each other, around the corner,” she says. “There is an element of choreography involved as it is with any tourism product that’s delivered.”
Peter Carey, a global fellow at the Wilson Centre’s Polar Institute who has spent decades as a researcher and a tour group lecturer, counted 42 cruise ships of various sizes in the region on one recent morning. In 2020, operators ordered 29 new expedition-style cruise ships for delivery within three years, adding to the 40 or so in service, Carey wrote in an article that year.
“The important step is to actually understand what the cumulative impact [of increased tourism] is and to use that information to make sound regulatory management decisions,” Carey says. Bergstrom understands the public interest. But she is concerned about the potential threats to Antarctica’s ecology, which she detailed in a recent paper. The continent’s long history of evolutionary isolation means its biological diversity is much less than that of the Arctic. And Bergstrom says the expanding range of tourism offerings – from kayaking and snowshoeing to an annual marathon on King George Island between Chilean and Chinese research bases – suggests tourism has gone “from nature-based to ego-based tourism, to test your testosterone in Antarctica”. “Tourism is getting more and more extreme,” she says. “On this scale, it is not sustainable.”
Are visitor caps the answer? Restrictions imposed by the Antarctic Treaty signatory nations – now numbering 54 – limit land-based visits to about 200 hectares, stretched over a region almost as large as France. The treaty regulates issues such as waste disposal, marine pollution, commercial sealing and commercial fishing, but as yet there is no annex specifically addressing tourism. For now, all activities undertaken in Antarctica by signatory parties need a permit. Tour operators must complete an environmental evaluation demonstrating their activities can be managed safely and with no more than a minor or transitory impact, Carey says. Separate studies of environmental impacts, such as on penguin colonies, have so far “found an absence of negative impact from visitors”. But Carey says the need for specialised rules will inevitably grow as tourism expands, raising the risk of accidents and the introduction of unwanted invasive species or pathogens such as avian influenza that could prove devastating for wildlife. Caps on visitor numbers to individual sites and the overall region are likely to be part of an eventual solution, he says.
Most tourists now take eight-to-14-day cruises from the Argentine port of Ushuaia, the closest to the Antarctic peninsula. Motivations of visitors vary greatly. For some it will be their final trip, for others it’s “just another place that people go”, after ticking off the Galápagos Islands or some other exotic locale. Luxury is increasingly the norm.
The centenary of the end of the “heroic era” in 2022 fanned interest in explorers such as Scott, Amundsen, Shackleton and Mawson. The 250th anniversary of British explorer James Cook’s voyages – the first known to enter the Antarctic circle – will also be marked this month. Whatever the lure, guides often find their enthusiasm for the region inspires visitors. Nielsen’s PhD on Brand Antarctica, soon to be published in book form, highlights Antarctica’s place in the popular imagination, with its mix of “heroism, extremity, purity, fragility”.
“You’ve got this whole idea … about Antarctica being a place that is life-changing,” Nielsen says. But how to balance that against the fossil fuels burned to reach the region, damage to mosses, disturbance from construction of infrastructure and invasive species? Tour groups encourage visitors to take part in citizen science projects, such as watching whales and other animals or monitoring water quality and clouds, and even to become defacto “ambassadors” for the continent. That “grants them some social licence for that tourism operation”, she says. Gina Greer, IAATO’s executive director, says the industry is well aware of the responsibilities it carries to keep its impact to a minimum. For example, ships sailing beyond 60 degrees south cannot burn dirty heavy fuel oil. “[We’re] always looking to evolve our practices, and to address new and emerging things that are coming out,” Greer says. She cites IAATO’s new protocols to curb the spread of avian flu, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of wild birds in the high Arctic and elsewhere, in addition to the usual requirements that clothes and boots of visitors are cleaned and checked for seeds before landings. Visitors will not be permitted to sit, kneel or lie on the ground or snow, nor leave any equipment. They must also keep at least five metres from wildlife “where it can be safely done”, the amended rules state. Among the challenges will be monitoring vessels from operators that are not IATTO members. Two such cruise ships have been identified, and although they are not scheduled to land visitors, the organisation will “keep an open communication line with them” to make sure they operate within agreed protocols, Greer says. She concedes that visitor caps may come, “but it’s really for the treaty party members to make that decision”. Meg Hall, a manager with Chimu Adventures, says many people visit the area already knowing “how fragile our world is”, and the experience many have being “amongst these beautiful creatures who aren’t afraid of humans … is really something quite extraordinary”. “They come back absolute advocates for our planet, which is a big win,” Hall says. The tourism industry is careful to mimic the approach adopted by national research teams, such as taking away all waste. “Nothing stays in Antarctica,” Hall says. “It’s an incredibly pristine location – it’s one of those rare places in the world. We intend to keep it that way.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/cruises-crowds-and-fragile-ecosystems-the-delicate-dance-of-antarctic-tourism;guardian;environment;5235
6554;6554;Utah father Michael Haight kills wife, five children and mother-in-law before shooting himself, police say;Friday 6 January 2023 16:18, UK;[];['united states', 'utah', 'crime'];['say', 'father', 'utah', 'children', 'community', 'shooting', 'michael', 'kills', 'haight', 'school', 'divorce', 'wrote', 'enoch', 'wife', 'motherinlaw', 'theyre', 'city'];"A father killed his wife, five children and his mother-in-law before turning the gun on himself, police said.

Michael Haight, 42, shot his wife Tausha, 40, weeks after she filed for divorce, officers in Utah said.

He is also thought to have killed their three daughters, aged 7, 12 and 17, their two sons aged, 4 and 7, and Mrs Haight's mother Gail Earl, 78, on Wednesday before shooting himself.

Mrs Haight had filed for divorce from her husband on December 21 after 20 years of marriage.

Authorities had attended the property in recent years over a domestic disturbance, Jackson Ames, police chief in the city of Enoch, said yesterday.

Police have not confirmed that he was motivated by his wife's divorce.

James Park, a lawyer who represented Mrs Haight in the divorce case, said she had not expressed any fear that her husband would physically hurt her.

Neighbours in the town of 8,000 gathered to pray and sing hymns outside the property yesterday.

President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said they are ""mourning with the Enoch City, Utah community"" after the ""tragic shooting"".

2384;2384;Artist asks British Museum to return Assyrian treasure to Iraq in swap;2023-01-20T06:00:31Z;['Matthew Weaver'];['British Museum', 'Heritage', 'Sculpture', 'Fourth plinth', 'Culture', 'Iraq', 'London', 'Tate Modern', 'UK news', 'Art', 'Museums'];;The Iraqi-American artist Michael Rakowitz has proposed in a letter to the British Museum that it return one of its ancient Assyrian treasures to Iraq in exchange for the donation of his fourth plinth sculpture to the UK. Rakowitz’s contemporary interpretation of an Assyrian winged bull, known as a lamassu, decorated in tins of date syrup, appeared on the plinth in Trafalgar Square from 2018 to 2020. He has tentatively agreed to gift the sculpture to Tate Modern on the basis that it shares custody with Iraq. But, as part of the deal, he said that the British Museum should return one of its two Assyrian lamassu sculptures, which were discovered in Nineveh by the Victorian archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard. Rakowitz said returning one of these treasures would help replace a 700BC lamassu, which had stood at the Nergal Gate in Nineveh. It was left in place by Layard but deliberately destroyed by Islamic State fighters in a raid on Mosul Museum in 2015. Rakowitz’s proposal is expected to be on the agenda of a visit to London next month by Iraq’s new minister of culture, Ahmed Fakkak, when he is expected to be given a tour of the British Museum. In a letter to the British Museum, setting out his bargain, Rakowitz said: “As I pondered my gift to the nation of Great Britain, I began to fantasise that it could be attached to a second gift: the return of one of the British Museum’s lamassu to the country of Iraq, to replace what was destroyed by Daesh [or Islamic State]”. The letter went on: “Given all that has been destroyed in Iraq, and the intersection of that destruction with the west’s insatiable appetite for the objects of the east while not always, if ever, extending that concern to its people, this return of an original would be more than just restitutive. It would be restorative.” Rakowitz said the British Museum initially dismissed the idea when he first suggested it in 2020. He was told the museum had helped to produce replicas of the originals. Rakowitz said: “I thought to myself, this is fucking insane. Where’s the dignity of sending back these things that are basically a husk of the original.” But since then other experts at the museum have been more sympathetic, Rakowitz claimed. He said: “I’ve had a generally good relationship with some of the people in the British Museum, who are not ventriloquised by the overall attitude that things can’t go back. The discussions and demands are about breaking through some of the language that protects these objects and institutions.” Rakowitz said Tate Modern was also lobbying behind the scenes to try to make it happen. He said: “The Tate informally agreed that they would put pressure on the British Museum to return one of the lamassu. The leadership of the Tate was very sympathetic to it.” When he approached officials in Iraq’s foreign ministry about exhibiting his sculpture, Rakowitz said they were keen to see the ancient lamassu returned to Iraq. “They loved the lamassu,” he said referring to his work, “but they also didn’t want to let the United Kingdom off the hook, and that they wanted the real ones back. London now have one lamassu too many so one of them needs to go back to Iraq.” Eleanor Robson, a professor of ancient Middle Eastern history at University College London, said the British Museum appeared to be softening its stance on returning treasures to the country of their origin, amid discussions about the future of Parthenon marbles. “The mood music seems to be changing,” she said. Robson, who is also chief investigator at the Nahrein Network on post-conflict cultural recovery in Iraq and the host’s of Fakkak visit, said: “The refurbishment of Mosul museum is very high on his agenda – it was very badly damaged by Daesh. There’s a lot of planning about what might go inside it. One possibility is that Michael’s lamassu might come and visit. It will be for the minister to decide.” It is unclear whether the minister will press for the original lamassu to be returned to Iraq. Robson added: “It’s good that we’ve got people like Michael, coming to stir things up and getting the debate going.” The British Museum would not commit to handing back either of its lamussu to Iraq, but did not rule out loan deals. A spokesperson said: “We were closely involved in supporting Iraqi requests for replica lamassu for the exterior of the university library in Mosul and, more recently, the Basrah Museum, where we have been working in partnership for over a decade. Future collaborations may well include cooperation on exhibitions and loans, which the museum would welcome.”;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/20/british-museum-artist-assyrian-return-iraq-michael-rakowitz;guardian;entertainment & culture;2384
3884;3884; Woman ordered to repay employer after software shows ‘time theft’;2023-01-12T16:17:56Z;['Leyland Cecco'];['Canada', 'Americas', 'World news'];;"A Canadian woman has been ordered by a civil tribunal to compensate her former employer for “time theft” after she was caught misrepresenting hours worked by controversial tracking software. Karlee Besse, who worked remotely as an accountant in British Columbia, initially claimed she was fired from her job without cause last year and sought C$5,000 ($3,729; £3,066) in compensation – both in unpaid wages and severance. But the company, Reach CPA, told the tribunal Beese had logged more than 50 hours that “did not appear to have spent on work-related tasks”. Reach said it installed employee-tracking software called TimeCamp on Besse’s work laptop after it found her assigned files were over budget and behind schedule, a strategy companies are increasingly taking in the era of remote work. The software tracks how long a document is open, how the employee uses the document and logs the time as work. Weeks later, the company said an analysis “identified irregularities between her timesheets and the software usage logs”.
While Besse told the tribunal she found the program “difficult” and worried it didn’t differentiate between work and personal use, the company demonstrated how TimeCamp automatically makes those distinctions, separating time logs for work from activities such as using the laptop to stream movies and television shows. Besse said she had printed documents to work on, but did not tell Reach she was using hard copy because she “knew they wouldn’t want to hear that” and she was afraid of repercussions. The company said that the software also tracks printing – and that few documents had been logged as printed. It also said any work from the printed documents would have needed to be input into the company’s software, which never happened. According to a video meeting between Besse and the company when they confronted her with the discrepancies, she told her manager “you can’t fight the time”, admitting she had “plugged time to files that I didn’t touch and that wasn’t right or appropriate in any way or fashion … and so for that I’m really sorry”. The judge tossed out Besse’s claim of wrongful termination and ordered her to pay C$2,459.89, both in returned wages and as a part of previous advance she had received from the company.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/12/canada-woman-time-theft-tracking-software;guardian;entertainment & culture;3884

Number 10 has confirmed two new green freeports will be established in Scotland by the end of 2023, backed by £52m in government funding.

Downing Street said the green freeports will help to level up Scotland and bring new, high-skilled jobs to Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth.

It is expected that they will bring an estimated £10.8bn of private and public investment and create over 75,000 new jobs.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""Working together delivers results – and I am absolutely delighted that the first minister and I can announce the delivery of our shared ambition for people in Scotland today with not one but two excellent Green Freeport areas.

""In extending the benefits of freeports to Scotland, we are unleashing the potential of the Firth of Forth and Inverness and Cromarty Firth – backing the delivery of thousands of high-quality green jobs for future generations, as we continue to make gains on our commitments to transition to net zero.""

Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, added that Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are ""fantastic areas for these new Green Freeports to set up"".

They will ensure ""the benefits are felt right across Scotland"", he said.

""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond.""

5468;5468;Border Force strikes could be extended to Dover and other ports;2023-01-03T18:46:14Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Industrial action', 'UK news', 'Mark Serwotka'];;"Border Force strikes over pay and conditions could be extended to ports including Dover within weeks, the Guardian can disclose. The Public and Commercial Services Union has recently discussed the possibility of targeting major ports of entry in south-east England after eight days of industrial action concentrated on airports. Business leaders have previously warned that a strike among members at Dover could bring freight services in and out of the UK to a standstill. It comes as the government refuses to budge to boost public sector pay for 2022/2023, amid action among ambulance drivers, nurses and rail workers. The PCS union insists that “all options are open” after receiving a mandate for industrial action from 100,000 members in 124 government departments and other bodies. So far, 6,000 have taken action. Sources at the UK’s biggest civil servants’ union confirmed that action in ports has been discussed internally. A spokesperson said: “We have a six-month mandate for action, so all that needs to happen at Dover and elsewhere is we must give the employer two weeks’ notice.” It comes after the union’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, warned of a “huge escalation” of action in January. More than 1,000 Border Force workers at London Gatwick, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Glasgow, and Heathrow airports went on strike after PCS announced a rejection of a 2% pay rise offer. Union members at Newhaven port in East Sussex also withdrew their labour. About 10,000 trucks cross the Channel every day with regular pick ups for perishable food from big distribution centres in north France and Belgium. The PCS has more than 2,000 members in the south-east who work at ports of entry including passport controls at Dover and Calais, the EuroTunnel entrance in Coquelles, Manston processing centre and Western Jet Foil, which is where people arriving on small boats are first landed in the UK. An extension of a strike could affect immigration, where passports are checked; customs, where lorries and freight are examined for stowaways, drugs, and guns and to check paperwork; the importation of thousands of tonnes of goods into the UK every day; and boats that patrol the coastline and have recently been picking up tens of thousands of people seeking asylum. It is understood that it is highly unlikely that the union would propose strike action on boats patrolling the Channel, because of the risk to lives. During the Christmas strikes, the government drafted in more than 800 military personnel and civil servants to staff entry gates and insisted that there would be no compromise on security. However, the Guardian disclosed that soldiers and sailors working at passport check points had only received between three and five days of training. Leaked emails showed that the temporary staff were not authorised to stop people they suspected of criminal activity or those who were the victims of modern slavery. Amid government claims that security had not been compromised, it also emerged that only nine people were stopped at passport control and held at Heathrow over three strike days from 23 to 25 December, compared with 189 people over the same three days in 2021 – a 95% drop. The government has claimed that on only seven occasions out of hundreds of flights at the six airports over the eight days of the strikes were passengers forced to wait more than two hours. Home Office sources were reported last week as saying that if the strikes were escalated to seaports such as Dover, they would have to train more people. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with the union’s decision to continue strike action and the inconvenience this will cause to the public and businesses. “We have comprehensive contingency plans in place and continue to work closely with partners and industry to manage its impact, whilst ensuring we can continue to deliver vital services to the public.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/03/border-force-strikes-could-be-extended-to-dover-and-other-ports;guardian;business & economy;5468

Mark Rowland, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, called the cost of living crisis a ""public mental health emergency"".

He said: ""We need good quality sleep. We need to be able to do things we enjoy. We need exercise. We need to be able to spend time with people we love.

""We need to do more than simply survive to have good mental health and well-being: we must thrive if we are to prevent mental health problems developing.

591;591;The 100-day test for new leaders and why Rishi Sunak is flunking it | Andrew Rawnsley;2023-01-29T08:30:43Z;['Andrew Rawnsley'];['Rishi Sunak', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;"This week, Rishi Sunak will clock up – celebrate wouldn’t be the mot juste – his 100th day at Number 10. It is an important milestone for a leader when judgments about his performance start to crystallise. Tory MPs gave him the top job in reaction to the manic chaos generated by his predecessors and he sold himself as the doctor who would cure the maladies that Liz Truss and Boris Johnson had inflicted on the country. He would restore confidence in the government’s fiscal competence after the lunacies of the brief reign of Mad Queen Liz and rebuild trust in the government’s ethical integrity after the moral squalor presided over by Bad King Boris. On the first mission, Mr Sunak has succeeded to the limited extent that financial markets think Britain is now under more reliable management, but at the price of jacking up taxes to an even higher level and while presiding over waves of industrial unrest the like of which we’ve not seen in this country for decades. It ought to have been more straightforward for him to draw a line under the degeneracy of the Johnson era. When it comes to integrity in public life, the prime minister is the prime decision-maker. He writes the rules about how ministers should behave and he is the chief invigilator of their conduct. He hires and he fires. He has the power to demand high standards, to ensure that they will be policed robustly and to remove transgressors. This doesn’t require government spending - it requires a moral compass and the determination to do the right thing. He also had an incentive to disinfect the Tory party because he arrived at Number 10 promising a purist regime. “This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level,” he declared in his first speech outside Number 10. “Trust is earned and I will earn yours.”
I thought at the time that only one of two things could be true. If Mr Sunak were serious, he was going to give the Tory party the shock treatment it needed by demanding an end to the debasement of standards it had indulged for too long. Or he would flunk it and there would be a continuation of the sleaze that is historically the product of protracted periods of Conservative rule. An early sign that he would flunk it was his foot-dragging about naming a new adviser on ministerial conduct, a position left vacant after the two previous holders resigned in disgust with Mr Johnson. When Mr Sunak eventually made the appointment, the role went to Sir Laurie Magnus, a former banker and quango head. The authenticity of the independence of the “independent adviser” was left moot because Mr Sunak retained a veto over what he could investigate and maintained the right to ignore any sanctions he might propose. Sir Laurie has already been tasked with one inquiry – into Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Sunak’s 100th day in office will be marked with the Tories once again swirled in a poison cloud of allegations relating to rule-breaking, conflicts of interest, bullying of officials and money, all so horribly familiar from the Johnson years. We are not talking about the misdeeds of some miscreant backbenchers that Tories can try to shrug off as unrepresentative of the party as a whole. Those under investigation are the chairman of the Tory party, the Conservative-appointed chairman of the BBC and the deputy prime minister. The latter, Dominic Raab, is the subject of an investigation by Adam Tolley KC into many formal complaints that he mistreated officials in several departments. The public appointments commission is looking into Richard Sharp, the BBC chair and Tory donor, who was put forward for the role at the broadcaster by Mr Johnson only weeks after Mr Sharp facilitated discussions about securing an undisclosed £800,000 loan for the then prime minister with a Canadian multimillionaire as the guarantor. After terms were agreed, the three men reportedly dined à trois at Chequers. Neither Mr Johnson nor Mr Sharp thought it appropriate to mention that some might see a conflict of interest. The party chairman, Mr Zahawi, has finally admitted, only under intense pressure and after previously threatening libel actions against those who brought this issue to light, that he was obliged to pay a penalty, believed to be in excess of £1m, as part of a £5m settlement with HMRC for unpaid tax. The head of the HMRC has since commented that there are no penalties for “innocent errors”. Most voters will not follow every corkscrew turn of each affair, but they will get the overall impression that the reek of Tory scandal continues to sweat from this government.
The consensus among Conservative MPs is that Mr Zahawi’s career is circling the plughole. If Sir Laurie’s inquiries somehow conclude that he’s in the all clear, it will be rightfully ridiculed as a whitewash. If Sir Laurie finds him in breach of the ministerial code, but the prime minister chooses not to fire the party chair, Mr Sunak will make himself utterly risible. So even Tory MPs who are well-disposed to Mr Zahawi cannot see him surviving. Waiting for Sir Laurie to pronounce is only prolonging the damage to their already shredded reputation. Some Conservative MPs are bewildered that their leader was so slow to register that this scandal would generate a ferocious furore. Fabulously rich Tories trying to shield their family wealth from the taxman is a subject on which Mr Sunak is personally vulnerable. Sir Keir Starmer punched that bruise at the most recent session of prime minister’s questions when he taunted the Tory leader: “We know why he was reluctant to ask (Zahawi) about his family finances and tax avoidance.” Outrage about money scandals in politics is always fiercer when the public are feeling the pinch in their own lives. The Zahawi affair is the more toxic for the government when taxes on much less affluent folk are being ratcheted up, voters are in the jaws of a cost of living crunch and there are widespread strikes in essential services because the government says the exchequer doesn’t have the money to give better pay rises to nurses and other public sector staff. His handling of this has made Mr Sunak look indecisive and clueless. The first reports about Mr Zahawi being investigated by HMRC emerged last summer. Much of the digging has been done by the tax lawyer Dan Neidle, who is to be highly commended for refusing to be intimidated by menacing letters from Mr Zahawi’s lawyers. So plenty was already in the public domain before the prime minister made him Tory party chair. “The issues in question occurred before I was prime minister,” is the best defence Mr Sunak has managed to muster. “No issues were raised with me.” This implies that he failed to get the full truth out of the other man before he appointed him and/or his civil servants didn’t do a proper job vetting his suitability to sit in the cabinet. That makes the prime minister look too feeble to get a grip on his responsibilities, the line that is being remorselessly prosecuted by Labour. It is rare now for Sir Keir to deliver a sentence mentioning the Tory leader that does not include the word “weak”. The Zahawi affair fits into a pattern of making dreadful judgments about personnel. He gave a seat in cabinet to “Sir” Gavin Williamson even though he had been removed from the top table twice before – only for “Sir” Gavin then to be compelled to resign, pursued by complaints of bullying and accusations from a former deputy that he employed “unethical and immoral” methods when he was chief whip. He brought back Suella Braverman as home secretary just six days after she had been forced to quit for security breaches that violated the ministerial code. He restored Mr Raab to the position of deputy prime minister after the fall of Ms Truss, a choice that is going to blow back on the prime minister very badly if the inquiry into Mr Raab doesn’t clear him of misconduct towards civil servants. This is not how Mr Sunak hoped to be assessed on his 100th day at Number 10. He looks a terrible judge of character, incapable of mastering his government and untrue to his promise to restore “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. The scandals keep coming and he seems incapable of stemming them. Under Boris Johnson, it was “one rule for everyone else and no rules for us”. Under Rishi Sunak, it appears to be plus ça change.

1539;1539;‘Tolls discriminate’: western Sydney residents face $60 a day levy to drive into CBD;2023-01-24T14:00:03Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Transport', 'Sydney', 'New South Wales politics', 'Australia news'];;"Ammar’s daily commute from Bankstown to Barangaroo in Sydney’s CBD can cost him almost $60 a day, an amount he describes as “ridiculous”. “It feels like we are paying a tax for living in western Sydney – and … the further out west you are, the more you pay.” On Tuesday, the NSW government announced the launch of its toll relief scheme, which offers 40% rebates of up to $750 to motorists who spend more than $375 a year on tolls. But for Ammar, who spends up to $290 a week on tolls, it barely makes a dent.
“I know there is a rebate, but they only pay a small portion and you are ultimately paying it upfront anyway,” Ammar said. A comparison of commutes of similar distance for people living east and south of the city shows toll costs are almost half those faced by people living in the west. Commuters from the north face tolls that are almost a third of the cost, according the NSW government’s toll calculator. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For example, a commute from Hornsby to Barangaroo would cost $10.45 one way via the M2, while commutes to Barangaroo from Cronulla in the south or Randwick in the east would each cost $15.44, compared with $28.74 from Bankstown.
“It’s $29 one-way, and if you think about it that’s one meal. When you add on things like petrol and traffic, it’s almost not worth it,” Ammar said. Ammar is a senior risk professional and, due to a knee reconstruction, is unable to take public transport.
“The car is the only option for me, and it feels like it’s so much. There’s also no real easy way to get to Barangaroo without the Cross-City tunnel, so it all adds up.” The state government opened the new M4-M8 tunnel ahead of schedule last Friday, with the new link cutting commute times from the west to the east of the city. But the tunnel adds yet another toll – capped at $11.11 after around 16km of driving – to Sydney’s already extensive network. The president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, Barry Calvert, said the hefty tolls were having a particular impact on people in western Sydney because it isn’t the “wealthy part of Sydney”. “Not everyone can afford to live in Bondi or Manly. We’d all love to live over there and hop on a ferry every morning, but we can’t. It’s not always people’s choice to live this far out, and the tolls do discriminate on that basis.” Calvert said public transport options in western Sydney were not a “viable alternative,” and that many people feel forced on to the roads. “I know that I would definitely use public transport and everyone else would if it was there, but it’s not there. And so we’re getting punished. “Most people who are now living further out, in the north-west or the south-west down towards Camden, have to drive an hour or so to get on to a main rail line. And then you have to park your car, which usually costs more money.” Tolls on WestConnex increased by 6.1% from 1 January. If they were to rise much further, the soaring cost of living would make it difficult for Ammar to continue to justify using toll roads.
“There is a significant cut in terms of timing, but there is always traffic … Sometimes I just take the long route back to avoid the costs and wait in the traffic,” he said. The NSW minister for metropolitan roads, Natalie Ward, said the government’s new rebate scheme, will “more than double” the number of drivers eligible for toll relief. The rebate is in addition to the M5 south-west cashback scheme, which allows NSW drivers to claim back the value of the tolls for a portion of the M5, excluding GST.
But NSW Labor said the rebate is not enough – and that the premier, Dominic Perrottet, has “given up” on toll reform after the delayed release of a review of Sydney’s toll roads. “The fact this review is being hidden is an admission that tolls are out of control in Sydney,” the shadow minister for roads, John Graham, said.
The chair of urbanism at the University of Sydney, Prof Nicole Gurran, said economic disparities play a large role in the impact of Sydney’s high tolls. “There are social and economic disadvantages associated with being forced to commute a long way to work, because the cost of accessibility to work is priced into the housing market,” she said. “That [people] are also forced to [commute] by car because of a lack of sufficient transport options is an equity issue that both sides of government should take very seriously.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/24/tolls-discriminate-western-sydney-residents-face-60-a-day-levy-to-drive-into-cbd;guardian;business & economy;1539
6635;6635;Virginia teacher shot in classroom by pupil, 6, 'showing signs of improvement' in hospital;Sunday 8 January 2023 05:29, UK;[];['virginia'];['shot', 'shootings', 'teacher', 'jones', 'pupil', 'zwerner', 'improvement', 'shooting', 'hospital', 'injured', 'school', 'classroom', 'virginia', 'sixyearold', 'showing', 'im', 'young', 'signs'];"Teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot by a six-year-old pupil in the US, is ""showing signs of improvement"".

Ms Zwerner, in her 30s, was left critically injured after being shot in class by the boy during an altercation on Friday - and it was not accidental, according to police.

Phillip Jones, the mayor of the city of Newport News in Virginia, where the incident happened, described it as a ""red flag for the country"".

He said the condition of the teacher at Richneck Elementary School is ""trending in a positive direction"" as she remains in hospital.

Ms Zwerner graduated from Virginia's James Madison University in 2020. A statement from its president said they were ""deeply saddened by the tragic incident,"" describing it as ""an incredibly difficult time"".

Police initially said the teacher's injures were ""life-threatening"" but said a senior officer had met her on Saturday and ""she has improved and is currently listed in stable condition"".

Chief Steve Drew said the shooting did not appear to be an accident and that it was isolated to the single victim. He said the student and teacher had known each other in a classroom setting.

""We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,"" he told reporters.

He said the boy had a handgun in the classroom, and investigators were trying to work out where he got it.

Mr Jones said: ""I do think that after this event, there is going to be a nationwide discussion on how these sorts of things can be prevented.""

Newport News public schools superintendent George Parker III said: ""I'm in awe, and I'm in shock, and I'm disheartened.""

Boy is too young to face trial

School officials have said there will be no classes at Richneck on Monday.

Virginia law does not allow six-year-olds to be tried as adults.

In addition, a six-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty.

A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent's custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services.

Mr Jones would not say where the boy is being held, but added: ""We are ensuring he has all the services that he currently needs right now.""

One angry British mother, living in the area, spoke to reporters outside the school, and said it was time for change.

""Let's do something. Let's change it.

""You've got a beautiful country, you have beautiful people, but what's the problem? Guns!"" she said.

""I am only here because my husband is in the military, otherwise I would not have come to this country.""

Young children accessing guns 'is rising'

Professor Daniel Webster, who studies gun violence at Johns Hopkins University, said a six-year-old shooting a teacher at school was extremely unusual.

But he said his research shows that instances of young children accessing loaded guns and shooting themselves or others unintentionally in homes or other settings are rising.

""A six-year-old gaining access to a loaded gun and shooting him/herself or someone else, sadly, is not so rare,"" he said.

Researcher David Riedman, who founded a database that tracks US school shootings dating back to 1970, said it was ""not something the legal system is really designed or positioned to deal with"".

He said he was only aware of three other shootings caused by six-year-old pupils in the time period he has studied; a fatal shooting of a fellow pupil in 2000 in Michigan and shootings that injured other students in 2011 in Texas and 2021 in Mississippi.

Mr Riedman said he only knows of one other instance of a student younger than that causing gunfire at a school, in which a five-year-old brought a gun to a Tennessee school in 2013 and accidentally discharged it.

6912;6912;Golden Globes 2023: A-listers return to ceremony - as host addresses diversity controversy;Wednesday 11 January 2023 04:51, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['golden globes', 'margot robbie', 'steven spielberg'];['host', 'diversity', 'controversy', 'took', 'alisters', 'return', 'golden', 'ceremony', 'pic', 'tv', 'black', 'award', 'best', 'im', 'globes', 'addresses', '2023', 'awards'];"Hollywood stars have returned to the Golden Globes in force - but host Jerrod Carmichael wasted no time addressing the diversity controversy that has overshadowed the awards.

On a night that saw big wins for TV shows The White Lotus, Abbott Elementary and House Of The Dragon - with The Banshees of Inisherin and Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans taking home the top film prizes - one of the main talking points ahead of the ceremony had been the question of who would turn up.

Last year's Golden Globes event was held in private, with no TV broadcast and winners announced on social media - and many stars chose not to acknowledge their successes.

It followed a Los Angeles Times expose in 2021 which found that organisers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) had no black members voting for the awards. The investigation also included allegations of inappropriate ""freebies"" influencing votes.

""I'll tell you why I'm here - I'm here because I'm black,"" said US comedian Carmichael as he opened the event in Los Angeles last night.

""This show, the Golden Globe Awards did not air last year, because the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which I won't say they were a racist organisation, but they didn't have a single black member until George Floyd died - do with that information what you will.

""One minute I'm making mint tea at home, the next you're invited to be the black face of an embattled white organisation. Life really comes at you fast.""

He added: ""I took this job assuming they hadn't changed at all. Regardless of whatever the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's past may be, this is an evening where we get to celebrate. And I think this industry deserves evenings like these. And I'm happy to be here.""

The Banshees Of Inisherin won the gong for best film (comedy or musical) - with Colin Farrell named best actor in the same category.

In the drama category, The Fabelmans was crowned the winner - and Spielberg also picked up the award for best director.

For TV, The White Lotus triumphed in the category for best limited series, anthology series or motion picture made for television, while star Jennifer Coolidge took home the award for best supporting actress.

Abbott Elementary took home three awards - best TV comedy or musical, best actress for Quinta Brunson, and best supporting actor for Tyler James Williams.

Cate Blanchett, Kevin Costner and Zendaya were also among the winners in the acting categories, but did not attend the ceremony.

TV writer, director and producer Ryan Murphy, a five-time Golden Globe winner and 16-time nominee, referenced the controversy of last year's show as he received the Carol Burnett special award honouring excellence in television.

He led a standing ovation for Michaela Jae Rodriguez, who last year made history as the first transgender actress to win an award - best actress in a TV drama for her portrayal of ""house mother"" Blanca Rodriguez in his show Pose - as she never got her moment in 2022.

The Globes also honoured Eddie Murphy with a special gong, presenting the star with the Cecil B DeMille career achievement award.

Murphy, known for films including Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor and the Shrek franchise, used his acceptance speech to make reference to Will Smith's infamous slap at the 2022 Oscars.

""I want to let you know that there is a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity, and peace of mind,"" he told the audience. ""There's a blueprint and I followed it my whole career, it's very simple...

""Just do these three things: Pay your taxes. Mind your business, and keep Will Smith's wife's name out of your f****** mouth!""

The awards took a more serious tone with an appearance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, introduced on screen by actor and activist Sean Penn - who has visited Ukraine several times since Russia's invasion almost a year ago.

Mr Zelenskyy told the audience that it was ""clear"" the ""tide was turning"" in the ongoing war in his country, and that Ukraine would be triumphant.

The Golden Globes controversy explained

Last year's event was turned into a ""private event"" at the last minute by the HFPA after it faced heavy criticism over its lack of black members.

Since the fallout, the organisation has been attempting to rebuild the awards' reputation from the top down, adding more than 100 new voters to its voting body, which it says ""is now 52% female, 51.5% racially and ethnically diverse"". For the first time, journalists from other countries can also be part of the mix.

Twenty-one new members joined the HFPA last year, six of whom are black, and membership eligibility was expanded from Los Angeles to anywhere in the United States.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230111051755/http://news.sky.com/story/golden-globes-2023-a-listers-return-to-ceremony-as-host-addresses-diversity-controversy-12784043;skynews;entertainment & culture;1003
4040;4040;‘I’m already sitting in the dark most of the time’: disabled yet pursued over gas bill;2023-01-11T22:15:28Z;['Miles Brignall', 'Clea Skopeliti'];['SSE', 'Energy bills', 'Disability', 'Poverty', 'Household bills', 'Gas', 'Consumer affairs', 'Energy industry', 'Utilities', 'Business', 'Society', 'Money'];;Peter Knight* was registered as disabled and on a list of “vulnerable” customers, but that did not stop the power supplier SSE from turning up at his home in December, threatening to install a prepayment meter. He was handed a debt collection notice for £78 – a portion of his gas arrears – and told they would return with a court-issued warrant and install a prepayment meter in his home if he did not pay. Knight, who is 32, lives on benefits and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder among other conditions, starts to cry as he recounts the experience. The visit came at the end of three weeks of phone calls from SSE, which in 2020 had its retail arm acquired by Ovo, the UK’s third-largest supplier. It is understood Knight had accrued debt balances of more than £400 on his gas account due to non-payment, and he had cancelled his direct debit following the October price cap increase. The company was made aware of his physical impairment and mental ill health and he was advised about seeking financial assistance. Despite repeatedly telling SSE staff that he was already struggling financially, he was given a stark choice, he says – either set up a direct debit with a promise to pay an unaffordable £330 a month, or accept a prepayment meter. He was also charged £33 in late payment and collection fees. When he put them off, the agent turned up at his house. “My universal credit award is £970 a month. My rent is £550. What are people in my situation supposed to do? I’m already sitting in the dark most of the time with the heating off. I don’t know how I’m going to get through this winter with my mental health intact. I was bawling my eyes out yesterday and I’m struggling to sleep,” says Knight, who lives alone in the north-east of England. Under their licence terms, suppliers are not allowed to move customers on to a prepayment meter if they have an illness or disability as they could be harmed if their gas or electricity were cut off. Only after he stood his ground and told the company the situation was pushing him to the edge, did an SSE employee contact him to confirm that as he was vulnerable the company would not be installing a meter unless he requested it. Knight’s debt has now been deferred for 65 working days and SSE has credited him £50 on his account. “They refused to allow me to service my arrears unless I agreed to sign up to a £330 a month direct debit,” he says, adding that this amount appeared to be calculated based on the last tenant’s winter usage, a breach of Ofgem rules. “I suspect that they are subjecting thousands of people to this kind of harassment with no care for the regulations. It’s disgusting.” Following the Guardian’s intervention, SSE listened again to the calls. It has since apologised to Knight. The company calculated new monthly direct debit payments based on his actual usage. The collection and late payment fees were cleared, and a goodwill payment added to his gas account. “We are here to support customers who are worried about their energy bills this winter and provide them with the financial support and advice they need,” SSE said. *Peter Knight is not his real name If you’ve been affected by the issues in this article, you can share your story here.

1245;1245;Eight days, 25 dead: California shaken by string of mass shootings;2023-01-25T19:24:04Z;['Lois Beckett', 'Sam Levin'];['California', 'Monterey Park shooting', 'US news', 'Gun crime', 'US gun control'];;"All the names of the dead from one California mass shooting had not yet been released when the news alerts started again on Monday afternoon: there had been another shooting. There was another gunman at large. Seven more people were dead. Gun violence takes a daily toll in California, but the brutality, scale and pace of the past week has felt different. In the course of just eight days, at least 25 people were killed in four separate mass shootings, defined as any shooting in which at least four people are injured.
The killings – which cut across a big city, a placid Los Angeles suburb, and two small farming towns – have left residents shaken, exhausted and afraid, and renewed calls for some kind of fundamental change. “This proliferation of violence just seems like it’s perpetual,” said Tinisch Hollins, the executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group for survivors of violence. “It’s so common now to hear of mass shootings that they don’t even stay in the headlines. Not even a day later, we’re talking about an entirely different incident. It’s horrifying.” An average of five California residents die from gun homicides each day, but mass-casualty shootings highlight how violence can upend any community in the state, from rural enclaves to quiet suburbs. “At some point, you get tired of ‘thoughts and prayers’. You get tired of writing statements,” said Fernando Rejón, executive director of Urban Peace Institute, a community safety organization founded in California. “And you keep asking yourself, what is going to be the tipping point? After Uvalde and all these recent mass shootings, you think they’ll be the tipping point, and then it’s not.” A Saturday night shooting in Monterey Park, California, America’s first “suburban Chinatown”, targeted a ballroom dance studio popular with elderly Asian American patrons on the eve of the Lunar New Year. Police said they were still trying to understand why the shooter, a 72-year-old Asian American man, had murdered 11 people, and injured nine more, at a studio he had apparently frequented for years.
On Monday afternoon, a 66-year-old Asian American man opened fire on current and former co-workers at two mushroom farms in Half Moon Bay, in northern California, officials said. Some of the killings reportedly took place in front of children who lived nearby, one official said: “For children to witness this is unspeakable,” she said. One person was wounded, and seven people died. Less than four hours after the Half Moon Bay shootings, early on Monday evening, a group of people in Oakland were reportedly filming a music video when shooting broke out near a gas station. An 18-year-old was killed, and four other people were shot, ranging in age from 19 to 56, the East Bay Times reported. The perpetrators remained at large. There appeared to be no limit to the age or vulnerability of the people at risk of being gunned down. Not even a week before the Monterey Park shooting, a 10-month old infant had been shot to death at home in Goshen, a small town in central California, in a shooting that left six people, across five generations of one family, dead. A 72-year-old woman had been shot in her sleep. Sixteen-year-old Alissa Parraz and her son Nycholas had been found together in a ditch outside their home, where it appeared they had been trying to flee the attack. All were shot in the head.
Samuel Pina, Elyssa’s grandfather, said the family was in shock: “It comes in big waves.” The gunmen in Oakland and Goshen were still unidentified and at large. Officials said the Half Moon Bay shooter drove himself to a local sheriff’s station following the slaying, where he was arrested in the parking lot. The 72-year-old who had opened fire at the California dance hall shooting had died by suicide after being pulled over by police the morning after the shooting. But even in communities where the killers had been identified, and no longer posed a danger, there were still more questions than answers about the sudden violence, and what might have prevented it. “In the end, there are simply too many guns in this country. And there has to be a change,” Dave Pine, a local lawmaker in San Mateo county, said on Monday, in the wake of the mushroom farm shootings. Gun laws California, the most populous US state and one of the world’s biggest economies, also has the country’s strictest gun laws. In 1989, it became the first state in the nation to ban military-style assault weapons. The state’s per-capita gun homicide rate is lower than the US average, and sharply lower than many Republican-majority states, like Louisiana and Mississippi, which have much more permissive gun ownership laws. But even California’s Democratic supermajority, which has continued to pass a wide range of new gun regulations, can only do so much in a country where gun rights are fiercely protected. Gunmakers have produced new, military-style weapons that comply with the letter of the law on California’s assault-weapon bans, while functioning in very similar ways to the original weapons. More conservative states with more permissive gun and ammunition purchasing laws, like Arizona and Nevada, are only a short drive away. Police departments in the state have been confiscating an increasing number of “ghost guns”, home-built weapons without serial numbers. At the federal level, gun rights absolutists continue to gain political power in the courts. A single George W Bush-appointed federal judge in California, Roger Benitez, has become famous for striking down California gun control laws. The US supreme court’s new pro-gun majority, fought for by the National Rifle Association and secured by Donald Trump, has already expanded the legal scope of the second amendment, which they defined last year as protecting the right of citizens to carry guns in public for self-protection. California is now being forced to rework its gun control statutes to comply with the new constitutional standards. While some Californians continue to call for even tighter gun laws, moments of crisis, including high-profile shootings, also fuel gun sales. Firearm purchases surged in California during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, with an estimated 5 million Americans nationwide becoming first-time gun owners in 2020 and 2021. Amid an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, there has been a striking increase in the number of Asian Americans buying guns to protect themselves. Community anti-violence programs exist across the state, many of them focused on identifying and working with potential perpetrators of gun violence. But these local programs are often understaffed and overstretched. “We have solutions that we know work. But they’re not funded,” said Dr Joseph Griffin, executive director of Youth Alive! in Oakland, which assists survivors of violence. ‘We need to come together’ The onslaught of back-to-back tragedies has a cumulative impact on California residents, creating a sense of fear and despair, especially for people who see themselves in the victims that were targeted, advocates said. Hollins, a San Francisco native who lost two brothers to violence, said the news cycles can be particularly traumatizing for people who previously survived violence or have relatives who were killed in shootings, and noted that the recent killings by police in the state also compounded the stress. “Some of us develop a level of compassion fatigue doing this work. It’s not a lack of compassion for the individuals who have been harmed, but there’s only so much you can process and hold from all these experiences. And so folks sometimes dissociate, and it can lead to this feeling of hopelessness.”
Still, Hollins said she hoped to see unity across communities and racial lines, and resources are provided for those affected to recover: “I don’t want these conversations to further fuel a political debate about which communities are more deserving or more responsible for the violence that we see happening. We obviously have a systemic and societal issue that crosses all communities and is affecting all of us.” Some survivors faced more barriers in getting help than others, local lawmakers said. The Half Moon Bay shooting victims were Chinese and Latino, officials there said. Half Moon Bay’s vice-mayor, Joaquin Jimenez, said that some of the farm workers who had been targeted were undocumented, which might make them more hesitant to seek mental health counseling or other services. “There’s a lot of fear,” Jimenez said. “For them to come forward to ask for help is going to be very difficult.” Nicole Lee, executive director of Urban Peace Movement, a racial justice group in Oakland, said that after mass violence, the priority is often to expand police’s presence: “When people are scared, they want a quick fix … But law enforcement can’t be at every block at all times, and in many instances they can’t stop these situations. So how do we make interventions that really keep us safe?” Lee, who is Chinese American, said it was also stunning to learn that the suspects in two separate mass shootings were older Asian men. While it was too soon to draw conclusions about what led to the violence, she noted that many Asian Americans in older generations may be grappling with unaddressed trauma, including from surviving war. “I don’t think we are attending to the mental health needs of immigrant communities and Asian communities, especially when there are language differences and cultural differences,” she said. “Not all cultures feel comfortable talking about trauma and mental health. And particularly … with elders, there are often pressures to not talk about these things.” Lee hopes that will shift: “People need to be listened to, and really need space to come together and support one another.” The Associated Press contributed reporting • This article was amended on 26 January 2023 because it described California as the “largest” US state.

393;393;Straight-up macaroni cheese recipe by Laura Goodman;2023-01-30T08:00:16Z;['N/A'];['Food', 'Pasta', 'Cheese', 'Vegetarian food and drink'];;I’ve eaten a lot of macaroni cheese. There are recipes out there that do things like use cottage cheese instead of sauce, insist that cheddar needs help from obscure French friends, or allow only 37g of macaroni per person. For a classic macaroni cheese you can count on, you need to stand over a large pot of bechamel and personally load it with cheddar and some key accessories. Serves 5-6 macaroni 500g unsalted butter 100g, plus 3 tbsp for the top plain flour 75g milk 1.2 litres mature cheddar cheese 275g, grated, plus 50g for the top English mustard 1 tbsp nutmeg ½ tsp, freshly grated breadcrumbs 50g salt and pepper Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6 and get some salted water boiling for the macaroni. Cook the macaroni for 2 minutes less than the packet indicates, drain it and leave it to one side, keeping back half a ladle of pasta water. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt the 100g of butter over a medium heat. When it’s melted, add the flour, and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth and beautifully beige. Add the milk bit by bit (about 100ml at a time). It’ll take you on a whole journey, thickening up before it smooths back out again. All you have to do is keep stirring. Switch to a whisk if it helps. Once you’ve added all the milk, keep the sauce on the heat and stir through the cheese, followed by the mustard and nutmeg, and then salt and pepper to taste. Add the macaroni to the sauce, along with the pasta water, and stir until even. Tip this straight into a wide, shallow oven dish, using a flexible spatula to get to all the sauce. Melt the extra butter and mix it with the extra cheese and the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle this mix over the macaroni cheese. Bake for about 30 minutes, until golden brown all over.

461;461;Ron DeSantis prepares for 2024 White House bid as Trump hits campaign trail;2023-01-29T21:00:02Z;['Maya Yang'];['US elections 2024', 'Ron DeSantis', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Donald Trump', 'Republicans', 'Florida'];;"America’s 2024 presidential race is showing signs of kicking into gear amid reports that Florida’s rightwing Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is now laying the groundwork for a White House bid as Donald Trump finally hit the campaign trail. DeSantis’s moves even spurred Trump into attacking him directly as the former US president held relatively low-key events over the weekend in the key early voting states of New Hampshire and South Carolina. “Ron would have not been governor if it wasn’t for me… when I hear he might run, I consider that very disloyal,” Trump said, before seeking to attack DeSantis’s actions over fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. DeSantis began his time as Florida’s governor in the shadow of Trump, whose political messaging he closely emulated. But he has since emerged as Trump’s most powerful political rival in the Republican party, increasingly popular with many party officials who are wary of the scandals and chaos that accompanied Trump’s time in office. The Washington Post has reported that DeSantis’s political team has already identified potential campaign hires in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, whose traditional early spots in the nomination contest give them outsize influence on the race. Citing two Republican sources with knowledge of conversations and staff meeting on DeSantis team, the paper said the Florida governor was in close talks with two current and experienced members of his current team – Phil Cox and Generra Peck – about possible senior roles in any 2024 effort. Bill Bowen, a New Hampshire Republican delegate, told the paper that his state would probably be receptive to DeSantis. “I’m convinced there’s a good network of establishment party people in New Hampshire that will quickly have a very effective DeSantis campaign,” Bowen said. DeSantis has carved out turf in the Republican party that invites conflict with Trump. He has tacked to the extremist right, especially on social issues. His state has restricted LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, sought to demonize further education in the state as a bastion of liberal power and he has enflamed tensions over immigration with a series of political stunts. In response to DeSantis’s likely presidential bid, Trump has issued threats against the governor. Last November, Trump appeared to warn DeSantis by hinting at political blackmail against DeSantis’s potential 2024 run.
“I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly. I really believe he could hurt himself badly … I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering – I know more about him than anybody – other than, perhaps, his wife,” Trump told Fox News. It was once widely expected that Trump – the only so far declared major candidate for the Republican nomination – would be largely unopposed. But a series of scandals, including meeting with white nationalists, and the flop of high-profile Trump-backed candidates in November’s midterm elections, has seen his grip on the party loosen considerably. Now a swath of other Republicans seem poised to enter the race. Trump even appeared to give his blessing to his former US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, after she informed him that she is considering a 2024 presidential bid. “I talked to her for a little while, I said, ‘Look, you know, go by your heart if you want to run’ … She’s publicly said that ‘I would never run against my president, he was a great president,’” Trump told reporters on Saturday, CNN reports. He added that he told Haley that she “should do it”. In a Fox News interview earlier this month, when asked about her previous comments about not running for president if Trump ran, Haley responded that the “survival of America matters”. “It’s bigger than one person. And when you’re looking at the future of America, I think it’s time for new generational change. I don’t think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in DC … I think we need a young generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things,” she said. Other former Trump cabinet members have also hinted at their presidential bids. Earlier this week, CBS asked former national security adviser John Bolton if he was considering a 2024 run. Bolton said that characterization was “exactly right”, the outlet reports. Bolton also criticized Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, calling it “poison” to the Republican party. “I think Republicans, especially after the November 8 elections last year, see that he’s poison to the ticket. He cannot be elected president. If he were the Republican nominee, he would doom our chances to get a majority in the Senate and the House. I don’t think he’s going to be the Republican nominee,” he said. On Tuesday, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo said that he will decide whether he will run for president. Speaking to CBS, Pompeo said: “Susan and I are thinking, praying, trying to figure out if this is the next place to go serve,” referring to his wife. “We haven’t gotten to that conclusion. We’ll figure this out in the next handful of months,” he added. When asked whether Trump’s 2024 presidential bid is having an impact on his own decision-making, Pompeo said: “None.” There are also likely to be a host of other Republicans eventually in the race with people like the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, and his Virginia counterpart, Glenn Youngkin, among names often touted as likely runners.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/desantis-trump-2024-white-house-bid;guardian;politics;461
3205;3205;German defence minister Christine Lambrecht quits after series of blunders;2023-01-16T11:10:59Z;['Kate Connolly'];['Germany', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'World news'];;"Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has announced her resignation following a series of blunders and a growing impression that she has struggled to deal with the challenges of overseeing the country’s military since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lambrecht asked the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to accept her resignation, she said in a statement on Monday morning, following widespread speculation over recent days that she would stand down. Scholz’s judgment has been questioned over his appointment of Lambrecht in the first place. He is under pressure to replace her with another woman, in order to fulfil his pledge to have an equal number of men and women in his cabinet. Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. From the start of her appointment in December 2021, Lambrecht was viewed as a weak candidate for the job. Insiders say the former justice minister had originally hoped to secure the interior ministry role. When Scholz announced a huge increase in military spending with the creation of a €100bn investment fund for the German armed forces at the start of the war in Ukraine, Lambrecht appeared to struggle with the scale of the challenge to bring the military into shape. Little has happened regarding the new weapons systems and equipment that Scholz has pledged would become available. Her apparent slowness to deliver accompanied repeated reports about the ill-equipped nature of the army.
Last month, during a training exercise, all 18 Puma infantry vehicles deployed had to be taken out of service due to technical difficulties, despite them being one of the military’s most advanced pieces of equipment. Lambrecht was also ridiculed early on in the invasion for her decision to send 5,000 helmets to Ukraine to aid its efforts to stave off Russian aggression. After repeated admissions that she did not understand the army’s ranking system, Lambrecht came under fire more recently after a clumsy and technically poor new year’s address on Instagram from her rooftop in which she could barely be heard above the noise of exploding fireworks in central Berlin. In the address, she said the conflict had meant she had gathered “many special impressions, many encounters with interesting, great people”. She was also forced to defend herself against nepotism after it was revealed she had flown on holiday with her son using a government helicopter. The incident came to light after her son posted a picture of himself in the helicopter on social media. Although her son paid for the trip, the public outcry over the incident was difficult for Lambrecht and her ministry to live down. Potential replacements include Eva Högl, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces and Siemtje Möller, a junior defence minister. Scholz is said to favour Lars Klingbeil, the leader of the Social Democrats – Scholz’s own party – who comes from a military family, though the pressure he will be under to choose a woman makes this less likely. Scholz is under pressure to make another significant step forward in German military aid to Ukraine by agreeing to deliver Leopard 2 battle tanks. Earlier this month, Germany agreed to provide 40 Marder armoured personnel carriers and a Patriot air defence missile battery to Kyiv. Germany has given Ukraine substantial support in recent months, including howitzers, Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and the first of four IRIS-T surface-to-air missile systems. But critics, some inside Germany’s governing coalition, have long-complained of Scholz’s perceived hesitancy to step up aid. Lambrecht was overshadowed on the issue by the chancellor, who made most major announcements.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/german-defence-minister-christine-lambrecht-quits;guardian;politics;3205
9004;9004;'One pay cheque away from homelessness': Striking workers tell their stories;Wednesday 1 February 2023 20:45, UK;[];['strikes'];['workers', 'away', 'inflation', 'union', 'offer', 'money', 'homelessness', 'cheque', 'school', 'schools', 'offered', 'rail', 'pay', 'tell', 'striking'];"Up to half a million workers went on strike on Wednesday - with large numbers of state schools in England forced to close their doors.

More than half (54%) were either fully closed or restricting access to pupils as teachers took industrial action, the Department for Education suggested.

The walkouts, which also involved civil servants, rail workers, bus drivers, border force workers and university staff, were the biggest in a decade.

The action is centred around demands for pay rises matching inflation, which ministers say they can't afford.

Civil servant Ellie Clarke, 31, who works at the Cabinet Office, said she was ""one pay cheque away from homelessness"" after a decade of real-terms cuts to her wages.

Ms Clarke said she is ""terrified every day"" as food costs and bills spiral in the cost of living crisis.

""We are just living in poverty. There is absolutely no chance we could go to the theatre or even just have some dinner with friends,"" she commented.

Primary school teacher Clodagh Glaisyer-Sidibe was on strike in Lewisham with a placard designed to ""turn heads"".

It read: ""I could make more £s on this pole.""

She explained: ""As a slightly older woman, I didn't feel I'd be making a lot of money as a pole dancer.

""So it's showing just how little we're getting.""

Tom Herzmark, a temporary lecturer at Brunel University, said it was ""actually embarrassing to talk about my pay"".

""I had six different part-time contracts last year but my income was still below the tax-free allowance,"" he told Sky News.

The tax-free threshold is £12,570. Tom lives with a friend to save on rent but says his earnings still aren't enough to live on.

""I've had to make difficult decisions about when I spend my money. I don't go on holidays. I don't go to the pub. I don't buy coffees, because it's all too expensive,"" he said.

""I'm paying to do the job with the hope that I will get a full-time position.""

Strikes take toll on economy as widespread disruption forces many to stay at home

In Walthamstow, northeast London, seven-year-old Daisy Halford joined her father on the picket line.

Holding a placard saying ""This is our future"" she said schools needed more money.

Her father is a secondary school teacher. Daisy said: ""Our schools aren't getting enough money and the government is taking money from our schools.

""I would like to get more money for our schools.""

How much are workers demanding, and how much have they been offered? RMT members at Network Rail are seeking an above inflation rise and have been offered 5% for last year and 4% for 2023. The union's workers within train operators have demanded the same but have also been offered 5% for 2022 and 4% for the current year. Train drivers' union Aslef's members want an increase linked to inflation but have been offered 4% by the companies - all represented by the Rail Delivery Group. The Royal College of Nursing has indicated it would accept a 10% pay offer - having originally sought 19%. The government has stuck to the 4% recommended by the pay review body. Striking ambulance workers affiliated to the GMB union have rejected an offer of 4% and want ministers to make a better offer, without naming an actual figure. There are 100,000 civil servants belonging to the PCS union, in many different government departments. They are generally seeking 10%. Teachers belonging to the NEU want a ""fully funded above-inflation increase"" but the government has said it cannot afford that and has offered 5%.

Peter Jeffrey, 48, who teaches at a primary school in Byker, Newcastle Upon Tyne, said: ""I've not had a real pay increase for 10 years. I'm effectively earning less than I was a decade ago.

""Any future pay rise is to come out of school budgets, meaning I have to think whether anything I get will impact colleagues like teaching assistants or dinner ladies, as well as things such as school trips, pencils and books.

""That puts us in a very difficult situation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/one-pay-cheque-away-from-homelessness-striking-workers-tell-their-stories-12800875;skynews;business & economy;3095
4804;4804;After Brexit and Trump, rightwing populists cling to power – but the truth is they can’t govern | Jonathan Freedland;2023-01-07T07:46:24Z;['Jonathan Freedland'];['US politics', 'Republicans', 'Donald Trump', 'Brexit', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak', 'European Union', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'US news', 'World news', 'Europe'];;"The US right has this week been staging a clown show that has had liberals in that country and beyond pulling up a chair and breaking out the popcorn. There has been a karmic pleasure in watching the Republicans who won control of the House of Representatives struggle to complete the most basic piece of business – the election of a speaker – but it’s also been instructive, and not only to Americans. For it has confirmed the dirty little secret of that strain of rightwing populist politics that revels in what it calls disruption: it always ends in bitter factional fighting, chaos and paralysis. We in Britain should know, because Brexit has gone the exact same way. Start with the karma that saw House Republicans gather two years to the day since they sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another: often overlooked in the anniversary recollections of 6 January 2021 is that, mere hours after rioters had stormed the US Capitol, a majority of Republican House members voted to do precisely as the rioters had demanded and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Yet here were those same House Republicans on 6 January 2023, having prevented the smooth transfer of power from one party to another – except this time, the party they were thwarting was their own.
It should have been straightforward. Republicans won a narrow majority in the House in November, which gave them the right to put one of their number in the speaker’s chair. The trouble was, while most backed Kevin McCarthy, about 20 rebels did not. By Thursday night, they had gone through 11 rounds of voting – the most since the civil war era – without McCarthy or anyone else winning a majority. The result: deadlock that was only broken after yet more voting rounds on Friday night, and into Saturday. It was a study in incompetence. A party asks the electorate to give them power; they get it and then freeze, unable to take even the first step towards using it. There was no clear political logic to the stalemate. The rebels are devotees of Donald Trump, but McCarthy himself is a tireless Trump sycophant – patronised by the former president as “my Kevin” – who begged for and won the backing of the orange one. The pro-Trump rebels were divided among themselves: one rebuked Trump for sticking with McCarthy, while another voted to make Trump himself speaker. It’s telling that the rebels’ demands were not on policy but on procedure, seeking rule changes or committee seats that would give them more power. Otherwise, they couldn’t really say what they wanted. They succeeded in getting metal detectors removed from the entrance to the chamber, so now people can walk on to the floor of the House carrying a gun, but apart from that, and their hunger to start investigating Democrats, including Joe Biden’s son Hunter, nothing. All this has significance for the year ahead in US politics. For one thing, it’s yet more evidence of the diminishing strength of Trump among Republican leaders, if not yet among the party faithful. For another, if Republicans cannot make a relatively easy decision like this one, how are they going to make the tough but necessary choices that are coming – such as authorising the spending, and debt, required to keep the US government functioning?
But its meaning goes far wider. For what’s been on display this week, in especially florid form, is a strain of politics that has infected many democracies, including our own. Its key feature is its delight in disruption, in promising to upend the system. That was the thrust of the twin movements of 2016, Trump and Brexit. Both promised to sweep away the elites, the experts, the orthodoxy – whether in Washington DC or Brussels. They were new movements, but they were drawing on deep roots. Four decades ago both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher cast themselves as radicals daring to shake off the dead hand of the government. So we can hardly be surprised that those who railed against government should be so bad at it. They promised disruption, and that’s what they’ve delivered. In the US it was the chaos of Trump himself, and now a House of mini-Trumps that can’t tie its own shoelaces. In the UK, it looks different: we have a prime minister in Rishi Sunak whose pitch is technocratic competence. But that should not conceal two things. First, the post-2016 Tory party delivered just as much parliamentary turmoil and intra-party division as McCarthy and co served up this week. Whether it was the Commons gridlock of the two years preceding the 2019 election or the psychodrama of the three years after it, Brexit-era Conservatism has proved every bit as unhinged as Trump-era Republicanism. When it comes to burn-it-all-down politics, the Republicans’ craziest wing are mere novices compared with a master arsonist such as Liz Truss. The US and UK are simply at different points in the cycle.
Second, even with Sunak in charge, and though painted in less vivid colours, Brexit-era Toryism is just as paralysed as its sister movement in the US. The five-point plan unveiled in the PM’s new year address consisted mostly of the basics of state administration – growing the economy, managing inflation – rather than anything amounting to a political programme. And that’s chiefly because his party, like the Republicans, cannot agree among themselves. Consider how much Sunak has had to drop, under pressure from assorted rebels. Whether it was reform of the planning system, the manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses a year or the perennial pledge to grasp the nettle of social care, Sunak has had to back away from tasks that are essential for the wellbeing of the country. True, he has avoided the farcical scenes that played out this week on Capitol Hill, but that’s only because he has preferred to preserve the veneer of unity than to force a whole slew of issues. The result is a prime minister who cannot propose much more than extra maths lessons lest he lose the fractious, restive coalition that keeps him in office. None of this is coincidence. It’s in the nature of the rightwing populist project, in Britain, the US and across the globe. Brexit is the exemplar, a mission that worked with great potency as a campaign, as a slogan, but which could never translate into governing, because it was never about governing. It was about disrupting life, not organising it – or even acknowledging the trade-offs required to organise it. It offered the poetry of destruction, not the prose of competence. The Conservatives are several stages further down this road than the Republicans, perhaps because their power has been uninterrupted throughout. But in both cases, and others, the shift is unmistakable. Once parties of the right saw themselves as the obvious custodians of state authority: the natural party of government. Now they are happier shaking their fists at those they insist are really in charge. They are becoming the natural party of opposition. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

1161;1161;Deep Fake Neighbour Wars review – the puerile joy of Idris Elba fighting Kim Kardashian over a wheelbarrow;2023-01-26T09:00:00Z;['Chitra Ramaswamy'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];;Catford, south-east London. Idris Elba – handyman, barman, mobile phone repairer, chef, delivery driver and DJ – is having a run-in with new neighbour Kim Kardashian over the communal garden. It’s Idris’s pride and joy, where he tends his brassicas and makes perfume out of rose petals and water that he sells on Etsy. First, he finds towels hanging off his pergola. Two days later, a paddling pool. Then one of those rotary washing lines with a squeak “that went right through me”, says Idris with a shudder. As for bus driver Kim, having a garden to call her own is “a huge blessing” and she refuses to stop sunbathing in it. Let the neighbour wars begin! This is a reality TV spoof with a difference: the first deepfake comedy to grace our screens. So not only do you see a person who sounds and acts exactly like Kardashian griping about the garden hose, wheelbarrow and Flymo Elba has placed on her path to block access to the garden (“Once, I had to jump eight things,” she wails. “Do I look like a hurdlist?”), she looks exactly like her, too. Welcome to Deep Fake Neighbour Wars (ITVX), where thanks to some ethically questionable and up-to-the-minute AI technology I don’t fully understand, we can now indulge in such puerile pleasures as watching Harry Kane have his patio tile cracked by Stormzy. Or Olivia Colman and monosyllabic hubby Jay-Z arguing with Tom Hiddleston (an estate agent, obvs) over his renaming of their cat Giovani. Or Usain Bolt and new wife Phoebe Waller-Bridge-Bolt nicking neighbour Rihanna’s pants. Or Greta Thunberg losing it on the local Facebook community page over a year-round Christmas garden display by Conor McGregor and Ariana Grande. Ha ha … but is it OK? Only, perhaps, because it’s so silly. Deep Fake Neighbour Wars is the brainchild of Spencer Jones and Barney Francis. Described as “the world’s first long form narrative show that uses deepfake technology”, it turns the country’s leading impressionists into A-list celebrities. At the start of each episode is a disclaimer about the celebs being played by actors and their faces all being deepfakes. At the end, their real faces emerge during the credits. I haven’t seen the show that Deep Fake Neighbour Wars is lampooning – New Zealand’s long-running Neighbours at War – but having consumed as much Channel 4 and 5 reality TV over the decades as the next British person, I know the format in my bones. The soft female voiceover forever cueing up the next chapter of some petty dispute with a line such as: “That was when everything started to change.” The tinny beats as the camera pans over Southend-on-Sea before homing in on the neighbours outside their houses, arms crossed, looking miffed. The pointless black-and-white reconstructions of key dramatic moments. Deep Fake Neighbour Wars may be skilled at using AI-generated images to make its impressionists look exactly like Nicki Minaj and Tom Holland, but it’s equally good at replicating the banal faux-shock of this type of reality TV. Some impressions, deepfake or not, are more convincing than others, which goes to show human skill still prevails and we’re not a mouse click away from being phased out by machines fronted by Mark Zuckerberg’s face. Waller-Bridge, for example, is way too posh. Matthew McConaughey looks a bit off, which actually makes him more convincing. Lorraine Kelly as Andy Murray’s tattooist mum is a bit much, but also makes perfect British comedy sense. Adele as a shopping channel enthusiast losing it over neighbour Jake Paul’s racing pigeons defecating on her new electronic awning is classic. I love how she keeps apologising for her language, when all she has done is say “cack”. Whether it’s Spitting Image, Rory Bremner, Dead Ringers or the latest in deepfake tech, it’s in the minor details that impressions really come to life. Should it be doing more? Instead of revealing something about our insidious celebrity culture, or deepfaking leaders to extract some political satire, Deep Fake Neighbour Wars goes for the laughs generated by putting enormously famous celebrities in humdrum situations. Keeping things silly sidesteps the ethical pitfalls, and it’s true that there is something inherently funny about Kardashian yearning to drive the A28 trunk road, south-east of London, because it’s “so scenic”. Yet it says something about the depoliticisation prevailing today that this is where the world’s first deepfake comedy chooses to go. It’s a bizarre show for bizarre times.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/26/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-review;guardian;entertainment & culture;1161
6190;6190;Politics latest: Transport Secretary Mark Harper and RMT boss Mick Lynch to answer questions as rail strikes return;;[];['live'];['rmt', 'mark', 'ireland', 'transport', 'varadkar', 'politics', 'president', 'thats', 'return', 'weve', 'secretary', 'northern', 'rail', 'mistakes', 'room', 'mick', 'protocol', 'questions', 'uk', 'strikes'];"'Mistakes' made over 'too strict' Northern Ireland Protocol - Varadkar

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that ""mistakes"" were made in the post-Brexit negotiations between the Republic of Ireland, the UK, and Europe.

The Northern Ireland Protocol, which has put a trade border between the nation and the rest of the UK, has led to a collapse in powersharing at Stormont.

Mr Varadkar - who returned to the head of the Irish government at the end of last year - has said the protocol is ""too strict"".

He was part of the 11th-hour negotiations with Boris Johnson which saw the protocol agreed in 2019.

Mr Varadkar said: ""I'm sure we've all made mistakes in the handling of Brexit.

""There was no road map, no manual, it wasn't something that we expected would happen and we've all done our best to deal with it.

""Again, I look forward to travelling to Northern Ireland early in the new year, meeting with all the parties, and reaching out to all parties and all communities in an effort to find a solution.""

He added: ""One thing I have said in the past is that, when we designed the protocol, when it was originally negotiated, perhaps it was a little bit too strict.

""And we've seen that the protocol has worked without it being fully enforced.

""And that's why I think there is room for flexibility and room for changes and we're open to that and up for that, and I know from speaking to [European Commission] President [Ursula] von der Leyen and [EC vice president] Maros Sefcovic, that's their position too.

""So, we are willing to show flexibility and to make compromises. We do want there to be an agreement.""

Negotiations are currently under way to find a solution to the concerns raised about the Protocol, ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement this year.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103073218/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-transport-secretary-mark-harper-and-rmt-boss-mick-lynch-to-answer-questions-as-rail-strikes-return-12593360;skynews;politics;281
2846;2846;Fukushima: court upholds acquittals of three Tepco executives over disaster;2023-01-18T06:40:08Z;['Justin McCurry'];['Fukushima', 'Japan disaster', 'Japan', 'Nuclear power', 'Asia Pacific', 'Energy', 'Environment'];;"Three former executives from the company that operates the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have had their not-guilty verdicts upheld by a court in Japan, dealing a blow to campaigners demanding the firm take legal responsibility for the disaster in March 2011. The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death. The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986.
The three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japan’s recorded history. More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. Wednesday’s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019. The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe. A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 – three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it. The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the government’s evaluation, saying the defendants “could not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in height”, Kyodo reported. Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepco’s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay ¥13.32tn (£80bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster. In contrast to Wednesday’s decision, the court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures. While that ruling – the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster – carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan. Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster;guardian;business & economy;2846
5857;5857;"The week in TV: Mayflies; Without Sin; Prince Andrew: The Musical; Marie Antoinette";2023-01-01T09:30:42Z;['Barbara Ellen'];['Drama', 'Television & radio', 'Television', 'TV comedy', 'Culture'];;"Mayflies (BBC One) | iPlayer Without Sin (ITVX) | itv.com Prince Andrew: The Musical (Channel 4) | All 4 Marie Antoinette (BBC Two) | iPlayer Watching BBC One’s Mayflies, you first wonder if it’s a male weepie; a kind of Beaches for blokes. Adapted by Andrea Gibb (Elizabeth Is Missing) from the Andrew O’Hagan novel, it wastes no time in reaching for the emotional jugular. From the moment vivid teacher Tully (Tony Curran) tells his thoughtful writer friend Jimmy (Martin Compston) that he has terminal cancer, everything floods out – sadness, fear, humour, anger, memory – over two beautifully paced, profoundly demanding episodes. This is a drama that’s not only in touch with its feelings; it needs you to be in touch with them too. Packed with disparate themes (love, class, assisted dying), Mayflies is also about the knotty bonds forged in youth. We see the pair as teenagers in 1980s Scotland – sensitive Jimmy (Rian Gordon) and charismatic Tully (Tom Glynn-Carney), both troubled but full of grit and hope, living for music, going with friends to see a post-punk festival in Manchester and spotting their heroes (“Johnny Marr, ya legend!”). Their mutual devotion is irrefutable, but is it the answer now? Is it fair (spoiler alert) that Tully asks Jimmy to help him with the darkest, most intense level of assistance? (“Don’t let me die like a prick.” “We all die like pricks”). It’s left to the women – Tully’s Anna (Ashley Jensen) and Jimmy’s Iona (Tracy Ifeachor) – to pour cold reality over the idea that brotherhood trumps all. If that sounds wretched and soggy, the televisual equivalent of a bed bath with a wet wipe, it’s not at all. The rough, throwaway humour (“Are you sure you should be smoking?” “That nag has bolted”) stops things from collapsing into trite, fridge-magnet affirmations or gloopy mawkishness. All the performances are extraordinary, particularly from Curran and Jensen as Tully and Anna plummet through hell without a parachute. Mayflies emerges as a fearlessly expressive poem about life, death and love, at once heartbreaking and uplifting. What a powerful drama to see out the old year. As father and daughter in 2010’s This Is England ’86, the chemistry between Johnny Harris and Vicky McClure was palpable, albeit toxic. Now they’re reunited in ITV’s four-part Nottingham-set thriller Without Sin, created and written by Frances Poletti. McClure plays Stella, a grieving mother who uses a restorative justice scheme to visit convicted murderer Charles (Harris) in prison to get answers about how her daughter Maisy died. Cab driver Stella (vacant gaze; long “safety blanket” hair) is living a half-life, hating herself for being awol when her daughter was killed. Even a tryst with her ex, Maisy’s father Paul (Perry Fitzgerald), seems mechanical; less about sex than numbing shared pain. When Stella visits Charles, there’s an expectation of standard screen-murderer fare (coldness, evil, a taunt or two?). However, soft-spoken, urgent Charles isn’t quite what you expect. Without divulging spoilers, he isn’t what Stella expects either.
Without Sin evolves into her circuitous quest for the truth, taking in drugs, family dysfunction, gangsters, human fallibility and imperilled teenagers. Stuck in prison, Charles is a shape-shifting study in ambiguity: is he a force for good (telling the truth) or bad (toying with Stella)? The plot becomes too tangled and busy – like a dangerously overloaded plug extension – but it works hard to avoid being formulaic, with a twist creeping up on you like a slowly spreading shadow. I feel guilty for not liking the hour-long Prince Andrew: The Musical more. Part of Channel 4’s Truth and Dare: 40 Years of Punching Boundaries season, it deserves credit for cocking a subversive snook at the ultimate Prince Charmless, who fraternised with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein (even after Epstein was convicted as a sex offender), and (allegedly) then some. Creator Kieran Hodgson stars as Andrew (all entitled smarm), with the cast immediately diving into a musical number about the Newsnight interview (lack of sweat; Woking pizza parlours), with Emily Maitlis (Emma Sidi) skewering princely waffle: “‘My paedo friend was out of jail so why not go out for dinner?’” I enjoy the cast camply shimmying around the “palace” (Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire).
Sadly, PA:TM then takes a prolonged, turgid tour through Andrew’s yawn-fuelled biography: “Randy Andy”, the Falklands war, Sarah Ferguson. Epstein and Maxwell appear only as images (a backdrop of Maxwell’s face) or an off-screen vocal impersonation: “Your Royal Highness, this is Jeffrey.” There’s no spoofing of the Queen (fair enough). Harry Enfield appears so fleetingly as Tony Blair, it’s barely worth his turning up. A clever number between Charles (Munya Chawawa) and Andrew (“Every heir needs a ne’er do well”) perks things up, but ultimately what amounts to cheap-seats regal panto fails the “too soon?” test. (Andrew only agreed to settle the sexual assault allegations with an “undisclosed sum” earlier this year.) Nor are things helped by the recent six-hour Harry and Meghan Netflix marathon. Not for the first time, I wonder: aren’t we all royally maxed out? Over on BBC Two there’s more royal fare, of the 18th-century variety, with the eight-part Franco-British drama Marie Antoinette, created by Deborah Davis, who won a screenwriting Bafta for 2018’s The Favourite. Emilia Schüle stars in the title role, with Louis Cunningham as her husband and a deliciously fruity James Purefoy as his priapic grandfather. It isn’t long before I realise my knowledge of the ill-fated Austrian émigré is Ladybird book-level patchy at best (“Let them eat cake”; play-acting at being a peasant; execution by guillotine during the French Revolution). This series brings home how young Marie Antoinette was when she married (14! ); her vulnerability (surrounded by conniving enemies); and the fear-drenched failure to produce an heir with an inexperienced husband who for years shied away from sex.
It soon becomes clear the couple are spoiled, overwhelmed children. No wonder Marie Antoinette has Alice in Wonderland-style nightmares about being dragged underwater by a gigantic necklace. Five episodes in, it looks as if we’re not going to get to the revolution, so maybe a second is already planned. I hope so. It’s sumptuous period fare, but suffused with dread and melancholy; a sense of spiders and vermin scuttling over the bowls of pretty bonbons.

2572;2572;Cassius Turvey: three more charged with murder of Indigenous Perth teenager;2023-01-19T10:09:33Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Western Australia', 'Perth', 'Australia news', 'Indigenous Australians'];;Three more people have been charged with murder as part of the ongoing investigation into the brutal death of Indigenous schoolboy Cassius Turvey. Turvey, 15, was walking with friends in Middle Swan on 13 October when he was allegedly attacked by 21-year-old Jack Steven James Brearley with a metal pole, that police believe to be a shopping trolley handle. Turvey suffered serious head injuries and died in hospital 10 days later. Brearley has already been charged with murder, but Western Australia police have now arrested a further three people, two men and a woman, as part of their investigation. Police allege that the two men and woman were in the company of Brearley during the assault. A 27-year-old man from Wundowie, a 24-year-old man from Chidlow and a 20-year-old woman from Herne Hill have each now been charged with murder. They will appear in the Perth magistrates court on 20 January 2023. Brearley is also accused of attacking a 13-year-old boy who was with Turvey, as well as stealing his crutches and cap. Brearley has been charged with one count each of murder, stealing and assault. He remains in custody at Casuarina prison, and has not yet been required to enter a plea to his charges. Thousands of vigils were held in towns and cities across the country to mourn the death of Turvey. The alleged violent assault sent shockwaves across various communities, with many grieving the loss of the teenager. At a vigil in Perth in November, his mother, Mechelle Turvey, paid tribute to her son. “He was the heart and soul of the community. “The love, the generosity, the kindness, and the outpouring of tributes across the nation has been so appreciated.”;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/cassius-turvey-three-more-charged-with-of-indigenous-perth-teenager;guardian;entertainment & culture;2572
403;403;Plantain cobbler recipe by Lopè Ariyo;2023-01-30T08:00:12Z;['N/A'];['Food', 'Dessert'];;Plantains can be boiled, fried, grilled and more. Here they’re drenched in a tropical syrup and topped with a biscuit-like casing somewhere between a cake and a scone. Other than taking the time to slice the plantains, this is a fairly quick and easy dessert. This cosy dish is best served warm and works amazingly well with caramel ice-cream but is as equally brilliant with vanilla ice-cream. Serves 8 For the plantain base plantains 4-6, cut into coins pineapple juice 60ml soft brown sugar 120g grated ginger 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp For the topping plain flour 240g baking powder 2 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp salt 1 tsp butter 60g, cold soft brown sugar 60g egg 1 milk or non-dairy alternative 60ml demerara sugar for sprinkling vanilla or salted caramel ice-cream to serve Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. In an ovenproof dish, stack the plantain coins on top of each other in threes or fours. Save a few to place on the topping. In a saucepan, mix together the pineapple juice, sugar, ginger and nutmeg. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the syrup over the plantains. To make the topping, sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt into a mixing bowl. Using your hand, rub in the butter until the mixture starts to crumble. Mix in the sugar. Whisk the egg and milk, add to the bowl and mix again until well combined and sticky. Using an ice-cream scoop, or any regular spoon, place balls of dough on to the plantains, making sure to leave pockets for the plantain syrup to pop through. Dunk the reserved plantain coins in some oil or butter and press down into the centre of each ball. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar. Bake for at least 30 minutes until the topping is dark, golden and crusty. Let it stand for 5 minutes and serve with the ice-cream of your choice. Lopè Ariyo is a recipe developer and food writer.

8600;8600;Flybe: What are passengers' rights when flights are cancelled by a bankrupt airline?;Saturday 28 January 2023 10:42, UK;['reemul balla', '@reemul_b'];['flybe', 'travel'];['cancelled', 'flights', 'went', 'credit', 'passengers', 'insurance', 'travel', 'provider', 'rights', 'card', 'bankrupt', 'flybe', 'airline'];"After Flybe went into administration on Saturday, many travellers will be out of pocket having bought tickets, while others are stranded in their outbound destination.

Flybe has told its passengers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged alternative flights with another airline.

What are passengers' rights if your flight is cancelled?

Flybe going into administration is a different situation to when an airline that still operates cancels flights.

Given the company is unable to trade anymore, the cancelled flights will not be rescheduled nor can passengers be rebooked onto other airlines.

Aviation analyst Alex Macheras told Sky News: ""While the UK government has stepped in before when larger airlines or travel groups go bust, this will not be the case for Flybe 2.0.

""As Flybe mostly sell 'flight only' bookings, travel is not ATOL protected, which means refunds from the company itself will not be provided.

""Anyone with bookings will have to rely on a refund from their credit card or debit card provider, or by claiming from travel insurance.""

He added that if a passenger booked their flights with a credit card and it was more than £100, they are protected under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.

This consumer protection law stipulates the credit provider is equally liable if there is any issue with the purchase - including flights.

For flights that cost less than £100, section 75 does not apply and the card company wouldn't usually be liable.

Mr Macheras added: ""This is why it's always best to book travel with a credit card.

""If a debit card was used, passengers can try claiming from the card provider under the chargeback system, but it's often a little more difficult and not a legal right compared with the credit card.""

Some card providers will ask for a negative response letter confirming the position.

The negative response letter will be published shortly according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

Mr Macheras said: ""There's also potentially the safety net of travel insurance, as around half of all UK travel insurance policies have scheduled airline failure cover (SAFI) as standard.""

The CAA said: ""If you did not book directly with Flybe and purchased your tickets through a third party, you should contact your booking or travel agent in the first instance.""

It said if passengers went via airline ticket agents, they are the first point of call and ""they may have provided travel insurance that includes SAFI [Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance] cover"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128110308/http://news.sky.com/story/flybe-what-are-passengers-rights-when-flights-are-cancelled-by-a-bankrupt-airline-12797215;skynews;business & economy;2691
2490;2490;George Santos denies reports that he competed as drag queen in Brazil;2023-01-19T16:01:42Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['George Santos', 'House of Representatives', 'US Congress', 'US politics', 'US news', 'Drag', 'World news', 'Brazil', 'Americas', 'Culture', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Republicans', 'New York'];;"George Santos on Thursday tweeted an angry denial that he competed as a drag queen in Brazilian beauty pageants 15 years ago, claims made by acquaintances that have highlighted the contrast between the Republican congressman’s past actions and now staunchly conservative views.
The New Yorker, who says he is gay, dismissed the story as an “obsession” by the media, which he insisted, without irony, “continues to make outrageous claims about my life”. Santos is facing calls from Democrats and his fellow New York Republicans to step down over fabrications about his career and history and amid reports of investigations at local, state and federal level in the US and in Brazil over the use of a stolen checkbook. In another contradiction exposed on Wednesday by a New York Times analysis of immigration records, Santos’s insistence that his mother was in the World Trade Center during the 9/11 terrorist attacks was found to be false. Santos has admitted “embellishing” his résumé but otherwise denied wrongdoing and said he will not resign. The claim that Santos was a drag performer came from a 58-year-old Brazilian who uses the drag name Eula Rochard, Reuters reported. Rochard said she befriended Santos when he was cross-dressing in 2005 at the first Pride parade in Niterói, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Three years later, Santos competed in a drag beauty pageant in Rio, she added. Another person from Niterói who knew Santos, but asked not to be named, said he participated in drag queen beauty pageants under the name Kitara Ravache, and aspired to be Miss Gay Rio de Janeiro. Santos is now a hardline conservative on numerous social issues, especially those targeting non-binary communities. Republicans have taken aim at drag shows and performers in several states, claiming they are harmful to children. In Texas, one proposal would brand venues that host such shows as “sexually oriented” businesses. Santos, the first out gay Republican to win a House seat in Congress as a non-incumbent, has supported Florida’s “don’t say gay” law, which marginalizes the LGBTQ+ community and prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms. Responding in October to criticism of his support for the Florida bill, Santos told USA Today: “I am openly gay, have never had an issue with my sexual identity in the past decade, and I can tell you and assure you, I will always be an advocate for LGBTQ+ folks.” Republican leaders have so far stood by Santos. He supported the new speaker, Kevin McCarthy, through 15 rounds of voting for that position, and was rewarded with seats on two House committees in a slim Republican majority. But despite McCarthy’s support, increasing numbers of senior party officials have pleaded with Republican leadership to cut him loose. They include several of Santos’s fellow New York congressmen. The Daily Beast reported on Thursday that a “shadow” race was under way in Democratic and Republican circles to replace Santos in New York’s third district, in the expectation that he will eventually be forced out. Republicans, the Beast said, are looking for “a candidate with an immaculate, bulletproof résumé who can patch up the Long Island GOP’s scarred reputation”. Democrats are seeking somebody who can turn the district blue again after Santos’s surprise win in November. As for Santos’s alleged drag show exploits, Rochard said the congressman was a “poor” drag queen in 2005, with a simple black dress, but in 2008 “he came back to Niterói with a lot of money” and a flamboyant pink dress to show for it. Santos competed in a drag beauty pageant that year but lost, Rochard said, adding: “He’s changed a lot but he was always a liar. He was always such a dreamer.” Santos’s tweet on Thursday was his second denial in two days concerning a claim about his past. On Wednesday, he was embroiled in allegations he took money from an online fundraiser intended to help save the life of a sick dog owned by a military veteran. “The media continues to make outrageous claims about my life while I am working to deliver results,” Santos said. “I will not be distracted or fazed by this.” On Thursday, Santos called “reports that I would let a dog die … shocking and insane”. But the veteran told CNN Santos should “go to hell”. Richard Osthoff added that if he spoke to Santos now, he would ask: “Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?’ “He’d probably lie about that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/george-santos-drag-queen-brazil-new-york-republican;guardian;politics;2490
3596;3596;Kevin De Bruyne’s understated genius still holds key to Manchester derby | Will Unwin;2023-01-13T22:30:27Z;['Will Unwin'];['Manchester City', 'Kevin De Bruyne', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Kevin De Bruyne created eight goals last season to help lead Manchester City to the title and earn himself the Premier League player of the year trophy for the second time. This season he has nine assists already but his consistent genius is drifting under the radar thanks to the headline figures plunderer-in-chief Erling Haaland is racking up. The Belgian’s delivery and eye-of-the-needle passes are a threat for any defence; he is able to create angles with the ball that few can dream of, producing passes before opponents can react. It helps that 27-goal Haaland has arrived to get on the end of whipped crosses and through-balls, making De Bruyne’s life a little easier when he takes the briefest of looks to see where his teammates are whenever the ball lands at his feet in the opposition half. Haaland volleying, jabbing and heading home passes from De Bruyne has become a regular sight. In the Manchester derby at the Etihad, the pair combined twice, ensuring United will be fearful of them at Old Trafford on Saturday.
Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva are yet to peak this season. Grealish and Mahrez have been the preferred options on the wings in recent months, a combination Pep Guardiola has turned to for key matches and moments. The wide players have been rotated frequently, whereas De Bruyne has started 16 of City’s 17 league matches. Silva has five league assists, Grealish and Foden three each, and Mahrez one (the same as the goalkeeper Ederson). Although these statistics look below par, they are not far off their numbers last season, and Silva has already surpassed his four. Where there is a problem is City’s second-most assists last season came jointly from the departed Gabriel Jesus and João Cancelo, who has one this campaign. Pep Guardiola wants more from certain squad members, especially going into a critical stage of the season.
“All I can do is to tell my players the reality in good and bad moments,” he said. “I have more experience than them. Not at playing football, but at analysing what happens, I’m better than them. I’m the only person to tell them the truth. Put everyone in the team individually in front of their own mirrors to look at themselves. Sometimes not saying anything, they see my face, they know exactly the situation.” De Bruyne has made 18 ‘big chances’, from which a player can reasonably be expected to score; second in terms of this metric at City is Haaland on eight. Newcastle’s Kieran Trippier is second overall in the Premier League, five behind De Bruyne, an indicator of the Belgian’s creativity. Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard, who play in comparable positions to De Bruyne, have 11 and 10 respectively, and they are having fine seasons. De Bruyne has looked tired at times in recent months, especially during Belgium’s World Cup demise. He has played more than 50 games in each of the past three seasons, and 27 already this campaign. Intelligence has been integral to De Bruyne’s game for years; he knows that at 31 his marauding runs cannot be as frequent or effective and he needs help from others.
De Bruyne’s brilliance has helped keep United in the shadows since he moved to England but the gap appears to be closing since Erik ten Hag’s arrival at Old Trafford. Guardiola, asked whether United were title challengers, said: “When I see the way United are playing, why not? Their playing is good. It is nice for us. The challenge to prove ourselves again, if we are able to do it.” A key reason behind United’s improvement is the arrival from Real Madrid of Casemiro, a player brought in to create a barrier in front of the defence with his experience and a little cynical know-how. The Brazilian faced City numerous times in the Champions League with Madrid and often struggled against De Bruyne. City have won three of the clubs’ four most recent meetings, Madrid’s victory coming in last season’s dramatic injury-time turnaround, by which time De Bruyne had been replaced and Casemiro arguably should have been sent off. De Bruyne will be unconcerned about facing him again. Haaland has become the man to fear for City’s opponents but Casemiro and his colleagues will be aiming to stop their rivals at source, which is still the ever-evolving De Bruyne. He would, however, be grateful for a little help from his friends.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/13/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-haaland-derby;guardian;sports;3596

4993;4993;Chess: Hastings tradition inspires home contingent at oldest annual tournament ;2023-01-06T08:00:44Z;['Leonard Barden'];['Chess', 'Sport'];;"Hastings is the grandpa of international chess tournaments, first staged in 1895 and annually since 1920, with brief war and pandemic breaks. Its vintage years were the 1930s, 50s and 70s, when world champions were eager to compete, while England’s Sir George Thomas and Hugh Alexander scored stunning upsets. The home contingent started slowly at the Caplin Hastings Masters 2022-23, before a surge in the second half put five English players in the mix at the start of Friday’s 10th and final round.
Final leading scores were Sarunas Sulskis (Lithuania) 8/10, Mark Hebden (England), Bence Korpa (Hungary) and Oleg Korneev (Spain) all 7.5; Martin Petrov (Bulgaria), Romain Édouard (France), Conor Murphy (Ireland), Timo Küppers (Germany), Brandon Clarke and Danny Gormally (England) all 7. Sulskis, 50, a five-time Lithuanian champion, won his first six games, and at that stage was 1.5 points ahead of 14 players tied for second. Then the pack overtook him, and the critical moment for the entire tournament came in Thursday’s ninth round, when Hebden established a won rook endgame. White (Sulskis) Kf2, Rh5. Black (Hebden) Kb5,Rb3, Pa4. The black king is in check, and Kb4, with the idea Rh4+ Ka5 Rh5+ Rb5 would win. Instead Hebden retreated with Kb6?? when Ke2! allowed the white king to stop the a pawn. In the final round, Sulskis won smoothly. For Hebden, 64, second prize still crowned a glorious few months during which he won team and individual golds for England at the world and European senior championships. He was joint winner at Hastings in 2009-10, and his zestful final-round attack on Friday overcame the reigning British champion Harry Grieve. Apart from the trio who finished at the top, the main English success story was Mohammed Aayan Ismail, the 2021 British under-16 champion. Despite his lowly 1963 Fide rating, Ismail played a strong tournament, missed his first IM norm by only half a point, and won a fine strategic game against a seasoned IM. Hastings’s venerable tradition continues, with sponsorship backing from e-trading technology firm Caplin Systems and long-standing support from Hastings Council, although its main event, the Caplin Hastings Masters, is now an open-to-all Swiss System tournament. In its heyday, it was an invitation 10-player all-play-all, in which four or five British masters fought to scavenge the occasional half point and the rare full point from the world elite.
Nowadays, that elite chases the high prize funds of the World Rapid and Blitz, followed by the “chess Wimbledon” at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, which starts on Saturday 14 January with Magnus Carlsen as top seed. Stockholm’s Rilton Cup clashes directly with Hastings, and two of England’s young grandmaster norm chasers, Matthew Wadsworth and Jonah Willow, preferred Sweden to Sussex. Long ago, when Thomas, the badminton baronet, scored his finest result at Hastings 1934-35, he tied for first with Max Euwe and Salo Flohr after defeating the past and future world champions José Raúl Capablanca and Mikhail Botvinnik in successive rounds. It could have been better still, but Thomas’s West London clubmate Reginald Michell defeated his colleague in the final round. The result was greeted at the time as a fine example of British sportsmanship, whereas today many would regard it as quixotic. 3849: 1…Qc4+! 2 Kg1 (2 Ke1 Qe2 mate) Qg8+! 3 Kf1 (3 Kh1/h2 Qg2 mate) Qg2+ 4 Ke1 Qg1+ and 5…Qxb1 wins.

869;869;‘Under siege’: As Alice Springs becomes a national flashpoint, locals fear what comes next;2023-01-27T14:00:54Z;['Sarah Collard', 'Blake Sharp-Wiggins'];['Alice Springs', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Northern Territory', 'Australia news', 'Northern Territory politics', 'Australian politics', 'Anthony Albanese'];;"In her 36 years living in Alice Springs, Donna Ah Chee’s home had never been burgled. Then, in the space of just one week this month, her home was broken into twice. The first time, she thinks it was just kids, rummaging through drawers and cupboards. The second time, two drunk men, one of them brandishing a large industrial spanner, smashed through her kitchen window while she was home alone. It took more than 40 minutes for police to arrive, she says. “The town’s under siege,” says Ah Chee, a Bundjalung woman and the head of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress. “It’s not just me, the whole town’s hurting: businesses, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people together are all suffering because of this.”
Alice Springs has become a national flashpoint in recent weeks with a surge in antisocial behaviour and crime, sparking calls by the mayor for military and federal police intervention. This week, Anthony Albanese made a whirlwind trip to the town, announcing new alcohol restrictions and promising $48.8m over two years for a range of measures, including liquor licence compliance and emergency accommodation. But to many of the local Arrernte people who have called this place home for generations, the measures feel all too familiar. And once again, they say they’re not being consulted on the policies being put in place. ‘We fear curfews’ For more than a decade, intervention-era alcohol bans were in place in remote Aboriginal communities. When those came to an end in July, liquor became legal in some communities for the first time in 15 years.
Since then, there’s been an escalating wave of crime and violence in Alice Springs. Over the past year, property offences in the town have jumped by almost 60%, assaults increased by 38% and domestic violence assaults have doubled. Many in the town are frustrated about young people taking to the streets at night, sometimes getting into trouble.
The Alice Springs mayor, Matt Paterson, said earlier this month the issue had reached “crisis levels”. As media coverage intensified, the prime minister announced a ban on takeaway alcohol sales on Monday and Tuesday, and limits on bottle store opening hours for the rest of the week. Albanese has said a total alcohol ban could be on the cards. The Northern Territory chief minister, Natasha Fyles, said the measures were about bringing some “immediate relief” for the community as it grapples with a surge in crime and alcohol-related harm. But Arrernte woman Cherisse Buzzacott, who was born and raised in Alice Springs, says the new restrictions make her worried. Buzzacott, like many others in the town, lived through the Howard government’s highly controversial NT intervention in 2007, where the military was brought in under the guise of community safety.
The intervention also compulsorily acquired township leases over Aboriginal-owned land. Income management was applied to all community residents receiving welfare payments, and signs were posted declaring bans on alcohol and pornography in township or “prescribed” areas. Buzzacott says people are now afraid of another NT intervention. “We fear curfews, military. The over policing that’s happening, that’s not an answer … it’s not facing what the actual issues are,” says Buzzacott, a former midwife who now works with the Indigenous-led Children’s Ground, which aims to improve the literacy of with kids and families in communities. She worries for her three young sons. “I think about how my kids are gonna grow up. I don’t want them walking around the streets and walking to shops and just being watched,” said Buzzacott. “Because that’s basically where we are headed, kids can’t go anywhere without being unaccompanied and are just constantly being pulled up.”
William Tilmouth, an Arrernte elder, stolen generations survivor and chair of Children’s Ground, also doesn’t believe the hastily announced alcohol restrictions will work. Instead, he believes they will leave another disempowering legacy for communities. “I’ve seen copious amounts of policies in the past in relation to alcohol and I’m yet to find one that actually works,” he said. ‘It’s a Band-Aid’ Instead of more intervention-era policies, people in Alice Springs want to see policies that target the real issues facing the town. Shirleen Campbell, a Warlpiri, Anmatyerre, Arrernte and Luritja woman who has been advocating for women’s safety for years, says alcohol is just one factor affecting the community – and it’s simplistic to believe alcohol restrictions will address family and domestic violence. Domestic, family and sexual violence were already at high levels in NT before the alcohol bans were lifted, with First Nations women drastically overrepresented and filling the intensive care beds at the local hospital. “It’s a Band-Aid,” says Campbell, who is the co-coordinator of Tangentyere Women’s Family Safety Group, working in and around the Alice Springs town camps with families, children and young people. “Violence comes from colonisation, so we need to unpack that as well, and it’s about education.”
Campbell says the intervention-era policies contributed to the current problems. The policies punished people trying their best and ruptured the strong family units that had kept them together for thousands of generations. “The intervention was a paintbrush that painted all our men with negativity. It damaged them,” she says. Campbell says empowering communities starts with families, breaking down colonial ideas of gender, stereotypes and inequality.
Buzzacott says governments and communities need to work together to address underlying issues such as access to safe housing, healthy food and a connection to their culture and language. With no functional playgrounds and limited internet access, Buzzacott says young people have little to do, leading them to act out. “They’re sad. They’ve got no hope. They’ve got no aspirations for the future,” she says. “We need to be talking to the kids about what they want, and talking to elders in Alice Springs but also in communities about how we can put in some culturally safe activities.” ‘Speak to the people’ Locals in the town say politicians come and go. This time, what they really want is to be listened to.
The government has appointed a Central Australian Regional Controller who will consult on further alcohol bans, and who is due to provide an initial report on 1 February. But people in Alice Springs say they don’t feel they have been consulted. “The problem is we’re not part of any consultations that are happening, we’re not meeting with the prime minister,” Buzzacott says. Tilmouth agrees. “Historically, Aboriginal people had to put up with prescribed solutions by people who knew nothing about us and yet made decisions for [us],” Tilmouth says.
Strong Grandmothers Group of the Central Desert, a group formed about a decade ago to help vulnerable young people in Alice Springs, used to conduct night patrols and spend time sitting and talking with children.

2546;2546;‘You have to set time aside for friendship’: the radical power of hanging out;2023-01-19T11:50:11Z;['Elle Hunt'];['Friendship', 'Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing'];;"Some of my fondest memories of friends should, by rights, be entirely forgettable. There was that time we took our books to the park and dozed. The time we sat by the sea drinking coffee, watching the waves. The time we assembled my flatpack furniture (well – I watched), ordered a pizza and watched TV. Fifteen years ago, these open-ended hangs were effortless and my social life flowed with only the lightest steer. Fast-forward to now, and – whether it’s the difference between being in my 30s versus my 20s, or 2023 versus 2013, or a pile-up of both – often the best I can manage is a quick drink after work in three weeks’ time. No one, myself included, is ever free to just hang out. “I’d love to,” I say, sincerely – but there is always a “but”. The author and academic Sheila Liming wants us to find the time – or, more precisely, to reclaim it. Her new book, Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time, is partly a paean to the pleasures of idling with others and partly a manifesto to “take back our social lives from the deadening whirl of contemporary life”. “When we’re young, it feels like social interactions just create themselves: they happen organically, we run into each other,” says Liming, at home in Vermont, when we speak over Zoom. “As we get older, they seem like something we have to put more effort into. Meetings become more structured, at times more formal – and also more of a chore.” There is a desire, she says, “for more casual interactions that don’t have a lot of ‘objectives’ associated with them, where there is nothing in particular you’re trying to get out of it”. Liming proposes a return to hanging out – “more amorphous and looser” than parties, but in a world obsessed with outputs, perhaps of greater importance. Liming defines hanging out as: “any time that you find yourself killing time in the presence of others … It can be something really informal, like sitting on your friend’s sofa and having a cup of tea.”
Rather than a particular activity, Liming says, it is an approach to socialising. For her, the gold standard was modelled by a colleague who invited Liming and her partner over for lunch. When they called to say that they were 20 minutes away, their host responded with enthusiasm, saying he would get started with the food. Then he asked: who was calling, sorry? Liming’s friend was willing to make lunch for anyone with his phone number. This was several years ago, she adds. “A lot has changed.” These days it may feel like we don’t have time for lunch at all, let alone to prepare it for friends who drop by. For office workers, technology and the associated expectation of round-the-clock availability have led to lengthening working days. Rising living costs have added to the pressure, with a reported 5.2 million UK workers taking on second jobs to cope. Leisure time, shrinking since the 1970s, is increasingly precious for women in particular, with US and UK statistics showing a stark gender gap: a reflection of uneven distribution of caring and domestic responsibilities. What free time people do have, time-use surveys consistently show, is mostly spent watching television – perhaps because we find ourselves too exhausted to do anything else. The barriers to hanging out go beyond simply finding the time and the energy: increasingly, they are structural. So-called “third places” – those in which you can comfortably spend time outside your home or office – are disappearing due to factors such as public spending cuts, privatisation and gentrification. In big cities it can be a struggle to find places to just be together. This creates a vicious cycle of needing money to spend time with friends, and needing to work to make money. This comes at a cost, Liming argues. When busy schedules mean plans are made long into the future, they can’t help but be crushed under the weight of expectation. By the time it actually happens, “I’ve almost talked myself out of the opportunity to enjoy it,” she says.
The quality of our company is just as important as the fact of it, Liming says. “We’ve all had those experiences when we’re around someone who doesn’t quite have the time to interact with us socially. That feeling of being squeezed in between two things – of being an obligation.” I’m flooded with uncomfortable memories of events where I’ve had one foot out the door – mentally, physically or both – because I have tried to cram too much in: “stopping by” at two parties, or accepting a dinner invitation even though I’m on deadline. Seeing my grimace, Liming laughs. “It’s OK, it’s not personal. We all do it.” It is the upshot, she says, of a culture that is continuously pushing us to wring out every bit of value from our days and to “optimise” our lives. Those pressures have filtered down to our friendships. The pandemic hasn’t helped. “It’s like those muscles that I had previously strengthened through social interactions were flabby,” Liming says. Indeed, many people report that their circles have shrunk since Covid-19 – a YouGov survey last year found that 40% of Britons aged 16 and over had lost contact with some of their friends.
Meanwhile, the number of “kinless” adults – those who find themselves without immediate family members in later life – is expected to grow. Yet amid this reported epidemic of loneliness, there is increased understanding that relationships are essential to our mental and physical wellbeing. Social isolation and loneliness can lead to an elevated risk of heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in the US. Liming proposes hanging out as a balm that forges connection and meaning. The first step is is to seek to nourish our relationships – not simply to renew them as we might a TV licence. “You have to set that time aside and make sure you’re doing it justice when you get the opportunity,” she says. That may mean politely declining those invitations you would only be attending out of obligation, so as to free yourself up for the ones that matter. Liming shudders to recall how many colleagues’ and distant school friends’ baby showers she got “roped into” attending in her early 30s. Relationships that we wish to maintain need not only time but space for intimacy, growth and even potential conflict. Liming writes of a disagreement she had recently with an old friend. After three hours, they had found common ground and Liming felt as if their “relationship had grown tougher somehow”. Had either of them been less invested, it might have been tempting to simply let the relationship cool. That is the muscle built by hanging out, says Liming, extending our tolerance for discomfort and our capacity for compassion. It is also about letting go of expectation. Hanging out doesn’t always have to mean “a perfect party scenario or gathering; it can be just OK”. Liming gives the example of her best friend from childhood, who now lives on the opposite coast and has two young children. When they meet Liming goes along with her friend on errands or to appointments. “Just seeing her in her daily life is much more interesting to me than a sort of forced environment,” she says. This is how I too stay connected with faraway friends, who I see on average once every two years. Where I used to try to catch up on everybody’s lives over an evening, as though I was cramming for an exam, my preference now is to dip into a few of them. I have tagged along to my sister’s work drinks, attended friends’ family gatherings, kept them company on their commute. It allows me to picture their days and engage more fully when we are apart. When schedules do not allow for sprawling socialising, or even face-to-face,“hanging out on the internet is just what we have to do”, says Liming. Certainly, in my experience, some digital interactions can be more rewarding than others – a few of my group chats on WhatsApp are nearly as free-flowing a source of entertainment and support as being together in person. This fits Liming’s thesis that hanging out is mostly a mindset, emphasising presence over merely being present.
That can extend to interacting with those whom we often see but don’t count as friends: the staff at our favourite cafe or the familiar faces at the gym. A recent large-scale study found that having a diverse “social portfolio” was predictive of happiness and higher wellbeing. There are certainly risks to striking up conversations with strangers, or even allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with friends, Liming acknowledges. But: “What’s the worst thing that’s going to happen?” In the weeks after we speak, I experiment. I spend Saturday afternoon running errands with one nearby friend, then Sunday morning on Zoom with an old faraway one. I make a point of spacing out my work calls to allow for chat. I leave for yoga 10 minutes early and say hello to the instructor before class. I don’t create any more hours in my day, but I feel the difference. My new schedule allows space for possibility: to run into a friend and not have to rush off, or to receive a last-minute invitation and reply: “I’d love to” – no buts.

221;221;Tyre Nichols’s death: seven officers have been removed from duty, police confirm;2023-01-31T03:12:25Z;['Adam Gabbatt', 'Edwin Rios'];['Tyre Nichols', 'Memphis', 'US policing', 'US news', 'World news', 'US politics', 'Joe Biden'];;"Two more Memphis police officers have been disciplined and three emergency responders fired in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols, officials said on Monday. That brings the total number of officers who have been disciplined to seven, including the five Black officers who were fired and charged last week with second-degree murder and other offenses in Nichols’s beating and 10 January death. Officer Preston Hemphill, who is white, was relieved of duty and put on what is known as administrative leave, the Memphis police major Karen Rudolph said on Monday, according to multiple reports. Later in the day it said another officer had also been relieved, but without naming the person or specifying what role they played in the incident. Rudolph stopped short of saying what role Hemphill had at the scene of Nichols’ deadly beating or whether he would be charged with a crime in connection with the killing, as several other officers have been. But Rudolph said that the investigation into Nichols’s death continued and “more information will be shared as it develops”. In a statement, police said all seven officers had been relieved of duty on 8 January.
Also on Monday, fire department officials announced the firing of the emergency medical technicians Robert Long and JaMicheal Sandridge and Lt Michelle Whitaker in connection with Nichols’s death. The fire chief, Gina Sweat, said in a statement that the department had received a call from police to respond to a report of a person who had been pepper-sprayed, and the workers arrived as Nichols was handcuffed and leaning up against a squad car. Long and Sandridge, based on the nature of the call and information police gave them, “failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr Nichols”, the statement said. Whitaker and the driver remained in the vehicle. An investigation determined that all three had violated “multiple” policies and protocols, the statement said. Hemphill was the third officer at a traffic stop that preceded the violent arrest but was not at the scene where Nichols was beaten, his lawyer Lee Gerald said. Lawyers for the Nichols family asked on Monday why the department had not disclosed the disciplinary action against Hemphill earlier and why he had not been fired or charged. “We have asked from the beginning that the Memphis police department be transparent with the family and the community – this news seems to indicate that they haven’t risen to the occasion,” said the statement from Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci. “It certainly begs the question why the white officer involved in this brutal attack was shielded and protected from the public eye, and, to date, from sufficient discipline and accountability.” News of the additional officers’ removal comes as calls for changes to American policing intensify after Nichols’s death. The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Steven Horsford, said the group of 60 members of Congress had asked to meet with the president this week to “push for negotiations on much-needed national reforms to our justice system – specifically, the actions and conduct of our law enforcement”. The appeal to Biden, who has called on Congress to pass police reforms, came as protests prompted by Nichols’s killing continued in Memphis over the weekend. Nichols, who was Black, died on 10 January, three days after Memphis police officers beat him after a traffic stop. Nichols’s parents, who have been invited to attend Biden’s State of the Union speech on 7 February, said the 29-year-old was driving home after photographing the sunset. Video footage released by Memphis officials last week showed officers kicking and punching Nichols and hitting him with a baton. Five Memphis officers were fired after the attack and have since been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. “No one in our nation should fear interacting with the police officers who serve our diverse communities, large and small,” Horsford, a Democratic congressman from Nevada, said. “We all want to be safe. “Many Black and brown people, however, and many young people in general, are justifiably afraid to interact with law enforcement officials.” Horsford continued: “We are calling on our colleagues in the House and Senate to jumpstart negotiations now and work with us to address the public health epidemic of police violence that disproportionately affects many of our communities. “The brutal beating of Tyre Nichols was murder and is a grim reminder that we still have a long way to go in solving systemic police violence in America.”
The Senate judiciary committee’s chairperson, Dick Durbin, said on Sunday that Congress can pass additional policing measures like “screening, training, accreditation, to up the game so that the people who have this responsibility to keep us safe really are stable and approaching this in a professional manner”. Law enforcement primarily falls under the jurisdiction of states, rather than the federal government. But Durbin said that should not “absolve” Congress from acting. “What we saw on the streets of Memphis was just inhumane and horrible,” he said. “I don’t know what created this – this rage in these police officers that they would congratulate themselves for beating a man to death. But that is literally what happened.” Also on Sunday, Crump called for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The bill, drafted after a Minneapolis police officer murdered Floyd in May 2020, would ban chokeholds, create national standards for policing ostensibly to increase accountability and reform qualified immunity, which shields police officers from civil liability for misconduct. The legislation passed the US House – then controlled by Democrats – in March 2021 but stalled in the Senate. With the House now under Republican control, it remains to be seen whether progress can be made on the bill. Crump told CNN there could be further criminal charges brought against Memphis police while Steve Mulroy, the prosecutor handling the case, said in an interview with the news channel that “nothing we did last Thursday [when the five officers were charged] regarding indictments precludes us from bringing other charges later”. “We are going to need time to allow the investigation to go forward and further consideration of charges,” Mulroy said. The Memphis police department on Saturday announced it would disband its “Scorpion” unit, which was tasked with proactively taking on street crime. The five officers charged over Nichols’s death were all part of the unit. Later that night protesters gathered outside Memphis city hall to mark the victory but said it was just the first step. Local community organizer LJ Abraham said that organizers were still demanding that Memphis police dismantle other taskforces they run – such as the multi-agency gang unit – and transparency in releasing body-camera footage. She showed the Guardian video from 2020 from a woman showing multiple Memphis police kneeling on her husband’s back while they tried to handcuff him, reportedly on his property. “Right now, when somebody is shot by police, we can’t see that video,” Abraham said, adding that four people had been killed by Memphis police since November. “The only reason we got to see Tyre’s footage was because of the manner in which he died.” A New York Times analysis found that police had given Nichols dozens of “contradictory and unachievable orders” during the traffic stop and subsequent beating. In the 13 minutes between officers stopping Nichols and taking him into custody, police shouted at least 71 commands, the Times reported. “Officers commanded Mr Nichols to show his hands even as they were holding his hands,” the Times found. “They told him to get on the ground even when he was on the ground. And they ordered him to reposition himself even when they had control of his body.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/30/congress-police-reform-biden-black-caucus-tyre-nichols-death;guardian;politics;221
3549;3549;NHS in England under more ‘extreme pressure’ than at height of pandemic;2023-01-14T11:10:18Z;['Donna Ferguson'];['NHS', 'UK news', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'Public services policy', 'Politics', 'Jeremy Hunt'];;"The NHS is under more “extreme pressure” than it was at the height of the pandemic and may not recover from the disruption and fallout caused by Covid for another two years, the head of the NHS in England has warned. Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, said the health service was “over-reliant” on foreign staff and called for universities to “ramp up” training places for medical workers to address staff shortages. Pritchard accepted that patients were dying while waiting for urgent and emergency care, after NHS England data showed response times to ambulances fell to the worst on record and a record number of people waited more than 12 hours in A&E departments last month. NHS England data for December showed the average response time for people requiring an ambulance for a stroke, severe burns or chest pain was 93 minutes, five times the operation target of 18 minutes. The higher-priority “life threatening” category was also badly affected in December, with ambulance crews taking almost 11 minutes on average to reach patients – including those suspected of having a heart attack. Pritchard told the Times the NHS was under “extreme pressure … like nothing I have ever experienced” in her 25 years in the health service, and that this was having consequences “not just on patient experience of healthcare but on outcomes as well”. She said: “We all thought Covid would be the most challenging thing for the NHS but actually, I think it arguably is more challenging now.” Pritchard thinks the NHS is still only “about halfway through” the fallout from the pandemic and it could take another two years to recover. “All of us working in the NHS want to do a really good job and my clinical frontline staff really struggle with the fact that they’re not always able to provide the care that they would want to – or that people deserve.” She added that the emotional toll on doctors and nurses was intense: “There are too many people waiting too long.” In November, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he accepted “the picture that the NHS is on the brink of collapse” and that doctors and nurses on the frontline were “frankly under unbearable pressure”. However, he added that “efficiencies” must be found. While there is no “magic wand solutions for the level of pressure the NHS is under”, Pritchard wants the NHS to be “very ambitious” about increasing training places. There are currently more than 133,000 vacancies in the health service. Last year, a survey by the Royal College of Nursing found only a quarter of nursing shifts have the planned number of registered staff on duty – and most nurses reported that staffing levels on their last shift were not sufficient to meet the needs of patients. Universities need to stop turning away “excellent” applicants so that the NHS can recruit more “homegrown” workers and stop spending £3bn a year on “really expensive” agency staff, Pritchard said. “There’s no lack of demand. We are seeing universities having to turn away really excellent people, not just for medical degrees but nursing, therapy – across the board,” she said.
Over the next few years, she wants the NHS to be in a position where it is increasingly able to be self-reliant on having a workforce that would meet demand. “We’d be wanting to get to a place where, excepting unusual circumstances which do arise if people are off sick, we actually have enough staff to be able to cover. That’s very different to the £3bn we spend on agency at the moment.” She added that while she would always welcome foreign-born doctors and nurses, “we have got to a place now where I think, honestly, we are over-reliant on our ability to recruit from overseas”.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/14/nhs-is-under-more-extreme-pressure-than-at-height-of-pandemic-official-says;guardian;health;3549

Bay after bay, bed after bed, is full of sick, sometimes very sick, patients.

They are mostly elderly and look frail. Most have flu, some have COVID, and others have respiratory infections.

The really unlucky ones have a combination of two or more of these viruses. The scene brings back memories of my visits to hospitals full of COVID patients at the height of the pandemic.

One of the ward 23's patients is John Greenwood. He's 92 years old. He lives alone. His wife is in a nursing home.

John woke in the early hours of Sunday morning, barely able to move. He had been struck down by flu.

John's son rushed him to The Royal Preston Hospital. They could not risk waiting two hours for an ambulance.

""When I was young, the way people talked, I just thought people would get healthier and healthier and hospitals won't be required as much,"" John tells me from his hospital bed.

""And it's just gone the opposite.""

'I've never seen anything like this'

Image: The Royal Preston Hospital is under relentless pressure

John has made good progress in his recovery, but is clearly still not fully over his infection.

""When I came in I couldn't take a drink, I couldn't do anything, and I'm getting slightly stronger every day,"" he says.

""I couldn't even use my mobile phone. I still feel very weak.

""I've had to have a bed bath this morning, they said 'can you do it yourself?'""

The ward is operating at 100% capacity, and it has been for some time.

As soon as a bed is vacant, it is filled again with a waiting patient. The pressure is relentless.

Professor Mohammed Munavvar says he has never seen a winter like it.

""I have been here as a respiratory consultant on this ward on this hospital for 24 years, and I've never, ever seen anything like this before,"" he says.

One of the worst winters ever for the NHS

Professor Munavvar is one of northwest England's most senior respiratory consultants.

His expertise helped this hospital to navigate the hospital through the peak of the pandemic. His skill is being tested again as the NHS buckles under one of the worst winters ever.

But this winter, he says, is the worst he's ever seen.

""You've got a COVID bay, you've got influenza patients, you've got COVID again after that,"" he says, and worries that this pressure will impact hospital waiting lists.

""If we focus our time and efforts on our acute hospital then we have less time to do our other jobs, which are seeing patients in the clinics, doing procedures and endoscopy units in theatres,"" he says.

""So already with the two-three year backlog that has developed thanks to COVID, we were trying to play catch-up, we were trying to clear some of that backlog, now this will set us back again.""

Strikes bringing even more woe

And this is why the small positive from this month's NHS performance figures, of the elective waiting list for England falling from 7.21 million to 7.19 million, is unlikely to be repeated next month.

The data represents November last year, ahead of the flu season and before the industrial action by health workers.

More dates are set to be announced by ambulance workers, and the British Medical Association, the doctors' union, is balloting its members on strike action.

Ambulance response times and waking times for treating continue to climb. This is because of rising demand and the inability of ambulances to discharge their patients because there is little or no capacity inside the hospital.

This is largely due to the delayed discharge of patients who have no social care package in place.

The government's plan to buy up care home beds has been criticised by some health leaders as too little too late.

In the short term at least, it is hoped it will create some capacity to ease the pressure.

There are also indications that COVID and flu infections are beginning to fall.

This has happened for two consecutive weeks now, so earlier fears that the figures might not give the true picture because of the Christmas holidays might be unfounded. Still, it is too early to say for sure.

8073;8073;F-16 fighter jets: What are they and could they be sent to help Ukraine?;Monday 23 January 2023 15:40, UK;['michael drummond', '@mikerdrummond'];['ukraine'];['jets', 'ingram', 'systems', 'f16', 'western', 'help', 'tanks', 'ukraine', 'f16s', 'aircraft', 'russian', 'sent', 'fighter'];"Could F-16 fighter jets soon be screaming over Kharkiv or breaking the sound barrier as they tear through the skies above Zaporizhzhia?

It once seemed impossible, but now? Maybe not.

As the Western world looks to Germany for a decision over Leopard 2 tanks, it was from the Netherlands that a possibly more radical idea was floated: sending Western-made fighter planes to Kyiv for use by Ukrainian pilots.

The Dutch cabinet said will look into supplying F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine if the Kyiv government asks for them, the country's media have reported.

During a parliamentary debate last week, foreign affairs minister Wopke Hoekstra said the cabinet would look at such a request with an ""open mind"".

So what are F-16s and what could they be used for? And what other weapons could be donated to Ukraine in the coming months?

F-16 Fighting Falcon

A highly manoeuvrable fighter jet, the F-16 is versatile and can reach speeds of more than 1,200mph.

It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low-flying aircraft in radar ground clutter, the US says.

In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles, deliver its payload with high accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point.

The Netherlands - a member of NATO - is one of a number of countries worldwide that flies F-16s as part of its air force.

""I think it's likely that we'll start to see more Western military aircraft being given to Ukraine - Ukrainians need it,"" former intelligence officer Philip Ingram tells Sky News.

He said the difficulty is that pilots can't just switch from flying one aircraft to another - especially at the intensity of live combat operations.

""But what we're finding across the board with the Ukrainians coming in and learning to take over and operate Western equipment is they're doing in weeks what it takes months for Western pilots to do,"" Mr Ingram added.

Asked about what the impact of a squadron of F-16s piloted by Ukrainians would be, he said it would have a psychological effect on Russian forces.

""They're up against a system that they know can outmatch them at any stage,"" he said, arguing that it would push Russian air operations further back.

Image: Will Polish MiG-29 fighters be sent to Ukraine?

Mikoyan MiG-29

The Soviet-designed MiG-29 is already used by the Ukrainian air force and serves as a multi-role fighter plane.

The collapse and breakup of the Soviet Union mean a number of European countries have stocks of MiG-29s, including Poland.

In March last year, just weeks after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland offered to supply its entire fleet of MiG-29s to Kyiv in return for F-16s from the US.

At the time the Pentagon said the offer was not ""tenable"" and ""raises serious concerns for the NATO alliance"".

However in the months since then Ukraine has mounted hugely successful counterattacks and many heavy weapons that were maybe once considered off the table - HIMARS and tanks, for example - have been donated to Kyiv.

A potential issue for the Polish MiG-29s, Mr Ingram says, is that they have been upgraded to run NATO communications systems that would potentially need to be removed to prevent them falling into Russian hands.

Asked about a possible timeline for F-16s, MiG-29s or other fixed-wing aircraft for Ukraine, Mr Ingram pointed to the next Ramstein air base meeting in mid-February which is expected to focus on aviation.

ATACMS long-range missiles

Ukraine has long been calling for more and longer-range missile systems as they continue to strike targets deep behind Russian lines.

The arrival of the HIMARS rocket system was arguably one of the biggest developments in the war and has undoubtedly played a huge role in underpinning Ukraine's counteroffensives.

With a range of around 190 miles Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) would be a step up in range from the HIMARS being used in Ukraine, which has a range of around 50 miles.

On a visit to Kyiv last week with two other US senators, Richard Blumenthal urged the Biden administration to supply Ukraine with tanks, artillery, and ATACMS missile systems, as well as planes.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had resisted earlier calls from opposition parties to sack Mr Zahawi following reports that the Tory chairman had paid a penalty as part of an estimated £4.8m settlement dispute with HMRC.

He had instead asked his new ethics adviser - Sir Laurie Magnus - to assess whether the settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.

In a letter written by Sir Laurie to the PM this morning following the conclusion of the investigation, the ethics adviser said Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the Ministerial Code"" and not fulfilled the requirements of being an ""honest, open and an exemplary leader"".

In a second letter written by the PM to Mr Zahawi following Sir Laurie's findings, Mr Sunak said it is ""clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code"" and announced the removal of the Tory chairman from his ministerial position.

Zahawi fired as Tory party chairman - politics latest

Mr Zahawi had faced pressure in recent days to quit as questions swirled about his finances even after he released a statement to ""clear up some of the confusion"".

He admitted he paid what HM Revenue & Customs said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in the YouGov polling company he co-founded, an error he said was ""careless"" not deliberate.

But he did not disclosed the size of the settlement or whether he paid a fine.

In the correspondence to Mr Sunak released by Downing Street, Sir Laurie said his overall judgement was that the ""omissions"" by Mr Zahawi regarding his tax affairs ""constitute a serious failure to meet the standards set out in the ministerial code"".

In the four-page report to Mr Sunak, dated 29 January, Sir Laurie says:

• Mr Zahawi's contact with HMRC began in April 2021 but he did not declare it

• He failed to declare the ongoing HMRC investigation when appointed as education secretary in October 2021

• The Tory chairman still did not mention the probe when appointed as chancellor in July 2022

• His ""delay in correcting an untrue public statement"" made in July 2022 - in which he said reports were ""inaccurate, unfair and clearly smears"" - was ""inconsistent with the requirement for openness""

• Mr Zahawi reached an in-principle settlement with HMRC in August 2022 - with a settlement in September 2022 along with a penalty - which was not disclosed until January 2023

• Mr Zahawi ""failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict"" by not declaring HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022

• The Tory chairman ""should have understood"" that HMRC were investigating ""a serious matter""

• He ""failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment""

• The cabinet office ""was not in a position to inform the appointing prime minister"" about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs as he failed to disclose the relevant information to the department

• Mr Zahawi's conduct ""has fallen below the high standards"" that a PM should expect from ministers

• The Tory chairman showed ""insufficient regard"" for the Ministerial Code

Informing Mr Zahawi of his decision to remove him from government, Mr Sunak wrote: ""When I became prime minister last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.

""That is why, following new information which came to light in recent days regarding your personal financial arrangements and declarations, I asked Sir Laurie Magnus, the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests, to fully investigate this matter.

""You agreed and undertook to cooperate fully with the inquiry.

""Following the completion of the independent adviser's investigation - the findings of which he has shared with us both - it is clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code.

""As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's Government.""

The PM added that Mr Zahawi should be ""extremely proud"" of his ""wide-ranging achievements in government over the last five years"", particularly crediting his ""successful oversight of the COVID-19 vaccine procurement and deployment programme"".

The row surrounding Mr Zahawi had centred on a tax bill over the sale of shares in YouGov - the polling firm he founded - worth an estimated £27 million and which were held by Balshore Investments, a company registered offshore in Gibraltar and linked to Mr Zahawi's family.

Mr Zahawi had insisted he was ""confident"" he had ""acted properly throughout"".

But in a letter to Mr Sunak following his sacking - in which he made no apology for his actions - Mr Zahawi told the PM he can be ""assured of my support from the backbenches in the coming years"".

He added that he is concerned ""about the conduct from some of the fourth estate in recent weeks"", in a reference to the media.

Mr Zahawi said: ""It has been, after being blessed with my loving family, the privilege of my life to serve in successive governments and make what I believe to have been a tangible difference to the country I love.""

He added: ""I am sorry to my family for the toll this has taken on them.

""Your five priorities are the right priorities, and I will do whatever I can to help you deliver them.""

Speaking shortly after Mr Zahawi's sacking, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove told reporters Mr Sunak had taken ""decisive action"" following the publication of Sir Laurie's report.

But Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson told Sky News the PM should have sacked Mr Zahawi before now.

The seven-year-old, 70lb boxer mix saved from a dog-fighting ring has now been adopted following a highly successful online auction of his “masterpieces”, created by Van Gogh licking peanut butter and liverwurst from a plastic bag and smearing the paint on the canvas below.
The Happily Furever After rescue center of Bethel, having crafted an artistic new way of attracting publicity, is planning another exhibition next month to try to find homes for its remaining gallery of animals. “It’s a beautiful thing because [people] are not only supporting the rescue, but they are supporting the dog,” Jaclyn Gartner, founder of the organization and art show curator, told Fox News digital. “For him, [painting] is enrichment and a treat. He enjoys doing it.” Gartner said there was little interest in Van Gogh after he arrived last summer from a shelter in North Carolina. A suspected bait dog for a fighting ring, he was found abandoned, injured and bleeding in a drainage pipe, leading to the amputation of his left ear. His first in-person “art show” at the shelter was poorly attended, leading Gartner to place his paintings for sale online. Assisted by a viral TikTok video that attracted 300,000 views, Van Gogh’s artwork sold out immediately, and he even picked up some private commissions. After seven months with a foster family, Van Gogh also earned an adoption application from his new owner, Jessica Starowitz, who had promised to allow him to continue painting his post-impressionist pieces. Like his 19th-century Dutch namesake, one of the world’s most famous artists who created about 900 oil paintings in his lifetime, including Sunflowers and The Starry Night, the canine Van Gogh is prolific, Gartner said. He has recently completed his 140th work. Starowitz told Fox that Van Gogh had experienced a lot of trauma, and was currently “working on his manners” and learning to be more comfortable around other dogs. Gartner also said that unlike the real Van Gogh, whose recognition came only after his death in 1890, the dog gets to enjoy the fruits of his labors. “He is properly compensated for his work in toys and treats,” she said in the video.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/14/one-eared-rescue-dog-paintings-van-gogh;guardian;entertainment & culture;3567

In Wales, there were seven flood warnings and 34 alerts, while in Scotland there were two and seven respectively.

The Met Office has issued a separate yellow weather warning for wind and rain covering parts of Northern Ireland and southern Scotland until early Sunday, where gusts on the coast could reach up to 70mph.

Andy Page, from the Met Office, said: ""After what has already been a wet start to January, further wet and windy conditions will move across the UK this weekend.

""With the ground already saturated in parts of the UK this additional rainfall could bring disruption, particularly in the West.""

As low pressure moves away into the North Sea, it will pull down cooler air into Sunday, leading to lower temperatures and the likelihood of widespread overnight frosts and northerly winds generating a notable ""wind chill"".

The prospect of the return of wintry weather has led to a yellow warning to be issued for ice covering much of Scotland and northern England.

A warning of snow and ice remains in force for the far north of Scotland until Wednesday.

3225;3225;‘Nurses have cried with me’: Pat Cullen on strikes, 16-hour shifts and colleagues who can’t afford shoes;2023-01-16T10:00:03Z;['Zoe Williams'];['Nursing', 'Industrial action', 'NHS', 'Politics', 'Health', 'Society', 'Trade unions', 'UK news'];;"When Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, had her first meeting with Steve Barclay, the health secretary, in November last year, her union had just been balloted on strike action. “We’d just got our mandate,” she says, speaking at the RCN’s office in central London, an august building full of plaques. “And our results were really significant. So I knew that we had one opportunity to prevent a strike that was going to be enormous – the largest nursing strike in the world.” Cullen is warm yet formidable, with a calm, level manner, but an unsettling habit of really listening and weighing her words. There are no dead zones in her sentences, which puts you on your mettle – although it didn’t, apparently, have that effect on Barclay. “It was an introductory meeting, collegiate and respectful,” she says. They talked through many of the wider problems affecting nurses: the high levels of violence and aggression that they face from patients and what might be driving that; the incidence of sexual assault in the workplace in a predominantly female profession; systemic racism. Barclay listened intently. “And then I said to him: ‘Look, the elephant in the room is pay. If we are to try and prevent the strike action, we need to get round the table and talk about this.’ And he said: ‘You have to understand, economically it’s very challenging. But let’s talk.’ Then he got up and left.” The RCN is arguing for a pay rise of 5% above retail price inflation, which is currently at 14%, but Cullen says that after a decade of intermittent public sector wage freezes nurses “were on the back foot starting off this period, their pay having dropped by almost 20% [in real terms]. This government has lambasted us for asking for 5% above the rate of inflation, but it’s actually the restoration of their pay. It’s not really a pay increase, when you think about it.” Not every service in England reached the turnout threshold – 50% – for strike action, although all of Scotland’s and Northern Ireland’s did, plus all of Wales’s bar one. “And those organisations that didn’t make the thresholds that this Tory government has put in place, in many of those areas we missed it by a handful of votes,” Cullen says. “They’re now in constant contact, asking us to reballot them.” She wasn’t bluffing: the nursing staff in large parts of the NHS were about to go on strike for the first time in the RCN’s 106-year history (although nurses in Northern Ireland had led the way three years earlier).
December arrived and Barclay called a second meeting. “The line was drawn for us as soon as we walked in the door: ‘We’re not here to talk about pay.’ I continued to talk about pay and said: ‘It’s two nights before the strike. Are you going to negotiate with me?’ I did most of the talking. He closed his books. And he and his team said: ‘We can talk about non-monetary issues, but we’re not talking about pay,’ and walked away. He didn’t say this, but I certainly left thinking: the PRB [pay review body] is more important to this man than the NHS. And more important than patients. And certainly more important than the nursing profession.” The PRB had recommended increases in its previous round. Cullen had been travelling the “depth and breadth of England” since September – “every hospital, practically. And I spoke to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of nursing staff, on the wards and in their departments and in their communities. And I came away thinking things were even more challenging than I thought they were.” As long ago as 2017, Theresa May was asked on air to admit that it was “surely wrong” that nurses were having to use food banks; the general assumption that they are probably doing OK is long gone. But, Cullen says, the cost of living crisis has brought this to a new level. “Some of those nurses cried with me. They walked with me and showed me food banks that they were reduced to using. They talked to me about the fears they had about their children going back to school and they couldn’t afford their shoes; about [hospital] trusts setting up uniform exchange arrangements for them, so that they could get secondhand uniforms for their children. It was heartbreaking. I can’t emphasise enough how much our nurses are struggling every single day just to keep themselves afloat.”
Every nurse I have spoken to – as well as some people working in social care – has colleagues who have left for retail jobs, despite their high levels of often specialist training, because it is paid equally well, with better conditions and much less jeopardy. “We have 47,000 unfilled posts,” Cullen says. “Can you imagine being a ward sister, coming in to 40 very ill patients at six o’clock this morning? Out of those 40 patients, you’re actually staffed for 25. The rest are on corridors and half your workforce is missing. You’re spending your morning trying to ring your current staff that have just left the hospital, begging them to come back and work a few more hours. It’s dreadful. It’s absolutely dreadful. And this government has just turned their back on them.” Until very recently – more on that later – Rishi Sunak echoed Barclay’s approach, saying there was no scope for pay increases and therefore very little to negotiate. The intransigence has been noted by many unions, across multiple sectors, who sound almost surprised by it. One Unite negotiator, Onay Kasab, described his conversation as “an insult to every single one of our members”. Ministers seem to be taking a novel position: that unions are much like kidnappers and sensible people never negotiate with them. What they might not know is that Cullen has spent her life negotiating – and previous opponents were probably tougher. The 58-year-old came into nursing in 1982, inspired by her mother’s care for her learning-disabled sister. She has four other sisters, also nurses, and a brother. Her father died when she was 13 and her mother was keen that they all “got a government job and saw the world”. They lived in a very Republican village in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles and her mother was worried they would “get into the politics”. In turn, Cullen tried to badger her son, 32, and her daughter, 27, into nursing; both refused. (He is a plastic surgeon and she is a teacher.) Their father, Enda Cullen, is a GP. Cullen started in Belfast as a mental health nurse. “You spend a lot of your time negotiating with patients, through very challenging periods in their lives and very challenging behaviour,” she says. “I would have been nursing people who would have displayed very high levels of aggression, particularly when I moved on to work in forensic mental health and prisoner healthcare.” One of her earliest campaigns – as an individual, rather than through the RCN, although she has been a member throughout her career – was to stop mentally ill patients having their belongings taken away over behavioural infractions, which she thought was an insult to their dignity. “I don’t deal well with injustice. When it stares me in the face and I know it’s wrong, I can’t let it pass by.”
In the 80s, she could see the impact of the Troubles on people’s mental health all around her. “Even as civilians living through the conflict, we could always see the need to negotiate and to get around a table and work things through and come to an agreement,” she says. “That was just something we did, from negotiating ourselves through army checkpoints, coming and going when we were at school, to trying to make a 7am shift, running late, having three checkpoints to get through.” It explains her manner – emollient but doughty – and it also makes me worry a bit for her adversaries. She isn’t a woman who wants to give up. She is a woman who wants to get to work. While nurses saw their pay erode over the past decade, Covid heaped on a different kind of pressure. Cullen is careful not to blame everything on the pandemic, because she thinks it takes the spotlight off policymakers’ long-term mismanagement of the NHS. Undeniably, though, Covid has left its mark. “I have never seen the health and wellbeing of our nurses so poor. Every single nurse gave everything they had during a pandemic – everything,” she says. “They worked night and day, moved out from their families, went and lived in makeshift hotels. Some of them slept in the hospitals. They worked in the most incredible conditions in intensive care, some of them working 14- or 16-hour shifts, without the proper equipment, going into situations that were unknown to every single one of us and fearing for their own lives.” Many nurses have been diagnosed with PTSD since Covid emerged; many others were killed by the disease. At the start of the pandemic, Cullen was the RCN’s director in Northern Ireland. She vividly remembers having to drive from place to place, looking for any PPE they could find. “And we all got a clap on the doorstep. But on the day that the pandemic is supposedly over – it’s not over – those nurses don’t just return to normal health. Their health has significantly suffered, emotionally and physically. They are absolutely exhausted. They’ve had to get up, dust themselves off and get on with the next crisis. But this is even worse: they’re heading into it with totally depleted physical and psychological systems. They can’t do it.” She was in her previous post when the nurses of Northern Ireland had their first ever strike, in 2019. About that decision, she says: “It’s not me that’s taking an industrial action. It’s our nursing staff.” Let’s go back to all that clapping. “By the government, it was all veneer,” Cullen says. “It was the right thing to do at the time, to stand out and clap on the doorsteps of Downing Street and elsewhere. But there is no doubt that, very quickly, the claps became slaps, and they have slapped those nurses now as hard as they possibly can, and left them behind. Every single nurse sees it, every single nurse believes it.” But public regard for nurses has always been – and remains – extremely high. “The public believes in nursing because nursing believes in the public,” Cullen says.
Nurses are an extremely hard group to demonise, even when they are on strike. The RCN raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for its hardship fund in donations from the general public in a matter of weeks. Carmel O’Boyle, an RCN branch and board chair, describes people joining the nurses on picket lines and bringing food with them, “because, in the north-west, people know how to join a picket line”. They ended up with so much food that, even after they had made parcels for the people losing their day’s wage, they donated most of it to a food bank. So the government’s starting position – that nurses can safely be ignored – never looked like it would get past public opinion. Earlier this month, Sunak began to realise that, floating the possibility of a one-off hardship payment. “The first we saw of it was through the media,” Cullen says. “And yet they say: ‘We won’t negotiate through the media.’” This proposal doesn’t look likely to cut it: “I find that insulting to those nurses. It’s almost a charitable approach,” Cullen says. “And it’s not going to allow us to retain or recruit nurses. There’s no workforce plan in place for nursing. There’s no strategic planning anywhere in the health service. It’s all just reactive stuff. And that’s symptomatic of how this government makes decisions. They make on-the-hoof decisions to try and get them over the next couple of weeks.”
If Sunak meets the nurses’ union even halfway, he will be gambling on the hope that he can pick them off as the people’s favourite striking workforce and it won’t affect his negotiations with other sectors. Structurally, he might have a chance – the RCN is not affiliated to the Labour party and not a member of the Trades Union Congress. “At the same time, we fully believe and support what other trade unions are trying to do and stand by them,” says Cullen. “And if you think of the ambulance strike at the minute, what they’re looking for is exactly what we’re looking for: to improve the lives of their workers and to make sure that we run an NHS that is fit for purpose. “Is this the total demise of the health service? Is this where we consign the NHS to the history books to say this is what we had and we didn’t look after it?” Her “No way!” is silent.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/16/nurses-have-cried-with-me-pat-cullen-on-strikes-16-hour-shifts-and-colleagues-who-cant-afford-shoes;guardian;health;3225

A thriving peach farm in the rural heartland of Catalonia is also the fertile earth that sustains multiple generations of an extended family. It’s the repository of the stories passed down from weathered grannies in funereal black cardigans to each fresh branch of an ever-spreading ancestral tree. It’s the launchpad for games of imagination for Iris (Ainet Jounou) and her semi-feral twin cousins. It’s a perpetual battleground: the men patrol at night with shotguns and spotlights, alert for rabbit incursions into the orchards. And it’s on borrowed time. At the start of Carla Simón’s terrific second feature (her first was the equally impressive 2017 drama Summer 1993) a bombshell drops: after the death of his father, the new owner of the land does not intend to honour the gentleman’s agreement that permitted the family to cultivate it for the last three generations. They can keep their house, he says. But after this year’s harvest, the trees will be grubbed out and replaced by solar panels. It’s such a devastating blow that it’s hard for the family members to comprehend. So at first, life carries on as normal, denial temporarily damming up the realities that will change the land beyond recognition. But Simón’s acute eye shows how stress fractures appear in the family; how a domestic ecosystem can be as precariously balanced as a natural one.

6909;6909;Cardinal George Pell, who was acquitted of child sexual abuse, has died aged 81;Wednesday 11 January 2023 03:34, UK;[];['vatican city'];['figure', '81', 'child', 'cardinal', 'george', 'abuse', 'aged', 'catholic', 'died', 'conservative', 'acquitted', 'rome', 'pell', 'australian', 'sexual', 'melbourne', 'roman'];"Cardinal George Pell has died aged 81.

The Australian clergyman was a leading Roman Catholic conservative and former top official at the Vatican.

Pell, a former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney, served as Vatican economy minister from 2014 until he took a leave of absence in 2017 to return to Australia to face charges of sexual abuse.

In 2018 he was convicted of molesting two choirboys at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne when he was archbishop of the diocese in the 1990s.

Always maintaining his innocence, he spent 13 months in prison until his conviction was quashed by the Australian High Court in 2020.

The ruling allowed the then 78-year-old to walk free, ending the case of the most senior figure accused in the global scandal of historical sex abuse that rocked the Roman Catholic Church worldwide.

Even before the sexual assault allegations, Pell was a polarising figure in the two decades that he dominated the Australian Catholic hierarchy - revered by conservative Catholics but disliked by liberals for his opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion and women's ordination.

Pell had been living in Rome since his acquittal in 2020.

His private secretary, Fr Joseph Hamilton, said that he died in Rome on Tuesday.

1511;1511;The media exploited Amy Winehouse’s life. A new biopic looks set to do the same with her death;2023-01-24T16:15:01Z;"[""Shaad D'Souza""]";['Music', 'Culture', 'Biopics', 'Pop and rock', 'Amy Winehouse', 'Film', 'Sam Taylor-Johnson'];;"It’s only been a week since Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black began filming in London, but the backlash has already come thick and fast. Over the weekend, pictures of Marisa Abela and Eddie Marsan in character as Amy and her father, Mitch Winehouse, made their way on to Twitter. The reaction was one of pure vitriol, with one particularly viral tweet describing the images of Abela, looking cartoonishly distraught in a halloween costume-level approximation of Winehouse’s trademark beehive, as “fucking revolting”: 34,000 likes and 3,500 quote tweets seemed to agree with the sentiment.
It’s hard to judge a film before even a single frame has been officially released, but it’s understandable that the set photos touched a nerve. In recent years, Winehouse’s troubled life and entirely preventable death have become emblematic of the ways that the entertainment and media industries fail young stars. Winehouse was a hugely talented musician who seemed to be surrounded by people more intent on wringing money from her than protecting her mental or physical health; this July marks 12 years since she died, and in that time, it would seem that the music industry has hardly become a more hospitable place for female musicians. In recent years, many stars of Winehouse’s stature have disclosed similar struggles with drug abuse and disordered eating to those experienced by the singer during her lifetime. Much of her career was a media circus, with tabloids and commentators fixating on her weight, her substance abuse issues and her public meltdowns. The stark images of Abela on set feel like they play into the very same voyeuristic impulses that led to Winehouse’s decline. (Distressing, too, are Abela’s comments on her “really positive” experience of losing weight to play Winehouse, which include no mention of the singer’s bulimia.)
Is it possible to make a biopic about an exploited young star that isn’t itself exploitative? I would argue probably not. So often, it feels as if people enjoy biopics because they scratch the same itch as true crime – there seems to be a gory fascination with seeing the pitiful depths of human existence. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be made, necessarily: I enjoyed Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, despite it also being a story of exploitation and decline, because I felt it raised interesting questions about the relationship between art and commerce, and seemed to be as much about Luhrmann as it was about Elvis. The difference is that Elvis died some 45 years ago and he enjoyed a long, successful career before his death; as did Freddie Mercury, whose 2018 biopic Bohemian Rhapsody supercharged Hollywood’s interest in films about musicians. Meanwhile it’s likely that there are even some teenagers for whom Winehouse’s death is fresh in the mind. Her career essentially lasted just six or seven years, and for many of them she was pilloried by the public, slandered in the press and battling her own personal demons. There’s hardly anything for Taylor-Johnson’s film to document that wouldn’t simply replicate the painful, indelible images that characterised Winehouse’s life, such as those of her fighting with paparazzi or struggling through a “comeback” performance in Serbia. The crowd-pleasing imperatives of big-budget biopics too often attempt to have it both ways when it comes to portraying tragedy and success: I Wanna Dance With Somebody, the recent Whitney Houston biopic, ends with the late musician drawing the bath that she would die in before fading to a flashback of a past performance, a strangely wan and strikingly inelegant final note.
Biopics shouldn’t have to spin a positive or sanitised narrative – needless to say, the woefully hagiographic Bohemian Rhapsody makes a strong case against it – but to make a film about Winehouse’s short, troubled life simply feels like adding insult to injury. Add to that the fact that the production is endorsed by Mitch Winehouse – who is depicted in the 2015 documentary Amy, which he later went to great lengths to discredit, as one of the many exploitative figures in his daughter’s life – and it’s hard to picture what Back to Black may offer beyond trauma porn that seeks to flatter those who witnessed his daughter’s decline and did nothing to prevent it. While some films, such as the New York Times’ shocking documentary on Britney Spears’s conservatorship, have genuinely acted as pieces of needle-shifting journalism, there’s little to suggest that this film isn’t just part of a recent cottage industry of films – 2021’s What Happened, Brittany Murphy? and Britney vs Spears among them – that seek to make money off the back of historical exploitation under the guise of serious film-making. Adding to Hollywood’s interest in these kinds of films is the fact that celebrities themselves seem to be champing at the bit to play tragic stars, perhaps because of how well those roles play with awards bodies – Spears slammed Millie Bobby Brown for saying she wanted to play her in a biopic, while The White Lotus star Theo James has been talking about his interest in portraying George Michael in a forthcoming project, which Michael’s estate has disavowed.
Ultimately, it feels as if Back to Black is symptomatic of an entertainment industry that refuses to let the dead rest. Every year, major labels pump out new songs featuring demo vocals from dead artists such as Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion and Lil Peep; the DJ Kygo had a hit in 2019 with a version of Higher Love using old Houston vocals; in 2019, Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly were reanimated as holograms, and went on an extensive double-headline tour. In 2015, it seemed like Universal, Winehouse’s label, was attempting to avoid that fate for the late star by destroying her demos so that nobody could attempt to cash in on her works-in-progress. More recently, it had begun to feel as if she was finally being remembered not as a purely tragic figure but as a generational talent who released two cherished records – and someone who wasn’t purely self-destructive, but a victim of systematic abuse and mental illness. Back to Black threatens not to honour that legacy, but to revive all the demeaning noise that obscured it in the first place.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/24/back-to-black-new-amy-winehouse-biopic-sam-taylor-johnson-marisa-abela;guardian;entertainment & culture;1511

Dyer - who is the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer - shot to fame on the 2018 series of Love Island, which she won with former partner Jack Fincham.

Following her split from Fincham, Dyer rekindled her relationship with ex-partner Kimmence, who she had dated before appearing on Love Island. She gave birth to their son Santi on 23 January 2021.

She later separated from Kimmence who was jailed for three and a half years in 2021 for defrauding two pensioners out of more than £34,000.

123;123;How to get the tang of citrus without using fruit | Kitchen aide;2023-01-31T14:00:00Z;['Anna Berrill'];['Fruit', 'Chefs', 'Food'];;"I have a citrus intolerance, so an awful lot of recipes are off limits. What can I substitute for it? Jane, Hoole, Chester Citrus brings welcome sharpness, sweetness and freshness to food, cutting through the rich, buttery dishes that winter so often calls for. But when life doesn’t give you lemons (or limes, oranges and grapefruit), Ravinder Bhogal suggests looking to the Middle Eastern spice sumac. “It’s sharp and sherbetty in a similar way to lemon,” says the regular Guardian columnist and chef-patron of Jikoni in London. “If you were making a dip, for example, and couldn’t use lemon, finish it with sumac and you’ll get the same level of acidity.” Peter Sanchez-Iglesias, chef-founder of Casa and Paco Tapas in Bristol, and executive chef at Decimo in London, agrees. He sprinkles sumac (and a drizzle of olive oil) over cooked fish: “That, for me, is the closest you can get to replicating that citrus flavour. I put it on everything: rice, eggs, salad ...” The latter is a particularly good pairing with sumac, says Chaya Pugh, development chef at the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, both in the dressing or mixed with seeds to sprinkle on top. (Spoiler alert: “Later this year, we’re doing a watermelon recipe in the paper where, instead of using citrus juice, we mix sumac with sugar, salt and chilli for a tangy, sweet, spicy, sprinkly thing.”) Alternatively, Sanchez-Iglesias peps up salads with pickle juice, be that from kimchi, pickled onions or even pickled eggs: “Use a little of the liquid to make the dressing.” Tamarind could also be used to get the citrus-free sharpness Jane is looking for. Bhogal says: “If you’re making a curry that calls for lime juice, say, you could get away with adding a teaspoon or so of tamarind instead – but keep tasting as you add it.” Other fruity little numbers to explore are pineapple juice, which is “a wonderful tenderiser” that’s “perfect with meat, especially pork belly”; sour plums (pickled or Japanese umeboshi), which Pugh chops or blitzes before adding to soups, stuffings and roasts; and passion fruit juice – “Use that to make curd, so you don’t miss out.” John Javier, executive chef at The Tent (at the End of the Universe) in central London, meanwhile, is a fan of verjus, which is made by pressing under-ripened grapes. It’s tart and acidic, but less so than vinegar (which we’ll get to), and, for Javier, much more than a citrus substitute: “In some cases, it’s better,” he insists. “I season cold broths and raw fish with it, and it’s also good in sauces [think beurre blanc]. Verjus has a strong flavour, though, so start with a small amount.” It also works a dream in granita. (Speaking of desserts, if you’re hankering for drizzle cake, Pugh suggests swapping citrus for pomegranate molasses in the icing.) Vinegars, of course, are another useful tool for bringing acidity, contrast and balance to the party – and there are so many to choose from. “If you’re looking for a sweet sharpness, go for red-wine or sherry vinegar,” Bhogal says. “For something fruity, try apple cider vinegar. And if you’re making a mustard dressing, go for champagne or white-wine vinegar.” Or, she adds, simply crack open a bottle of white wine to cut through a risotto or fish stew, and pour yourself a glass while you’re at it.

527;527;Retired early and wondering what to do? How about fighting for the rest of us? | Emma Beddington;2023-01-29T14:00:51Z;['Emma Beddington'];['Work & careers', 'Retirement age', 'Older people', 'Money', 'Society', 'Guardian Careers', 'Pay', 'Pensions', 'Poverty', 'Family finances', 'Social exclusion'];;"‘Where have all the workers gone?” asked a House of Lords report last month. The title evokes an image of peers looking around crossly for the 565,000 missing economically active people in much the same way I do for my nail clippers, but actually, the report is perfectly sensible and interesting. It covers Brexit and ill-health, but the trend that emerges most strongly is a reversal of the previous long-term one: people in the 50-to-64 age bracket are leaving the labour market. Spin the wheel of over-analysed work microtrends and you might not have expected to land on “silver quitting” (another report went for “the great retirement”, less catchily), but a growing body of evidence suggests that is exactly what has happened in Britain. Why? It doesn’t look, from the research, as if it’s a question of ill-health or that they were pushed out; rather, it’s mainly “a lifestyle choice”. “These people express no desire to work and do not expect to work again” as the lords put it. That “great retirement” report, from the longer-life thinktank Phoenix Insights, also found “the main reason people in the UK were leaving the workforce was because they no longer wanted to work”. Predictably, it’s middle and higher earners, and two-thirds are mortgage-free; you need financial security to make that kind of lifestyle choice. “Experiments with a different lifestyle during the pandemic meant that people learnt more about their preferences for retirement versus work,” the House of Lords theorised. That dovetails with the Phoenix finding that the percentage of those saying they just don’t fancy it any more has increased since the pandemic. So, thanks to Covid, a specific slice of the population got an existential shock and a taste of how nice solvent retirement could be, gathered their colleagues around a Colin the Caterpillar cake, took the John Lewis vouchers and ran. Does that mean my late-40s cohort takes on “oldest person in the workplace” responsibilities? Have they left handover notes? We are way too tired for wisdom. It comes against a backdrop of panicky, cash-strapped governments worldwide trying to get us to work longer. Reports last week suggested that the UK state pension age could rise to 68 sooner than planned. I doubt we would even react – if we aren’t on the streets for public-sector pay, corruption or 200 missing asylum-seeking children, this surely wouldn’t fire us up. Compare and contrast with France, where Macron’s proposal to raise the retirement age to 64 triggered epic protests. Work can be great: the majority of silver quitters said they liked their jobs, but equally a word cloud of their thoughts on work read: “Boring tiring stress necessary MONEY”. Yes. Nothing is going right with mine recently: I’ve got the shakes, I’m eating like an urban gull, exercising only by running for trains and socialising – if you can call it that – solely through the medium of expletive-strewn WhatsApps. And my job is one of the easy ones. I love what I do, but it gave me pause to read research from China that suggested eating well, seeing friends twice a week and exercising regularly may slow the rate of memory decline and reduce the risk of dementia. We all deserve the opportunity not to work while we’re still capable of enjoying it. This early-retirement phenomenon is the product of one-off demographic good fortune – younger people don’t have the assets and governments aren’t planning to let us pack it all in – which leaves a lucky bunch of 50-to-64-year-old unicorns cantering off into the sunset. Good for them for not doing what it was assumed they would do and working until they dropped. And how admirable to take the life lessons of Covid and act upon them: run free, unicorns. But if we don’t benefit from your taxes now, and you have more time on your hands, here is a suggestion. How about using some of that new freedom and energy to take a crash course in protest techniques, then come and man the barricades to help everyone else enjoy a bit of what you’re having? • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/retired-early-and-wondering-what-to-do-how-about-fighting-for-the-rest-of-us;guardian;entertainment & culture;527
174;174;Once Manchester City’s sibling, NYC FC is now more like a distant cousin;2023-01-31T09:00:41Z;['Graham Ruthven'];['MLS', 'New York City FC', 'Manchester City', 'Football', 'Sport', 'US sports'];;"Before New York City FC, there was only Manchester City under the City Football Group (CFG) umbrella. The establishment of Major League Soccer’s 20th franchise in 2013 marked the creation of a new global soccer entity that would soon enough stretch across five continents and count several clubs among its network, but CFG’s first outpost outside the UK was in New York. This was to NYC FC’s benefit. While Manchester City has always been CFG’s primary focus, a strong connection was forged between the Premier League and MLS siblings. Four City players were signed to be part of NYC FC’s squad for their debut season in 2015. Over the next few years, City sent some of their prospects (including Angelino and Yangel Herrera) to the Bronx for first-team experience and NYC FC sent some of their best players in the other direction – see Frank Lampard and Jack Harrison.
Now, though, the traffic between the two clubs has slowed almost to a complete stop. In fact, CFG is increasingly funnelling players away from New York. NYC FC, who haven’t received a player directly from Manchester City in recent years, have seemingly fallen down the CFG pecking order. Alexander Callens, for example, left NYC FC at the end of his contract to sign for Girona, the Spanish La Liga club part-owned by CFG and Pep Guardiola’s brother, Pere. Callens was an integral part of Nick Cushing’s team, but that didn’t stop CFG from placing the defender at another one of their clubs. This came just six months after Taty Castellanos, NYC FC’s best player and top scorer, was also sent to Girona. Even more painful was that the Argentinian striker was sent to Spain on loan – Castellanos is still technically on NYC FC’s books. Replacing Castellanos mid-season was impossible and Cushing has still to find a goalscorer capable of filling his boots. Santi Rodriguez was sent back to Montevideo City Torque, a Uruguayan club acquired by CFG in 2017, at the end of last season while Nico Acevedo’s loan spell from Bahia was also ended almost as soon as CFG bought a majority share in the Brazilian club last month. Meanwhile, NYC FC have yet to make a single notable new signing for the 2023 MLS season, which starts in under a month – Tony Alfaro, Matt Freese, Mitja Ilenic and Gabriel Segal are all depth additions. Even if NYC FC manage to get some new players through the door before their opening fixture against Nashville on 25 February, their squad rebuild won’t be complete. Talles Magno has the potential to become the club’s new No 9 while Thiago Andrade will receive more game time now that the competition for places has been cleared out. Tayvon Gray is another youngster NYC FC fans are excited to see more of. There are, however, too many holes to plug in just one off-season. The disintegration of the NYC FC squad is all the more remarkable because of where they were less than two years ago. 2021 saw the franchise win its first ever MLS Cup, in large part due to good scouting and recruitment, but that winning team was quickly broken apart. Of the 11 players who started the championship game against Portland, only three – Gray, Maxime Chanot and Alfredo Morales – are still at the club (Castellanos and James Sands are out on loan). In a sense, winning MLS Cup was the worst thing to ever happen to NYC FC. CFG may argue they are focusing on building a long-term, sustainable future for NYC FC through the construction of a new stadium. After years of playing on a baseball field at Yankee Stadium, plans for a new 25,000-capacity venue in Queens were announced in November. A permanent home will finally allow NYC FC to put roots down, but at an estimated cost of $780m. That outlay could affect the transfer business done by the NYC FC front office, although the club is among the best in MLS at finding talent. “We’re not going to rush in to adding just any players,” said Cushing. “We’ve seen over many years that we can spot talent … whether that’s through the academy or the transfer market.” Indeed, it’s entirely possible NYC FC’s next cycle will bring just as much success as the last one, even if the start to the 2023 season is rough. Initially founded as one of MLS’s marquee franchises with the pulling power to attract some of the sport’s biggest names, CFG has since remoulded NYC FC as a club that develops players for others. In CFG’s hierarchy, NYC FC no longer hold the position they did only a few years ago, certainly when they were founded a decade ago. Once called Manchester City’s sister team, they are now more like a distant cousin.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/31/once-manchester-citys-sibling-nyc-fc-is-now-more-like-a-distant-cousin;guardian;sports;174

2251;2251;Family wins high court fight for fresh inquest into stabbing of Yousef Makki;2023-01-20T16:22:34Z;['Mabel Banfield-Nwachi'];['UK news', 'Greater Manchester', 'Law'];;The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death have won their fight for a second inquest, after a high court ruling on Friday. Yousef Makki, 17, died after his friend Joshua Molnar, a former public schoolboy who was 17 at the time, stabbed him through the heart with a knife during a row in the affluent area of Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, in March 2019. Molnar was acquitted of murder and manslaughter by a jury following a trial later that year, on the basis of self-defence. After an inquest in 2021, Alison Mutch, senior coroner at South Manchester coroner’s court in Stockport, said the exact circumstances surrounding Yousef’s stabbing “could not be ascertained” and ruled out both unlawful killing and accidental death as reasons for his death. Yousef’s family, from Burnage, Manchester, said they were “disgusted” with the narrative conclusion and brought a judicial review in 2022. On Friday, Lady Justice Macur and Mr Justice Fordham, handed down their ruling at the high court in Manchester, ordering a fresh inquest before a different coroner. Yousef’s family said they were grateful to the judges for their “compassion and understanding” in recognising that “the coroner’s conclusion was unlawful”. Jade Akoum, Yousef’s older sister, said outside the court: “We now look forward to a new inquest before a different coroner, which we hope and pray will establish clearly the facts about how Yousef died. We will not stop until we have justice for Yousef: for us, for our mum, but first and foremost for him, our beloved king.” Representing Yousef’s family at the initial inquest, Peter Weatherby KC told the hearing there was a “wealth of evidence” that suggested Yousef’s death was accidental or unlawful. Weatherby said there were “discrepancies” between what was said during the trial and the version of events given at the inquest. “This is a death caused by an unlawful weapon brandished in the street by Joshua Molnar and unless there was some terrible accident, or unless Yousef Makki put him in fear, this was an unlawful killing and the coroner simply fails to address those issues in her decision,” he said. Initially, Molnar told police he had not seen what had happened. Footage from police body-cams showed a tearful Molnar blaming the attack on someone he said had fled. At trial, he claimed Yousef had brandished his own knife first, before he got his out in self-defence. Then, during the inquest, Molnar said he could not remember who had first taken out their knife. Yousef, Molnar and another teenager, Adam Chowdhary, then 17, had all carried knives that night. All three acted out the role of “middle class gangsters”, Molnar’s trial heard. Molnar, now 21, was jailed for 16 months for possession of a knife in a public place and perverting the course of justice by lying to police at the scene. Chowdhary was cleared of perverting the course of justice by the jury at his trial but admitted possession of a flick knife, which he had bought online, and was given a four-month detention order. The high court judges ruled that the coroner’s inquiry was “insufficiently distilled” and did not explain how she reached her conclusions. They added: “Consequently, whilst I do not consider that the evidence necessarily all points in one direction, neither can I be satisfied that Her Majesty’s senior coroner (HMSC) has assessed all relevant evidence or analysed the findings of fact she made. “HMSC’s generic reference to her consideration of the ‘totality’ of the evidence is inadequate to convey that she did ‘strive’ to reach a conclusion upon the evidence. If she did so but was left profoundly unsure, then she did not explain why.” A date for the new inquest has yet to be announced.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/20/yousef-makki-family-wins-high-court-fight-for-fresh-inquest-into-stabbing;guardian;politics;2251

Only billionaires like Jeff Bezos;2023-01-08T14:00:50Z;['Emma Beddington'];['The super-rich', 'Ageing', 'Healthcare industry', 'Rich lists'];;"The anti-ageing industry is hotting up. Not the one advertising me snail goo and sheep placenta facials (the algorithms can’t accept that I barely moisturise); the one exploring how elastic the limits of life are. A generic diabetes drug, metformin, apparently shows potential to slow ageing (researchers are hoping to secure funding for a large-scale trial). A “longevity diet” could hack cell ageing, but you’d better like your proteins “pesco-vegetarian-derived” and your fats “mostly from plant-based and pro-longevity sources”. There’s a definite buzz, but it’s all in the early stages – as one researcher put it: “It’s a great time to be a rich mouse.” Rich – that’s key. We relish tales of absurd billionaire biohacks – dodgy supplements, cryochambers and fasts so long I’d eat my own arm – as evidence that all their money can’t buy them eternal life. But now we might have to be grateful for their mad hubris: billionaire-funded private sector startups are apparently filling the gaps in longevity science, funding anti-ageing research too speculative for big pharma and too expensive for academia and government, with Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Sergey Brin all getting involved. But will this generate meaningful trickledown of any advances? We know how effective trickledown is in other areas. Mainly, I keep thinking how only billionaires have the luxury of believing great age is remotely desirable. Recent research found just 35% of “ordinary” people want to reach 100. There’s no mystery: getting old at the pointy end of the climate catastrophe, as food and water supplies falter and health and social care are dismantled is one thing; getting old on your private climate-controlled island as handmaidens count your macros and juice your nuts is quite another. Then there’s the “health span” disparity: the wealthiest live nearly 10 disability-free years longer than the poorest. We are in the UN’s “decade of healthy ageing” and there are tons of innovative ideas out there around healthcare, community, city life and more that could make living longer appeal to more of us. But all that requires money.

4293;4293;Newcastle council fined £280,000 after falling tree killed six-year-old;2023-01-10T17:24:05Z;['Robyn Vinter'];['Newcastle', 'UK news', 'Schools', 'Local government', 'Children'];;"A council has been fined £280,000 for oversights that led to a six-year-old girl being crushed to death by a falling tree in her school playground. Newcastle city council pleaded guilty at South Tyneside magistrates court to a charge relating to the death of year 2 pupil Ella Henderson, who was killed when a decaying willow tree fell on her in high winds at Gosforth Park first school in Newcastle while she was playing at lunchtime on 25 September 2020. Her parents, Vikki and Neil Henderson, said they were “devastated beyond words” to hear in court how there was more than one occasion that Ella’s death could have been prevented. The tree had been flagged by council workers in 2018 as needing further inspection but a number of failings meant this did not happen. It was found to have significant decay that caused the trunk to break during 38mph (60km/h) winds. While several of her classmates sustained superficial injuries, Ella was seriously hurt and was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, where she died in the early hours of the next day. In a victim impact statement read by the prosecutor, Vikki described how she and Neil had “the perfect life” before the sudden death of their daughter. She said: “There was not one thing we would have changed. We had two happy, healthy, little girls who were just the best of friends and life was amazing. “Having lived that life, we now live with a complete hole in our lives.” She described having an empty place at the table and an empty bed in a holiday cottage, which were a “constant reminder, not that we will ever need one, that she’s not here”. Henderson continued: “Seeing everyone’s life move on and their kids and her friends getting older while we stay still; always with a six-year-old who will never get her front teeth is devastating.” She added: “The hardest part is that all we did was what every other parent does every day. She should have been so safe at school and knowing that I’m the only one who doesn’t get to pick their child up every day is just the worst feeling.” The Hendersons were present in court via video link. Pleading guilty to a charge brought by the Health and Safety Executive under section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act, the council admitted it had failed to inspect the tree properly and had also failed to inform the school of the results of a report into the condition of the trees, which had accidentally been sent to the wrong school. Newcastle city council offered an “unreserved apology” to Ella’s parents and admitted the tree should have been felled long before she was killed. It has since made significant changes, such as restructuring the team that inspects the trees, giving further training to council workers, and putting in place a database of up-to-date email addresses for schools. The council was commended by district judge Zoe Passfield for cooperating with the investigation and for pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity. In passing the sentence, she advised it was not intended to reflect the “tragic” loss suffered by Ella’s family and said it would be “unjust” not to consider that a fine would effectively be taken from the people of Newcastle, who “have done nothing wrong”. “I have to step back and consider the effect on the council and its ability to provide essential services,” she added. The chief executive of Newcastle city council, Pam Smith, said the council fully accepted the sentence of the court. She said: “We would like to offer our sincere and profound condolences and apologise unreservedly to Ella’s family for their unimaginable loss.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/ella-henderson-newcastle-killed-falling-tree-parents-devastating-loss;guardian;entertainment & culture;4293

4835;4835;Marcus Rashford shines in Manchester United’s FA Cup win over Everton;2023-01-06T22:27:52Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['FA Cup', 'Manchester United', 'Everton', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Marcus Rashford is a shoo-in for all player of the year shortlists if he continues to put in performances like this. The No 10 was the creative force behind Antony’s opener and Conor Coady’s own goal before scoring a stoppage-time penalty that came after Alejandro Garnacho was yanked down and which ensured Manchester United’s passage into the next round. Of his star act, Erik ten Hag said: “Again, great performance, Marcus was the one who went in front and showed the confidence and the belief and good movements behind, taking the players on and for 90 minutes was a threat. When he keeps focus like that I am sure he can keep this process going.”
Frank Lampard arrived in need of a win to try to save his job but left withhis future still hanging by a thread. Everton next host Southampton on Saturday week, whether Lampard will still be in charge then is open to question. Of his chances of avoiding the sack, he said: “That’s not under my control. It’s not for me to focus on that. It’s for me to focus on what I saw tonight and that was a performance that every manager wants with the attitude of the team, and the focus. The focus now is Southampton.” On three minutes United promised to be an irresistible juggernaut that would flatten their visitors but that never materialised. Casemiro tapped to Anthony Martial and the No 9 lost and then regained possession and found Rashford. He coasted along the left, gained half a yard on Ben Godfrey, and rolled the ball across for Antony to poke in. Everton were confused and dazed and there was more. Martial shot wide, Antony raced down the right but his delivery disappointed, and Christian Eriksen took aim from distance. Yet football, as the saying goes, can be a funny game and the latest evidence came in Everton’s farcical equaliser. Amadou Onana shrugged aside Casemiro and passed to Neil Maupay: the striker was virtually on the byline to the right of David De Gea’s left post but when he took aim the goalkeeper comically refused to take his left hand off from the upright to make the save, the ball went through his legs, and Coady forced it home.
De Gea has a sorry catalogue of howlers on the CV and this was one of the worst. With their equaliser Everton had given their manager the perfect boost in their first FA Cup meeting with United since the 2016 semi-final won by United en route to their last FA Cup win. Both managers named strong XIs, with Martial, Rashford, Casemiro and Luke Shaw in Ten Hag’s lineup and Lampard picking his strongest team with the exception of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who had only recently returned after injury. Raphaël Varane, another of Ten Hag’s main men, conjured a trick to leave Idrissa Gueye for dead before slicing in from the right and passing to Casemiro whose goalmouth chip was misdirected. So, too was an Eriksen drive – though only marginally – the latest in a bombardment of Everton which they survived to still be level at the break.
The usually uber-silky Casemiro was off the pace and was eventually replaced. The Brazilian began the second half with an errant pass that allowed Alex Iwobi to dart into United’s half. Tyrell Malacia dashed over to tackle but inadvertently injured the winger and Iwobi was carried off. “It’s ankle ligaments damage – we hope to a lesser extent,” said Lampard. Another wide man – Rashford – was about to fashion his second assist. This time Séamus Coleman was the defender left twisted as the No 10 jinked past and hammered in a cross that Coady was unfortunate to turn past Pickford. Here was Rashford’s latest gamechanging act in a season of them. It had a gleeful Stretford End informing Lampard he was “getting sacked in the morning”, and provoked a question: could United take control and, as the cliche goes, put their foot on the ball? The answer was no. The spectacle remained akin to a hockey game that had Casemiro hassling near an Everton corner flag, then Coleman tipping the ball across United’s area and Vitalii Mykolenko going close to making it 2-2. Next Fernandes warmed Pickford’s fingers from 30 yards and Rashford drew Abdoulaye Doucouré into a yellow card. De Gea went close to committing another clownish error under pressure from Calvert-Lewin, who had replaced Maupay. The striker would bundle into the net seconds later but Gray had been offside earlier in the move. Rashford’s spot-kick – he has now scored in five successive games – sealed United’s progress.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/manchester-united-everton-fa-cup-third-round-match-report;guardian;sports;4835
411;411;Visa delays await Chinese students returning to Australia after sudden ban on online learning;2023-01-30T07:31:24Z;['Caitlin Cassidy', 'Elias Visontay'];['Australia news', 'China', 'Australian education', 'Australian universities'];;"More than 40,000 university students have been left scrambling to make it to Australia in time for the new semester after the Chinese government announced a snap ban on recognising online degrees obtained from foreign institutions. Under the new rules, all Chinese students enrolled to study online with overseas providers must be on campus for semester 1 – due to start in a matter of weeks in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup CEO of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) Phil Honeywood said while he welcomed the return to on-campus learning, the sudden timing would cause significant challenges for flights, accommodation and visa approvals. About 42,000 Chinese nationals with student visas remain offshore, Guardian Australia understands, including 5,500 applicants processed in the past month and 2,400 in the past fortnight. It isn’t known how many students are yet to apply for a student visa to travel.
Chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said there would be “obvious logistical issues” so close to the new academic year. “We will be working closely with government and industry to ensure universities can quickly respond to this influx and facilitate the safe return of students,” she said. The Chinese Ministry for Education’s “special announcement”, made on Saturday, reverses rules introduced during the pandemic allowing enrolments and continued studies to take place remotely. Since the announcement, airlines are already grappling to respond to a noticeable uptick in demand from students for direct flights from mainland China. Chinese carriers have been under existing pressure to cater to an influx of passengers wanting to travel to Australia as they planned to resume direct flights following Beijing’s border reopening announcement in recent weeks. Guardian Australia understands that airlines are fielding increased inquiries from Chinese students and expect that even capacity on flights not yet announced will be stretched. Most flights from China into Australia in recent days have been either full or almost full, however passenger loads on outbound services back to China are smaller. Chief executive of the Group of Eight Australian universities, Vicki Thomson, said it would be an “almost impossible task” for students studying online to make it home for the start of the first semester. “Final year students who stuck with us throughout the Covid years may now need to return urgently, secure accommodation and obtain a visa within a few weeks,” she said. “We are concerned at the bluntness of this decision and we will seek urgent advice and clarification from the Chinese embassy on what special circumstance provisions are available for Chinese students. “We also urge the government to prioritise visa processing for all international students so that we can return to normal and minimise further disruption.” Just 25% of higher education student visas are processed within a week, while half are processed within a month. Students from China, India, Pakistan and Iran face longer security and clearance checks when applying for visas, with wait times sometimes blowing out in excess of three years. Education minister Jason Clare said he was working with universities alongside the minister for home affairs to address “short term logistical issues” stemming from the Chinese government’s decision. “Chinese students are already returning to Australia with about 3,500 arriving so far this month,” he said. “Many universities have been preparing for Chinese students to return to onshore study.” Chinese students took to social media platform Weibo to air their concerns about the delays in processing visas. “What did Chinese students in Australia do wrong?” one said. “Can’t you see what Australia’s policy is like and send a notice afterward? School starts in a few days, are you kidding me now?” “There are only a few days left before school starts, are you kidding?” another said. “They are not treating Chinese students studying abroad as human beings.” Luke Sheehy, executive director of Australian Technology Network of Universities said a “significant number” of Chinese students who had opted to study at its universities online during the pandemic would require assistance.
A University of Sydney spokesperson said while the “vast majority” of students would be on campus for semester 1, it would continue to offer remote teaching “wherever possible” for offshore students unable to make it back. “From semester 2, we’ll stop delivery of on-campus units remotely,” they said. A University of Melbourne spokesperson said online learning programs “may continue to be available” in some graduate programs from semester 1 but all undergraduate courses would be on campus. An RMIT spokesperson said it was “currently working through” how best to help Chinese students who wanted to return to Melbourne campuses, while UNSW said it was “continuing to support” Chinese students working on campus or remotely.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/visa-delays-await-chinese-students-returning-to-australia-after-sudden-ban-on-online-learning;guardian;entertainment & culture;411
2543;2543;Måneskin: Rush! review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week;2023-01-19T12:00:08Z;['Alexis Petridis'];['Music', 'Culture', 'Pop and rock', 'Måneskin'];;"Has there been a more improbable pop phenomenon in recent years than the rise of Rome-based quartet Måneskin? Whatever your musical predictions for 2021 were, they definitely didn’t include an international breakthrough by the runners-up of the Italian X Factor. They were unexpectedly propelled to global stardom by victory in the Eurovision song contest and a viral surge in the popularity of their cover of the Four Seasons’ 1967 hit Beggin’. Måneskin’s version takes its cues not from the original, but a 21st-century version by Norwegian hip-hop duo Madcon. Initially, Måneskin’s success seemed to be the type that came with the inbuilt tang of short-lived novelty; instead things just seemed to escalate: a support slot on the Rolling Stones’ US tour; a collaboration with Iggy Pop; an appearance on the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic; more than 6.5bn streams. At the end of summer 2022, a point by which observers might reasonably have assumed Måneskin’s 15 minutes would long be over, they were instead in a position to sack-off an appearance at the Reading and Leeds festival because they had a better offer: an appearance at the MTV VMAs, at which they walked off with the best alternative video award.
Perhaps Måneskin are rather sharper operators than the unexpectedly-propelled-to-global-fame narrative implies. Listening to Rush!, their first album with lyrics primarily in English, you’re struck by how canny their sound is. Once purveyors of wan funk-rock in the vein of the Red Hot Chili Peppers – a sound that netted vast success in their homeland – they gave themselves an overhaul shortly before Eurovision, while temporarily residing in London: the only track on Rush! that resembles Flea and co is the lumbering La Fine, which is also the worst thing here. These days, the label that’s most frequently attached to them is glam, but that seems largely rooted in their penchant for flared catsuits and lyrical expressions of non-specific rebellion: “Honestly, I don’t give a fuck / I’m addicted to rock’n’roll, yeah,” frontman Damiano David barks on Kool Kids, a song that also offers the band’s disinclination to use dental floss as evidence of their wild-eyed outsider status. Certainly, the glam tag has almost nothing to do with the music: Read Your Diary features glam drums, but somehow feels like it has more in common with the 00s pop that also used that rhythm – Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl, Britney Spears’ Womanizer – than the oeuvre of Slade or Sweet.
In fact, Måneskin’s curious grab-bag of influences is hard to accurately label, and thus perfect for the post-genre, non-tribal I-like-a-bit-of-everything era of streaming. It outwardly leans towards hard rock: the distorted guitars, the squealing guest appearance by Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello on Gossip and the downtuned, growling bass of Gasoline are just about heavy enough to qualify them for a place in the pages of Kerrang!. Equally, Gasoline’s four-to-the-floor pulse and its dynamics appear to be influenced by mainstream dance music: there are dramatic drops and moments where it cuts to silence before the riff slowly builds again. Meanwhile, the melodies throughout are pure mainstream pop, an aspect particularly pronounced on ballads Timezone and the genuinely beautiful If Not for You: not for nothing do a host of spendy writers-for-hire appear in Rush!’s credits, among them Max Martin, who also produces. But the biggest influences on Rush! might be the Killers and Franz Ferdinand, two bands Måneskin covered back in the days when they were still trying to impress whoever Italy’s equivalent of Simon Cowell is. Bla Bla Bla’s semi-spoken vocals and relentless rhythmic pulse seem cut from the same cloth as the Killers’ Mr Brightside, albeit without that song’s undeniable chorus. The ghost of Alex Kapranos, meanwhile, seems to lurk everywhere: in the staccato riffs of Don’t Wanna Sleep and Feel, the scratchy angular guitar on Mammamia and the album’s frequent recourse to post-punk disco drums, as on the frantic Mark Chapman, a dead ringer for Franz’s 2004 hit Michael.
Måneskin’s skill lies not just in assembling an array of influences into something that’s genuinely coherent, but in making the end result sound oddly guileless, rather than a carefully thought-through exercise in ticking boxes. What Rush! lacks in heft – a couple of glancing lyrical references to sexuality and gender notwithstanding, not even Måneskin’s loudest cheerleader is going to claim it as a weighty album – it makes up for in enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm occasionally tips over into a cloying eagerness to please (Supermodel is a little too desperate to remind listeners of Smells Like Teen Spirit), more often it’s infectious. The people behind it sound like they’re having the time of their lives, making the most of their unexpected moment in the spotlight: a moment that Rush! seems likely to extend further. This week Alexis listened to Everything But The Girl – Nothing Left to Lose More than 20 years later, Everything But the Girl return with a pitch-perfect 2023 update of the dance music plus lyrical misery they minted in the 90s.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/19/maneskin-rush-review-eurovision-winners-extend-their-improbable-15-minutes-of-fame;guardian;entertainment & culture;2543

Four fictional health case studies are a delicious time capsule of 80s mores. There’s junior doctor Duncan, whose signature dishes are ‘coq au vin or beef stroganoff’ and thrusting executive Jeffrey (pictured resplendent in checked golfing slacks), who flies ‘executive class’ and enjoys ‘business banter over several Scotches’, but opts for salads in the directors’ dining room. Widowed weight watcher Joyce can ‘still sport a Jean Muir 8’ and graphic designer Jo’s style credentials are signposted with a yellow Anglepoise lamp in her office. She relaxes with the last of her cigarette allowance and a stiff G&T at home ‘before collapsing’ (perhaps that bit still resonates). All four needed to raise their wellness game, the report concluded, conjuring a cheery vision of chest infections, bone softening and alcohol addiction. We might have ditched the fags and even be flirting with Dry January, but the picture of contradictory health messages, anxiety-creating scares and health and beauty obsessives living in ‘a shrunken, self-absorbed world’ remains familiar. There’s no arguing, either, with the observation that ‘Pain, sickness and death are part of being human… to cope with them is undoubtedly healthy.’";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/22/the-early-days-of-the-wellness-industry-1983;guardian;health;2024
931;931;Audrey Magee: ‘Reading The Bell Jar at 17 was immersive, thrilling and exhausting’;2023-01-27T10:00:47Z;['N/A'];['Books', 'Fiction', 'Culture'];;"My earliest reading memory In the Jungle, a book about counting animals. I was three or four. The colours were vivid, the animals exotic, and I read those pages thousands of times. My favourite book growing up Across the Barricades by Joan Lingard. Growing up in an Ireland riven by division, the story of love and kindness in Belfast between Catholic Kevin and Protestant Sadie was a balm for me. The book that changed me as a teenager I was 16, in school, when I first read Moderato Cantabile by Marguerite Duras. After a diet of English/Irish writing that told me what to think and how to feel, here was a writer who created a space for me, the reader, to think as I wanted to think, to feel as I wanted to feel. It thrilled me. The writer who changed my mind I was 21 when I first read James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I was living in Aachen, then in West Germany, and embracing all things European, adamant that, with the exception of Beckett, Irish writing had little to offer beyond narrative. Joyce debunked that notion. The book that made me want to be a writer I had always written – letters, diaries – and had dabbled a little in writing plays and short stories, but becoming a writer, especially in Ireland, seemed a monumental aspiration. At the age of about 24, living in Australia, I read Janet Frame’s Faces in the Water. Frame somehow made the act of writing a book seem tangible. Her writing is raw, unadulterated, and I hugely admired the courage required to write so searingly and honestly of madness.
The book or author I came back to The Trial by Franz Kafka. I had read it in German as part of my undergraduate degree but knew that I was missing so much. I adored the indulgence of reading it in English. The book I reread I read Thomas Mann’s Buddenbrooks first in my 20s, relishing the depictions of youth and artistic aspiration. With the recent publication of Colm Tóibín’s The Magician, I read Buddenbrooks again, this time bonding with the characters in middle age. I look forward to reading it as an old woman to see how the writing holds up. The book I could never read again Reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath was an utterly immersive, thrilling and exhausting experience at 17. I would be afraid of reading it again, afraid of diluting or tarnishing that wonderful time I spent in that space with Plath. The book I discovered later in life Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. I can’t believe I reached my 40s before reading that book. How did it elude me? The book I am currently reading A Mercy by Toni Morrison. I am going through a bit of a Morrison thing at the moment. My comfort read Books on grammar. Three books – The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr and EB White; Grammar Rules: Writing With Military Precision by Craig Shrives; and Eats, Shoots and Leaves by Lynne Truss – are always close to hand, ready, when in doubt, to soothe and comfort. • The Colony by Audrey Magee is published in paperback by Faber.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/27/audrey-magee-reading-the-bell-jar-at-17-was-immersive-thrilling-and-exhausting;guardian;entertainment & culture;931
4449;4449;‘It’s going to be tough’: Sainsbury’s chief on price cuts, inflation and energy costs ;2023-01-09T13:00:12Z;['Sarah Butler'];['J Sainsbury', 'Supermarkets', 'Retail industry', 'Food & drink industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Inflation', 'UK cost of living crisis'];;"Simon Roberts spent his Christmas Eve in a van, helping bring groceries to Sainsbury’s shoppers’ homes as part of an initiative to make festive deliveries as close to the big day as possible. The chief executive of the UK’s second-largest supermarket chain says the experiment, which involved holding back thousands of turkeys ordered by online shoppers to arrive on Christmas Eve, was part of “thinking differently” as it seeks new ways to succeed in a fiercely competitive sector. “I don’t think Christmas was easy and I don’t think any [rival] held back from putting their best foot forward,” he says – despite suggestions that its big competitors Morrisons and Asda have been stymied by debt-fuelled private takeovers, which made it harder for them to keep prices down.
Since taking the role in May 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the affable former Boots executive has focused a lot more on price than his predecessors. Sainsbury’s now price-matches hundreds of products with the discounter Aldi on main lines such as chicken legs, bananas and milk, and announced cut-price vegetables for Christmas well ahead of Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. Roberts says the new pricing regime has not been at the expense of the reputation for quality long guarded by the brand and has helped win over shoppers who had switched to the discounters. While Sainsbury’s does not reveal its trading figures until later this week, the strategy appears to have paid off over Christmas, with sales of groceries, excluding non-food, up 8.3% in December, according to figures from the industry analyst Kantar released last week. This put Sainbury’s ahead of its traditional rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons – although still well behind the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, which racked up growth of close to 30%.
Over the more widely quoted figures covering total grocery sales in the three months to Christmas Day, Sainsbury’s was still ahead of Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose – but pipped by Asda to fastest growing among the traditional players, as the latter recovered from a tricky 2021. Asda has announced plans to open dozens of convenience stores and introduced new cut-price own-label groceries as part of its attempt to push Sainsbury’s off the podium and take its place as the UK’s second-largest grocer. Roberts says Sainsbury’s is in the right place to fight back: “We are as competitive as we have ever been.” He says this Christmas was the culmination of Sainsbury’s three-year battle to offer better value to shoppers “at the centre of the plate” and then tempt them with a wider range of treats not found at supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. Roberts said the availability of turkeys was good despite concerns about supplies being affected by an outbreak of avian flu, although he admits buying more than usual meant they had some left over after Christmas. Eggs were also a concern – and will continue to be – as Roberts says supply of free-range eggs in particular has struggled to keep up with demand and producers have been hit by rising costs and the bird flu outbreak. The price-matching tactic may have hit profits, costing £550m over two years, but has never been more prescient as rising household costs on everything from energy to petrol, basic clothing and groceries put the squeeze on household budgets. “We are very aware of how tough it is going to be as bills land after Christmas. Energy bills are a real concern,” Roberts says.
“My biggest hope for this year is that inflation comes down. It is impacting every household and every business. Bringing it under control must be a priority [for the government] and front of mind.” Despite that hope, Roberts admits that with the war in Ukraine continuing, limiting availability of some key foodstuffs such as grain as well as oil and gas, he expects inflation to fall but not go away this year. Labour costs are also an issue, with Sainsbury’s last week announcing its third pay rise in a year, taking hourly wages to at least £11, amid fierce competition for shop workers that has also prompted rivals such as Tesco and Aldi to institute multiple pay rises. “There are pressures coming up with energy costs,” Roberts adds. “In food production there is a lot of energy consumption.”
He says government help with energy bills has helped keep food producers going, especially small and medium-sized companies, and it will continue to be important, but stresses that businesses need to find ways to cut costs now that the government is moving to reduce support. He says Sainsbury’s has cut its energy use by 23% over three years, thanks to measures such as installing LED bulbs and tweaking heat and ventilation systems, and greater energy efficiency is “now a major focus of what we do” as the company aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2025. Cost-cutting measures – including closing cafes and fresh food counters – have helped Sainsbury’s keep food prices down. Roberts says the supermarket’s rate of inflation is well below the 13.3% annual industry average for December, according to figures released last week by the British Retail Consortium and the data firm Nielsen. Shoppers are also dealing with inflation by changing their behaviour – buying more frozen food to save on waste, switching to cheaper own-label brands and dining more at home. There is also a swing back to physical stores, as shoppers try to save on delivery costs and attempt to buy only what they really need in straitened times. With profits under pressure Roberts will have to convince shareholders – including the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns a 14.3% stake and the “Czech Sphinx”, the billionaire Daniel Křetínský, who holds 10.2% – that his long game is worth it. “Over time, customers are wanting to save but not wanting to go to more stores than they need to,” he says. No doubt the Sphinx will be waiting to see if he’s right.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/09/sainsburys-price-cuts-inflation-simon-roberts;guardian;entertainment & culture;4449
138;138;France under fire over fast-track plan for AI video surveillance at Paris Olympics;2023-01-31T12:06:38Z;['Angelique Chrisafis'];['France', 'Surveillance', 'Artificial intelligence (AI)', 'Paris Olympic Games 2024', 'Olympic Games', 'Europe', 'Human rights', 'Technology', 'World news', 'Sport', 'Police'];;The French government is fast-tracking special legislation for the 2024 Paris Olympics that would allow the use of video surveillance assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Ministers have argued that certain exceptional security measures are needed to ensure the smooth running of the events that will attract 13 million spectators, but rights groups have warned France is seeking to use the Games as a pretext to extend police surveillance powers, which could then become permanent. The measures include a proposal to legalise the use of AI-assisted video surveillance. For the first time in France, this would allow automated video camera surveillance, in which AI algorithms would be used to detect suspicious or “abnormal” activity in crowds. These algorithms would analyse video images from fixed CCTV cameras or drones, highlighting behaviour deemed abnormal or suspicious, which would be automatically signalled to police, who could act. The AI systems would be used to monitor crowds such as the 600,000 people expected at the Paris opening ceremony but could also be used around stadiums, on city streets and on public transport. The French sports minister, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, has described the bill as introducing “essential adjustments” in order for the games to run smoothly. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said the bill would give a French “framework” for security for the games. The proposal comes as France seeks to avoid a repeat of the chaos of last year’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid at the Stade de France, where fans including children were teargassed, and many supporters complained they were mugged around the stadium. The French government has emphasised that its security proposals for the Olympics do not include the use of facial recognition technologies. Ministers have also said automated video surveillance was an experimental measure for a defined period. But rights groups said the proposal would cover all sporting, festive and cultural events in a broad time frame, which would run from this spring until June 2025, long after the Games ended. They said there was a danger the measure could then become permanent law. The bill will be considered by the lower house in the national assembly in February after Senate approval on Tuesday, but campaigners have called for more public debate. Amnesty International called the proposal a “turning point” in the use of AI surveillance technologies in France and said it marked a “dangerous step” for human rights and privacy rights. Katia Roux, the advocacy officer on technology and human rights at Amnesty International France, said: “We’re deeply worried by the fact that these algorithms will be able to analyse images from fixed CCTV cameras or drones to detect ‘abnormal or suspect’ behaviour. First, there is the issue of defining abnormal or suspect behaviour – who will decide what behaviour is the norm or not? Also, in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms, we consider the proposal presents a danger to the right to a private life, it could also impact freedom of expression, freedom to meet, and the principle of non-discrimination.” Roux said that even though the government had said no biometric data would be used, “in reality the algorithms will analyse behaviour, and physical data, which is data that must be protected”. Roux said the efficiency of such automatic surveillance techniques had not been proved. She said the context of the bill was important, coming amid “French authorities’ very clear will for several years to broaden the surveillance powers of the police”. Amnesty cautioned that the Games “must not serve as a pretext” to allow exceptional measures to become permanent law. Roux said there were examples of surveillance laws put in place for special events that were later used repressively, citing Russia’s introduction of facial recognition surveillance during the 2018 football World Cup. Bastien Le Querrec, of the French NGO La Quadrature du Net, which campaigns on data and privacy issues, said the proposal to authorise video surveillance by algorithm “seems to us particularly dangerous, disproportionate and puts in place a mechanism of mass surveillance”. He said that until now in France, video surveillance required “a human behind a screen” analysing CCTV footage, which made it impossible to monitor the entire public space all the time. “But with the use of algorithms, that human limit is no longer there – it would be possible to permanently survey all video camera images – and there are several hundreds of thousands of video cameras in France. This means that any person filmed could see their behaviour analysed, their movements detected and classified and decided by algorithm if normal or abnormal.” He said he feared the Olympics could be presented as a “political moment” to pass legislation that would otherwise be seen as unacceptable.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/france-paris-olympics-ai-video-surveillance-law;guardian;science & technology;138

Instead, there was a straightforward look at what Harry’s book, Spare, tells about being inside the royal family. They have a life so far removed from the ordinary experience that it is incredible so many believe they truly “know” the character of individual royals and are prepared to die in a Twitter or Facebook ditch defending them. What is most strange is that Catherine Bennett’s observations are so obvious, and should have been so to everyone. But it is as Harry says: so many people imbue the royal family with qualities and celebrity that they have done nothing to earn, except by simply being born. Mike Wisbach Buckingham Promoting insecurity The ever-changing demands of the beauty/fashion industry, while clearly functioning to undermine women, also serve the purposes of consumerism, by creating demand for otherwise unnecessary products (“Buccal fat removal is a new take on an old theme: a means to keep women in their place”, Comment). This is why the cosmetics industry has extended its reach to men as well, though perhaps not yet to the same degree. Expanding the market by promoting insecurity and unattainable, ephemeral ideals is at the core of these unsustainable industries. Fliss Watts Workington, Cumbria Thanks for your generosity I want to say a huge thank-you to Guardian and Observer readers for supporting the 2022 charity appeal. We see the difference Locality members make every day, but the way readers have responded has been inspiring. These are the community organisations who run our food banks and warm spaces. But they also provide hope – helping people into jobs, setting up businesses, improving people’s health and providing spaces for people to connect. The stark reality is that much of the money raised will go towards keeping doors open and lights on. With government reducing support for rising energy bills, even with your donations some Locality members will struggle to survive. Beyond helping community organisations continue their vital work, we hope the appeal will spark something longer lasting. Far more people are now aware of the value of organisations that have the local knowledge and tenacity to achieve change. Perhaps the appeal resonated so strongly because it showed something we all want – caring communities and neighbourhoods to be proud of. So, whether you donated or not, we encourage everyone to connect with your community. You might be surprised at what you can achieve. Tony Armstrong, CEO Locality London N1 Children bear the brunt The government’s failure to support children starts not from birth but from well before that, when the wellbeing and health of mothers is uncertain, making pregnancy and birth a hazardous undertaking in the 21st-century UK (“From birth, UK is a hostile place to have children”, Comment). For significant numbers of children, poverty, substandard and precarious housing, poor healthcare and a decaying local environment is now all too common and directly associated with educational achievement. Even the care of children for whom the state has direct responsibility is outsourced; profit trumps welfare. The effect of all this on today’s children is then visited on the next generation and so the cycle continues. Sure Start centres were so aptly named, but the same nasty George Osborne austerity policies that have so damaged family income and welfare closed them. Over 13 years, the Conservatives have systematically dismantled family and child welfare. Dr Robin C Richmond Bromyard, Herefordshire Shocking story of farmed salmon As your article reports, salmon are dying in record numbers on industrial Scottish farms, with mortalities nearly doubling in 2022 to reach 14.9 million (“Scottish salmon farms facing boycott call as fish deaths double”, News). These are staggering numbers made all the more shocking by the “hidden layer” of mortality that lies behind every farmed salmon’s death. In the wild, salmon eat other fish in order to grow. In Scotland, the salmon industry uses hundreds of thousands of tonnes of small wild fish (such as sardines and anchovies) to feed the fish they produce every year. Research from Feedback Global shows that in 2019 the farmed salmon that died before being harvested led to a waste of about 25,000 tonnes of wild fish in the form of feed, enough to feed two million people their weekly portion of oily fish for a year. The Scottish salmon industry claims that the dying salmon are a result of jellyfish, but in reality they are a result of an unsustainable industry that is being wasteful in its never-ending chase for profit. The only solution is to reduce our dependence on farmed salmon for good. By diversifying the fish that we eat, we can reduce the environmental toll of salmon farming and make more fish available for more people around the world. Teigist Taye, campaigner, Feedback Global London SW17 Social murder Will Hutton details frightening numbers of excess weekly deaths caused by austerity and a “failing NHS and care system” (“Lest we forget: our NHS crisis is the deadly legacy of George Osborne’s austerity”, Comment). He closes his article with three powerful words: “Tory policies kill.” This is a pattern with a history. In 1845, Friedrich Engels studied the effects of poor housing and working conditions in Manchester and wrote The Condition of the Working Class in England. “The class which at present holds social and political control places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death.” Even more to the point than Hutton, Engels chose two words to describe this deliberate neglect, “social murder”.

5055;5055;A centrist pitch from Keir Starmer means he will need to show how he differs from Sunak;2023-01-05T19:17:34Z;['Pippa Crerar'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Brexit'];;Keir Starmer was looking assured, shirt sleeves rolled up and cracking jokes, as he stood in front of a giant orange robotic arm in an east London design lab to make his new year speech. Just 24 hours earlier Rishi Sunak had given his own address on the state of the nation at the building next door, prompting the Labour leader to quip: “I won’t tell the prime minister where I’m going on holiday this year just in case I find him there as well.” But with the two politicians just a few points apart in favourability ratings – and even some of their own MPs worrying whether the public can distinguish between the two parties’ offerings – Starmer’s relaxed demeanour belied his determination. Labour aides had stressed that this speech was about making his case for a much needed “national renewal” and setting out his vision to the country – rather than announcing detailed policies. We will hear more about those “missions”, around which the next election manifesto will be built, in the coming weeks. With an election not expected until autumn 2024, Starmer has time on his side to gradually build up to his full election offer. Sunak, meanwhile, is a man in a hurry to prove to the tired British electorate that he can take the country in a different direction. Key to Starmer’s plan in the run-up to the next election is showing that he understands what people are going through. He told his audience that Labour was ready to “roll up” its sleeves, adding: “We can’t keep expecting the British people to just suck it up. Not without the hope – the possibility – of something better.” Labour has been accused of spending too much time criticising the government without offering its own solutions. One shadow cabinet minister admitted: “When we say that the Tories have screwed things up with the NHS, or anything else, we’ve got to be able to answer the question of what we would do differently.” Starmer said he was “under no illusions” about the scale of the challenges the country faced and the party would not “rest on its laurels” despite being 20 points ahead in the polls. Labour knows it still has to seal the deal with voters who backed the Tories last time. The centrist pitch we heard from Starmer in his speech will be repeated in the weeks ahead as he attempts to reassure floating votes with doubts about Labour – insisting that his plans will be “fully costed” and that he will not be getting the “big government chequebook” out to spend the way “out of their mess”. Labour insiders acknowledge that it could be a difficult argument for the left to stomach, and insist that there will be some investment in Britain’s damaged public services. But Starmer’s refusal to say that he would match the Tories’ spending commitments, à la Tony Blair in 1997, is unlikely to offer much comfort. His plans for a “more relaxed” approach by a Labour government to private sector expertise will also trouble some in the party. Yet the leadership is quite happy to be seen as coming up with pragmatic solutions, demonstrating again that it has moved on from the Corbyn era. Labour still wrestles internally with Brexit, despite the growing confidence of senior figures to criticise the government’s handling of it. So it marks quite a shift for Starmer, who campaigned vigorously for Remain and a second referendum, to admit he “couldn’t disagree” with some of the arguments made by Brexiters, in particular their lack of agency. His decision to label Labour’s devolution plans the “take back control” bill may have been surprising, but aides insist it is neither a gimmick nor an attempt to troll Dominic Cummings, but instead to show that he understands why so many people backed leave. It also, conveniently, gives Labour cover to talk about the failures of Brexit and the damage it has done to the economy. Labour starts the year with a spring in its step. It has come a long way since its historic defeat in 2019. Yet Starmer knows there is much more to do: on policy, on winning over Tory waverers, on reassuring its core support that it still stands for something, on Starmer himself. Starmer’s straight, almost managerial, style was a welcome antidote when opposing the flamboyant and chaotic Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. But up against Rishi Sunak, who also errs on the side of technocrat rather than instinctive politician, there is pressure to differentiate. So as well as winning back voters lost last time, Labour also has to talk up dividing lines that already exist, and create new ones, with the Conservatives, if it is to persuade enough people that it is worth voting for.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/a-centrist-pitch-from-keir-starmer-means-he-will-need-to-show-how-he-differs-from-sunak;guardian;politics;5055
1972;1972;Can robots really plug the workforce shortage left by Brexit? | Torsten Bell;2023-01-22T10:00:33Z;['Torsten Bell'];['Migration', 'Robots', 'Work & careers', 'Brexit', 'European Union', 'UK news'];;Migration was quite a big deal, Brexit-wise, but six years on, and two after the end of free movement, what has been the impact? The level of net migration certainly hasn’t fallen, but a new report from Jonathan Portes and John Springford argues that if you focus on workers, the end of freedom of movement has left about 330,000 fewer in Britain (460,000 fewer Europeans, but 130,000 more from elsewhere). That’s a reduction of roughly 1% of the labour force, prompting many to say that a lack of migration drove recent economy-wide labour shortages. This is overstated (hiring difficulties have been common across Europe), but fewer available workers will have contributed to the hiring challenges in lower-paying sectors that were previously reliant on EU workers (and where the authors show the workforce reduction is concentrated). But that’s not a bug with the new migration regime, it’s a design feature. The important question is what happens next. Here, a new Danish study offers some insights. It shows that, from the mid-1990s, firms were more likely to invest in robots to support production in places where cheaper migrant labour was hard to come by: a 1 percentage point rise in the share of non-western immigrants decreased the probability of robots being used by 7%. The authors argue that this is because when firms can pay migrants lower wages, they do so rather than use machines. Does this mean the UK is about to see a robot invasion? There should be more automation under the new migration regime but note that this paper looked at only one part of how firms respond. For some migrant-reliant sectors with hard-to-automate services or agricultural work fewer migrants doesn’t mean shiny robots, it means shrinking. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

5809;5809;Black Stalin obituary;2023-01-01T14:51:37Z;['Peter Mason'];['Music', 'Trinidad and Tobago'];;"Black Stalin, who has died aged 81, was a modern calypsonian of the old school, dedicated to keeping political and social commentary at the heart of his music when other exponents of the art were becoming purveyors of frivolous party music. His determination to stick to what he saw as the righteous course allowed Stalin to become calypso monarch in his native Trinidad and Tobago – the highest achievement any calypsonian can aspire to – on five occasions. It also brought him a global audience of fans who were appreciative of his acerbic, Rasta-influenced take on political and racial affairs. In the 1990s in particular Stalin was a force on the world music scene, and some of his many albums sold in significant quantities abroad. He was fiery by nature as well as in his lyrics, and among his best known songs were the classic Burn Dem (1987) – in which he begged Saint Peter to allow him to personally throw various world leaders, including Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, into the fires of hell – and More Come (1994), in which he celebrated an endless stream of black “warriors” ready to die in the battle against oppression. Such compositions stood in marked contrast to the trend for dance-based “bump and wine” calypsos that took hold in Trinidad and the wider Caribbean from the 80s onwards – and which threatened to undermine the proud calypsonian tradition of creating music with a political edge.
While Stalin knew as well as anyone that calypso has often been leavened with humour, sexual innuendo and good dance tunes, he appreciated that social and political commentary was at its heart. And although he was not above issuing the odd feelgood tune himself – two of them, Black Man Feeling to Party, and Look on the Bright Side, won him the Calypso Monarch competition in 1991 – in general he stuck to his guns. His body of work, generally stronger in meaning than in melody, was a mix of optimism and pessimism, often defiant and upbeat (as in his popular We Can Make It, from 1988, which encouraged Trinidadians to stand firm during an economic crisis) but just as frequently bemoaning the human condition (as in Ism Schism, from 1985, which despaired of the cynicism of politicians and the propensity of the electorate to fall for their tricks). Though ethnic identity was a preoccupation, and he referred to himself mainly just as “The Black Man”, Stalin was scornful of those who played what he called “race politics” and stood aside from the black power movement that threatened revolution in Trinidad in 1970. Instead he positioned himself as a voice of the poor, of whatever race. Born Leroy Calliste to Elcina, a market vendor, and her husband, George, in San Fernando in the south of Trinidad, he had a humble upbringing in the most impoverished part of town. Receiving only a cursory education at San Fernando Roman Catholic boys’ school, he spent much of his youth hanging around the practice yard of one of the local steelbands, the Free French Steel Orchestra, where he formed the idea of becoming an entertainer. After school there were a number of short-lived jobs, including as a clerk at the Point-a Pierre docks and as a limbo dancer. Showing little interest in a conventional career path, he was increasingly drawn to San Fernando’s calypso “tents” – where a roster of calypsonians showcase their latest compositions to the paying public, especially in the run-up to carnival. He made his singing debut at the Good Shepherd Friendly Society Hall in his home town in 1959 with the self-penned tune Why I Want to Be a Calypsonian, and by 1962 had found a regular home with the Southern Brigade tent in San Fernando, where he came under the wing of one of the most popular calypsonians of a previous generation, the fearsome Lord Blakie, who gave him the sobriquet Stalin. Although Calliste was too much in awe of Blakie ever to ask him why he had chosen the name, many later thought it suited his occasionally abrasive and dictatorial style, though he had a softer side to his personality too. Calliste became well enough established to join an early 60s tour of calypsonians around the Caribbean, and by 1964 he was appearing at the Original Young Brigade tent in the Trinidadian capital, Port of Spain, run by the greatest of all calypsonians, Mighty Sparrow. In the small economy of Trinidad, most calypsonians at that time regarded the idea of releasing records as an aspiration rather than an expectation. So although in 1966 Stalin issued his first single, he busied himself in subsequent years mainly with live performances – including a 1972 tour to New York – allied to yearly tilts at winning the calypso monarch competition, which offered the prospect of decent prize money. It took him until 1978 to find a financial backer to release his first album, To the Caribbean Man, material from which helped to win him his first calypso monarch crown in 1979. For the next decade many of Stalin’s lyrics were informed by Rastafarianism and he began to come to the attention of the wider world, making his first European tour in 1987. He won his second calypso monarch crown in 1985, followed by others in 1987, 1991 and 1995, by which time albums such as Rebellion (1994) and Message to Sundar (1995) – both on Eddy Grant’s Ice Records label – were meeting with critical approval across the globe. The height of Stalin’s activity and acclaim was from the late 70s to the early 2000s, but he managed to release a final album, Just for You, in 2009. Although he suffered a stroke in 2014, which left him unable to sing publicly, he maintained his status as one of Trinidad’s most beloved entertainers. He is survived by his wife, Patsy (nee Mitchell), whom he married in 1974, by their three children, Shaka, Keina and Abiola, and by two sons, Jason and Ray, from an earlier relationship. • Black Stalin (Leroy Calliste), singer, born 24 September 1941; died 28 December 2022";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/01/black-stalin-obituary;guardian;entertainment & culture;5809

He first worked on the sports and US diplomatic desks at Reuters before becoming assistant Washington correspondent for the Times in 1960. In that role he was on the airport tarmac in Washington when Jackie Kennedy landed with JFK’s blood still on her dress. He also attended the first Beatles concert in the US, interviewed Martin Luther King Jr and covered the Cuban missile crisis. Afterwards he moved to Beirut as Middle East correspondent for the Times, covering the six-day war and the British withdrawal from Aden, and was then the Times’s deputy features editor until 1970, when he took over as editor of the Cambridge Evening News. In 1974 he joined the Westminster Press newspaper group as editorial director, appointing and supporting its editors and helping to modernise its 120 titles, introducing new technology and setting up an editorial training centre in Hastings, Sussex. From 1992 until his retirement in 1995 he was the company’s deputy chief executive. Born in Watford to Elizabeth (nee Clark) and Dennis Herbert, Nick spent a number of his early years in Uganda, where his father was headteacher at King’s college in Budo. At the age of five he travelled with his family through France as it fell to Germany, taking a boat from Marseille to Mombasa and dodging the U-boats. When they eventually returned from Uganda to the UK, Nick attended Oundle school in Northamptonshire and then studied English at Cambridge University before setting off on his journalistic career with Reuters. In retirement he was influential in the creation of the Society of Editors and served on the executive committee of the National Trust. He was also the trust’s regional chair in East Anglia, overseeing the revival of Houghton Mill near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, walking past it daily to collect his copy of the Guardian. Nick’s other interests included genealogy, about which he wrote a book, Successive Journeys (2008), spilling the beans on his ancestors.

929;929;Most bosses secretly want all staff back in offices, says head of CBI;2023-01-27T10:02:40Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Confederation of British Industry (CBI)', 'Working from home', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'Work & careers'];;Most bosses secretly want to get all staff back to working in the office, according to the head of Britain’s leading business lobby group. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the whole world of work had “gone crazy” since the coronavirus pandemic, which led to a shift to more working from home for many people who used to work solely from the office. “You ask most bosses, everybody secretly wants everyone to come back to the office,” said Danker, who represents the interests of 190,000 UK businesses. “I just don’t think that is going to happen overnight,” he said on the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast. “I think we are all coping with this but we’re going to be talking about it for a few years. I think the whole world of work has gone crazy. We have no idea where it is going to land.” Companies moved to remote and flexible working during the Covid pandemic but many have tried to get staff back to offices since restrictions were lifted. Sectors such as banking have been quick to call staff back to offices, although in September HSBC told staff it was looking at whether to keep its global headquarters in Canary Wharf, where it has been based for more than two decades, after its lease for the 45-floor tower expires in 2027. However, other industries have maintained flexible working policies, with many staff saying they find the mix of office and remote working beneficial for productivity, health and wellbeing as well as a significant cost saving over full-time commuting amid the cost of living crisis. Research released by the online work platform LinkedIn in November found that 49% of companies would prefer staff to work more from the office, with 10% planning to force a return over “productivity paranoia”. However, the research found that 34% of workers said they would quit if they were told to return to the office full-time, and 58% said they would be less productive at work if flexible working policies were scaled back. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of people who are economically inactive – people aged between 16 and 64 not looking for work – is at a higher level than before the pandemic. “We are going to work with companies to make sure that they can bring you health support and wraparound care to absorb yourself back into work,” Danker said.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/27/most-bosses-secretly-want-all-staff-back-in-offices-says-head-of-cbi;guardian;business & economy;929

1182;1182;Britishvolt ‘collapsed owing £120m’ as UK car industry reports dismal year;2023-01-26T06:01:50Z;['Jasper Jolly', 'John Collingridge'];['Automotive industry', 'Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'UK news', 'Business', 'Northumberland', 'Tata', 'Jaguar Land Rover', 'Technology sector', 'Brexit'];;"The battery startup Britishvolt owed as much as £120m to creditors when it collapsed last week in a major blow to hopes of sustaining the British car industry, it can be revealed. Creditors are expected to recover a very small proportion of the debts, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, although there are understood to be several bids for the company and its assets. EY, a professional services firm, is handling the administration. EY is hoping to find a buyer for the remainder of the business – which has 26 staff remaining on its payroll – and the ownership of the site in Northumberland. The deadline for initial offers for the Britishvolt assets was Tuesday evening.
The failure of Britishvolt, after a desperate struggle to raise funds, came after a dismal year for the UK car industry. British factories built only 775,014 cars during 2022, the lowest annual figure since 1956, according to data published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. Production fell 9.8% from 2021, and declined 41% from 2019, before the pandemic. Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) also lost its crown as the biggest UK carmaker by volume to Japan’s Nissan. The UK car industry has been struggling with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic for three years, with output disrupted first by lockdowns, and then by supply chain problems including a severe global shortage of computer chips and interruption to supplies of parts from Ukraine after Russia invaded. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said “2020 was bad, ‘21 was worse, ‘22 was even worse.” The collapse in output was mainly driven by the closure of Honda’s Swindon factory. Despite the company’s denials, industry analysts said Brexit was likely a major factor in that decision. Hawes said uncertainty over the future of the UK-EU trading relationship would make it harder to attract investment to the UK. At the same time, the industry is gearing up to move to producing battery-electric vehicles. Britishvolt had been hailed by the former prime minister Boris Johnson as an “electric vehicle battery pioneer”, and was seen – in the absence of many more established rivals – as a flagship project for the government. Attracting battery production was seen as key to retaining automotive industry jobs and the government promised to give Britishvolt £100m in funding if it could meet milestones related to equipment purchases.
Britishvolt had received support from FTSE 100 companies Glencore, Ashtead and abrdn’s subsidiary Tritax. However, it ran out of cash before it could build its factory, amid revelations of profligate spending. Hawes said its collapse was a “disappointment”, if not a surprise. “Maybe something from the ashes will arise,” he said. Several companies have expressed a preliminary interest in the company or its assets. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns JLR, has also considered purchasing the site. DeaLab, a little-known Indonesia-linked private equity firm, put in an offer for the company before it went into administration. Recharge Industries, an Australian startup, has publicly expressed an interest in buying assets from the administration. The company, run by a 38-year-old former employee of PwC, a professional services firm, is also trying to build a battery factory in Geelong in southern Australia. Recharge put in its bid after being aided by Ian Botham, the former England cricketer, according to the Australian Financial Review (AFR), which first reported the offer. Lord Botham, who was awarded a peerage by Johnson, is now a UK-Australia trade envoy. “The UK is home to the most innovative and exciting companies in the world. It’s fantastic to have an Australian business wanting to invest in UK-Australia trade and investment opportunities,” Botham said in a statement to AFR. Botham was approached for comment. EY declined to comment and to provide a list of Britishvolt’s creditors until it publishes its administrator’s report in six or seven weeks’ time. EY has said it will not vote in creditor resolutions, after confirming that it is itself one of the smaller creditors after carrying out consultancy work for Britishvolt.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/26/britishvolt-collapsed-owing-120m-as-uk-car-industry-reports-dismal-year;guardian;business & economy;1182

Eve & Ranshaw, in the market town of Louth, Lincolnshire, has traded continuously since 1781 and is one of the oldest independent, family run department stores in the country. The business said on Wednesday it was shutting down, with its last day of business on Saturday 4 March and its online shop closing on 30 January. “It is with a heavy heart that we close after 240 years of service in Louth,” the retailer said in a statement. “In recent years we have faced some challenging times with changes in customer shopping habits, lockdown closures, rising business costs and the current cost of living crisis. Regrettably, it has now reached a point where the department store is no longer viable.” It asked for “consideration and support” for the staff affected, “some of whom have served the business for decades”. The store’s owner, Marcus Sandwith, who inherited the business from his father and grandfather, described the announcement as “a really sad day”. “Before my father died in 2019, I made a promise to him that I would give it my best go, to take things forward,” he told the BBC. “But even then he said you have to see how things go because he knew things were changing with online shopping. We have given it a really good go.” The store was founded in 1781 by Adam Eve, a farmer’s son, and originally traded in grocery, wool and linen goods. Over the years it expanded under several owner partnerships, including that of Thomas Ranshaw, who started there as a 13-year-old apprentice, and moved into high-class tailoring and fashion along with home furnishing products and services. It was bought by Christoper Sandwith and his son, David, in 1977, before it was passed on to David’s son, Marcus. The doorway of the store, on Market Place in the town centre, features a timeline of the reigns of monarchs during which it has served customers. Sandwith said the family hoped to continue their guardianship of the Grade-II listed building and would only consider leasing it to businesses that are “community-minded”. “It has been there for a long time. We want to be the guardians of that building still, and make sure that whoever does come in adds value to Louth,” he said. Adam Grist, a councillor who is portfolio holder for market towns and rural economy at East Lindsey district council, said: “The department store is a huge part of the history of Louth town centre and has been much loved by generations of families over the years. The loss of the store will be felt particularly by the town’s many independent shops and everyone who comes to Louth to shop there.” In 2015 Eve & Ranshaw appeared on the Channel 4 show The Takeover featuring the Dragons’ Den star Hilary Devey, who presided over a revamp aimed at attracting younger customers. The store said in its statement it “could not have been as successful as it was without the support and loyalty” of its customers, as it thanked the public for “being with our shop in all its ups and downs”.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/19/one-uk-oldest-department-stores-eve-ranshaw-shut-costs-rise;guardian;business & economy;2512
4215;4215;I’m the perfect target for buccal fat removal – this is how I’ve resisted it | Moya Lothian-McLean ;2023-01-11T07:00:10Z;['Moya Lothian-McLean'];['Beauty', 'Fashion', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'Cosmetic surgery', 'Celebrity', 'Social media', 'Digital media'];;"A fresh source of insecurity to carry into the new year: buccal fat. The end of 2022, rumours circulated that the actor Lea Michele had undergone a cosmetic procedure designed to chisel the cheeks. That procedure, according to the internet know-it-alls, is buccal fat removal. All the girls are (allegedly) getting it: Bella Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, Zoë Kravitz. It’s the procedure du jour, darling. The sudden prominence of buccal fat removal in wider cultural parlance was startling to me, not least because it was something I’d already spent late nights Googling during one of those pesky 11pm collapses of self-esteem. As a woman of chubby cheeks experience, who spends too much time on her laptop, I am well acquainted with buccal fat and the heated speculation surrounding which celebrities – mostly female – have supposedly had theirs hacked out.
When I first heard about the procedure, it felt like a neurosis created just for me, with my wide, oval face and broad baby cheeks that confine me to perpetual childhood. The overwhelming facial ideal of the last decade has been one of angular, sharp lines: cheekbones and jawlines that can cut glass, arching brows. A feline look, exemplified by the likes of Hadid and Michaela Coel, paired with plump, pillowy lips and big doe eyes. Dubbed “Instagram face” (although that term feels passé now), the aesthetic borrows from many different sources – writer Joanna Fuertes-Knight observed in 2018 that the elements adding up to the “new beauty” are a mishmash of features drawn from a variety of ethnicities, thus making it even harder to attain naturally. Which is why, with wearying regularity, a new “tweakment” appears, promising to bring you a step closer to that elusive ideal. That ideal is a product of our visual culture – tailored for image production, created to be captured on camera. It is a beauty made up of incohesive, bitty pieces which, on celluloid, can look incredible. In person, however, the impact is often less than the sum of its parts. I do not write this to be cruel or judgmental; beauty is subjective and often a sensitive topic, especially for those who have permanently altered their appearance. I am not opposed to cosmetic procedures; the likelihood is I will end up having one at some point, given my age, influences and track record of trailing the herd. I have many close friends who’ve had great work done. But what I’m referring to here is the shock of meeting, in person, those who have crafted the “perfect” face, only to realise that a full bricolage of cosmetic treatments often leaves one looking – and forgive me – a little like a plasticised Cabbage Patch doll.
This is because the camera does lie. Research shows that those basing their ideal on the barrage of photos they see online and what their selfie camera shows can develop a distorted perception of how they look – and of which features require “tweaking”. There is also only so much a face can be treated like Silly Putty (and filled with it) before it takes on an uncanny valley quality. I think this is why, when push comes to shove – and despite frequent searches for “preventive Botox” or “non-surgical nose contouring” – I have not (yet) taken the plunge. I know that my fixation on certain parts of myself, whether my cheeks or cupid’s bow, are trend-led, and will probably change in a few months. And I’m conscious that with treatments so readily available, one moment of dissatisfaction could lead to a decision that would long outlast the feeling of self-loathing.
Then there’s the upkeep. While procedures like dermal fillers are marketed as easy, low-maintenance ways to achieve The Face, they are, in fact, a lifelong commitment. Fillers “migrate”, and need dissolving and reinjecting; “preventive” Botox, once started, may weaken and prematurely age muscles. Buccal fat that appeared a burden in youth needs surgically replacing as the years pass. And that’s before you consider the psychological impact such work can have. One former Love Island contestant, whose rock-hard enhanced pout became a focal point of discussion among viewers, said that her mouth without fillers had looked like an “80-year-old man’s ball sack”. Except that pictures she later posted contradicted her statement: without fillers, they were just normal lips. Once this particular critical and exacting lens is turned on, it seems nigh-on impossible to find contentment in how you look; there is always something new to adjust, especially if you are only as “beautiful” as the last least-flattering image snapped of you. Deep down, I want to be beautiful according to the current, mainstream understanding of the word. It is rare that a woman like me doesn’t long for this, having stepped into adulthood during an age in which image rules supreme and the definition of “beauty” has tightened like a corset, no matter the empowering messages that lifestyle magazines like to parrot. But I also prize my self-esteem. And, contrary to so much of the socialisation that goes into building a girl, I do not think the two easily coexist – or at least not right now. To be beautiful in 2023 is an exhausting, sisyphean undertaking of reappraisal and self-critique, and requires a willingness to constantly remake oneself in the mould of the look of the month. It takes so much time, energy, money and discontent. “Why be beautiful when you can be happy?” I think, and smile wide with all the supposedly “excess” fat my cheeks have to offer.

654;654;No sunlight, no soil – no worries as vertical farming looks stacked with promise;2023-01-28T19:00:28Z;['Donna Lu'];['Australia news', 'Agriculture', 'Farming', 'Science'];;"Not far from the fertile farmlands known as Australia’s salad bowl, rows of fruit and vegetables are being cultivated without sunlight or soil. Perfect-looking strawberries, tomatoes, baby cos lettuces and coriander grow under moody purple fluorescent lighting. Here in the research wing of a 4000 sq metre facility at Arundel on the Gold Coast, the intensity and timing of light, the humidity of the air, and the nutrients in the water supply are all intricately controlled.
Founded in 2017, indoor vertical farming company Stacked Farm bills itself as being able to produce fresh fruit and vegetables year-round, using less water than traditional farming and without the need for pesticides. In months, its leafy vegetables will hit the shelves of major supermarkets around the country. Stacked Farm, the biggest player in Australia’s vertical farming industry, says the technique can produce more crops more quickly and in less space than traditional agriculture requires. Vertical farming refers to indoor farming in controlled environments, usually in the absence of soil and natural light, and involves well-established horticultural techniques. Stacked Farm, for instance, uses a form of hydroponics, growing its plants in rockwool, a material similar to an insulation batt, while a channel of water flows underneath. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup As weather events around Australia become more extreme and threaten food supply chains, the reliability of indoor farming may become an increasingly alluring choice. But the approach has been criticised for the high energy inputs it requires, with industry players even saying they are not trying to do away with outdoor farming altogether.
Vertical farming: towers of produce American academic Dickson Despommier first floated the idea of vertical farming more than two decades ago, envisaging city skyscrapers filled with produce to feed tens of thousands of urbanites.
Efforts to put vertical farming into practice began around 2010 in the US where there have been major produce supply challenges, says Paul Gauthier, a professor of protected cropping at the University of Queensland (UQ). A decade on, commercial vertical farming is now booming in the US and Europe, but locally the industry is lagging behind, in part because Australia has historically been food secure. “Australia has plenty of space, a low population density, a fairly stable climate and significant expanses of agricultural land. It simply does not have the same pressures on agriculture as do other countries,” says Floris Van Ogtrop, an associate professor at the University of Sydney. “This has meant that investment in vertical farming … in Australia is not comparable to other countries.” Paul Millett, co-founder of InvertiGro, an Australian firm that specialises in stackable vertical farming modules, agrees. “We’re kind of hamstrung in a way because we’ve been blessed with our abundance of fresh produce,” he says. “However, particularly in the last couple of years with Covid and floods and fires, we’ve had lots of supply chain challenges, and people have seen shelves empty of lettuces.” With the extreme weather set to continue, Australian firms are starting to go commercial.
From July, Stacked Farm will begin commercial-scale farming using a fully automated process from seeding to bagging, says Michael Spencer, the firm’s chief commercial officer. Half of the floor space at Arundel will soon be filled with 10-metre high growing modules, each housing 15 levels of produce. Spencer estimates the facility will be able to produce between 400 and 440 tonnes of produce a year, depending on the crop. Two larger farms, in Melbourne and Sydney, are planned for in the coming years. Stacked Farm has already signed supply deals with wholesalers such as MorCoFresh, which supplies chains such as Grill’d and Guzman y Gomez, and PMFresh, whose salad bags can be found on the shelves in major supermarkets. InvertiGro – which produces stackable vertical farming modules “almost like Lego” – has also established contracts with food distributors and retailers such as Woolworths, Millett says. It has grown more than 200 crops to date, including leafy greens, berries, soft fruits and vegetables, and the firm is also experimenting with growing medicinal cannabis, flowering crops and fodder for livestock feed. One advantage of indoor farming is that the conditions can be optimised to shorten the time to harvest. “For leafy greens, we’re getting a crop … at least every four weeks or thereabouts,” Millett says. Spencer cites a similar length at Stacked Farm, with a growth cycle taking between 14 and 30 days for leafy greens. “For traditional farming, depending on the region and if the climate is [good], you get anywhere from five to six harvests a year,” he says. “In indoor farming, we’re now getting roughly 17 harvests … out of that same period.” There is also the benefit of a reduced need for water, which is traditionally lost to evaporation or runoff. Spencer says Stacked Farm uses 95% less water than farming in a field. “Every time water moves through the system, it’s captured and re-used. The only water that leaves the facility is in the plant itself.” UQ’s Gauthier is researching vertical farming for crops that may become more difficult to grow outdoors in future. “The areas of land on Earth where we can grow coffee and cacao are shrinking because of climate change,” he says. Currently in a field, the time from seed to harvest for cacao is about three years, whereas, “In vertical farming, it will take 12 months”. The energy issue But vertical farming has an achilles heel: energy consumption. “Depending on which study you read, if a mix of energy from the grid would be used, the CO2 equivalents and nitrogen equivalents of producing lettuce in a vertical farm can be up to double that of conventional agriculture,” Van Ogtrop says. However, he adds, the figures can sway in favour of vertical farms if they are run on renewable energy. Solar power could help bring down energy costs, Spencer, says, but is not a panacea. “Large scale farms will have solar on each roof. To give you an idea, it might support 10 to 15% of our needs.” Millett concedes that energy cost is a key consideration. “It’s about minimising the amount of energy that goes into a lettuce or bunch of basil. It’s optimising the lights … only with the intensity and colour spectrum that they need.” Other drawbacks of vertical farming include the use of synthetic fertilisers, which either come from energy intensive processes or are mined, Van Ogtrop says. Though there is interest in recycling nutrients from sources like food waste, such processes are still in their early days. Van Ogtrop adds that the growth materials used, such as coconut coir, rockwool, peat moss and perlite, “are often not sourced sustainably or ethically and may have downstream environmental or health impacts”. And there is also the risk of pests ruining a crop, Millett says, adding that one benefit of the InvertiCube’s modular set-up – each has walls and glass doors – means it has greater resistance to pests than other forms of vertical farming. Ultimately, Stacked Farm wants to fill supply chain shortages rather than do away with outdoor fields. “We’re not here to displace traditional farming,” Spencer says. Van Ogtrop agrees with Spencer, believing that, “Vertical farming is not going to replace broad-acre farming for growing our grains and legumes.” “Much of our fruit and veg will still be grown under the sun and in soil, which is why it is super important that we invest in sustainable agriculture and do all we can to mitigate climate change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/no-sunlight-soil-vertical-farming-stacked-farms;guardian;science & technology;654
1745;1745;‘Why don’t we just write the stupidest song ever?’ How the Darkness made I Believe in a Thing Called Love;2023-01-23T14:24:14Z;['Ralph Jones'];['Culture', 'Music', 'The Darkness', 'Pop and rock'];;"Dan Hawkins, guitarist I can’t remember who said it but we were having a conversation along the lines of: “Why don’t we just write the stupidest song ever?” It was probably Justin, my brother, who came up with the first riff: he and Frankie were sparring with that ridiculous chorus line very early on. I came up with the bridge and the back end of the chorus and tried to put it into some sort of semblance of a song. We took that arrangement into a dingy rehearsal room a few days later. I expected us all to feel embarrassed playing it. But everyone was singing along to the chorus the second time it came around. We looked at each other and thought: “This is it. It’s staying.” I was like: “Oh fuck. It’s staying.” The arrangement is super-tight. It’s almost signposted – you know where it’s going the moment it starts. You know what it’s all about. A lot of the best songs are like that. I spent a long time in the studio getting the perfect tempo, making sure the drums were absolutely spot-on. The crab that features in the music video meant something to the band. It was a reference to when you’ve taken lots of cocaine and your eyes are basically on stalks. It has appeared on numerous occasions throughout our career. We’ve always had an affinity with sea creatures, possibly because we’re from Lowestoft in Suffolk. We arrived in Canada to start a tour of the Americas, months after our album Permission to Land had been released. It had gone back to No 1. We never considered ourselves a singles band, which was why that song was a problem for me in the first place. For me, the Darkness was about albums and being an incredible rock band. I wasn’t bothered about being popular. To record it, I probably played it 200 times. And since then, I’d say the total is pushing 4,000. Every tour we did, we’d soundcheck with it as well. Three times a day, five times a week. What’s surprising is how big it is internationally. We played that song to 400,000 people at a free festival in Poland and every single one of them was going crazy and singing it back to us. We played to a full stadium supporting Lady Gaga in 2011 in São Paolo and it was the same. It’s like that wherever we go. Everything about the song pushes positivity. It just feels great to play.
Justin Hawkins, lead singer, guitarist We didn’t labour over it. We didn’t toil and look for the ultimate riff. I was just following my fingers, really. I think we were sitting at what we used to call the Table of Truth: it was a round wooden table in the flat where Frankie [bass-player] and Dan [guitarist] lived. Things that are cartoonish and ridiculous – that’s my raison d’être. The ridiculous things that the Darkness do are tempered by Dan’s actual good taste. For me to be turned on, it’s got to have something in it that makes him go: “You can’t do that.” I was almost on a pathological quest to put “love” in every single song. Bands were afraid to actually talk about love. But the huge songs, the ones that really get you in the heart, they’re actually talking about it and they’re using the word “love”. I’m always in love, that’s the reality. It’s one of the first and most abiding addictions of my life. I remember when we rehearsed the song, our manager came down and just said: “That’s a hit, that is.” This was news to us. We recorded it in 2001 – the lead vocal was recorded on 11 September, the day of the 9/11 attacks. We played it with Robbie Williams at Knebworth a few summers later. It really was like: “Shit! Now we’re famous.” My goal has always been to get every pair of hands in the air. And often that was the case. We’ve seen a lot of hands in a lot of different airspace. Every time we play it, the place kicks off and I feel relief because I can play it on autopilot. Even now, people sing it at me in the street. I’ll never have anything but abiding affection for that song.

4074;4074;Gwen Stefani faces backlash over ‘I’m Japanese’ comment;2023-01-11T18:19:05Z;['Maya Yang'];['Gwen Stefani', 'Race', 'US news', 'Music'];;The singer and TV host Gwen Stefani faced widespread backlash after claiming: “I’m Japanese.” In an interview with Allure magazine released on Tuesday, Stefani, who is of Irish and Italian descent, was promoting her GXVE beauty brand when she said: “My God, I’m Japanese and I didn’t know it.” The 53-year-old described the influence Japanese culture had on her childhood, when her father, who is Italian American, worked for Yamaha and traveled between California and Japan. “That was my Japanese influence and that was a culture that was so rich with tradition, yet so futuristic [with] so much attention to art and detail and discipline and it was fascinating to me,” Stefani told the Allure editor Jesa Marie Calaor, who is Filipino American. Stefani described her father’s stories of Japanese street performers cosplaying as Elvis Presley and women with colorful hair and said that when she grew older, she traveled to Harajuku, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo, known for eclectic clothing stores and cosplay shops and which eventually served as the inspiration for her fragrance line, Harajuku Lovers. “I said, ‘My God, I’m Japanese and I didn’t know it,’” Stefani said. Calaor wrote that Stefani’s words “seemed to hang in the air” between them. “I am, you know,” Stefani said. Stefani also said she considered herself a “super fan” of Japanese culture. Stefani has long faced claims of cultural appropriation, beginning with the release of her 2004 album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. A tour in support of the album featured four Japanese backup dancers: Maya Chino, known as Love, Jennifer Kita, known as Angel, Rino Nakasone, known as Music, and Mayuko Kitayama, known as Baby. Calaor wrote: “Like Stefani, I am not Japanese. But I am an Asian woman living in America, which comes with sobering realities during a time of heightened Asian American and Pacific Islander hate. “I envy anyone who can claim to be part of this vibrant, creative community but avoid the part of the narrative that can be painful or scary.” Calaor wrote that Stefani said she was Japanese multiple times but also said she identified with Hispanic and Latino communities and was “a little bit of an Orange county girl, a little bit of a Japanese girl, a little bit of an English girl”. Stefani’s comments generated widespread backlash online. One commenter wrote: “The white culture of thinking you can identify as a person of color simply because you like something about that culture. It is not appreciation. It is exactly the theft and erasure that live at the origin of genocide, enslavement, and colonialism.” Another wrote: “God, imagine being an Asian American editor and hearing Gwen Stefani repeat over and over again, ‘I’m Japanese.’ “People like Gwen Stefani can adopt all the cool things they want from Asian cultures, yet won’t have to worry about being pushed off a [New York City] subway platform because of her race.” That was a reference to an Asian woman killed last year. The author Roxane Gay tweeted: “Gwen Stefani’s publicist must be busy today.” According to Allure, a representative for Stefani indicated Stefani’s comments had been misunderstood. Asked for an on-the-record comment or clarification, Stefani’s team declined to provide a statement, the magazine said.;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/11/gwen-stefani-japanese-comments-allure-interview;guardian;entertainment & culture;4074
4034;4034;Biden under scrutiny as second batch of classified documents reportedly found;2023-01-11T23:16:29Z;['David Smith'];['Joe Biden', 'Biden administration', 'US politics', 'US news'];;"Joe Biden was facing fresh scrutiny over his handling of government secrets on Wednesday after a second batch of classified materials was reportedly found at a location linked to him. The White House was already on the defensive after revelations that classified documents were discovered last November in an office used by Biden after he served as US vice-president. On Tuesday he said he was “surprised to learn” of their existence. Then came a report from the NBC News network, followed by other media outlets, that said the president’s aides had found another set of classified documents at a separate location. The classification level, number and precise location of the material was not immediately clear, NBC News added.
The allegation handed fresh ammunition to Republicans seeking to draw a false equivalence with a justice department investigation into former president Donald Trump’s mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator for Missouri and ardent Trump defender, responded to the disclosure by tweeting: “Special counsel”. Biden maintained an office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a thinktank in Washington, after he left the vice-presidency in 2017 until shortly before he launched his 2020 presidential campaign. It was affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and continued to operate independently of the Biden administration. Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, has said “a small number of documents with classified markings” were discovered on 2 November 2022 in a locked closet at the centre as Biden’s personal lawyers were clearing out the offices. According to Sauber, the lawyers immediately alerted the White House counsel’s office, which notified the National Archives, which took custody of the documents the next day. But it remains unclear why the administration waited more than two months to acknowledge the discovery of the records and what exactly they contain. Trump weighed in on his social media site, demanding: “When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?” At a press conference in Mexico on Tuesday, Biden said he took classified documents “seriously” and his team acted appropriately by quickly turning the documents over. “They did what they should have done. They immediately called the Archives.” But a day later his spokesperson, Karine Jean-Pierre, faced tough questioning from a White House press corps starved of scandal since the end of the Trump presidency. She declined to say how the documents came to be at the office or when Biden was informed of their existence or provide assurances that other materials would not come to light. “I know you all are going to have a lot of questions on this but at this time I’m not going to go beyond what the president said yesterday,” Jean-Pierre said. “I’m not going to go beyond what my colleagues from the White House counsel shared with many of you as well on Monday. I want to be prudent here and make sure that my colleagues really truly handle this issue.” Asked why it had taken so long for the existence of the documents to be disclosed, she replied: “This is under review by the Department of Justice.” There was an unusually acrimonious exchange with Ed O’Keefe, senior White House correspondent of CBS News, who pointed out that Biden had started his tenure by acknowledging that he would make mistakes and be transparent about them. Jean-Pierre retorted: “We don’t need to have this kind of confrontation. Ask your question.” The attorney general, Merrick Garland, has reportedly asked the US attorney for the northern district of Illinois, John Lausch – one of the few US attorneys to be held over from Trump’s administration – to review the matter after the Archives referred the issue to the department. The situation contrasts sharply with that of Trump, who had about 300 documents with classification markings, including some that were recovered in an FBI search after his lawyers provided a sworn certification that all government records had been returned. In November Garland appointed Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor with a background in public corruption cases, to lead investigations into Trump’s retention of classified documents, as well as key aspects of a separate investigation regarding the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. But such distinctions are likely to be lost on many voters, especially as Republicans and rightwing media capitalise on the apparent misstep and accuse the justice department of double standards. Reports of a second batch of documents are likely to add fuel to the fire. Congressman Jim Jordan, chair of the House of Representatives’ judiciary committee, said the American public deserved to know earlier about the revelation of Biden’s classified documents. “They knew about this a week before the election, maybe the American people should have known that,” he told reporters. “They certainly knew about the raid on Mar-a-Lago 91 days before this election, but nice if on 2 November, the country would have known that there were classified documents at the Biden Center.” Congressman Mike Turner of the House intelligence committee has requested that the US intelligence community conduct a “damage assessment” of the documents found at the Penn Center. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/11/joe-biden-second-batch-classified-documents;guardian;politics;4034
371;371;Legal & General chief executive Nigel Wilson to retire;2023-01-30T10:23:31Z;['Kalyeena Makortoff'];['Legal and General', 'Insurance industry', 'Business', 'UK news'];;"The chief executive of Legal & General, Nigel Wilson, is to retire after more than a decade leading Britain’s largest asset manager and insurance group. L&G, which manages £1.3tn worth of assets for clients including workplace pension schemes, is now on the hunt for a successor. The company said it would consider internal and external candidates to replace Wilson, who would stay in the role for the next year while recruitment was under way.
Investors appeared disappointed by the news, pushing L&G shares down nearly 2% on Monday. “The market reaction suggests Wilson will be missed. The shares have made progress under his tenure as he has quietly got on with the job of creating a more coherent business,” Russ Mould, a director for the online investment platform AJ Bell, said. The 66-year-old, who was knighted for services to the financial industry last year, has been at the helm of L&G since 2012, after joined the company as chief financial officer in 2009. Under his leadership, L&G made large investments in regional projects including affordable housing, and pushed for big changes in government regulations, including loosening rules over how much cash insurers should hold to protect against risks on their balance sheets. While the asset manager has thrived financially during his time as chief executive, a division of its investment arm was temporarily thrown into turmoil last autumn during the UK bond market meltdown after the government’s disastrous mini-budget. It was one of the first asset managers to pass on collateral calls to workplace pension schemes – requiring large cash sums to cover complex hedging products that nearly caused some funds to collapse. The asset manager said on Monday that Wilson’s retirement would mark the end of his executive career, suggesting he was likely to take further boardroom or advisory roles after he steps down from L&G. However, he is likely to be selective about his next move, having reportedly snubbed Liz Truss last year by turning down a job as minister for investment in her short-lived time in office. Wilson, who grew up on a council estate in Newton Aycliffe and went on to study economics at the University of Essex, is a member of the government’s levelling-up advisory council and the life sciences industrial strategy implementation board. He served on the business councils under a number of prime ministers including Boris Johnson. Commenting on his retirement, Wilson said: “I firmly believe we have laid strong foundations to support the next phase of growth for the group, with one of the most talented, collaborative and collegiate management teams in any industry to deliver this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/legal-general-chief-executive-nigel-wilson-retire-shares-ftse-100;guardian;business & economy;371

She’s been a customer for over five years, mostly because she finds the panties more comfortable than pads, plus she can wash and reuse them every cycle. “They provide a sense of security so I don’t worry about leaks or bleeding through clothes,” said Gjesdahl, who is 28 and lives in Wisconsin. She started using the brand’s “super absorbent” style after she bled for weeks post-partum. The underwear, made with cotton, nylon and elastane, is leak-resistant and can hold up to five regular tampons’ worth of blood. “[Thinx was] the only pair of underwear I wore for three or four weeks after my child was born,” Gjesdahl said. “It was a relief to not have to wear the giant pads the hospital provides.” But her relief turned to disappointment this week after news broke that the New York-based brand had settled a class-action lawsuit regarding its supposedly “organic, sustainable and non-toxic” underwear.
Though Thinx denies “improper or unlawful” behavior, the brand faced allegations in court “regarding the presence of short chain per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (‘PFAS’)”, also known as “forever chemicals”. According to the EPA, PFAS are “widely used, long lasting chemicals, components of which break down very slowly over time”. These chemicals have been found “in the blood of people and animals all over the world” and “may be linked to harmful health effects in humans”. That said, researchers still do not know just how harmful PFAS are to humans, or exactly how much people are exposed to them. In the class-action suit, Thinx said that PFAS “have never been a part of its product design, and that it will continue to take measures to help ensure that PFAS are not intentionally added to Thinx Period Underwear at any stage of production”. Customers who submit valid claims to buying Thinx products between 2016 and 2022 can receive $7 per purchase for a maximum of three purchases. Thinx brands itself as a sustainable alternative to single-use pads and tampons. Its website pledges that the underwear is made “carefully and consciously, from [our] sustainable manufacturing processes to ethical working conditions”. Thinx also has a line for children experiencing their first few cycles, called Thinx Teen. A reported one million people use Thinx products. Now, consumers such as Gjesdahl wonder if they’ve unknowingly exposed themselves to toxic chemicals – and what period product they will reach for next. “I’m disappointed because I love these products and now I’m scared about the impacts that PFAS and silver nanoparticles might have had on my health that I’m not experiencing yet, like cancer,” Gjesdahl said. On Twitter, other customers also directed their anger at the brand. “This is trash and the settlement amount is trash, thinx costs so much money … why is it so hard to find safe menstrual products?” one user wrote. “Nothing quite like reading about the Thinx lawsuit while wearing a pair,” tweeted another.
Brianna, a 34-year-old from Minnesota, has shopped at Thinx for a little over a year. She calls the products “game-changing” and said the underwear made her period more manageable and less noticeable. But she does not feel safe using the products now, and feels defeated having to find another go-to menstrual product when so many of them do not work for her anatomy. (Brianna asked that her last name not be used.) “Finding a menstrual product you like is so insanely frustrating because not everything works for everybody,” Brianna said. “Period products are not cheap, they vary widely from brand to brand, and even though I’ve had a period for over two decades, I’m still finding what works for me.” Representatives for Thinx did not respond to a request for comment. For many, the search for a suitable menstrual product goes on. Pads can feel bulky and show through tight clothing. Tampons are a bit less cumbersome, though like pads they are single-use products that build up waste and can also include harmful chemicals such as phthalates and dioxins. Menstrual cups are considered an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative, though inserting these silicone or rubber devices can be messy and they can be ill-fitting. When over 1.8 billion people around the world menstruate each month, why is it so hard for them to find quality period products? Chris Bobel, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says it has to do with menstrual stigma. As long as a device obscures the fact that a woman has her period, she may feel grateful for the coverage, not skeptical or curious about how it works. “Our socialized priority is to conceal our menstruating bodies, and not to question the types of products that we use,” Bobel said. “It really is a perfect set-up for the industry to take advantage of us and exploit our desperation to pass as non-menstruating.”
Though today’s menstruators are too young to have experienced the panic over toxic shock syndrome linked to the ultra-absorbent Rely tampons Procter & Gamble sold in the 1970s, that fear of harmful period products looms large. “A startup [like Thinx] can take advantage of that, even if they represent themselves as different from the major manufacturers, like David in the face of Goliath,” Gobel said. And that’s certainly part of Thinx’s brand. The company differentiated itself from the Tampaxes of the world with in-your-face ads, which sometimes featured images of tampon strings or yonic fruit. Former fans like Brianna won’t be sticking around for the next boundary-pushing campaign. “Now, I’m back to square one and out hundreds of dollars,” she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/thinx-underwear-menstruation-period-pfas;guardian;health;2624
1477;1477;Zara Aleena’s family may sue over murder by released prisoner;2023-01-24T18:35:34Z;['Vikram Dodd'];['Prisons and probation', 'Crime', 'London', 'UK criminal justice', 'Law', 'Society', 'UK news'];;"The family of Zara Aleena are considering taking legal action over the disastrous failings that led to her murder by a recently released prisoner, the Guardian has been told. It follows an official report that found Jordan McSweeney, 29, who murdered the aspiring lawyer in June 2022, should have been assessed by probation officers as a high-risk offender, but was classed as posing a medium risk when he was released part way through a sentence. He kicked and beat Aleena, 35, to death as she walked home after an evening out, near her home in Ilford, east London, and has been jailed for life for her murder.
McSweeney killed Aleena nine days after being released on licence from prison on 17 June. Two days before the murder, he had been recalled to prison for breaching his release conditions – with the first breach having happened a day after he was freed. The report by the probation inspectorate found McSweeney had a long history of misogynistic and racially aggravated incidents, the chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, said. The report found staff had huge caseloads, worsened by large-scale vacancies. Farah Naz, Aleena’s aunt, who has acted as the family spokesperson since the murder, told the Guardian the family still had questions and would fight for them to be answered. Naz said if the probation service had acted correctly, Aleena would still be alive. “This would not have happened,” she said. “This could have been prevented.”
She said the family would sue, adding that they would use an inquest to get the answers they needed if officials had not been honest and open with them before then. Naz said the failing system emboldened offenders, and cited McSweeney as an example: “There has been failing after failing after failing. He was not scared of the consequences. “This was a busy road [where Zara was attacked and killed]. A main road. He spent considerable time there attacking her. He was not scared of attacking her, he was not scared of prison. “He knew how to play the system, there was no deterrent.”
Naz said report after report found huge problems with the prison and probation services, echoing sentiments expressed by MPs in a parliamentary debate on Tuesday. It was the responsibility of those who ran the services, and those who inspected them, to speak out about lack of resources, she said. “You need to make a loud noise and say: ‘We are not getting enough money and mistakes will be made,’” she said. “We need to say to the deputy PM [Dominic Raab]: ‘What are you going to do about it?’” It is understood that, after the blistering inspectorate report, Raab, who is also the justice secretary, is considering meeting the family. In his report, Russell said the probation staff involved were experiencing unmanageable workloads, made worse by high staff vacancy rates – “something we have increasingly seen in our local inspections of services”. In the Commons, the justice minister Damian Hinds said he was “profoundly sorry” for the blunders and claimed the government was recruiting more staff. Hinds said: “The probation service needs more staff and that’s why we’ve invested heavily in getting additional funding of more than £155m a year to deliver tougher supervision of offenders, reduce case loads, and recruit thousands more staff to make the public safer.” Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, said the probation service was in “freefall” and said: “McSweeney’s repeated failure to attend probation appointments should have triggered swift action. He was recalled to prison two days before he attacked Zara, but he was never arrested and brought in. If he had been, Zara would still be alive.” Reed added: “The fact is, these are all problems the government knew about but failed to act on with urgency. For that reason the government must shoulder its share of responsibility.” Naz said the the family were still stunned by Aleena’s brutal killing. “It is a struggle for us. It has only been seven months. Our lives have been affected forever. We have this man who walked into our lives and destroyed us.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/24/zara-aleenas-family-may-sue-over-by-released-prisoner;guardian;entertainment & culture;1477
8150;8150;Cost of living latest: I tried being paid to use less electricity four times - but how much did I earn?;;[];['cost of living', 'live'];['energy', 'earn', 'sessions', 'paid', 'living', 'cut', 'hours', 'saving', 'really', 'worth', 'tried', 'cost', 'latest', 'save', 'peak', 'electricity', 'savings', 'times'];"I tried the Octopus Energy saving sessions to see if you can really save £100 off your bill

Analysis by Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter

The promise of up to £100 off your energy bill seems like a great deal, all for the price of turning off your lights for a few short hours.

But can sitting in the dark really save you £100?

Households are being promised savings if they cut back their electricity use during certain peak hours - with the first real run of the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) taking place last night and today.

It seems like a no-brainer amid an energy crisis that has left millions struggling with their monthly payments.

I'm with Octopus Energy and opted into their Saving Sessions as soon as they became available on the app. The energy provider has run five since November.

Of these, I opted into four (I forgot to click to opt in to one on 30 November) and diligently turned off the electricity as much as possible during the set time periods.

Washing machine? Off. Lights? Off. TV? Off. Heating? Off.

I even timed to be out during one of them, to guarantee I wasn't using any electricity.

My savings so far? £2.36.

So, is it worth it?

I only live with one other person - unless you count the two cats - which means our energy usage is already relatively low, and we struggled to cut back any further. This resulted in very minimal savings through the scheme.

We use the washing machine a few times a week (at most) and already did it during the day, and my irregular work hours mean I often cook dinner later at night after peak time has already passed.

Like us, if you already have fairly low energy usage - or use it mainly out of peak demand - you may find you can't quite cut back to the percentage required to save money.

Indeed, during two of the sessions, we didn't save a single penny (including one time when we went weren't in the property).

I am also reluctant to turn off any of the constantly-on appliances in my home (the fridge and freezer) because if I'm only going to be saving a few pennies, is it worth the risk of all my food going rancid?

But it's never a bad idea to consider how much energy you use and try to cut back (whatever time of day) and you lose absolutely nothing from opting in.

In fact, despite my minimal savings, I would recommend anyone who can sign up for the scheme does so - every penny counts.

Households who were already using a lot of energy during peak hours (5pm to 9pm) will likely find they save more by shifting their schedules around by an hour. But for smaller households, or those with irregular hours, be aware that your rewards may be much lower than the promised £100.

Plus, the main reason behind these sessions isn't really money - it's reducing the UK's energy consumption in a bid to prevent blackouts.

So I'll continue to sign up for every session, and dutifully turn off most of the appliances in my home, at the very least to try and take some pressure off the National Grid.

And who knows - maybe this session will be the one where I save enough to make it worth it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124101913/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-i-tried-being-paid-to-use-less-electricity-four-times-but-how-much-did-i-earn-12615118;skynews;business & economy;2241
2868;2868;Nine Network feels absence of stars as big numbers come through Australian Open gates;2023-01-18T04:05:44Z;['Emma Kemp'];['Australian Open 2023', 'Australian Open', 'Tennis', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'Australian media'];;"The Australian Open’s loss of Nick Kyrgios and Ash Barty has not stopped crowds coming through the gates, but fewer are tuning in from home for a grand slam marked by a plethora of high-profile absences. Questions around how the lack of two of the tournament’s biggest draw cards would affect local interest were partially answered in the first two days of action, though a full picture will not be clear until the end of next week.
Attendances, at least, do not appear to have suffered. The opening day brought record crowds through the gates at Melbourne Park, with 49,274 turning out for the day session and 28,670 for the evening. On Tuesday, 37,149 braved the extreme heat during the day session and 29,875 were not turned off by the night session’s downpours. But host broadcaster, the Nine Network, is feeling the absence of big names also including retirees Serena Williams and Roger Federer, pregnant Naomi Osaka and injured world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz, veteran Venus Williams and Australian Ajla Tomljanović. That was highlighted on Monday night, when its Australian Open coverage recorded an average metropolitan audience of 357,000 – a 44% slide on the Barty-headlining opening night of 2022 (635,000). Less people watched Polish first seed Iga Swiatek defeat German Jule Niemeier and Daniil Medvedev see off Marcos Giron than Home and Away, with the long-running soap bringing in 463,000 and another Network Seven show, The Chase Australia, tallying 477,000. The cricket was another diverting presence, with the Big Bash League bringing 267,000 to Seven for Brisbane Heat’s win over the Melbourne Stars and Fox bumping that number up further. On Tuesday night an average of 462,000 viewers watched the evening session of the tennis, placing second for the day behind only news programs as nine-time champion Novak Djokovic made his much-anticipated return to Melbourne Park and Andy Murray dug deep to oust Matteo Berrettini. Nine will be watching the numbers closely over the next fortnight, having signed a new broadcast deal in November worth a reported $500m following 2022’s ratings smash hit. Nine’s coverage of the Australian Open 2022 has reached a national audience of 12.5 million viewers (metro: 8.977 million/regional: 3.523 million) for its linear broadcast on Channel 9 and 9Gem. Last year’s final between the victorious Barty and Danielle Collins was the highest-rating Australian Open women’s final of all time, delivering a national average metro audience of 2.581 million viewers. The all-Australian men’s doubles final, when Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis beat Matt Ebden and Max Purcell, grabbed a national average metro audience of 1.7 million, making that the tournament’s most-watched men’s doubles match of all time.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/nine-network-feels-absence-of-stars-as-big-numbers-come-through-australian-open-gates;guardian;sports;2868
4691;4691;Low-alcohol drinks can also be high on flavour;2023-01-08T06:00:40Z;['David Williams'];['Wine', 'Food', 'Life and style'];;Zeno Alcohol Liberated Red (£10.49, zenowine.com) It might not be quite on a par with breakthroughs in nuclear fusion energy or the hunt for a cure for Alzheimer’s, but the wine business has been slowly inching closer to a goal that has long seemed tantalisingly out of reach: creating a non-alcoholic wine that people might choose to drink for pleasure rather than duty. The prize for any brands that might crack the code is a big one: a share of a no- and low-alcohol market that is expected to grow to around £450m in the UK by the end of this year. Certainly at this time of year, when so many wine drinkers are participating in one of the two big annual festivals of abstinence, Dry January (the other being Sober October), any product that can offer all the other uniquely winey things that their favourite drink offers apart from alcohol is worth its weight in gold. Most no-lo still wine brands miss that mark. Newcomer Zeno’s red, however, gets very close. Oddbird Domaine de la Prade Organic Alcohol-Free Red (£10, harveynichols.com) When I say “very close” what I mean is that Zeno’s red didn’t quite pass the blind taste test I asked my family to subject it to: in a lineup of “normal” red wines with alcohol between 13 and 14% it does still stand out as something “else”. It still doesn’t quite have the same palate weight and impact of its boozy peers. All the same, once I’d re-calibrated, I did find it a very enjoyable sip with food. Crucially, it’s dry, and it has tannins and spice and red fruit that add up to some complexity. Another red still no-lo wine that I think offers a similarly wine-like experience if not quite feeling like the real thing is Oddbird’s Domaine de la Prade, a blend of shiraz and merlot that has a real succulence to it, as well a touch of oak toastiness and some herb-and-pepper notes that are quintessential flavours of the Languedoc region where it is sourced. Belle & Co Sparkling Rosé (from £3.99, Morrisons, Budgens, Londis, Booths, Iceland, Ocado) When it comes to white non-alcoholic wines, I’m not sure anyone has bettered my two stand-by choices of the past few years: German winemaker Johannes Leitz’s convincingly racy, apple and lime-scented Leitz Eins Zwei Zero Alcohol-Free Riesling Alc Vol 0.0% (£6.99, Waitrose) and the gently floral muscat of Natureo White from Spanish winemaking giants Torres (from £6.00, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose). But the non-alcoholic wines that I’ve drunk most of in the past year are all sparkling, in part because bubbles are an easy way to add a bit of the mouthfilling texture missing due to the absence of alcohol. Among the best I’ve tried recently is another form the Oddbird range, the Oddbird Alcohol-Free Sparkling Rosé NV (£12.99 or £9.99 as part of a mixed case of 12 bottles, laithwaites.co.uk) with its candied redcurrants and creamy mousse. For value, I’d go for the refreshingly clean, fun, strawberry-juicy blend of unfermented grape must and tea that is Belle & Co Sparkling Rosé.

1941;1941;Georgia Maq: All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem is the most perfect song of all time;2023-01-22T14:00:37Z;['N/A'];['Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Australian music', 'LCD Soundsystem', 'Culture'];;"To me, a perfect song isn’t something that can be quantified by the amount of choruses, verses, lyrics or minutes, but by how it changes you. How it lifts you up off your bedroom floor or out of your car seat and takes you to somewhere you never knew possible. To me, the perfect song is All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem. It was one of my best friends in Melbourne who introduced me to it. My phone lit up with a link to a song and a message from her that said “listen to this”. It was the beginning of August 2022, a week-long heatwave had just hit Los Angeles and I was in the centre of it. I’d just spent a month on tour with Camp Cope in North America and was missing my friends back home. I connected my phone to the car’s audio system, pressed play and suddenly, I was being held by the arms of love once again.
At almost eight minutes long, All My Friends starts with one minute and 20 seconds of repetition – the one chord progression (simply A and E) that continues through the entire piece, while drums and synths slowly build around the central pulsing progression. A song that repeats the same two chords over and over would usually bore me, but what keeps me on my feet is the changing synth parts and the subtle growth of the lyrics, sung with the beautiful timbre of James Murphy.
I spent the next month driving around Los Angeles listening to All My Friends in my rental car with the windows down, letting the sun and music warm the places in me I’d believed to be long frozen over. Seeing the Hollywood sign in the distance, getting stuck in traffic on the freeway, weaving my way through the hills of Laurel Canyon, speeding out to Pasadena, coming home at three in the morning from a lover’s house in Studio City. This music accompanied me to places I never thought I would go – the driving force of the song felt like a companion. Often in life, I feel as though I am wandering alone – but not with All My Friends by my side.
The first five times I listened to the song I thought James was writing about being drunk at a party and stumbling around the streets of Brooklyn until dawn, contemplating his youth and current position in life. But after five more listens it felt as though the song was about group therapy. The joint act of simply sitting around in a circle talking through the difficult aspects of life and slowly figuring it out together. I believe songs exist to be interpreted by the listener, and this song came to me when I needed it most, when I was alone in a foreign place trying to figure out what I was doing with my life, wondering who my friends were and where they might be. By chance, LCD Soundsystem were headlining the This Ain’t No Picnic festival at the end of my month in Los Angeles. I stood at the back of the crowd and danced, uncontrollably, by myself, until I was clean of self-effacing thoughts, clean of any regrets or pain, clean of any comparisons that rid me of my happiness. I couldn’t stop moving. I felt as though I’d spent my entire life living under a storm cloud in the freezing darkness and All My Friends cleared the sky until it was just me, standing in the warmth of the sun, basking in its rays for those eight minutes, swallowed by the sound.

3475;3475;UK set to brand Iran’s revolutionary guards as terrorists after Akbari execution;2023-01-14T19:00:19Z;['Patrick Wintour'];['Foreign policy', 'UK news', 'Iran', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Nuclear weapons', 'Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office', 'Politics'];;"The UK and the European Union are expected to coordinate moves to brand the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation after the execution of Alireza Akbari, a British-Iranian dual national who was lured back to Iran by the security services three years ago. Akbari, who had been a senior defence figure in reformist governments nearly two decades ago, was hanged for being a spy for MI6, a charge his family deny. A friend of the family said “this is a murder case”, and vowed to prove the innocence of the 61-year-old, including allegations that he had been paid by British intelligence. Akbari leaves behind two daughters and a wife who lives in the UK. They had been given reason to hope for a last-minute reprieve, but his wife read of his execution on the Iranian state judicial news agency before dawn on Saturday morning. In the first of what is likely to be a series of steps, the British government imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on the Iranian prosecutor general, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, described by the Foreign Office as “one of the most powerful figures in Iran’s judicial system”. The UK also summoned the Iranian chargé d’affaires while the British ambassador to Tehran, Stephen Shercliff, was in turn summoned by the Iranian foreign ministry for what was said to be an outrageous interference in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic. Shercliff was told “the decisive action to protect the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not depend on the consent of other governments, including England”. The Iranians claim Akbari was recruited by a previous British ambassador. The British calculation now will be whether to take further steps that risk the door being closed indefinitely on further talks over the stalled nuclear deal, or whether the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation in the Middle East is regarded as too great to antagonise the regime. Nuclear talks have been on hold for months with UN weapons inspectors denied access to Iran’s key sites. Without formally breaking off the talks, Western powers have said that while the repression of Iranian street protests continues, the nuclear deal is no longer their focus. Iran is thought to have enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear bomb, but cannot yet weaponise the material. A formal decision to proscribe the IRGC both in the UK and the EU is bound to lead to Iranian retaliation. The UK’s security minister, Tom Tugendhat, suggested the move was justifiable: “The state’s murder of another citizen shows the cruelty of the Iranian regime. The Iranian regime threatens other British citizens even in the UK, as MI5 head reported recently. We will defend our security.”
The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, in a note last week warned that “proscribing a State entity under the Terrorism Act 2000 would depart from consistent and decades-long UK policy, and calls into question the definition of terrorism which, to date, has proven practical and effective”. He said the enduring policy of the government has been to treat terrorism by states as falling outside the Terrorism Act 2000, pointing out the Salisbury poisoning by Russian agents was treated as hostile state activity, not terrorism. But he added this appeared to be a policy position rather than a legal view on the interpretation of the Act, so giving UK ministers some flexibility to proscribe the IRGC if they wanted. In November, the MI5 director general, Ken McCallum, described the Islamic Republic as a “mounting concern. Iran projects threats to the UK directly, through its aggressive intelligence services. At its sharpest this includes ambitions to kidnap or even kill British or UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime”. He went on to say that UK authorities have discovered at least 10 “potential threats” to “kidnap or even kill British or UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime.” Akbari’s friends say he was the victim of a power struggle at the top of the regime, including efforts by some officials to oust the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkani. Akbari had been a key ally of Shamkani until 2005 when he left government. Responding to the execution, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “I am appalled by the execution of British-Iranian citizen Alireza Akbari in Iran. This was a callous and cowardly act, carried out by a barbaric regime with no respect for the human rights of their own people.” The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, added: “This barbaric act deserves condemnation in the strongest possible terms. This will not stand unchallenged.” Both the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, issued statements of solidarity with the UK. Baerbock said: “The execution of Alireza Akbari is another inhumane act by the Iranian regime. We stand with our British friends and will continue to closely coordinate our action against the regime and our support for Iran’s people.” Colonna said: “Iran’s repeated violations of international law cannot go unanswered, especially when it comes to the treatment of the foreign nationals the country arbitrarily detains. France reiterates its steadfast opposition to the death penalty everywhere and in all circumstances, and condemns its political use in Iran.” It is expected the EU will impose sanctions on as many as 20 Iranian officials including the minister of sport, but Baerbock – under domestic pressure over the issue from the Christian Democrats – has also said the EU is looking at putting the IRGC on the terror list. EU lawyers are examining the evidential thresholds that have to be met to brand the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. The IRGC is already sanctioned in the UK, but some of those sanctions are due to be lifted this autumn as part of the nuclear deal.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/uk-brand-iran-revolutionary-guards-as-terrorists-akbari-execution;guardian;politics;3475

Lai, a dual Hong Kong and British citizen, is awaiting trial on national security charges in one of the most high-profile cases brought by Hong Kong authorities against the pro-democracy movement. If convicted he could face life in prison. Lai’s international legal team has written to Rishi Sunak requesting an urgent meeting about “potential ways to secure Mr Lai’s release”. According to extracts of the letter provided to the Guardian, the legal team described Lai’s prosecution as “a deeply concerning, emblematic case, with profound ramifications for Mr Lai”. It said Lai had become a “thorn in Beijing’s side” and he was being targeted by authorities over his work in journalism and advocacy in support of “the rule of law, the free market, free press, property rights and an open society”.
The charges were brought under the national security law imposed in Hong Kong in 2020, which outlaws a broad swathe of behaviour as either collusion with foreign forces – the charge Lai faces – or secession, subversion or terrorism. Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai’s international legal team, told the Guardian that Lai was a UK national “imprisoned in Hong Kong for speaking truth to power”. “He is being subjected to ‘lawfare’ – multiple prosecutions and lawsuits, all designed to silence and discredit him and send a clear message to others that they should not dare to criticise the Chinese or Hong Kong authorities,” Gallagher said. “We ask the prime minister and foreign secretary to treat this concerning case with the utmost urgency, and take immediate steps to protect Mr Lai, a British citizen.” The international legal team said it had made two requests to meet UK foreign ministers in the past, which were either denied or unanswered. It said the UK government had earlier this month agreed to a meeting with a Foreign Office minister. The Foreign Office has been contacted for comment. The 74-year-old has been in jail for more than two years, initially on remand and then serving successive terms for offences related to the 2019 protests and business fraud, all charges his supporters say are politically motivated. The Apple Daily newspaper Lai founded was also raided, his businesses were shut down, and his colleagues arrested. Just days after his 2020 arrest on allegations of foreign collusion, Lai told the Guardian that Beijing wanted to make “Hong Kong people subservient”. Lai’s national security trial was supposed to begin last year but was delayed in December, after government attempts to bar UK lawyer, Tim Owen, from representing him. It is now scheduled for September. Shortly before his December court appearance he was sentenced to a further five years and nine months for fraud, related to a contractual dispute. Supporters have suggested the conviction – over one of his companies violating terms of a lease – was politically motivated. The judge, Stanley Chan, denied the accusation. Lai’s son Sebastian Lai said the UK government had a duty to protect its citizens. “My dad is a British citizen who has done nothing wrong,” he said in a statement. “I call on the British government to take urgent action to protect my dad immediately and secure his freedom. The UK must do all it can to stop this, and do it now.” The UK government has repeatedly criticised the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities’ crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, including the prosecution of Lai. The US government has condemned Lai’s conviction for fraud, but the letter from his legal team reportedly noted that the UK had made no formal statement. Sunak’s official spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have been clear that the Hong Kong authorities must end their targeting of pro-democracy voices, including Jimmy Lai. The British government will always support rights and freedoms and the rule of law, because it’s the right and moral thing to do. The Foreign Office has provided support to Jimmy Lai for some time, and the minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has met his legal team today.” In December 2020, the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the national security law breached the internationally binding joint declaration governing the return of Hong Kong from the UK to China, and was being used against Lai. “This highlights the authorities’ continued attacks on the rights and freedoms of its people,” Raab said. “We have raised this case with the authorities in Hong Kong and call on them to end their targeting of Lai and other pro-democracy voices.” The law has been used against dozens of pro-democracy activists and supporters, with almost all high-profile figures either in jail or exiled overseas.

8986;8986;Five swans killed after flying into Hinkley power lines;Wednesday 1 February 2023 18:08, UK;[];['somerset'];['flying', 'lines', 'sky', 'grid', 'national', 'hinkley', 'wildlife', 'told', 'power', 'swans', 'killed', 'urgency'];"A wildlife charity has called for action from the National Grid after five swans were ""literally blown apart"" after flying into new Hinkley Point C power lines in Somerset.

Pauline Kidner, who is the founder of Secret World Wildlife Rescue, told Sky News that a member of her team went to the scene near Burnham-On-Sea on Monday to find the swans dead on the ground beneath the pylons.

One swan was found still alive and, after assessment by the charity, was later released.

Pictures from the site showed one of the swan's heads had been separated from its body after it struck the power lines.

National Grid has told Sky News it is ""investigating as a matter of urgency"" and has experts assessing the site.

Ms Kidner said the power lines started to be replaced by National Grid last year - but birds are struggling to see them because ""there is nothing on these new ones"" to make them stand out.

She said: ""We want the National Grid to realise the urgency over this because of the amount of swans in the area. Something needs to be done.

""This is a wetland and it is a good area for swans.

""The power lines started to be replaced last year from Hinkley through to Loxton. Usually, National Grid will put things on the lines so birds can see them, but there is nothing on these new ones.

""When the swans collide with the line, it is an instantaneous death because of the power surge. They were literally blown apart.

""One swan found by the dead bodies was assessed and found to be uninjured. We believe it stayed because its mate was probably one of the dead ones.

""This one was released near a group of young and unpaired swans which winter on the moors.

""Even when this one was being released, three other swans flew over the lines demonstrating this is a flight path, but fortunately avoided them.

""With so many swans already lost through Avian flu, this is an added danger to them. So sad.""

The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he “couldn’t think of anything that would be more distressing for victim-survivors than that”. There was much anguish and torment in Pell’s home town of Ballarat where a mass was held at the local Catholic cathedral urging forgiveness. Ballarat was not only the birthplace of Pell, but the scene where up to 14 priests are alleged to have sexually abused children and as many as 50 suicides are said to have been linked to the abuse. “Forgiveness? Yeah, I get that, totally. But not when someone is refusing to apologise or show any reason for them to be forgiven,” said one survivor of child sexual abuse who attended today’s mass. Top news
Dominic Perrottet’s Nazi outfit | The NSW premier apologised for wearing a Nazi uniform to his 21st birthday, describing it as a “terrible mistake”. The revelations could jeopardise Perrottet’s election chances in March, with the Coalition seeking a fourth term in office. The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies said in a statement that dressing as a Nazi was “not a joke” and “disrespects the millions of innocent civilians who were murdered during WWII”.

6187;6187;Rise in number of children needing help for serious mental health problems, NHS data shows;Tuesday 3 January 2023 06:32, UK;[];['mental health', 'nhs'];['mental', 'eating', 'nhs', 'data', 'problems', 'children', 'disorders', 'hospital', 'shows', 'help', 'needing', 'services', 'admissions', 'young', 'number', 'health', 'rise', 'serious'];"There has been a huge increase in the number of children requiring treatment for serious mental health problems including eating disorders, figures show.

NHS data reveals a 39% rise in a year in referrals for NHS mental health treatment for under-18s to more than a million (1,169,515) in 2021/22.

By comparison, the figure was 839,570 in 2020/21, and in 2019/20 there were 850,741 referrals.

The England-wide data includes children who are suicidal, self-harming, suffering serious depression or anxiety, and have eating disorders.

Separately, NHS Digital data also shows hospital admissions for eating disorders are rising among children and young people.

There were 7,719 admissions in 2021/22 among under-18s, up from 6,079 the previous year and 4,232 in 2019/20 - which is an 82% rise across two years.

The most recent data available, from April to October 2022, reveals there were 3,456 admissions, up 38% from 2,508 for the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.

There were also 3,011 admissions from April to October 2020, as well as 4,600 for the same period in 2021 when the full effects of the pandemic were felt.

And the data suggests 2022/23 could see the highest number of hospital admissions for eating disorders, for people of all ages.

From April to October 2022, there were 15,083 admissions, compared with 28,436 for the whole of the previous year (2021/22).

There were 23,351 admissions a year earlier, and in 2019/20 there were 20,650, marking a 38% rise between 2019/20 and 2021/22.

Anorexia is the most prevalent eating disorder which is leading to hospital admissions among all ages, with 10,808 admissions in 2021/22.

The data also shows that bulimia is the next most common, with 5,563, while other eating disorders accounted for 12,893 admissions.

Dr Elaine Lockhart, chairwoman of the child and adolescent psychiatry faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the surge of referrals for children and young people reflects a ""whole range"" of illnesses.

She said specialist services are needed to respond to the ""most urgent and the most unwell"", including youngsters who have psychosis, suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety disorder.

Dr Lockhart said more staff were needed and that targets for seeing children urgently with eating disorders were sliding ""completely"".

""I think what's frustrating for us is if we could see them more quickly and intervene, then the difficulties might not become as severe as they do because they've had to wait,"" she added.

An NSPCC spokesperson said: ""These alarming figures are sadly reflected in the conversations we are having through Childline. The service delivers tens of thousands of counselling sessions every year to children and young people who are self-harming, suffering depression or anxiety, experiencing suicidal thoughts and have eating disorders.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Improving eating disorders services is a key priority and we're investing £53m per year in children and young people's community eating disorder services to increase capacity in 70 community teams across the country.

""We are already investing £2.3bn a year into mental health services, meaning an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access support by 2024 - and we're aiming to grow the mental health workforce by 27,000 more staff by this time too.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103073218/http://news.sky.com/story/rise-in-number-of-children-needing-help-for-serious-mental-health-problems-nhs-data-shows-12778589;skynews;health;278
275;275;After the fall of Nadhim Zahawi, many taxing questions remain | Letters;2023-01-30T17:53:16Z;['N/A'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'Tax and spending', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak', 'HMRC', 'UK news', 'Tax'];;Now that Nadhim Zahawi has been sacked, having been found to be in serious breach of the ministerial code (Nadhim Zahawi sacked as Tory party chair over tax affairs, 29 January), surely the big question to ask is: how much UK tax has he avoided, albeit legally, by investing his wealth in overseas tax havens? And how many other MPs and government ministers also avoid UK tax by this method of investment? The ministerial code needs to be updated to question if it is morally acceptable for ministers to legally avoid tax while they are responsible for raising taxes from the rest of us, who are not rich enough to use this loophole. Rob Tidbury Paulton, Somerset • I suppose we should not be surprised that Nadhim Zahawi’s resignation letter to the prime minister contains not a hint of apology, let alone any recognition that he had done something wrong. But then, in his letter to Zahawi, the prime minister could not bring himself to ascribe to Zahawi, in terms, the serious breach of the ministerial code unearthed by the ethics adviser. It was just “there has been a serious breach”. Never apologise, never explain. Remind me, who said that? Valerie Bayliss Sheffield • Nadhim Zahawi writes to the prime minister about his fleeing to Great Britain as a child: “I believe that in no other country on earth would my story be possible.” Fortunately for him, neither Suella Braverman nor Priti Patel were home secretary at the time. Henry Spyvee Guildford, Surrey • The inequalities and solutions raised by Polly Toynbee need to be brought to the attention of the wider public (Zahawi, Sunak, Johnson: this is rule by plutocrat. It’s like a stench that’s worse each day, 23 January). I suggest a campaign touring the country with a big red bus plastered with this slogan: “We give £350m a week to the richest people in this country. Why not spend it on the NHS instead?” Terry Fletcher Cramlington, Northumberland • Nadhim Zahawi would have done well to emulate the actions of one of his predecessors as MP for Stratford-on-Avon, John Profumo, who promptly resigned when his affair with Christine Keeler became public. Profumo redeemed his reputation by devoting the rest of his life to charitable causes. Any chance that Zahawi will do the same? Catherine Dyer Salisbury • May I congratulate Maggie Lyons (Letters, 27 January) on the outcome of her recent bet about Nadhim Zahawi. Could she be persuaded, perhaps, to make another 50p bet with her husband that Dominic Raab will be gone by the end of this week? Simon Crombie Wokingham, Berkshire • No one should criticise Nadhim Zahawi for his careless error unless they can say, hand on heart, that they have never forgotten to pay £3m of tax that they owe. Mike Cashman Milton Keynes • So Nadhim Zahawi finds himself out in the cold on the backbenches. Not to worry, he can always warm up in his horses’ stables. Ruth Coomber Needham Market, Suffolk • It is rare for a Tory minister to wear a beard, so among other things Nadhim Zahawi has now managed to bring the hirsute into disrepute.

1568;1568;Agile aubergine! 10 easy, delicious vegan recipes to make in a hurry at home;2023-01-24T12:00:00Z;['Stuart Heritage'];['Food', 'Vegan food and drink', 'Veganism', 'Life and style', 'Potatoes'];;"Smokey aubergine with chilli jam Esra Muslu, chef founder of Zahter, London Aubergine is often found on Turkish tables. It’s such a beautiful vegetable, and I like cooking it right over an open flame, which adds a nice smokiness, and serving with chilli jam and crisp, fried garlic. Make sure all sides of the aubergine are cooked over the flame, then peel the skin. I make a chilli jam by mixing 250g sugar with 250g water until dissolved, then stirring in chopped chilli and lime juice to taste, and heating until thickened. Thinly slice 50g garlic and fry in oil. Place the aubergine on the plate and roughly chop. Sprinkle some salt and za’atar, and garnish with parsley, four or five fried garlic slices, the chilli jam and a drizzle of pomegranate molasses. Baked celeriac Neil Campbell, head chef at Rovi, London I love celeriac – so many things can be done with it and none of them need to be fancy. Bake them like you would a baked potato, rubbed in olive oil and salt (they’re lower in calories and higher in vitamins than spuds) until they’re caramelised on the outside and soft and fluffy within, then load up however you would like. Confit garlic, mushrooms and herbs is a winner, or I love using a homemade zhoug. Make this by blending parsley, coriander, green chilli, garlic and lemon juice with olive oil, then drizzle all over. Some chopped nuts work nicely with this, too. Teriyaki maitake mushroom donburi Luke French, chef director at Jöro, Sheffield A hero vegan ingredient for me is maitake mushrooms, which have an insane flavour. You can sometimes find them in supermarket packets of mixed wild mushrooms. One of my favourite comfort dishes is a teriyaki maitake mushroom donburi (mushroom rice bowl) – I promise you it is one of the tastiest vegan rice bowls you’ll ever have eaten. Make a simple teriyaki by reducing 200g mirin with 300g light soy sauce by half, then stir in a sachet of miso soup paste and reserve. Next, brine the mushrooms by dissolving 10g salt and 20g caster sugar with 200g cold water, then submerge the mushrooms in it for 20 minutes. After brining, pat dry on kitchen paper, then cook on a hot barbecue grill (or fry in smoked olive oil) until charred and crispy around the outside. Glaze the mushrooms in the teriyaki dressing and serve on freshly cooked sushi rice/short grain rice, seasoned with a little rice vinegar/mirin/sugar/salt. Top with freshly chopped chives and crispy fried onions, and drizzle with more teriyaki dressing.
Gnocchi with cavolo nero and walnuts Giovann Attard, executive head chef at Norma, London I make a good gnocchi with cavolo nero and walnuts. Put 550g mashed potato in a bowl with 5g salt, 20ml olive oil and 300g 00 flour, and mix until it has formed a ball, making sure that it isn’t too wet and sticky. Taking a small piece at a time, form into a long roll around 2cm thick, then cut the roll into 2.5cm pieces. Place the gnocchi pieces on a floured tray, then cook by boiling in a large pan of boiling salted water until they float to the top. These are perfect with a cavolo nero pesto, made by placing 45g chopped and blanched cavolo nero in a blender with 100g walnuts, 5 tbsp olive oil, a bunch of basil leaves, two garlic cloves, 50g pine nuts, 10g vegan parmesan and ½ tsp each of salt and pepper. Blend until smooth. If the blender is struggling, add a bit of hot water from the gnocchi pan.
Dal Aktar Islam, chef at Opheem, Birmingham My go-to vegan dish is dal. I love it because it goes with everything; I usually have mine with bread or rice, with some pickles on the side. Heat a little oil in a pan over a moderate heat, add 1 tsp mustard seeds, ½ tsp cumin seeds, 2.5cm of chopped ginger, ½ tbsp chopped garlic and 20 curry leaves, then sauté for 30 seconds. Add a chopped onion and a chopped green chilli, and sauté until translucent, before adding 1 tsp red chilli powder, ¼ tsp turmeric powder and ½ tsp salt, then sauté for two or three minutes. Add 250g red lentils and 100g moong dal (make sure both have been washed and soaked) and enough boiling water to cover the lentils with 2cm extra, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes. While it’s cooking, prepare the temper by caramelising a finely sliced shallot and setting it aside. Using the same pan and remaining oil, add three finely chopped garlic cloves and cook until lightly brown, then add two whole dry Kashmiri red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, ½ tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder and mix well, then pour over your prepared lentils. Mixed greens bruschetta Conor Gadd, chef owner of Trullo, London My wife and I often cook vegan meals at home and, when we do, it is much more about celebrating vegetables than it is trying to do a vegan version of a meat dish. For a simple supper, I make a bruschetta of mixed greens using cavolo, kale, cime di rapa – things like that. After taking them off the stalk, I chop the greens roughly and blanch them for two to three minutes. While they’re blanching, I sweat garlic and chilli in a pan (twice as much as you think you’ll need), then add the greens and cook for a few minutes. Season with salt and a squeeze of lemon, and drench in new season Tuscan olive oil, then simply eat with some grilled bread. Masala poori Sameer Taneja, executive chef at Benares, London One of my favourite vegan dishes to make is masala poori – which are Indian crispy, spiced flatbreads. They are spiced with turmeric, coriander, fenugreek and chilli powder, and are delicious on their own or dipped into curries and sauces (my favourite is with a black chickpea curry). To create the masala poori, I prepare a flour and semolina dough (250g whole wheat flour, 25g semolina, 100ml water, 10g sunflower oil) and mix well with spices, resting for 30 minutes before kneading and rolling into small flat discs. You then deep-fry until golden on each side (30 seconds or so) and nudge the discs around the pan, which encourages them to puff up, creating delicious crispy flatbreads. Simple but so tasty. Caramelised onion yeast sauce Jan Ostle, head chef at Wilsons, Bristol At the restaurant we always have a vegan menu running alongside our regular menu, and often dishes from the vegan menu are so delicious that they move across. This caramelised onion yeast sauce is one of those that can be used for any hearty, savoury dish. Lightly caramelise six shallots and a clove of garlic. Roast 200g baker’s yeast at 160C until crispy. Add the two together, cover with water and simmer. Blend and pass through a sieve, then add a dash of sherry vinegar if it needs some acidity. It’s great with roasted root vegetables.
Gaji namul Judy Joo, founder of Seoul Bird, London I love the silkiness of aubergines, and I have many memories of eating gaji namul, a colourful aubergine-based side dish. My mum would sauté the aubergine very carefully with chopsticks, so as not to bruise or discolour it. Asian aubergines work best for this recipe as their skins are thinner and they are much sweeter in taste. Cut three Asian aubergines into finger-sized batons and toss in ½ tbsp salt. Place in a single layer in a colander over a plate or in a sink and allow the excess water to drain off for 25–30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce by whisking together two chopped garlic chives, 1 tbsp grated garlic, a thinly sliced spring onion, 1 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes), 2 tsp roasted and crushed sesame seeds, ½ tbsp white sugar, 2 tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp roasted sesame oil. Set aside. Sauté the aubergines in oil for 2-3 minutes, then remove from heat, coat with sauce, season with salt and eat.
Mushroom ‘ragu’ on toast Sofian Msetfi, executive chef at Ormer Mayfair, London My go-to comfort dish in January is a vegan mushroom “ragu” on toast. It’s simple to make and perfect as a nourishing lunch or light supper. Grill a couple of slices of sourdough until golden brown, then drizzle with olive oil. Fry a roughly chopped banana shallot and a finely sliced garlic clove with some salt. After 2-3 minutes, add 300g chopped wild or button mushrooms with ½ tsp chopped thyme. Once cooked, add 40ml rice milk, 20ml balsamic vinegar and a squeeze of lime juice. Reduce until thick and the mushrooms are coated in the sauce. Spoon the ragu on top of the toasted sourdough and finish with 50g roughly chopped pistachios, the zest of one lime and a handful of watercress for garnish.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/24/agile-aubergine-10-easy-delicious-vegan-plant-based-meals-to-make-in-a-hurry-at-home;guardian;entertainment & culture;1568
8912;8912;Remains found in house confirmed to be missing teenager Leah Croucher's;Friday 21 October 2022 16:22, UK;[];['buckinghamshire', 'crime'];['week', 'house', 'crouchers', 'milton', 'ms', 'property', 'teenager', 'leah', 'confirmed', 'missing', 'murder', 'remains'];"Remains found in the loft space of a house have been formally identified as those of missing teenager Leah Croucher.

The 19-year-old disappeared on her way to work at a finance company in Milton Keynes on 15 February 2019.

A murder investigation was launched last week after the discovery of the remains in a house in the city in Buckinghamshire.

A post mortem examination last week did not uncover her cause of death and investigations are continuing, police said.

Items belonging to Ms Croucher were also found in the property in Loxbeare Drive, Furzton, which is a few minutes away from her home.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Kevin Brown, head of the major crime unit at Thames Valley Police, said: ""After a difficult process, we are now in a position to formally confirm that the body found in Loxbeare Drive last week is that of Leah.""

""The grief and shock of Leah's family and friends is unimaginable, and they have shown enormous courage, patience and dignity over the last three years and eight months while our search for Leah continued.""

Last week Ms Croucher's parents, Claire and John, laid flowers at the property where her remains were found.

They said they would ""cherish her memories forever"", writing in a message: ""Our darkest fears have come true, we only need to be apart a little longer. We have so missed you for so long already.

""The future looks so bleak now we know we will never see your smile or hear your laughter again. We will cherish your memories forever. We love you. Mum and Dad xx xx"".

Her grandparents also left roses near the house, along with a handwritten note saying: ""Our darling, we will never stop seeking answers. Will love and miss you always.""

Missed opportunities to arrest prime suspect

Convicted sex offender Neil Maxwell was named by police this month as the prime suspect in the murder inquiry.

He was found dead on 20 April 2019 after taking his own life.

Police started searching the property on 10 October this year after receiving a tip-off from a member of the public.

Officers had visited the house on two earlier occasions but insisted this was the first time Ms Croucher's disappearance was linked to the address - despite conducting about 4,000 house-to-house calls.

They changed their investigation from a missing person's probe to a murder inquiry after discovering the remains.

It has since emerged Maxwell was the only person with keys to the house, which was unoccupied when police were conducting their inquiries.

He was wanted in connection with a sexual assault and used false names and changed his mobile phone and vehicles to avoid police.

The force made a total of 18 attempts to arrest Maxwell - initially at an address in Milton Keynes on 30 November 2018.

Police said if he was alive today, they would be seeking to arrest him.

Mr Brown added: ""Our investigations into Leah's murder will leave no stone unturned and we owe it to Leah's family to ensure we find the truth.""

7770;7770;Four Met Police officers investigated over arrest of girl, 15, who was strip-searched;Thursday 19 January 2023 18:11, UK;[];['metropolitan police'];['officers', 'met', 'misconduct', 'child', 'sky', 'q', 'investigation', 'notices', 'stripsearched', 'served', 'arrest', 'investigated', 'metropolitan', '15', 'girl'];"Four Metropolitan Police officers are under investigation over the arrest and detention of a 15-year-old girl who was later strip-searched.

A police sergeant and three constables have been served misconduct notices by police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

The girl was detained at Walworth Police Station in Kennington, south London, on 11 December 2020.

The incident happened shortly after another 15-year-old, a black girl identified only as Child Q, was strip-searched at a school in east London.

Child Q was searched by two female officers without any other adults present and with the knowledge she was on her period.

Four Metropolitan Police constables were served gross misconduct notices in relation to the incident, which prompted outrage among the public and politicians.

The investigation into their conduct is ongoing, the IOPC told Sky News on Thursday.

The mother of the girl detained in December 2020 came forward after publicity about Child Q.

The IOPC launched an investigation after the complaint was received in May 2022.

In a statement seen by Sky News, the watchdog said of the incident: ""We can confirm that four Metropolitan Police Service officers have been served misconduct notices as part of our ongoing investigation.

""A police sergeant and three police constables have been served notices in relation to the arrest and detention of the child, who was strip searched by MPS officers.

""Our investigation began following a referral in May 2022.

""The serving of misconduct notices does not necessarily mean disciplinary proceedings will follow.

""Due to the sensitivities surrounding this matter, we cannot provide any further information at this time.""

Scotland Yard told Sky News the officers remain in post and have not been placed on restricted duties or suspended.

570;570;"The week in theatre: Othello; The Unfriend; On the Ropes – review";2023-01-29T10:30:46Z;['Susannah Clapp'];['Theatre', 'Othello', 'Lyric Hammersmith', 'Steven Moffat', 'Reece Shearsmith', 'Amanda Abbington', 'Culture', 'Stage', 'Frances Barber', 'Windrush scandal'];;"Frantic Assembly’s roughed-up, seized-by-the-scruff-of-its-neck version of Othello keeps shining new lights on Shakespeare’s play. When I first saw Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett’s adaptation 14 years ago, the switch of setting – to a pool bar in the 21st century – was invigorating, but the main excitement was the way the stage seemed to be expanding its vocabulary. Shakespeare’s words were there all right, but their meaning was danced as well as spoken. In Graham’s new production, which is concluding a nationwide tour with a London run, the velocity and agility of movement is still breathtaking. Characters seem to lean on the air or be pushed by it; the atmosphere might be another cast member. The dynamics of the plot are evident before anyone speaks: Iago scissors himself between Othello and Desdemona; male bodies arch back and forward, as if tugged by gusts of violence; Desdemona and Emilia swivel towards each other for a chat, their limbs making a protective chamber as they bend together. Still, this time the revelation is different. What struck me most forcibly now is the way Othello’s violence can be seen growing from the entrenched habits of fighting that surround him. With the sheer outnumbering of women by men more evident than ever, the play becomes without strain a tragedy in which males are automatically pitted against females. Michael Akinsulire’s Othello may be cranked up by Joe Layton’s muscular, slippery Iago but he goes on to kill because bludgeoning comes so naturally, is so all-pervasive.
The evening opens to the sound of drums and the sight of flying fists and hurtling limbs – with pool cues slid around suggestively. No wonder it should end in a clamour of violence. Akinsulire’s delivery is staccato, as if each phrase were a stab. Beside him, Chanel Waddock’s Desdemona (big hoops and Lycra) is fresh, unposh, relaxed. The key to their relationship is Emilia’s late plea for women to behave with the same liberty as men. It is a mighty speech from one of Shakespeare’s most vivid characters, but it isn’t always given due weight. Finely framed by this production, Kirsty Stuart makes it the verbal high point of the evening. The Unfriend transfers to the West End after success at Chichester. Sherlocked-up – directed by Mark Gatiss, written by Steven Moffat and with Amanda Abbington among the cast – it is at the other end of the comedy-thriller spectrum from the now long-running 2:22 A Ghost Story: humorous, with a few chiller touches. A couple find themselves hosting a holiday acquaintance whom they believe to be a serial killer. Preposterousness is scattered with perspicacity: the couple’s reactions are, well, strangled by politeness. The murderess turns out to have a liberating, beneficial effect on the hitherto sullen family.
Robert Jones’s design of suburban interior and roofscape wink at sitcom; clever Michael Simkins blends seamlessly into this as the flatpack neighbour so dull no one can remember his name. Plot and performances flirt with farce. Frances Barber, both luscious and frightening, has a smile so wide she looks capable of carrying out her threat to gobble every one up; praise is due to head of wardrobe, Amy Jeskins, who gives her an apricot velour tracksuit with, on the back, the glittering instruction to “Love Life”. Reece Shearsmith, hovering between the feeble and the sinister, provides a knockout poo episode: face slipping all over the place, loo brush held aloft in the sitting room, stumblingly putting far-from routine inquiries about faeces to a policeman. None of the teasing or nudging lands much of a point, and edginess quickly evaporates – though there is an impressive performance from Gabriel Howell as a teenager who moves from slump to sunshine. Yet at a matinee, an appreciative audience gave a glow of enjoyment to my experience: cosiness reigned; the theatre seemed to be an enormous communal sofa. Gathered around a boxing ring, the audience for On the Ropes watch Mensah Bediako slugging it out as Vernon Vanriel, in a play written by Vanriel himself with Dougie Blaxland. They are watching a Windrush battle, a fight between British authorities and people they treat as subjects – not citizens. Vanriel, who grew up in Tottenham, rose to fame as a flamboyant fighter (draped in the union jack), struggled with addiction and depression, and was, after an extended visit to Jamaica, barred by bureaucratic tangles from returning to the country where he had spent 43 years. He was finally rescued from 13 years of destitution when Amelia Gentleman wrote about his plight in the Guardian and MP David Lammy took up his case.
It is an important story and it exerts a grip; it deserves more incisive treatment. Anastasia Osei-Kuffour’s production is not tough enough with the episodic, all-inclusive script: it straggles. Still, the rhyming dialogue is often fleet-footed, and the music – from Jimmy Cliff to Nina Simone – wonderful. And no one could fault the shape-changing talent of Amber James as she shifts in turn from being pious mother to jobsworth official to sweet, hip-swinging sister. When she lets the music out of her throat you want her to sing the whole action. What a blues ballad that would be.

This week, Hannah Verdier chooses five of the best scandalous podcasts about the rich and famous, from a high society gossip show to a podcast breaking down Hollywood’s messiest break-ups The Just Enough Family Fashion designer Liz Lange grew up in a family with a helicopter, a house in the Hamptons and a ski lodge in Aspen. But despite the Steinbergs’ lavish lifestyle and penchant for being massive show-offs, the close family fell on hard times. Lange documents their rise and fall, from jaw-dropping displays of wealth to bankruptcy and the knock of the bailiffs at the door (you know you’re in trouble when you have to sell off more than 50 of your old masters). If you’re a fan of financial schadenfreude, it’s particularly satisfying. Even the Rich Gossip queens Brooke Siffrinn and Aricia Skidmore-Williams clearly love the questionable decisions rich people often make, and their podcast documents everything Getty, Versace and Hilton. Some people think it’s tasteless to rake over royal gossip, but fortunately the hosts say a healthy “Hell yeah” to the practice and delight in schooling listeners in Diana and Meghan’s lives. The rags-to-royalty stories give more fuel to the pair’s belief that the rich are “just like us”, with Charles and Diana’s horse riding, cheating and arguing offering a glorious source of scandal. Trashy Divorces Gawping at other people’s failed relationships may not be kind, but it can providehours of fun, as hosts Alicia and Stacie prove. The prolific podcasters (and married couple) prod not just celebrity divorces but breakups, too. Celebrities featured are of course rich enough to fill a good divorce lawyer’s bank account, but the hosts also show their human sides. Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton, Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, and Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are all featured with just the right amount of gossip, relish and laughter. Queen of the Con: The Irish Heiress When reality TV producer Johnathan Walton met fun-loving Mair Smyth she was just a glamorous heiress waiting for her inheritance. But the reality was much more scandalous. Would a grasping cousin really be able to relieve her of the promised cash? Why was she fired from multiple jobs? Walton lost thousands to his shape-shifting neighbour and as the red flags waved he began to investigate further, discovering she had impersonated Jennifer Aniston, posed as a psychic, and blackmailed married men. A juicy tale, though ultimately a sad one for everyone involved. American Scandal The case of Patty Hearst has been well documented over the years, thanks to its intoxicating ingredients, namely a rich heiress and a blundering revolutionary gang. Kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army at 19, the FBI struggled for leads in Hearst’s disappearance – until she was arrested for robbing a bank. Was she brainwashed or just doing what it took to survive? American Scandal examines the evidence in detail, with slightly theatrical dramatisations that put listeners at the heart of the action.

5530;5530;Australia could swing from three years of La Niña to hot and dry El Niño in 2023;2023-01-03T14:00:51Z;['Peter Hannam'];['Australia weather', 'El Niño southern oscillation', 'La Niña', 'Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'Australia news'];;"Australia could swing from three years of above-average rainfall to one of the hottest, driest El Niño periods on record, as models show an increasing likelihood the climate driver may form in the Pacific in 2023. The latest climate models used by the Bureau of Meteorology – which will update its forecasts on Wednesday – indicate sea-surface temperatures may exceed El Niño thresholds in the key region of the equatorial Pacific by June.
Scientists caution that models may be less accurate ahead of the “autumn predictability gap” in April – the time of year when the Pacific enters a reset mode, allowing small influences to have big effects. But they suggest that after three consecutive La Niña years, the ocean is primed for a switch. “The Pacific must be quite charged with heat ready to have an El Niño,” Cai Wenju, a senior CSIRO climate scientist, told Guardian Australia. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we had an El Niño by the end of the year.” Agus Santoso, a senior researcher at the University of New South Wales’s Climate Change Research Centre, agreed. “Definitely an El Niño is a prospect [for 2023]”, he said. “You could have a weak El Niño. A strong El Niño is a possibility but neutral conditions are also a possibility.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads People living on the east coast of Australia will be glad to see the end of the La Niña, which sees strong easterly winds cause the build-up of warm waters north and east of the country, supporting the formation of rain clouds and storms. Australia notched three straight years of above-average national rainfall to the end of 2022. Extensive flooding in some regions of NSW and South Australia remain ongoing, and Indonesia has also been affected by flooding. In an El Niño the trade winds stall or even reverse, increasing the risk of severe heatwaves, droughts and fires.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which uses different thresholds than the BoM to determine La Niña and El Niño events, last month rated odds of an El Niño forming by August-October as a two-in-three chance. The current La Niña had been of “moderate” strength compared with the 2010-11 event and “is on the way towards decay” by autumn, Santoso said. One factor in favour of an end to the string of La Niñas is that there are no recorded instances of four in a row, he said. While a La Niña event can be followed by an El Niño, the reverse combination is more common. Both Santoso and Cai caution that having conditions tilting towards an El Niño does not guarantee one will develop. They point to 2014, when models indicated an El Niño was very possible but one failed to develop. However, the following summer of 2015-16 produced one of the strongest El Niños on record. La Niña years tend to be relatively cool at a global scale – and particularly so in Australia – as the Pacific absorbs relatively more warmth from the atmosphere. Even so, 2022 was on track to be either the fifth or sixth hottest on record, the World Meteorological Organization has said.
Should an El Niño develop, 2023 could turn out to be one of the hottest years in history, building as it would on the background rise of greenhouse gases and global heating. “When the next El Niño comes, we are going to have much, much worse conditions in terms of heatwaves,” Cai said. A typical El Niño might add about 0.1C to global mean temperatures but he warned the next one might top that “because there’s so much heat in the equatorial Pacific”. The intensity and frequency of La Niña and El Niño were likely to increase in a hotter world, Santoso said. The processes that trigger such events were reinforced by the warming of the sea-surface temperatures, enhancing the coupling between atmosphere and ocean. “We don’t know whether [the next dry spell] is going to be a long one or not,” Santoso said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/australia-could-swing-from-three-years-of-la-nina-to-hot-and-dry-el-nino-in-2023;guardian;environment;5530

By James Sillars, business reporter

The governor of the Bank of England has told MPs there is still ""something of a hangover effect"" in the wake of the mini-budget market chaos last year but declared that the hit to mortgages was over.

Andrew Bailey used remarks to the Treasury committee to declare that market conditions had returned to normal after the economic competence of the-then Liz Truss government was called into question - sparking chaos in the bond markets and forcing up borrowing costs.

The damage caused by the so called growth plan, outlined by her short-lived chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last September, had now been largely eradicated, according to Mr Bailey.

34;34;NoViolet Bulawayo and Margo Jefferson join ‘exciting’ Rathbones Folio prize shortlist;2023-01-31T19:45:49Z;['Sarah Shaffi'];['Books', 'Culture', 'Publishing', 'Rathbones Folio prize', 'Awards and prizes', 'NoViolet Bulawayo', 'Margo Jefferson'];;"The shortlists for this year’s Rathbones Folio prize spans three continents and includes Booker prize-shortlisted Glory by NoViolet Bulawayo and Pulitzer prize-winning writer Margo Jefferson’s memoir Constructing a Nervous System. This is the first year in which the new format for the Rathbones Folio prize is running; a winner will be named in each of the three categories (fiction, nonfiction and poetry), with those winners then going on to compete for the overall prize. Category winners will receive £2,000 each, with the overall winner getting an additional £30,000. Since 2017 the prize has been open to nonfiction and poetry as well as fiction, but the introduction of category winners is new. Alongside Bulawayo’s Glory, a political satire which takes inspiration from George Orwell’s 1984 to comment on Zimbabwean politics, the fiction shortlist also contains Sheila Heti’s Pure Colour, Daisy Hildyard’s Emergency, Michelle de Kretser’s Scary Monsters and Elizabeth Strout’s Lucy by the Sea.
In the nonfiction category Will Ashon’s The Passengers, Amy Bloom’s In Love, Jonathan Freedland’s The Escape Artist and Darren McGarvey’s The Social Distance Between Us join Jefferson on the shortlist. The poetry category consists of Victoria Adukwei Bulley’s Quiet, Fiona Benson’s Ephemeron, Zaffar Kunial’s England’s Green and Yomi Sode’s Manorism, all of which made the TS Eliot prize longlist. The shortlist is completed by Safiya Kamaria Kinshasa’s Cane, Corn & Gully. Pure Colour is a study of grief, in which the protagonist spends part of the novel in a leaf. Reviewing the book in the Guardian, Anne Enright said it was “an original, a book that says something new for our difficult times”, adding: “It’s a bit mad, but I think you will like it.” Chair of judges Ali Smith described the Rathbones Folio as a prize “unlike any other in that the books in the running are specifically chosen from a long list nominated solely by writers.”
She and her fellow judges, Jackie Kay and Guy Gunaratne, are “hoping our shortlists will excite other readers and writers as much as they’ve excited us”. Hildyard’s Emergency is a coming-of-age story set in a village in northern England, and was described by Sarah Moss in the Guardian as succeeding because “of the chilly and beautifully sustained voice of its narrator, the precise embroidery of its sentences and paragraphs, its observations of the natural world and insistence that there is no distinction between humans and environments”. De Kretser’s Scary Monsters contains two first-person narratives, one set in 1981 and the other in a dystopian near-future; the order in which they are read is left to the reader. Lucy by the Sea is the follow-up to Strout’s 2022 Booker prize-shortlisted Oh William!, and is set during the pandemic. Alexandra Harris in the Guardian said Strout had “written another wondrously living book, as fine a pandemic novel as one could hope for”. Ashon’s The Passengers is a collection of stories told to him by 100 people across the UK he spoke to over the course of 18 months. Sukhdev Sandhu described it as “not just an oral history of the contemporary moment but, drenched in mood and texture, renders the country itself as a sonic collage” in the Guardian. In Love is Bloom’s memoir of her husband, Brian Ameche’s, decision to seek assisted suicide after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Freedland’s The Escape Artist tells the story of Rudolf Vrba, who managed to escape from Auschwitz in 1944, alongside fellow prisoner Alfred Wetzler. The book was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize and Waterstones Book of the Year. Adukwei Bulley is an alumna of the Barbican Young Poets and recipient of an Eric Gregory award, and Quiet is her debut collection. Benson’s Ephemeron is divided into four sections, and was described by Fiona Sampson in the Guardian as showing the poet’s“unusual range”. Kunial’s England’s Green is his second collection, and is a look at England through language and place. Manorism is Sode’s debut collection, and its title is a word invented by Sode; he told the Guardian that the “argument I’m making is that there’s an innate manorism that comes from where you grew up – your manor – and goes with you wherever you travel”. Safiya Kamaria Kinshasa’s Cane, Corn & Gully is published by small publisher Out-Spoken Press, founded by poet Anthony Anaxagorou. The collection, said the press, is a “genealogical and autobiographical collection which unites dance and poetry to observe, question and ruminate on what it means to adopt, perform, and pass down the notion of black West Indian femininity”. The winners of the category prizes and the overall prize will be announced on 27 March. Previous Folio prize winners include Colm Tóibín, Carmen Maria Machado, Raymond Antrobus, Hisham Matar and George Saunders.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/31/noviolet-bulawayo-and-margo-jefferson-join-exciting-rathbones-folio-prize-shortlist;guardian;entertainment & culture;34

She glared at me and my sisters, Janet and Susie. “I’m going to your nan’s, so don’t you dare turn that on without me. If you do, it will explode and kill you.” And they wonder why I became a dramatist. We waited all of two seconds after she’d gone, then ran to plug it in. And then it appeared. Crossroads. Miss Diane was arguing with husband Vince, the postman. I think he was drunk. Actually, I think she was an alcoholic and seeing in him everything that had gone wrong in her life, or something. But never mind that – they stood against a wall that was so yellow! It would be trite to say that image burned itself into my brain so deeply that my entire career has been chasing that moment. And yet here I am. Those were the days. When everyone watched the two great soaps, Crossroads and Coronation Street. In the 60s, that’s all we’d had, a street in Weatherfield and … a motel? The Crossroads Motel? Please don’t think motel was a buzzword. Even then, no one knew what it meant. It’s technically a hotel on a motorway, which was supposed to sound glamorous. But, with apologies to Birmingham, it was in Birmingham.
Coronation Street sprung fully formed from the mind of Tony Warren. Don’t let anyone tell you that television shows need time to bed in. His very first episode sizzles into life in scene one and is still buzzing with that same energy 62 years later. But Crossroads was more … assembled. A flatpack of stories. Created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, it was originally based round two sisters, Meg (Noele Gordon) and Kitty (Beryl Johnstone); one rich, one poor. To be fair, two feuding sisters should have generated enough stories to run for 100 years, except the rivalry never quite worked, and in 1969 Johnstone died. Given the speed of production – Crossroads was Britain’s first five-day-a-week soap – Kitty’s death was mentioned, months later, and she vanished without a funeral or a regret. And, I think, the programme limped from that point onwards. But I was watching! Somehow, with television, something clicked and kept luring me in. All of it: soaps, quizshows, comedies, drama, everything. At the risk of cod-psychology, I often wonder if it was because I was gay; when other boys hit puberty and turned to girls and sport, I just watched. I watched the parties, I watched the snogging, and I watched TV. Sometimes I think the closet made me a writer. Sometimes I think that’s bollocks, because I was inventing Asterix stories when I was nine. But still, everything good in my life has come out of being gay, so I’ll stick with my first theory. As a result, I was still watching Crossroads at the age of 18, when I went to university at Oxford, just in time for the show’s greatest scandal to erupt: the sacking of Noele Gordon. It was a strange, noisy, public sacking, humiliating for character and star. It fascinated me so much that, 42 years on, I’ve written a drama about those events for ITV, starring Helena Bonham Carter as Noele, or Nolly, as everyone called her. But even when Nolly’s imperious Meg had sailed off on the QE2 (which we had to recreate on an empty Liverpool dock with a crane, a wind machine and a CG ship), I stayed watching. Until the day that Crossroads changed my life.
In 1986, William Smethurst took over the show. In an interview with the Guardian, he said, as I remember it: we’re looking for new writers but no one will write for this show because they all think it’s rubbish! Well. Challenge accepted. The dream! I was unemployed, tucked away in a tiny flat in Cardiff; I had no agent, no contacts, but I did have a newfangled electric typewriter. So I bashed out a script and posted it off. Maybe three weeks passed, maybe three months, then the phone rang. They said: we like this, please come to Birmingham, meet the team, we’ll show you around, and let’s talk. Back then I thought: wow, is it that easy? Now, looking back, I realise it’s even simpler than that. Yes, I can write. Good call, Crossroads! So off I went. They’d summoned four hopefuls. We got shown around the sets – back then, I’d never been in a drama studio, but even with no experience I thought: this is tiny. The sets were practically backdrops. Never mind breaking the fourth wall, they had problems with walls two and three. But I loved it. It was my first insight into television production. We were even given a list of the price of drinks at the bar; it felt like the Holy Bible. Then, crucially, they gave us a trial script to write, drawn from real storylines. My episode was “Bomber Lancaster is nice to Jill after she has a bad day at work.” Lovely! I can do that! Off I went, back to Cardiff, back to the electric typewriter. I bashed it out and sent it off and waited. Four or five days later, I walked into my local newsagent and there they were, stacks of newspapers, every single headline – the Mirror, the Sun, the Mail, the Express, the Daily Star – all shouting “CROSSROADS AXED!” My dream died on the spot. I bought the Mirror and 20 Silk Cut and walked home, crushed. It was a funny old time, the mid-80s. In those same months, I was offered a job as a Play School presenter, and as a cartoonist for the Sunday Sport. But Crossroads had lit the fuse. That electric typewriter worked! Inventing scenes and giving imaginary people things to say … yes, that was the life for me. I stayed in soaps a long time, first in children’s TV, working on Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor’s Children’s Ward, then inventing my own shows in Granada Television’s magnificent entertainment department, whose leader, David Liddiment, sought to fill every spare slot in the schedule with a soap. I created Revelations, the story of an adulterous bishop with Judy Loe on splendid form as his murdering wife (“Shakespeare on a micro-budget,” said the Independent). Springhill, the story of the antichrist born on a Liverpool estate. I’m not making this up! Except we were making it up, day after day after day. I loved it and then I moved on. I got tired of my overwrought soap voice. In a soap, everyone says what they’re thinking; in life, no one says what they really think, and that began to interest me more. So I wrote Queer As Folk, and changed my life again.
But to this day, I still watch the soaps. It feels more lonely, now. My friend Phil’s mum died last year, and I felt like soap viewership had been reduced to one. Me. But the things I once loved are still loved, and maybe writing Nolly was a chance for me to remember those golden days, and to say thank you. It’s an ephemeral thing to love, a soap. It’s easy to say you’re a fan of a football team, or a singer, or a fantasy franchise. And I’m very much aware that, two years ago, I wrote an article for the Observer describing my life in relation to the rise of HIV and Aids in the 1980s. That subject is vast and full of anger. Crossroads cannot bear the weight of comparison. And yet, in my memory, those things are bound together as one. In the autumn of 1981, boys like Ritchie Tozer from It’s a Sin headed off to London, walking blindly into disaster, while Noele Gordon was recording her final scenes in Birmingham in the exact same months. Both those things happened. Both are true. Both are me. In the end, in defence of these lovely, silly, brilliant, vital TV shows, I have to quote my own script, because I gave the final line to Noele Gordon. In episode three, a man says to her that he watches TV only for the news and the wildlife. “Well then,” says Nolly. “You’re a fucking idiot.” Nolly is on ITVX from 2 February.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/13/nolly-russell-t-davies-crossroads-drama-helena-bonham-carter;guardian;entertainment & culture;3718
175;175;China claims Covid wave is ‘coming to an end’ as tourism and factory activity rebound;2023-01-31T08:50:36Z;['Helen Davidson'];['China', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research'];;"China’s wave of Covid is “coming to an end”, health officials have claimed, saying there had been no sign of a new surge from the lunar new year holiday period, despite a big increase in travel compared to last year. Government figures released on Tuesday showed big rises in tourism and hospitality activity compared to the same time last year. Factory activity has also rebounded for the first time in four months, an early sign of economic return after the country reported its slowest growth in about half a century during strict Covid controls. After abruptly lifting zero-Covid restrictions in early December, China was swamped by a wave of Covid cases. Available data on admissions to hospitals and fever clinics released in recent weeks showed an apparent peak in infections around early January.
There were concerns that the mass travel of hundreds of millions of people for the lunar new year period could further spread infections. On Tuesday, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claimed however, “there has not been an obvious rebound in Covid cases”. “In this time, no new variant has been discovered, and the country’s current wave is coming to an end.” Figures from the ministry of transport showed travel in the first 22 days of this year’s travel period was 75.8% higher than in 2022, although it was still only around half the number of trips made during the last pre-pandemic lunar new year in 2019. Officials had predicted that travel would increase by 99.5% year-on-year over the whole 40 days, and reach 70.3% of pre-pandemic levels, analysis firm Trivium said. In Dali, a popular holiday destination in Yunnan, hostel owner Fang Yu said she was booked out for the holiday period. “It feels a bit sudden because I have been lying flat for three years and suddenly there are so many customers, which makes me think about how can I provide the best service, especially when my facilities are now dusty after three years and my labels and signs have not yet been polished,” she told the Guardian. “So we are really hurry-scurry and are short of staff.” Fang said the mood among the guests was buoyant, and more understanding after three difficult years. “The pandemic made people reflect on themselves and look back. They are more likely to treat us as equals, and they generally seemed to be happy and not so picky,” she said. “My employees are also very happy after seeing so many people coming here from everywhere with joy on their faces.” Other economic figures were mixed, as China grapples with the lingering effects of zero-Covid on its economy. The most positive results were in the tourism and hospitality sectors, which reached almost 81% of pre-pandemic levels. Domestic tourism trips increased to 88.6% of 2019’s level, the ministry of culture and tourism said, but revenue from consumption-related industries grew by just 12.2% in the first week of the holiday period. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) stood at 50.1, compared with a reading of 47.0 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday. The 50-point mark separates contraction from growth. The IMF also revised China’s growth outlook sharply higher for 2023, to 5.2% from 4.4% in the October forecast after zero-Covid lockdown policies in 2022 slashed the country’s growth rate to 3.0%. The lunar new year period – which last about 40 days – has been called the largest at of human migration in the world, with hundreds of millions of people traveling across China and the region, including domestic migrant workers returning to home villages and towns to reunite with family. For many, it is the only chance they can go home each year, but the pandemic had prevented many from doing so in recent years. Even after restrictions were lifted this year, people were urged to reconsider visiting elderly relatives of those relatives had not yet been infected. The true scale of infections and deaths – particularly outside cities – has not been clear. Estimates of deaths range from about 80,000 – the official figure based on cases in hospitals – to more than a million according to global health experts.

5314;5314;A global recession may be looming, but there is a way out of this rut  | Larry Elliott;2023-01-04T14:35:12Z;['Larry Elliott'];['Economic growth (GDP)', 'Economics', 'Economic policy', 'Economic recovery', 'Politics', 'Inequality', 'UK news', 'Recession', 'Business'];;Great things were expected of the 2020s. After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

2641;2641;In five momentous years Jacinda Ardern became New Zealand’s most important postwar prime minister | Morgan Godfery;2023-01-19T03:59:01Z;['Morgan Godfery'];['Jacinda Ardern', 'New Zealand', 'New Zealand politics'];;"In one sense it feels as if Jacinda Ardern, who came to office in 2017, was the perpetual prime minister. In the collective memory, time fractures into the innocent period before the Christchurch massacre, the White Island eruption, the pandemic and then the exhausting period post. In each period – both before and after that defining summer from December 2019 to February 2020 – it feels as if the constant was Ardern. It’s difficult to imagine any other prime minister cutting through their bureaucracy’s cautious advice, their cabinet’s hesitancy and their citizenry’s uncertainty to make the decision to lock down a country of five million and work towards eliminating Covid-19.
Yet Ardern did. Within a few short months Covid was contained in New Zealand. The economy would boom. And in an uncharacteristically warm, dry spring in 2020 the prime minister won an unprecedented parliamentary majority – an endorsement of her policies and leadership in the worst emergency in almost a century. Yet in another sense it also feels as if Ardern arrived yesterday only to depart tomorrow. In August 2017 her Labour party colleagues almost had to beg her to assume the leadership. That alone qualifies Ardern as a politician apart from her colleagues. Unlike the series of Labour leaders who came before, or the series of National leaders who bit at her heels, Ardern never seemed to seek power. For nine years she was the reliable deputy. First to Grant Robertson, who eventually in turn became her deputy, and then to Andrew Little. That experience deputising was, in hindsight, the best possible audition for power. What’s striking about Ardern is the absence of ego. Even in her resignation speech she speaks directly to her daughter, Neve, promising that Mum is coming home, and addressing her partner, Clarke, promising that they can finally marry. Students of political memoir and reflection understand that political careers leave precious little time or cognitive space for home life. The former prime minister Helen Clark was a famous workaholic, clocking on at 7am and off at almost midnight. John Key, both during and after his prime ministership, did register his regret at missing important moments in the lives of his children. But Ardern, with characteristic self-effacement, made a promise that she would be home when Neve enters primary school. This is the best possible reason to step down – honouring a commitment to your daughter. For the global class of Ardern watchers it was always extraordinary to observe how someone could give birth, breastfeed and care for an infant, toddler and then child while at the same time confronting a terrorist massacre, volcanic eruption and a pandemic. In each disaster the prime minister acted decisively – from banning semi-automatic weapons and reforming firearms law to implementing a world-leading alert level system to crush Covid-19 outbreaks. The speed at which these disasters would arrive, and the equally speedy response, makes it feel as if the short five-year period the prime minister was in power was actually an age. In this sense, then, she feels like the perpetual prime minister. As a country we packed so much living into these last five years. But that is also an unusually short term of service for an MMP prime minister. Key had eight years while Clark had nine and Jim Bolger seven. Yet it’s Ardern who will most likely linger in the public memory in the decades to come. No prime minister in the post-war period has had to confront and resolve as many disasters. The pandemic, yes, but also a dramatic housing shortage (Ardern’s government built more homes than any other government in decades), runaway climate change (Ardern’s government passed a Zero Carbon Act) and growing inequality. Perhaps this is where Ardern might register one failing. The economic response to the pandemic, where billions of dollars in cheap credit was released, helped the wealthiest New Zealanders peel even further away from the poorest. But that is a policy problem for the next prime minister to confront. It’s tempting to insert a dialectic into Ardern’s rise. If a conservative culture and soulless consumerism were responsible for flower power in the 1960s, then perhaps it was a neoliberal politic and a life-threatening capitalist mode that is responsible for Ardern’s singular and unique appeal. From 2017 to 2023 she was someone who promised to care. Historians might conclude in later years that this reading is too grand or overdetermined. But the prime minister’s appeal was always in her personality. The “relentless positivity”, as she called it in 2017. Or the humility, as I see, in never seeking power. Yet when it was thrust upon her, first in the form of the Labour leadership and then in the prime ministership, Ardern proved that she was more than a happy face. She was the most important prime minister in postwar history.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/in-five-momentous-years-jacinda-ardern-became-new-zealands-most-important-postwar-prime-minister;guardian;politics;2641
4227;4227;Rishi Sunak is stuck peddling fake solutions – he can’t admit his own party is the problem | Rafael Behr;2023-01-11T06:00:10Z;['Rafael Behr'];['Rishi Sunak', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Immigration and asylum', 'NHS', 'Economic policy', 'Industrial action'];;"The Conservative party spent 2022 at war with itself and begins 2023 in an uneasy truce. To keep the peace, Rishi Sunak has to avoid two contentious topics: the past and the future. That doesn’t leave much room for manoeuvre. The past is tricky to narrate without mentioning Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and the reasons why neither of them is now prime minister. Sunak can’t explain how he comes to be in charge without describing the recklessness of governments he served and discrediting the party he leads. Most of the governing challenges Sunak faces were either caused by his predecessors or exacerbated by their negligent mismanagement. He can’t repudiate them without disinterring the grievances that his accession was meant to bury. But without telling the story so far, a leader struggles to narrate where things will go next. That sense of a journey is what was missing from the speech Sunak gave last week setting out his agenda. There were five pledges, crafted to make short-term damage limitation sound like bold ambition.
The prime minister has promised lower inflation and shorter NHS waiting lists (taking a fairly safe punt that both are on a downward trajectory from current peaks). He wants economic growth to return and national debt to fall (as both are forecast to do), but was careful not to say by how much or how quickly. Setting the economic bar low doesn’t guarantee that Sunak will clear it. But the greater political hazard is loaded into the pledge that looks, on paper, easiest to fulfil – an act of parliament to make migration across the Channel in small boats more illegal than it is already. That is not the same as reducing the total number of journeys – a metric that doesn’t respond to draconian statutes. The prime minister can only deliver gestures in the Commons, not results in the water. The distinction will not impress voters who will be incensed by reports of Albanians still landing dinghies in Kent. If the law is being flouted, Sunak will hardly be able to boast that he made it stricter. The prime minister will succeed only in elevating the platform from which Nigel Farage and his tribute acts on the populist right of the Tory party denounce the government for failure to defend the nation’s borders. Sunak’s supporters explain his pledges – “the people’s priorities” – as a device to streamline the Tory project so it might glide more smoothly into a general election campaign with memorable achievements under the prime minister’s wing. The plan is to bang on about the five-point plan with unremitting, monomaniacal discipline. The minority of people who pay close attention to politics will be bored to tears, but the much larger audience that only tunes in to Westminster occasionally will get the message that the prime minister is doing something about the issues that exercise them most. The slimline agenda is meant to reinforce Sunak’s image as a pragmatist and a problem-solver. That branding was available to him once, when he was the fresh-faced young chancellor coping with a pandemic that no one had seen coming. But now he is the stale face of a party in power for 13 years, during which time most people’s incomes and living standards have fallen. There is a difference between solving problems and legislating against them. The government’s proposed anti-strike law, introduced to parliament on Tuesday, is a case in point. Its purpose is to limit the rights of workers in essential public services to take industrial action. This will further poison current disputes with nurses, teachers, train drivers and others, making it harder to reach a settlement. A government that responds to trade union pressure by breaking the legal levers by which that pressure is applied is not serious about negotiation.
Conservative thinking on industrial relations has hardly evolved since the 1970s and early 1980s. It is a period Sunak, born in 1980, knows only as historic parable – the legend of Mrs Thatcher taming the red barons. But the iron lady is not still an inspiration only for 21st-century Tories, she is the last safe icon among former prime ministers. There have been five others since her, but they are unavailable as role models, either because they failed spectacularly, sold out to Europe or both. Sunak can hardly unite his party with pledges to manage sleazy decline like John Major, embrace metropolitan liberalism like David Cameron, martyr himself to Brexit compromise like Theresa May or detonate Britain’s economic credibility like Liz Truss. As for Boris Johnson, the political grave isn’t deep enough for Sunak to eulogise on it safely. Dozens of Tory MPs think their old boss would do a better job of protecting their seats in a general election. They talk of a resurrection, much to the horror of colleagues who recall what it was like having a prime minister with a pathological aversion to probity. Sunak is protected and diminished by that memory. He is in Downing Street because his party preferred leaders who soiled the office. Someone had to clear up the mess. It is hardly a mandate to boast about, but if it is forgotten, the Tories’ fragile loyalty to their least-worst choice vanishes too. He has won no elections, nor even any arguments. He is neither the keeper nor the builder of a legacy, just a placeholder prime minister, averting his eyes from the past, silent on the future, marooned in the present and shrinking every day.

2506;2506;"Elgar: Viola Concerto; Bloch: Suite for Viola and Orchestra review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week";2023-01-19T15:00:12Z;['Andrew Clements'];['Classical music', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Edward Elgar', 'BBC Symphony Orchestra'];;"Elgar signalled his approval of Lionel Tertis’s viola arrangement of the solo part of his cello concerto by conducting its first performance in 1930, with Tertis as the soloist. That the great violist’s reworking was supremely tactful, and involved the minimum of changes to the solo lines – mostly octave transpositions where the original cello part goes below the viola’s range – and none at all to the orchestral score, no doubt helped Elgar to accept its validity.
As Timothy Ridout’s fine performance with Martyn Brabbins and the BBC Symphony Orchestra shows, the concerto is entirely convincing as a viola work, which makes its rarity in the concert hall and on disc all the more surprising – apparently this is just the third ever commercial recording. It could even be argued that the central pair of movements are more effective in the viola version than in the original – Ridout makes the scherzo fabulously nimble and precise, and the long aching lines of the Adagio even more plangent. It’s only in a handful of passages in the outer movements that the extra weight of tone that the cello inevitably brings is really missed.
Ridout is equally impressive in Ernest Bloch’s Suite, which was composed first for viola and piano and subsequently orchestrated; it was first performed in 1919, the year in which Elgar’s concerto was premiered, too. It’s a curious piece, full of faux orientalisms, and veering between full-blooded romantic sweeps and nervy modernist juxtapositions; the best music comes in the third movement, an enchanted nocturne, which Ridout spins out on a beautiful thread of silvery tone.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) last week admitted it spent £600,000 on staffing costs alone in just two months as part of its review of the bill. Ministers have now ordered other departments not to reveal details on what resources they have diverted, but analysis by the Observer suggests the final total for all government departments will be in the tens of millions. BEIS is responsible for just 318 out of about 4,000 laws and regulations protecting employment rights, consumer rights, the environment, farming, travel and civil liberties that Rishi Sunak said he plans to abolish or reform by the end of the year. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Treasury and the Department for Transport all have more regulations to consider, while HMRC, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health and Social Care also have substantial tasks. Last year, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who championed the bill as business secretary, was told BEIS would need 400 staff to find out which laws the government wanted to scrap and what the impact would be, while the DHSC would need 100 people to deal with 137 pieces of legislation identified so far. Experts say the cost could run into tens of millions of pounds. MPs from every opposition party have called on the government to rethink the bill, which returns to parliament on Wednesday. In a letter to the Observer, the MPs say: “As yet parliament doesn’t have a full list of what regulations could be deleted but we do know it includes vital protections for river quality, clean air, consumer health and workers’ rights. “Ministers are choosing to apply an arbitrary, unmanageable deadline to review these laws and then giving themselves the power to decide what happens next rather than parliament.” For instance, civil servants in the business department have the task of examining the future of the ecodesign of ‘glandless standalone circulators’ (a type of fan), or whether to keep regulations ensuring that makeup or lead crystal glass is not toxic. Defra has about 1,100 laws and regulations to review, including rules on aquatic animal quarantine, or how to guarantee that chicks exported to Finland are free of salmonella. Other regulations include those to protect wildlife, limit sewage and pollution in rivers, whether drinking water has radioactive substances in it, the use of hormones in livestock, how much pesticide is allowed in food, and limits on harmful air pollution. Ruth Chambers of the Greener UK coalition of 10 major environmental organisations said: “Trying to scrap nearly 4,000 laws in a year with next to no scrutiny is reckless and undermines the environment, business and public health. “Simply extending the deadline will not change the fundamental flaws. Ministers will still be able to weaken vital protections behind closed doors. Gaps will still be left in the law. The bill will drain resources from government departments trying to deal with the cost of living crisis, and cost taxpayers millions in the process. “We need a far more considered approach that this bill cannot and will not provide.” Experts are already warning that the legislation raises serious legal problems for the government and directly contradicts elements of the 2020 Brexit trade agreement with the EU which guarantees that UK will not “weaken or reduce” labour and social protections. Prof Keith Ewing, president of the Institute of Employment Rights, said that a string of employment rights would be made “vulnerable” by the new bill. “This is a very wide category of rights,” he said. “You could argue it covers our entire inheritance from leaving the EU, as a result there is an obligation of non-regression. I can’t see how they can meet the obligations of that deal and remove all EU regulations by the end of the year. “Some people in government seem to be deluding themselves that because of Brexit, we can move ourselves back to the days before 1 January 1973, as if the world had never changed. We may have left the EU, but we have retained obligations to it under the trade agreement.” A BEIS spokesperson said: “The programme to review, revoke and reform retained EU law is underway and being adequately resourced.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/whitehall-spending-tens-of-millions-rees-mogg-bill-to-scrap-eu-laws;guardian;politics;3510
1812;1812;Men, guard your friendships – heed the warning of the Banshees of Inisherin | Tim Dowling;2023-01-23T08:00:18Z;['Tim Dowling'];['Men', 'Friendship', 'Life and style', 'The Banshees of Inisherin', 'Drama films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'UK news', 'Men'];;"The premise of the film The Banshees of Inisherin – now attracting awards like a magnet – is encapsulated in an early exchange between the two main characters: Colm abruptly ends his longstanding friendship with Pádraic, who, understandably, seeks an explanation. “I just don’t like you no more,” says Colm. “You do like me,” says Pádraic. “I don’t,” says Colm. Although many of the codes of straight male friendship are unspoken, there are two obvious breaches of protocol here. First, one never ends things overtly – the demands of male friendship are traditionally so low that it would be more work to break off an acquaintance than to maintain it. It would certainly involve more talking. Second, among men, not liking someone is no particular barrier to lifelong friendship. It’s hard to even think of such a relationship in those terms. Do I actually like this guy? Does he like me? How would I even know? We spend all the time we’re together insulting each other. Why would it matter? What follows in the film is a grisly dissolution of a friendship (in a bid to escape Pádraic, Colm threatens to chop off his own fingers) that we, the audience, have never known in its prime. But because it’s a friendship between two men, we can guess what it was like: companionable, fundamentally unserious and wholly reliant on proximity or shared interests – in this case, going to the pub at 2pm every day. And all of it shrouded in a fog of comforting irrelevance. This, apparently, is what Colm can no longer abide about Pádraic. “I just don’t have a place in my life for dullness any more,” he says. Men like to think that because our friendships are slow-growing, studded with barbs, and require little tending, they are durable, like a drought-resistant hedge. But in reality they’re terribly fragile; untended, they often simply shrivel up. They may seem flexible, but they’re not constructed to withstand much in the way of change. When the writer and performer Max Dickins got engaged to his girlfriend, it triggered a crisis – he couldn’t think of a close enough male friend to serve as his best man. Some of the most obvious candidates, it transpired, were people he hadn’t spoken to in ages. His male friendships had, one by one, slipped away. He embarked on an investigation that became a funny and engaging book – Billy No-Mates: How I Realised Men Have a Friendship Problem. Dickins instantly recognised something familiar in The Banshees of Inisherin, even though it’s set on an island off the coast of Ireland a century ago. “I thought it was one of the best portrayals of male friendship, and also of male mental health, I’ve seen on the screen,” he says. “It’s pretty rare that a friendship, especially a male friendship, is the absolute centre of a narrative.” It’s not, as you may have gathered, a terribly flattering portrayal of male friendship. Neither is the one in Dickins’ book, at first. The friends he re-established contact with always seemed to insist on social settings that gave the meeting an ulterior purpose – a sports bar, or some kind of activity – rendering direct communication unnecessary. In terms of conversation there was a predominant mode, what Dickins calls, “the jazz of casual brutality that men reserve for people they like”. You may recognise this picture of male friendship: emotionally illiterate, devoid of ritual, wavering between light-hearted abuse and total silence. More than anything else, our friendships seem unthought-through. Nobody quite seems to know what they want from them, or what they need. But if you’re a man, it’s hard not to also feel a certain affection for this arrangement, or to think that maybe it is, in some sense, exactly what’s required. “We can overthink friendship a little bit,” says Dickins, “and kind of get obsessed about this idea that you have a best friend that is for ever and will always be present and the perfect cipher for you.” Male friendships are more like a kind of travel, he says, with the two of you side by side, eyes fixed on some shared destination. “When men lose that spot on the horizon, often that friendship will become less close,” he says, “because that is the juice in it. That is what’s pushing it forwards and keeping it together.” Male friendship is also like a club – members come and go, leave and rejoin. The supposed insufficiency of male friendship has spawned a lot of movements and groups over the years, some pitching formal male bonding rituals, others trying to re-confer a traditional sense of masculinity that the modern world has somehow robbed from us. A lot of the “mythopoetic” male movements – typified by Robert Bly’s book Iron John – have aged poorly. But there are still plenty of gurus out there – Jordan Peterson, say – purporting to tell hapless men hard truths when they’re really just telling them what they want to hear: that men are the true victims of victim culture. What Dickins learned – and his book amply demonstrates – is that male friendships, like all friendships, require regular maintenance to keep them going. As a man you may well find your closest male friends are simply the ones prepared to do all the social heavy lifting. As for the friendships themselves, well, you won’t know what you’re missing till they’re gone; for all their emotional opacity and genial cruelty, male friendships are still vital. As Dickins writes (paraphrasing the American sportswriter Ethan Strauss): “Yes, masculinity is a little bit toxic – that’s what I like about it.” But be careful – it’s all fun until somebody loses a finger. Or several.

5780;5780;The Last of Us, Shrinking and Kaleidoscope: what’s new to streaming in Australia this January ;2023-01-01T19:00:02Z;['Luke Buckmaster'];['Television & radio', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Australian film', 'Australian television', 'Netflix', 'Stan', 'Television', 'Australian Broadcasting Corporation', 'Pedro Pascal', 'The Last of Us'];;"Netflix Kaleidoscope TV, US, 2023 – out 1 January Creator Eric Garcia’s Ridley Scott-produced anthology series has an interesting gimmick: Netflix will present episodes randomly, each viewer experiencing them in a different order (other than the finale, which is the same for all). Loosely inspired by a real-life heist that occurred in Manhattan during Hurricane Sandy, in which bonds worth billions went missing, the characters are a familiar lineup of shady professionals including a weapons specialist (Paz Vega), a safe cracker (Jai Courtney), a driver (Jordan Mendoza) and a mastermind pulling the shots (Giancarlo Esposito, AKA Gus Fring from Breaking Bad).
The Pale Blue Eye Film, US, 2022 – out 6 January Murder mysteries are more fun when they’re based before the dawn of advanced forensics. Nobody wants to hear “I think it was Miss Peacock in the library with the rope – but let’s check with the lab first.”
The Pale Blue Eyes takes place in the 1830s, with Christian Bale as a renowned detective recruited by an American military academy to solve a case involving a corpse that’s had its heart removed. He recruits a young cadet to help, though it’s not just anyone: this cadet is fond of poetry and is named Edgar Allen Poe (Harry Melling). The film is based on Louis Bayard’s novel of the same name, which was described by the New York Times as “shockingly clever and devoutly unsentimental”.
Copenhagen Cowboy TV, Denmark, 2023 – out 5 January Nicolas Winding Refn is known for brutal violence and blindingly bright neon-glazed images. The director of Drive, Only God Forgives and Too Old to Die Young returns to his motherland for (his words) a “poetic neo-noir”, marking his first Danish language production since 2005. Copenhagen Cowboy follows a young woman, Miu (Angela Bundalovic), who navigates Copenhagen’s criminal underbelly and is joined by her nemesis for – according to the official synopsis – “an odyssey through the natural and the supernatural”. Expect saturated colours and long, lingering shots.
Honourable mentions: Lady Voyeur (TV, 1 January), Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street (TV, 4 January), Break Point (TV, 13 January), A Quiet Place Part II (film, 14 January), Khallat+ (film, 19 January), You People (film, 27 January), Pamela, A Love Story (TV, 31 January), Cunk On Earth (TV, 31 January), Jung_E (film, date TBC). Stan Black Snow TV, Australia, 2023 – out 1 January Creator Lucas Taylor’s Queensland-set murder mystery has a morbidly entertaining premise: what if the opening of a long-buried time capsule contained a clue to an unsolved murder? Travis Fimmel’s sleepy-eyed detective James Cormack dusts off an old case involving the death of 17-year-old Isabel (Talijah Blackman-Corowa), who is also one of the lead characters – the show alternating between her story (set in the 90s) and Cormac’s investigation many years later, in 2019. After a strong start Black Snow’s screenwriters struggle to maintain tension across its six-episode arc – but those partial to a good ol‘ small-town mystery will probably find enough to satisfy.
Transfusion Film, Australia, 2023 – out 20 January Sam Worthington is currently on cinema screens, frolicking around on Pandora as the tall blue protagonist of Avatar: Way of the Water. You can see him sans motion capture suit in this new Australian thriller, playing a PTSD-suffering former member of the Australian army’s Special Air Service regiment. In a plotline that sounds a bit Liam Neeson-esque, Worthington’s protagonist must venture into the criminal underworld to save his young son (Edward Friday Carmody). The synopsis sounds a little macho; let’s hope director Matt Nable brings something interesting to the table.
Honourable mentions: every Harry Potter movie (film, 15 January), 10 Cloverfield Lane (film, 21 January), Farewell, Mr Haffmann (film, 22 January), Youth (film, 23 January), The Pretend One (film, 25 January), Poker Face (TV, 27 January), Slam (film, 31 January).
ABC iView Crazy Fun Park TV, Australia, 2023 – out 1 January Every once in a while the ABC produces smart and energetic YA productions that resonate with their target audiences – among them The PM’s Daughter and Nowhere Boys. This new series created by Nicholas Verso (director of Boys in the Trees) begins inside its eerie titular location – a disused amusement park – where a young man observes a bunch of mask-wearing ghosts then gets out of there, toot suite. The narrative revolves around Chester (Henry Strand), a high school student whose best friend (Stacy Clausen) dies but lives on as an apparition at Crazy Fun Park. The Paul Jennings-esque tone is playfully creepy.
Honourable mentions: Camilla’s Country Life (film, 6 January), Bradman and Tendulkar (TV, 23 January), Australia’s Wild Odyssey (TV, 24 January). SBS on Demand Not Quite Hollywood Film, Australia, 2008 – out 1 January Mark Hartley’s riotously entertaining documentary about the Ozploitation movement captures the explosive, tyre-streaked, bullet-marked, nudity-filled energy of an exhilarating trash-and-treasure period of Australian cinema. It’s pacey and pulpy, like many of the films it explores. After watching Not Quite Hollywood, why not gorge on some Ozploitation classics that land on the platform on 6 January – including Razorback, Road Games, Mad Dog Morgan, The Man from Hong Kong, Long Weekend and Patrick.
Honourable mentions: Cosi (film, 1 January), Good Night, and Good Luck (film, 1 January), Somewhere Boy (TV, 5 January), What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (film, 6 January), Bird of Passage (film, 6 January), Am I Being Unreasonable?

Amazon Prime Video The Rig TV, Scotland, 2023 – out 6 January This supernatural thriller created by David Macpherson and directed by John Strickland (whose credits include Line of Duty and Bodyguard) follows a crew working on an oil rig off the Scottish coast who are hit by a thick mysterious fog that covers the rig and summons eerie happenings. “Since the fog came in, some of our crew have had psychological difficulty,” says one character in the trailer, which sounds like a bit of an understatement given all those creepy visuals and talk about how the crew have encountered “something old” that’s “waking up”. Oooooo.
Lots of Rocky movies Rocky Balboa is the most recognisable boxer in movie history – played with sweaty aplomb by Sylvester Stallone. His movies (as well as baton-passing spinoffs Creed and Creed 2) are landing on Prime Video in January, allowing fans and potential fans to launch an epic binge session. Rocky 1-3 arrive on 6 January; Rocky 4, 5 and Rocky Balboa on 13 January; and Creed and Creed 2 on 20 January.
Honourable mentions: Jurassic Park (film, 1 January), Jurassic Park: The Lost World (film, 1 January), Gasoline Alley (film, 6 January), Shotgun Wedding (film, 27 January), Where The Crawdads Sing (film, 28 January). Disney+ Extraordinary TV, UK, 2023 – out 25 January Creator and lead writer Emma Moran’s comedy series is the latest “superhero with a twist” story, finding a marketable point of difference in a well-flogged genre by depicting a world in which everyone over 18 has a superpower – except the protagonist. Twenty-five-year-old Jen (Máiréad Tyers) feels understandably shafted, moaning about being a plain old unremarkable human. The concept has lots of potential for comedy and zany world-building.
Honourable mentions: Koala Man (film, 9 January), Chasing Waves (TV, 11 January), If These Walls Could Sing (film, 6 January), Darby and the Dead (film, 27 January). Binge The Last of Us TV, US, 2023 – out 16 January Much anticipation surrounds this adaptation of the masterful, hard-hitting video game of the same name, originally released in 2013 and with an even more confronting sequel landing in 2020. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey star as Joel and Ellie – a stoic man and teenage girl respectively, who navigate a post-apocalyptic America where hideous zombie-like creatures monster the landscape. I love how the time-ravaged aesthetic of both games combines dilapidated settings with visions of nature reclaiming city spaces, mixing natural beauty and potential rebirth with a constant reminder that the world can never return to what it was. Creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have their work cut out for them.
Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie Film, US, 2017 – out 12 January David Soren’s gloriously zany animation doesn’t take a moment for granted, constantly shifting realities, mixing up its aesthetic and embracing a mood of kiddish chaos. Two young pranksters – George (voice of Kevin Hart) and Harold (voice of Thomas Middleditch) – are delighted by their newfound ability to mind-control their school principal, who turns on their command into a subservient blubbering idiot and quasi-superhero. There’s loads of funny gags, sometimes delightfully childish and sometimes utterly audacious.
Honourable mentions: Labyrinth (film, 1 January), Mulholland Drive (film, 1 January), One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (film, 2 January), Boiler Room (film, 3 January), Brooklyn (film, 7 January), Calvary (film, 7 January), Carol (film, 7 January), Velma (TV, 12 January), Forrest Gump (film, 15 January), Top Gun: Maverick (film, 19 January), The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (film, 20 January), Where the Drawdads Sing (film, 28 January). Apple TV+ Shrinking TV, US, 2023 – out 27 January What if a shrink snapped and started telling clients what they really think? That’s the premise of Shrinking, a 10-part comedy co-created by and starring Jason Segel as a therapist who breaks conventions, breaches ethical boundaries and (according to the official synopsis) starts “making huge changes to people’s lives”. The underwhelming teaser trailer doesn’t give away much, but it does briefly show co-star Harrison Ford, whose performance marks one of his first TV roles. Old mate Hazza finally got the TV memo, also recently starring in the Yellowstone origin story 1923.
Honourable mentions: Servant season 4 (TV, 13 January), Super League: The War For Football (TV, January 13), Truth Be Told season 3 (TV, 27 January). Paramount+ Art & Krimes by Krimes Film, US, 2021 – out 5 January “When you go into prison you quickly come to realise that there are a few things that no one can take from you – your dignity and your ability to create,” says artist Jesse Krimes told Deadline, reflecting on his artistic ideals and his time in a federal prison. During a six-year stint, Krimes – who was found guilty of cocaine possession – continued to create art, clandestinely piecing together contraband creations using materials such as bedsheets and hair gel. His works include a 40-foot mural, constructed piecemeal, different parts of it smuggled out of the penitentiary. Director Alysa Nahmias captures his story in Art & Krimes by Krimes, which played on the festival circuit (including at Sundance and Telluride) before being acquired by Paramount+.

4853;4853;Kimbra on the ups and downs of fame: ‘Always having to look like a pop star is exhausting’;2023-01-06T19:00:07Z;['Katie Cunningham'];['Music', 'Gotye', 'Culture', 'New Zealand', 'Pop and rock', 'Anxiety'];;"Lately, Kimbra has been thinking about her anxiety. It’s something she’s long struggled with but has begun to take more seriously as an adult. “I have a really challenging career, so sometimes I [feel like], why me? Then I’m like, well, it makes sense,” she says, her native Kiwi accent dulled by years of living in the US. “Any young woman who was thrown into the spotlight young, who has to think every day about how they appear, to be scrutinised, and has a lot of people putting money into their career – obviously, I’m going to be susceptible to anxiety.” Kimbra Lee Johnson, who you probably know mononymously, has been in the public eye for most of her life. She began performing and making music at 11 (see the adorable clip of her declaring “one day, I’d love to be a pop star” on a New Zealand children’s show). At 17 she signed a management deal with financing, part of a long game plan to get her ready to launch as an artist, “which is a huge privilege but fucking pressure as well”. By the time she was 21, she had achieved the sort of success most musicians can only dream of when she appeared on the 2011 Gotye hit Somebody That I Used to Know, which topped the charts in 23 countries, was awarded two Grammys and now ranks among the bestselling digital singles of all time. Her debut album, released soon after, went platinum in Australia and New Zealand and proved her flair for creating interesting, left-of-centre pop songs that are more Björk than Britney Spears. Now 32, Kimbra is preparing to share her fourth album, A Reckoning. It’s her first release as an independent artist, which feels significant given her early years as a major label darling. She got her childhood wish to become a pop star but can now reflect on both the good and bad that it brought. The Hamilton-born artist loves performing and feels music is her purpose. But success has also meant challenge and sacrifice.
“It’s a pretty lonely life,” Kimbra says, before sitting in one of the many long pauses she will take during our conversation, choosing her words carefully. “Not a lot of people can really understand the pressures that you’re under. And I think loneliness is responsible for a lot of things. When you’re lonely, then you get more in your head and then your mental health goes out [the window].”
Of course, Kimbra couldn’t have known what she was signing up for when this all began. At 17, as soon as she finished high school, she moved from New Zealand to Melbourne to begin work on her debut album, expanding on tracks she wrote when she was 15, including Settle Down and The Build Up. Suddenly she went from a “pretty normal” teenager with lots of friends and hobbies to being alone in a new city, her life revolving around work. It was a difficult transition but in 2010 the hard work paid off and she signed with Warner. The deal was brokered by her then-manager Mark Richardson, an industry veteran who had flown to Auckland to meet Kimbra and her parents after hearing a demo on her MySpace page. Richardson had put her in the studio with a producer, François Tétaz, to work on the album. At the time, Tétaz was also working on the next album from singer-songwriter Wally de Backer, AKA Gotye. The pair asked Kimbra if she would be interested in singing on an offbeat, spacey Gotye song that they were trying to find the right guest vocalist for – Somebody That I Used to Know. “She laid that vocal down in her bedroom with Wally and the rest is history,” Richardson remembers. “It just blew up.”
Kimbra was everywhere. Vows, the debut album the 21-year-old had been working on quietly for years, was released a month later. But the success of Somebody That I Used to Know was “challenging” for Kimbra, Richardson thinks.
“It’s like a massive adrenaline shot,” he describes. They were in the process of developing Kimbra as an artist, which had been moving at a nice pace pre-Gotye. “And then the next minute, she’s on stage getting a Grammy from Prince … It’s difficult to handle that. Because suddenly you get given everything, rather than slowly, progressively, earning everything.” Kimbra wishes she could have enjoyed or even remembered that time more, instead of constantly thinking about the next thing. “But this is stuff that you don’t really know when you’re 20,” she says. She learned how nonstop touring and her “all-consuming” focus on music could disconnect her from friends, and that fame could be a double-edged sword.
“I don’t like the transactional part of fame, where I exist to be an accessory for your Instagram photo,” she says. “I don’t like feeling like a product. I don’t like having to uphold a fantasy all the time. “The expectation of always having to look like a pop star is exhausting. And I don’t like how narcissistic fame is. I spend so much time looking at myself; it’s really boring – in the mirror, approving promo photos, making things on social media. There’s a self-absorbed part of fame where you have to always be on watch. It’s a price I’m willing to pay … I just wish it wasn’t so ‘me, me, me’. Because I truly mean it – it truly is boring to only think about yourself, and fame does that. It just creates an echo chamber.” By 2014 Kimbra pulled the brakes. She began to work on her second album, The Golden Echo, in Los Angeles. It was the turning point in her career. Richardson says the pressure was on from her label after Vows and the Gotye track to deliver a big follow-up album; a desire that was sometimes at odds with Kimbra’s vision. “She was trying to push the bounds of music,” Richardson says. “She didn’t want to be moulded into the next Katy Perry.” Excited by her new access to artists whose work she’d long admired, Kimbra crammed the record with big ideas and big collaborations with the likes of John Legend, Daniel Johns and Thundercat. “There was no organic flow with it … and I think that it just got a bit lost, to be honest,” Richardson says.
The Golden Echo divided critical opinion and did not replicate the commercial success of her debut. Kimbra was happy in her decision to “go weird” with the album, and is nonchalant about how it fared. “It probably wasn’t a smart commercial move, but, oh well. I like it.” Richardson and Kimbra parted ways after that. She moved to New York and four years later she released her third album, Primal Heart. There were “always the hopes that I would have more pop success”, Kimbra says. But it didn’t chart well, and soon after she exited her record deal with Warner, feeling she and the label were no longer on the same page. “I was on a six-album deal and they wanted to extend it to eight albums and choose my next producer. Nope,” she says. “They want to sign SoundCloud rappers – it just wasn’t the right fit any more.” In the years since that split Kimbra has been through an intense period of personal challenges that include the sudden death of her best friend, breakups and navigating New York during the apocalyptic early days of the pandemic. She had to confront the way she processes big, heavy emotions and the “scary stuff” that lives inside her, including the destructive ways she says her anxiety can sometimes manifest. She began thinking about the afterlife more, delved deeper into spirituality. All of this was poured into her fourth album – one that is sonically more pared back than her previous work, with plenty of darker, more introspective tracks, such as the haunting lead single Save Me. Writing it was a salve.
“I’m just so grateful to God that I have music because I don’t know how else I would get out that tension, that chaos,” she says. “I have a lot of interior dialogues, and they’re not always kind.” When she’s at home in New York, Kimbra enjoys simple pleasures: yoga, painting watercolours, walking her dog and watching “shitty reality TV like everyone else”. And now she’s an independent artist, she feels “liberated” in her work; no longer having to deal with expectations from a label about how her music should sound. “I just want to make music I like,” she says. “I can’t go and sell something that I don’t believe in … I’m leaving behind a legacy. I want to make shit that’s going to matter when I die.”
Having been through the major label machine and come out the other side, Kimbra sees positives and negatives. The music industry can be exploitative, patriarchal and “very shady in the way it’s set up”, she says. But she also knows she owes a lot of her success to people in the industry who believe in her. She has begun producing for other musicians – something that offers her a healthy sense of detachment – and wants to mentor more young female musicians. Looking back, “it’s crazy to think of how ambitious I was as a kid”, she says of those early days of her career when she threw her everything into music. But everything that happened along the way feels as though it was leading her here. “[Without it], I wouldn’t be able to help other young women through anxiety and the pressures of the music industry. I wouldn’t have all these things to offer. You know how if someone has been married to the same person all their life, and they’re trying to give you relationship advice – you’re like, well, you don’t really know,” she says. “So I wouldn’t change anything.” A Reckoning is out on 27 January.

Since then tensions have risen and progress has stalled in negotiations between the league and the Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) over a new collective bargaining agreement. Why are the NRL, clubs and players still at loggerheads? There has been little to no progress made on a new collective bargaining agreement. Bargaining, at least in any real sense, has not even begun according to the RLPA. Players feel disrespected by the NRL and frustrated at the lack of progress. The NRL are not only reluctant to cede more money but are concerned about losing decision-making power around core employment terms. What impact did the announcement of a salary cap have? The NRL announced an increase in the salary cap to $12.1m in 2023, two days prior to Christmas. It was a rise of 25% according to the NRL but significantly less in real terms relative to the last negotiated salary cap, per the RLPA. The failure to have prior agreement from the RLPA was viewed by players as disrespectful, lacking in goodwill and an attempt to position players as greedy.
What does this mean for NRLW players? The women’s competition is set to expand to 10 teams this season yet the players do not have a CBA to work under. Players are currently being forced to either not train or train without the security of private health insurance since the last deal, funded by sacrifices made by Jillaroos players, expired on 31 December. Dally M medal winner Raecene McGregor injured her MCL at training this week. Broncos star Ali Brigginshaw said she will not train without insurance. Players have historically been offered just four-month contracts, only adding to the risk of training without insurance and the uncertainty offered to NRLW players. What actions have players taken? Players have taken the unprecedented move of refusing to undertake any NRL media or promotional work. This was an organic player-driven move designed to show unity and seriousness. This action is expected to continue into the season if a CBA has not been agreed. What options are on the table for players The players maintain “everything is on the table”, including a player strike. While a potential strike remains a ways off, there is a strong possibility that players could extend their refusal to participate in NRL activities to community work. What happens if there is a strike? This is obviously the worst case scenario for all involved, particularly the NRL. Games would be cancelled for an indefinite period of time. Revenue from broadcasters and ticket sales, among other streams, would dry up. It would be a public relations disaster. One possibility raised this week was an offer from USA Championship Rugby League to pause its season and come in as alternative labour if required. The NRL has not commented on that option. Where are negotiations at? Bargaining, remarkably, has not even begun. The NRL put a proposal to the RLPA in early January that has been rejected by the players, who believe it tracks backwards on a per player basis in both financial and non-financial issues. RLPA chief Clint Newton and NRL CEO Andrew Abdo have met and held discussions but no official bargaining has taken place despite one club CEO noting that in February 2022 Abdo declared he wanted a deal done by State of Origin last year and brought in former Nine CEO Hugh Marks to lead negotiations. Is this all about money? Yes and no. Money is obviously central but it does not seem to be the key source of tension. The RLPA is looking to ensure all players on a per player basis are tracking forward with this CBA covering approximately 1,000 players due to the addition of a 17th club and 10 NRLW teams, up from 600. Abdo said the NRL “put forward an offer of $1.3bn over a five-year cycle, which is an increase of 37% for players”. What are the issues at play? There are myriad issues and dynamics at play. Players are after both security, particularly for women and more vulnerable male players, and increased power, particularly around core employment conditions and their ability to dictate where the players share of revenue is directed. The NRL appears reluctant to give up any power, particularly around core employment conditions. The lack of trust the players have for the NRL and their perception that the NRL has not prioritised discussions – including being adequately prepared and educated to bargain – underlies talks, though the NRL is adamant that reaching an agreement with players has been a priority and continues to be a priority. Where are the players at? Players are “frustrated” at not only how long CBA discussions have dragged on but at the NRL’s lack of transparency and their attempt to paint players as greedy. Trust is at an all-time low among players after the NRL unilaterally announced the salary cap and then sent a proposal that would have players “track backwards” on a per-player basis. Where is the NRL at? The NRL appears to be playing hardball despite the players claiming they will “not be bullied”. The league appears to be of the belief that the salary cap can be dictated from HQ and that its offering to players is fair. The league is firm in its view that players will not be worse off on a per-player basis under the proposals it has put forward. The NRL is of the view that they have prioritised reaching an agreement on the CBA despite bargaining having not officially started nearly 12 months after the NRL said they wanted a CBA agreed, and three months after the last CBA expired. ARLC Chairman Peter V’Landys said at the time of the salary cap announcement, “we wanted to give certainty to the players and clubs”. What do the clubs think? The clubs are, in principle and in their majority, supportive of the players. They are generally happy with the proposed grant offering put forward by the NRL but have always maintained that no agreement on grants will be reached outside of the context of the CBA negotiations, something the NRL tried to do last February when they attempted to divorce the two negotiations. They have supported players in their players’ refusal to deal with NRL Media. What is the timeline for this to be resolved? There is no timeline. Once bargaining begins, the shortest period of time in reaching an agreement would be two weeks so there remains a possibility, in theory, of a CBA being agreed to by the start of the season. One club boss, though, believes that scenario is highly unlikely.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/25/nrl-and-players-remain-a-long-way-from-peace-in-protracted-pay-dispute;guardian;sports;1422

Supermarkets have said it's nothing out of the ordinary.

When asked why and when exactly Easter egg sales began, if there have been complaints and what sales figures have been like, Sainsbury's said: ""Each year we stock some seasonal products in advance of the main holiday period. This is because some customers like to buy gifts and longer life items in plenty of time, or treat themselves early.""

Tesco too said the reason was because consumers like to buy ahead of time.

""It's a few weeks until customers are able to choose from our full range of Easter products,"" a spokesperson said. ""However, we know some of our customers like to buy their eggs early, so we have started selling a small selection in some of our stores.""

Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, 21, was found guilty earlier this week of killing 21-year-old Thomas Roberts in Bournemouth, Dorset, last year.

He will serve a minimum of 29 years.

Mr Roberts had been acting as a ""peacemaker"" after his friend James Medway got into an argument with Abdulrahimzai over an e-scooter that was left outside a Subway sandwich shop in March.

Mr Roberts slapped Abdulrahimzai in the face during the 24-second confrontation.

Abdulrahimzai then revealed a knife he had hidden between the two pairs of trousers he was wearing and stabbed Mr Roberts twice before running away into nearby woodland.

He then buried the knife before burning the trousers, jacket and an Afghan flag he was wearing as a scarf.

Abdulrahimzai claimed he fled his home country of Afghanistan after he was tortured by the Taliban and his parents were killed.

After the verdict was delivered, the court heard how he had previously been convicted of murdering two people in Serbia, as well as a related firearm offence.

4682;4682;Andrew Tate isn’t feminism’s inadvertent bastard child. He’s sexism’s last gasp | Martha Gill;2023-01-08T06:30:40Z;['Martha Gill'];['Feminism', 'Women', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'Andrew Tate'];;"Is feminism ultimately to blame for the rise of Andrew Tate, the “trillionaire” guru and self-identified misogynist who once claimed women should “bear responsibility” for being sexually assaulted and who last week was arrested in Romania on charges of people trafficking? Is it western strides in equality that have pushed young men to join his 4 million followers online? Plenty of people think so. “His appeal should… be seen as a leading indicator of some of the genuine disorientation being felt by millions of boys and men,” writes the author Richard Reeves, a feeling, he says, which results from “the extraordinary successes of the women’s movement”. Boys are being overtaken by girls in education. Men no longer know who they should be. “In an age where any and all masculinity is pathological,” writes Patrick Hess at the Critic, “some boys and young men will find Tate’s brand of male chauvinism alluring.” “You don’t like that young men flock to Andrew Tate?” read a popular tweet on this subject. “Inspire greatness in them rather than heaping constant shame and disappointment on their heads.” Does misogynistic anger among young men in the west correlate to their new economic and social status? Is Tate equality’s bastard child? It’s a theory. Just one problem. Take a look at the world’s more entrenched patriarchies – those countries where men still unequivocally hold the whip hand – and you’ll find just as many angry young men flocking to misogynist ideologues at the merest glimmerings of feminist progress. Except they’ll be angrier. And there will be more of them. Take South Korea, where women are still paid a third less than men, giving it the worst gender pay gap in the rich world, and where a culture of harassment includes hidden cameras in female lavatories. Feeble government efforts to address this in the mid-2010s were enough to spark a huge anti-feminist movement among the country’s young men. In a 2019 survey, 60% of men in their 20s said discrimination against women was not a serious problem, while two-thirds thought unfairness to men was the big issue. The country’s anti-feminist leader, Yoon Suk-yeol, was propelled to victory last year on the votes of young men. He had promised to enhance punishments for “false accusations” of sexual harassment and blamed feminism for low birthrates. Or take Slovakia. It ranks a weak 24th out of 27 EU countries in terms of gender equality. Women there earn up to a quarter less than men. Yet it is also the EU country with the highest proportion of young males opposed to advances in women’s rights. Feminism has made snail-like progress in Slovakia compared with the EU average. But Slovak men are the angriest in the bloc. In India, there is a thriving men’s rights movement, born out of opposition in 2000 to laws that protected women from violence over dowry disputes. Since then, young men have flocked to the movement, fuelled by what they see as “gender-biased laws”. This is a country where female infanticide is still a major problem and female literacy lags far behind. Yet young men feel hard done by. Could it be that it is not actual unfairness but perceived unfairness that is making these young men angry? And that this perception is fed directly by the prevalence of sexist narratives in the society in which they live? Might that be why anti-feminist backlashes are worse in more extreme patriarchies? Could it in fact be the west’s residual sexism, rather than its relative equality, which is to blame for the popularity of people such as Tate?
That would make sense in a historical context. Resistance to equality movements is generally strongest when they are starting out. Think of the reaction to anti-racist policies in the 1950s and then think of the reaction today, when most right-thinking people have been won over to the idea racism is deplorable. Tate is sexism’s last gasp. Not feminism’s bastard child. And are we really in the grips of a “masculinity crisis”? I only note that a masculinity crisis has been diagnosed wherever and whenever women fight against sexism. Historians have located a “masculinity crisis” as far back as the 1880s, when roles available to women widened. Masculinity crises erupted in the 1960s and 1970s. The masculinity crisis was a central motif in 1980s and 90s British cinema and in China the government has denoted a “masculinity crisis” among boys and men. (In China, women in their 20s still face huge pressure to leave the workforce and get married.) It is true that women in the west are overtaking men in some subjects in the relative meritocracy of formal education. Pay gaps have closed for younger employees. But young males can still look ahead and anticipate a brighter future than young women. They can look to their 30s and 40s and anticipate parenting pay gaps in which they will probably be the victors; they can look at the tiny proportion of women at the top of most career ladders and predict a more successful 50s and 60s. Men do not, in fact, lack for role models: they have entire libraries, film archives and the leaders of almost every country and profession. We worry about young male “status loss”. We rarely ask how young women – barraged by street harassment, low rape convictions and a TV schedule full of dead, sexy female bodies – feel about their own “status”. Why does Tate really appeal to young men? Well, like everyone else, young men are susceptible to the idea that they are special, deserving and that others are to blame for their problems. And like everyone else, they will behave as badly as society permits. The west is still replete with sexist narratives. Tate is not a symptom of too much equality, but too much patriarchy. The real work is getting rid of it. ● Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

5804;5804;Takeaways in poor parts of England more likely to fail on hygiene;2023-01-01T15:21:04Z;['Carmen Aguilar García', 'Pamela Duncan'];['Inequality', 'Social exclusion', 'Poverty', 'Food & drink industry', 'Food safety', 'Food', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Hygiene', 'Hospitality industry'];;"Takeaways in poorer parts of England are twice as likely to need improvement in food hygiene as those in wealthier areas, with as many as one in five in some parts of the UK falling below required standards, according to Guardian analysis. Almost one in 10 takeaways in England’s poorest neighbourhoods did not satisfactorily comply with food hygiene standards, compared with just one in 24 in the richest, according to an analysis of almost 600,000 inspection reports at the beginning of December, 64,000 of them takeaways. Data from the Food Standards Agency shows that one in 16 takeaways across the UK fell below legally required standards at the beginning of December. In England the worst records were in more deprived local authorities, including Halton in Cheshire, where one in five takeaways had a rating of two or less – meaning they did not satisfactorily meet food hygiene standards at the time of their last inspection, while it was close to that level in the north London boroughs of Enfield (18.4%) and Waltham Forest (17.7%). One in five Aberdeen takeaways fell below equivalent Scottish standards, as did one in six in Edinburgh.
In total, almost 16,700 food providers across the UK require improvements, including almost 4,000 takeaways, 4,500 restaurants and 1,200 pubs. The data also revealed 530 care settings that did not meet requirements, including 300 childcare providers, among them nurseries, playgroups, breakfast clubs, primary schools and other educational settings. Establishments providing for older, vulnerable groups were also among those deemed unsafe by inspectors, including 180 care homes and at least 15 hospitals. The Food Standards Agency rates all establishments where the public can buy or eat food with a score from zero to five. Zero means urgent upgrades are required, while a two or lower means some improvements are needed. A business with a score of three or higher complies satisfactorily with the law. The food consultant James Miller said takeaways faced higher challenges when it came to meeting food hygiene standards. “They deal with more demand than restaurants and tend to have less staff, who are also busier and less trained in hygiene documentation. That makes it more difficult for them to keep up with the dozens of daily records required,” he said.
Takeaways were also more likely to have a language barrier, said Miller, making it more difficult to understand the requirements. And they were also facing the wider challenges of the food industry. “There is a backlog with the inspections due to Covid. Brexit has had an impact on recruiting workers from abroad, and now the cost of living crisis,” he said. “But businesses should not forget that a good hygiene rating would bring more customers to them.” It would appear that the public agree: a survey of 2,000 adults carried out by the Food Standards Agency in 2020 found that 82% of the respondents would not consider buying food from a business with a score lower than three or four. Public sentiment is also swaying food order and delivery companies, which are displaying takeaways’ food safety ratings with greater prominence and punishing those that do not comply with the standards. Since 2019 the platform Just Eat has refused to host takeaways that attracted a zero rating in their last inspection and has reportedly invested £1m in support to restaurants with a score lower than three – the threshold for a pass under the food hygiene standards. Its main rivals, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, appear to have followed suit: a spot check for zero-rated restaurants showed up no results on either site. These kinds of innovations, as well as a requirement for restaurants to display their latest food standards rating on their premises, make a difference, experts say, as customers are increasingly savvy. Responding to the finding that Enfield had the second-lowest compliance rate in England, the council leader, Nesil Caliskan, said the the local authority would take appropriate action and prosecute when necessary. Scott Arthur, the Edinburgh city council environment convener, said ratings in the city had improved, with “the pass rate currently at 89%” in November for all types of establishments. “A business with an ‘improvement required’ status is not necessarily a risk to public health,” he said. “Environmental health staff take appropriate enforcement action, including closure of food premises, where there is an imminent risk to public health.” Jesse Williams, the Food Standards Agency’s head of food hygiene ratings, said: “All food businesses are able to achieve the top rating of ‘five – very good’ by doing what is required by food law.” The rating criteria are the same for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but Scotland uses a different system, which classes food providers that do not meet the hygiene requirements with an “improvement required” grade. A spokesperson for Food Standards Scotland said: “The ‘pass’ standard is set to represent a single level of compliance that is satisfactory in terms of consumer expectations and also an enforcement outcome.” Each local authority is responsible for ranking food establishments and planning the inspections in their areas. The time between inspections can vary from six months for those businesses that pose higher risk to two years or more for low- or very low-risk businesses. In between inspections, local authorities may monitor businesses in different ways.";https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2023/jan/01/takeaways-in-poor-parts-of-england-more-likely-to-fail-on-hygiene;guardian;politics;5804
8159;8159;First Tory MP publicly calls for Nadhim Zahawi to go - 'too many unanswered questions' over tax affairs;Tuesday 24 January 2023 12:19, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['nadhim zahawi'];['questions', 'mr', 'calls', 'minister', 'nadhim', 'paid', 'investigation', 'tax', 'tory', 'party', 'sunak', 'mp', 'zahawi', 'publicly', 'affairs', 'told', 'unanswered'];"A Conservative former minister has become the first Tory MP to publicly call for Nadhim Zahawi to stand down as party chairman.

Caroline Nokes said there are ""too many unanswered questions"" over the former chancellor's multi-million pound tax dispute and that he is ""leading too many front pages"".

""When you become the story it's a distraction from anything else the government is trying to do,"" she told TalkTV.

""And I really think in order to get this cleared up Nadhim should stand aside and let the investigation run its course.""

Politics news - latest: Tory party turning on Zahawi

On Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi but resisted calls to sack him, saying he retained ""confidence"" in his colleague.

The inquiry by new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus is expected to focus on whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his prior tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty.

Questions were first raised about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs last summer when he was running to be party leader, but the senior Tory MP insisted at the time that he was ""clearly being smeared"" and had always paid his taxes.

Other Tories are privately turning on Mr Zahawi, with one former minister telling Sky News: ""He's toast.""

Opposition parties are calling for him to be sacked while Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the Civil Service, told Sky News Mr Zahawi is in a ""pretty perilous position"" as several facts need clarifying - including the length of his tax investigation and what he told Mr Sunak about it.

Earlier, Home Office minister Chris Philp suggested the PM was not aware Mr Zahawi had paid a penalty to the taxman, or of any prior investigation into him, when he appointed him as party chairman.

Mr Sunak defended Mr Zahawi in the House of Commons last week, but this was before the cabinet minister released a statement admitting he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov - the polling company he co-founded - an error he noted was ""careless not deliberate"".

Asked today if the PM was confident that Mr Zahawi had always told the truth about his tax affairs, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The investigation looks at any potential breaches of the ministerial code.

""As you'll know, I won't get into being prescriptive about how the advice goes about ascertaining that.""

The spokesman could not say when the inquiry would return its findings but insisted the investigation will be done ""swiftly"".

Sources close to Mr Zahawi are maintaining he is ""absolutely not standing down"", and he refused to answer questions on his political future when approached by journalists this morning.

In a statement last night he said: ""I am confident I acted properly throughout and look forward to answering any and all specific questions in a formal setting to Sir Laurie.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124120238/http://news.sky.com/story/first-tory-mp-publicly-calls-for-nadhim-zahawi-to-go-too-many-unanswered-questions-over-tax-affairs-12794069;skynews;politics;2250
5219;5219;Australian coal industry says China market matters less than before, even if import ban ends;2023-01-05T05:24:39Z;['Peter Hannam'];['Coal', 'Australia news', 'Energy', 'Environment', 'Fossil fuels', 'Australian economy', 'China', 'Mining', 'Business'];;"Australia would benefit from a lifting of China’s ban on its coal but any gains would likely be modest as miners have largely redirected supplies elsewhere, analysts said. Shares of ASX-listed coalminers shot up on Wednesday after reports China was considering lifting its restrictions on coal imports from Australia from April. The ban was imposed in mid-2020 amid deteriorating bilateral relations that have since begun to improve.
Investors pared back their expectations of a significant boon for exporters on Thursday. Whitehaven Coal shares ended the day down 1.5%, while New Hope fell 0.7% and Yancoal closed flat. The overall market rose 0.6%. The Albanese government said the resumption of normal trade across the board between Australia and China was “in both countries’ best interests”. “The Australian coal industry has been successful in finding alternative markets,” a spokesperson for the resource minister, Madeleine King, said.
China-Australia relations have warmed since the change of the federal government in May, with the foreign minister, Penny Wong, last month making the first visit to Beijing by an Australian minister in three years. China has its own motivation to resume coal imports after a severe drought reduced hydropower last year, resulting in a depletion of stockpiles of the fossil fuel. Beijing’s imposition of restrictions on commodity imports from Australia – such as coal, wine and barley, but not iron ore – resulted in exporters finding alternative markets. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Ian Macfarlane, said the industry would welcome any easing of restrictions and would be keen to tap any revived export opportunities.
“[I]t is worth noting that increased exports to other countries, particularly India and [elsewhere] in Asia, over the last two years have seen long-term relationships built with these countries,” Macfarlane said. “These alternative markets to China are now seen by Queensland coal exporters as stable, long-term customers for Queensland coal.” The chief economist at Betashares, David Bassanese, said China may be reconsidering its ban on Australian coal because of ongoing uncertainty about global supplies given the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions on energy exporter Russia. Since banning coal from Australia, China has had to source supplies from more distant sources or increase its reliance of lower-quality coal from Chinese mines. A resumption of coal imports from Australia “should help our coal export prices to a degree, as the price premium for better quality coal that Australian tends to produce is enhanced”, Bassanese said.
According to the government’s latest quarterly report on resources and energy exports, shipments of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking should rise from 164m tonnes in 2021-22 to 163m tonnes by 2023-24. Soaring prices meant export revenues for the material tripled in 2021-22 to $68b. Thermal coal, burned mostly in power stations, has been more disrupted by the sanctions on Russia, with global supply chains “now longer and less efficient than they were in 2019”, the report said.
“High grade thermal coal (mostly originating from Australia and Russia) has been particularly affected by longer freight distances, and the price premium for high grade coal grew notably larger in 2022,” it said. Thermal coal prices are likely to slide from historic highs of US$360 (A$523) a tonne in 2020 to about US$200/t (A$293) by 2024, the government report said.
The increasing difficult to obtain finance and insurance for coal – particularly as investors shy away from fossil fuels – means the sector could be in “a permanent higher price phase”, it said. “This is expected to reduce its competitiveness relative to other energy sources over the longer term.” Australia exported $13.7bn worth of coal to China in 2019, almost $10bn of which was metallurgical coal. Analysis by data firm EnergyQuest has found Australia’s exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were unchanged in 2022. Higher prices meant revenues jumped 86% in the year to about $92.8bn. “The huge growth in export revenue in 2022 is set to drive strong growth in taxation and royalties paid by Australian LNG projects, as well as helping pay for Australia’s imports,” EnergyQuest’s chief executive, Graeme Bethune, said. The exports placed Australia among the top three LNG exporters, with Qatar and the US. LNG exports from Western Australia and the Northern Territory were up 2.1%, while those from Queensland – which make up slightly less than a third of the total – fell 3.3%, EnergyQuest said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/05/china-signals-it-may-lift-ban-on-australian-coal-but-any-benefits-likely-modest-after-exporters-switch-to-other-markets;guardian;business & economy;5219
1760;1760;Rishi Sunak asks ethics adviser to look into Nadhim Zahawi tax case;2023-01-23T13:54:22Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;"Rishi Sunak has told his ethics adviser to investigate suggestions that Nadhim Zahawi was forced to pay a fine and millions of pounds in unpaid taxes to HMRC, as the prime minister acknowledged there were “questions that need answering”. In a move that will place Zahawi, the Conservative party chair, under further intense scrutiny but allows the government to deflect immediate calls for him to be sacked, Sunak reiterated the importance of “integrity and accountability”. He said his ethics adviser, the newly appointed Laurie Magnus, had been asked to “get to the bottom of everything, to investigate the matter fully and establish all the facts and provide advice to me” on whether Zahawi broke the ministerial code. Zahawi had “agreed with that approach and has agreed to fully cooperate with that investigation”, Sunak said, stressing that “clearly in this case there are questions that need answering”. During the investigation, Zahawi will remain chair of the Conservatives, a job that over the next few months will involve masterminding the party’s strategy in the runup to the local elections this spring. Defending the decision not to suspend Zahawi while Magnus’s inquiry is carried out, Sunak said: “I think it is important we do these things professionally. Integrity and accountability’s really important to me, but it’s also important we do these things properly.” He said he would “decide on the appropriate next steps” after seeing Magnus’s report. The approach is similar to that taken by Downing Street after accusations of bullying were made against the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, which Raab denied. Raab has been allowed to remain in post while an independent investigation continues. However, the former Cabinet Office minister Gavin Williamson stood down when a formal complaint about similar behaviour, which he also denied, was made to parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme. Zahawi has faced mounting calls to quit since the Guardian was told he had agreed to pay a penalty to HMRC as part of a seven-figure settlement over his tax affairs. He has not denied that he was under investigation by the tax collection agency while chancellor, when he was in charge of the nation’s finances including taxation. Labour is pressing Zahawi to reveal when the payment to HMRC was made, and address the estimate that he owed £3.7m but was charged a 30% penalty – taking the total sum paid to £4.8m. The dispute between Zahawi and HMRC was the result of a non-payment of capital gains tax due after the sale of shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded. Having spent months refusing to answer questions about the unpaid taxes, Zahawi admitted over the weekend that he had paid HMRC what “was due” after it “disagreed about the exact allocation” of shares in YouGov. He said the team that looked at his case found it was a “careless – and not deliberate” – error.
Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said what had already been revealed about Zahawi merited his dismissal. He called on Sunak to “show some leadership” and sack the Conservative chair, telling broadcasters: “This is a test of the prime minister. He promised us – his first words – integrity and accountability. Well, if those words mean anything, the prime minister should sack him … If he doesn’t, it’s just going to be further evidence, I think, for the British public, as to just how weak this prime minister really is.” Some Tories have also piled on the pressure. The backbencher Peter Aldous said on Sunday: “Really you shouldn’t have a situation where the chancellor, his private advisers, have or are negotiating a settlement with HMRC. That’s not acceptable.” The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith urged Zahawi to “just clear it up” given the remaining questions the minister has refused to answer about whether he incurred a penalty, when the payment to HMRC was made and the size of it. The former minister Tim Loughton said Sunak would “take the appropriate action” if further damaging details emerged about Zahawi’s tax affairs, and said it would have been “more helpful” if the Tory chair had explained himself “more fully rather earlier on”.
Fresh allegations about Zahawi continued to emerge after the weekend, with the Times reporting that when he was a business minister, Zahawi wrongly told officials during the Greensill lobbying scandal that he had not exchanged WhatsApp messages with the former prime minister David Cameron that later turned out to have been deleted from his phone. Zahawi has declined to comment on the claim. Sunak still has confidence in Zahawi and hopes the investigation is finished “as quickly as possible”, No 10 said. The prime minister’s spokesperson claimed Sunak was not aware that Zahawi had paid a penalty to HMRC when he told MPs in the Commons last week his colleague had “addressed the matter in full”, adding that when Sunak appointed Zahawi he was assured by officials there were “no outstanding issues”. The investigation into Zahawi’s behaviour will cover his declarations, but Downing Street said it was not being “prescriptive” about the remit, meaning it could also cover any false claims made by Zahawi, legal threats, the missing messages with Cameron and his time as chancellor.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/23/rishi-sunak-asks-ethics-adviser-look-into-nadhim-zahawi-case;guardian;politics;1760
3743;3743;Coastal residents fear ‘hideous’ seawalls will block waterfront views;2023-01-13T11:00:13Z;['Geoff Dembicki'];['Sea level', 'Environment', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'Climate crisis', 'US news'];;"There were more than a few issues with a recent federal plan to wall Miami off from the dangers of climate change. The $5bn proposal involved building a massive concrete seawall in the fragile marine ecosystem of Biscayne Bay. It included using taxpayer money to elevate private waterfront mansions, while constructing a wall through the middle of downtown and sometimes low-income neighborhoods. But the idea of an imposing seawall was also – in the eyes of many residents – unforgivably ugly. Miami’s Downtown Development Authority, which was reportedly alarmed by the prospect of hulking concrete slabs, brought in an architectural firm that created renderings portraying the seawall plan as an almost dystopian vision of the future, featuring grey walls defaced with graffiti reading “Berlin” circling a moat of dirty water. That helped galvanize an opposition which became so intense that now the project is going back to the drawing board. It might seem frivolous to focus on the aesthetics of a project that proponents hope will protect Miami from future storm surges that could flatten homes and kill thousands of people – a danger growing more dire each day due to climate change. But the residents, environmentalists, businesspeople and politicians battling to amend this recent seawall proposal see the fight in existential terms: they are trying to preserve the soul of the city. “Miami is all about our connection to the water,” said Rachel Silverstein, executive director of the environmental research and advocacy group Miami Waterkeeper. “At what point are people not going to want to live here any more because of the solution they’re proposing, which is so destructive to our community and our identity.”
Up and down US coastlines, cities as diverse as New York, Charleston, Norfolk, Houston and San Francisco are staring down the same dilemma: tall concrete walls could technically protect homes and property from seas rising because of climate change, but the proposals are so potentially hideous that some locals are rejecting them. “The fights are around many of the same issues,” said Billy Fleming, a director at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design who specializes in climate change adaptation. “It’s about people worrying about what these seawall proposals could do to the visual character of a place.” Coastal communities have for decades ignored warnings about climate change, constructing more and more buildings and homes in flood-exposed areas even as the dangers rise. And now that coastal dwellers are seeing the drastic solutions required to keep them safe, potentially turning their charming cities ugly, people are snapping to attention.
That’s what happened when the US army corps of engineers, a branch of the military that is also behind the Miami plans, proposed a $1.1bn seawall to protect Charleston, South Carolina, a city constructed on marshes and tidal creeks whose downtown is so vulnerable to storm surge and sea-level rise that the risks are often described as “existential”. The plan is causing local backlash because it has the potential, in the words of the Post and Courier columnist Robert Behre, to be “pretty hideous”. He was referring to renderings produced by the city’s Civic Design Center, which showed a thoroughfare named Lockwood Boulevard blocked off from scenic views of the Ashley River by a tall concrete wall. A South Carolina commentator named Will Folks compared it to the Berlin Wall, writing earlier this year that “one of the most gorgeous cities in the world is on the verge of erecting an unsightly Eastern Bloc edifice in the hopes of containing rising floodwaters.” Local policymakers are also expressing reservations about the project’s visual impact. “Unless it’s drastically amended, I don’t think it’s going anywhere,” councilman Mike Seekings said in July, reportedly referring in part to fears that a concrete wall could ruin the city’s iconic seaside vistas.
“I’d say aesthetics are almost core to the debate,” said Belvin Olasov, co-director of an advocacy group called the Charleston Climate Coalition. “In Charleston you can just walk by the sea, that’s sort of a traditional connection, so the idea of blocking that off with a giant concrete wall is objectionable to many people.” But he pointed to other problems with the proposal. The seawall wouldn’t protect the historically Black neighborhood of Rosemont due in part to the high cost of extending the wall that far north in the city – potentially it could even make flooding there worse by blocking drainage ditches and creating what would essentially be a bathtub for rain. That is also a concern in Norfolk, Virginia, where the army corps is proposing a $1.6bn seawall that could protect the climate-vulnerable city from a hurricane-caused storm surge. But some locals fear water blocked by the seawall might merely be redirected south to the city of Portsmouth, the majority of whose residents are Black.
The ugliness and social inequity of such proposals may actually come from the same root cause – a mandate governing the operations of the US army corps to secure the highest value properties for the most efficient possible expenditure. That’s how you get unsightly concrete proposals that fail to protect an area’s most vulnerable residents, Fleming said. “Any piece of coastal infrastructure has to go through the army corps’ permitting and approval process and they will never build anything other than what gives them the highest marginal benefit, and aesthetics don’t factor into that,” Fleming said. The army corps did not respond to a request for comment. In coastal communities facing heavy climate impacts, some locals are proposing an alternative: nature-based solutions such as restoring barrier islands, oyster beds and mangroves that more unobtrusively allow cities to coexist with water, and better protect lower-income areas that are often left out of discussions around climate adaptation.
These measures “can address our nation’s disproportionate flood risk gap and start to fix the systemic inequalities and systematic racism of the past”, reads a 2021 letter to the US army corps of engineers signed by more than 100 environmental groups. Those are the types of solutions that Miami Waterkeeper and others in south Florida are advocating for as an alternative to 20ft concrete walls buttressing the coastline. This fall the army corps began reconsidering its original proposal. “They’re sort of rethinking everything now, and doing that with more public input,” Silverstein said. But that pushes back the timeline for protecting Miami, she said, potentially resulting in nothing being built until the 2030s, while the risk of catastrophic storm surge only gets worse and worse.
“We are facing a very real existential crisis from sea level rise and climate change,” she said. “Miami 50 years from now is not going to look like Miami today, we have to acknowledge that and plan for that.” Despite public opposition in Miami and other cities, the preferred strategy from the army corps and federal policymakers is still to build hulking fortresses – such as the $29bn project it’s proposing in Galveston, Texas – literally walling off cities from the sea.
But in an era of escalating climate disasters, that may be exactly what some communities need. When planners in the 1940s proposed a flood wall for the Missouri town of Cape Girardeau, which sits alongside the Mississippi River, locals objected that it would be an ugly, tourism-killing disaster that could even trap “offensive odors” within the city. When the river swelled five years ago and came within a few feet of breaching the wall, the town’s newspaper ran an editorial “appreciating the floodwall, and leaders who built it”, arguing that “without it, we probably wouldn’t have a Main Street lined with businesses today”. It added: “We tip our caps to those leaders from previous generations who pushed for the wall and insisted on its completion.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/13/us-cities-ugly-seawalls-climate-crisis-miami;guardian;environment;3743
2960;2960;Shooting at Martin Luther King Day party leaves eight wounded in Florida;2023-01-17T15:32:03Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['US news', 'Florida', 'California', 'Gun crime'];;"A shooting which erupted on a packed Martin Luther King Jr Day block party in Florida and left eight people wounded late on Monday was the 30th mass shooting in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Authorities said one person was critically hurt in the shooting during the holiday event in Fort Pierce. Seven others were also shot and wounded, and at least four more hurt in the panic that followed.
“As the shots rang out, people were just running in all directions,” Brian Hester, chief deputy of the local sheriff’s office, said at a news briefing. “There were people laying behind cars, laying behind anything they could lay behind. It was kind of hard to tell who was a victim and who was just hiding at that point.” The MLK Day party in the city’s Ilous Ellis Park was billed as a family event with a DJ and live music, dance performances, a car show and children’s activities. In a cellphone video taken by a witness, families are seen dancing by their cars as shots are fired, with parents then taking children by the hand and scrambling to safety. Hester said the shooting appeared to follow a dispute between two groups. He added that at least two weapons were fired in the US’s latest mass shooting, which is defined as a shooting with at least four people killed or wounded, not including attackers. “So many innocent people that were injured or hurt were not part of the disagreement,” he said. “It’s really unfortunate, and it’s sad that during a celebration of someone who represented peace and equality, a disagreement results in a use of guns and violence.” The Florida shooting came hours after a 17-year-old woman and her six-month-old baby were among six killed in another mass gun attack on Monday, in Goshen, California. Officials there suspect the “horrific massacre” in the early hours was related to drug cartel activity after a search of the residence by deputies executing a narcotics warrant last week. “We believe this was not a random act of violence. We believe this was a targeted family,” the local sheriff, Mike Boudreaux, told reporters. Boudreaux said deputies were called to the residence at about 3.30am on Monday and found two victims dead in the street, with four more in the house. They included a man who was still alive but died later in hospital. Several survivors were led from the house, the sheriff said. Goshen is a semi-rural community of about 3,000 residents, 35 miles south-east of Fresno in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. Boudreaux said gang violence was not uncommon in the area, but that a massacre targeting an infant showed a heartless level of brutality. At least 1,943 people have died in the US from gun violence so far this year. Of those killed, 88 were aged 17 or under, with another 187 minors injured, the Gun Violence Archive reported. The latest shootings come as gun reform advocates fear the new Republican majority in the House will try to stall progress made by Joe Biden’s signing last summer of a bipartisan bill strengthening firearms restrictions, after mass killings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York. Even if Senate Democrats manage to pass additional gun regulations, the newly elected House speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy, will be able to block those bills from receiving a vote in the lower chamber. “I do believe that there’s still opportunity regardless of the fact that obviously the House is under Republican control now,” Zeenat Yahya, director of policy for the gun safety group March for Our Lives, said. “We want to be able to make sure that gun violence prevention is still at the forefront of a conversation, and we’re playing an active role at the federal level.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/17/florida-shooting-martin-luther-king-day-party-fort-pierce;guardian;entertainment & culture;2960

The fee is believed to be more than Barcelona paid Manchester City when they broke the existing women’s transfer record last summer with their recruitment of the England midfielder Keira Walsh for about £400,000. Russo, who scored four goals for the Lionesses at last summer’s Euros, including an audacious backheel against Sweden in the semi-final, is out of contract at the end of the season. United are likely to reject the offer even though they risk losing her for free with no agreement reached after talks with the 23-year-old over an extension.
Arsenal are without the Euro 2022 golden boot winner, Beth Mead, and the WSL’s record goalscorer, Vivianne Miedema, for the rest of the season because of ACL injuries and the manager, Jonas Eidevall, has said: “I would be disappointed if we can’t bring in a prolific goalscorer in addition to the signings already. That should be a really important priority for us in this window with the number and the level of games we are playing.” United are top of the WSL, level on points with second-place Chelsea and three clear of Arsenal, who have a game in hand. In the FA Cup Arsenal, the 14-times winners, will play away to Chelsea, the holders, in the fifth round.

2607;2607;Blue skies and 18C water: why surfing in southern Spain is the perfect winter escape;2023-01-19T07:00:03Z;['Sam Haddad'];['Surfing holidays', 'Andalucia holidays', 'Spain holidays', 'Travel', 'Europe holidays', 'Winter sun'];;"The sun is blindingly bright, the air balmy, the sea a clear turquoise-blue and 18C, with no suspicious murky stripes of pollution. Paddling out into the Atlantic from El Palmar, on south-west Spain’s Costa de la Luz, is a far cry from a January surf experience in the UK.
I’ve come to Andalucía to escape the bleakness of the British winter with a stay at The Sea Retreat, a new surf camp on the coast between Cádiz and Tarifa. Set up by Marina Nieves and her husband Callum Jelley in the laid-back community of El Palmar – the name means “palm grove”, it caters for beginners and intermediates, with a maximum of eight adults staying in the surf house at any one time (some rooms can accommodate extra children too). Callum, the only British voice I’ll hear all week, is from Yorkshire and Marina is from Seville, though has been coming to El Palmar with her family since she was little, as evidenced by how well she surfs, with enviable style and grace whatever the wave conditions. El Palmar has a long, wild stretch of beach and gets 300-plus days of sunshine a year. It’s a mix of low-rise homes, cafes and bars with painted driftwood signage, surf schools and small farms. There are no house numbers or running water; instead residents use wells and bring in drinking water, but this being 2023 and the era of teletrabajo (remote working), there is of course wifi. The Sea Retreat is based in a house just three minutes’ walk from the beach, with a mix of twin and double rooms. I wake to the sound of roosters crowing and at night the sky is flush with stars. There’s a garden and barbecue, and a chef prepares healthy food, from tofu noodles to Spanish tortilla each evening.
In the height of summer, the waves here are not good for surfing, and El Palmar gets so rammed with holidaymakers that many locals leave town and rent out their homes. According to Callum, January and February are the best months here – the weather usually mild as opposed to scorching, the vegetation its most lush and verdant, and the waves plentiful. Data from surf forecasting app Magic Seaweed suggests El Palmar has rideable waves 80% of the time in January (at my home break on the south coast of England, the figure is 29%). And while I am still wearing a wetsuit, it’s not a thick one, which makes paddling a lot easier. While some cafes and restaurants are closed during my stay, there is plenty of life, from thirtysomethings carving past on surfskate boards and teens doing wheelies on motocross bikes to older couples on touring bikes and Germans of all ages in campervans, living their best #vanlife.
The outdoor wooden deck of Homies, my favourite coffee spot of the week, is always full of people smiling into the sunshine as if, like me, they can’t quite believe they’re cheating winter, and enjoying food and drink at much more affordable prices than back home. The camp package includes one surf lesson a day of around two hours with Marina, and a guided sunset surf, which is a real highlight. Surf equipment can be borrowed anytime, so I do this a few times, getting out of the water when I could no longer move my arms rather than because I was cold.
We mostly surf at El Palmar: it’s a beach break with long whitewater rides for beginners and good conditions for progression for those wanting to improve in green, unbroken waves. On my trip there’s just one other couple – from Sardinia – but guests are generally a mix of Spanish and English, with a range of abilities, and Marina is a calm and patient coach for all levels. On the technical side, she helps the beginners with their pop-ups, and all of us with our wave selection and timing. I learn to position myself to catch the most powerful part of the wave, but she’s also really useful on the mental side. Surfing is a humbling sport, and when I’m feeling out of my comfort zone, the internal chatter can be overwhelming.
On a couple of mornings, the waves are too fast and powerful at El Palmar, so we head to a more sheltered spot nearby that is popular with longboarders. (Marina and Callum ask me not to mention its location, so it doesn’t get overrun. This isn’t a problem at El Palmar which has miles of space and plenty of peaks to surf on.) For these days, I borrow a mid-length board made by a local shaper, and it rides like a dream. I sit in the lineup – the point where the waves begin to break – with a backdrop of sweeping dunes and hills covered in umbrella-shaped pines, the outline of Africa just visible in the distance. I don’t want these sessions to ever end. One day we go for lunch at Peña El Atún, a relaxed seafood restaurant in nearby Barbate which specialises in tuna caught using the traditional Andalucían method of almadraba – using net traps. The freshest tuna I’ve ever eaten is offered as part of a menu including sashimi, tacos, tomato stews, and salmorejo, a thicker and creamier version of gazpacho. The bill comes to less than €20 a head.
On the way back in the van, we pass another secret longboard spot, the beginnings of new bike path which will one day link this section of coastline to Athens, and some graffiti protesting at hotels’ overuse of water in a region where the resource is under increasing pressure. Another day, we hire bikes and ride to the north-west end of El Palmar beach, passing tufts of cane and pounding Atlantic waves, a picturesque stone observation tower and land slated for a controversial new hotel and beach club. Compared with much of coastal Spain, this part of the Costa de la Luz is noticeably undeveloped, though this may not last. Marina and Callum believe there is a way to welcome visitors responsibly without harming El Palmar’s distinctive character and precious natural environment. Besides only hosting up to eight adult guests at a time, they encourage visitors to travel by train, and during the sunsets when we’re not surfing, we do beach cleans, strolling along the shore in the evening light picking up any litter we find. Steering guests towards off-season travel is another way to reduce the impact of tourism – and this is a lot easier in places where the weather is mild. And where the waves are this good. The trip was provided by The Sea Retreat, whose six-night trips cost £699pp, with full-board, equipment and surf lessons (B&B option £95 a day). Shorter or longer stays and self-catering also available. The nearest station is San Fernando-Bahia Sur, on the line from Seville (from €17.95 return).

Flybe planned to operate hundreds of flights a week

Flybe had previously been pushed into administration in March 2020 with the loss of 2,400 jobs as the COVID-19 pandemic battered large parts of the travel market.

Its business and assets were purchased in 2021 by Thyme Opco, which is linked to US hedge fund Cyrus Capital.

Thyme Opco was renamed Flybe Limited.

It had been based at Birmingham Airport.

On the resumption of its flying operations last April, it planned to operate up to 530 flights a week across 23 routes, serving airports such as Belfast City, Birmingham, East Midlands, Glasgow, Heathrow and Leeds Bradford.

2170;2170;‘We really need this space’: a holistic retreat for black women;2023-01-21T07:00:02Z;['Lola Okolosie'];['Spa breaks', 'Essex holidays', 'Travel', 'United Kingdom holidays', 'Short breaks', 'England holidays', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Women', 'Life and style', 'Race'];;"I had reached the ripe old age of 42 without ever having been on a retreat. But my partner and children were going to remain at home while I, freed from my frantic routine of ferrying the kids around and thinking up healthy meals, was to spend four days trying to relax. Yet, days before departure, I find myself worrying about the backlog of “to dos” I’ll have waiting for me on my return. Rather than ease into the much-needed rest, I start telling myself I can’t afford so much time away. To quell the rising panic, I text Abi Osho, holistic lifestyle coach and creator of Soul Melanin Reconnect Freedom Sista Retreats for black women, warning her that I might not last the full long weekend. Osho sends an information pack. We will have extensive grounds and a swimming pool at our disposal. That sounds nice, I think. Sounds like my weekend will be a type of spa experience. On my taxi ride through the Essex countryside and up a quiet country lane to a substantial coach house in Little Baddow, east of Chelmsford, I’m looking forward to kicking back in saunas, hot tubs and steam rooms, though I’m aware that meals will be fully vegan and there’ll be no alcohol or caffeine. I’ve brought my laptop – spa weekends involve a lot of sitting around, don’t they? There’s a sizeable stone buddha in the front garden, but instead of using it as somewhere to calm my mind and turn my attention inwards, I think about how I’ll catch up on my backlog at some point over the weekend.
When I meet Osho, though, I begin to suspect this won’t be the pampering weekend that the word “retreat” had conjured up. This is confirmed when I join the 12 other – all-female – guests. We sit in a circle in a large open-plan kitchen-diner and Osho asks: “Why are you here?” The women’s answers are varied. Nearly half are dealing with the void left in the wake of a death, or grappling with their mortality after a serious illness, but their answers all share a theme: they are here because they need a safe space. News of the Queen’s death that very same day had added to the atmosphere of reflection. In Osho’s space, we don’t feel any need to temper our conversations about Chris Kaba, the man shot dead by police in London in September, or about the monarchy and its legacies of empire. We are among kin and already it feels as though something substantial is taking root. We are not making adjustments to our way of talking or manner of being in order to slip through everyday interactions. Wellbeing tourism was estimated to be worth £467bn worldwide in 2017. Yet, as Carolyn Kylstra, former editor-in-chief of Self, Condé Nast’s wellness magazine, put it, “Wellness has a race problem.” It is a booming industry that, she notes, caters “almost exclusively” for wealthy white people. But now black practitioners are charting a new way for under-represented communities. It was a desire to support black women – who face stark health inequalities in the UK and worldwide – that led Osho to create her retreats. “I just thought that we really need this space,” Osho tells me. “The journey I wanted to take women on was one of really knowing their self-worth.” She began offering monthly one-day retreats during lockdown in locations such as Broadstairs in Kent, but demand for longer breaks led Osho to introduce weekend retreats.
It is Asantewaa’s first time at one of Osho’s retreats. A complex-needs worker and grandmother from north London, Asantewaa tells me she was drawn to attend because it is a space solely for black women. “As black women there’s things we need to do together as opposed to open it out to the masses,” she says. “When I’m with my sisters, I know they can understand my experiences. Some things don’t have to be spoken.” Nearly all the women attending have grown-up children. A fair few also have grandchildren and most continue to juggle work with caring responsibilities. Outwardly, each woman is the image of perseverance, fortitude and resilience: the archetypal strong black woman. Yet within Osho’s sister circle, they lay bare their vulnerabilities. After dinner that first night, we gather underneath the stars, all barefoot so that we can “ground”. Grounding, a daily element of Osho’s retreats, is the practice of connecting with the charge-carrying ions able to conduct electrical current within soil. We leave feeling revitalised, yet ready for our beds. Activities over the next few days include a sound bath, a crystals and essential oils workshop, and a self-reflection session using an oracle deck. Free from the rules of tarot cards, oracle decks contain images and prompts that lead readers towards self-analysis. Osho explicitly links this to African religious practices that believe the human spirit remains even after death and, crucially, that our ancestors act as mediators in everyday life. Days begin with a 7am stretching routine, then breakfast and a walk. Mid-morning on day two, we head to a nearby wood. Osho says she wants to encourage women to “recognise that these beautiful spaces in nature are also open to us as a people. There can be an invisible awkwardness in woodland spaces, almost like we don’t belong – particularly if you’ve always lived in an urban environment.” Each woman is instructed to find something from the forest floor that signifies her. We tramp through the damp undergrowth and pick fallen leaves, twigs and moss and tell how each item speaks to who we are. Within the circle, women find words to share their grief; one discloses experiences of abuse. As one breaks down in tears, the circle gathers to hold her in her pain. We leave the forest with a sense that in just 12 hours, we have bonded.
Sonia Hines, a “young pensioner” from south London is on her fourth retreat with Osho. After the first, she tells me, she realised she hadn’t been to the beach “for the longest time”. Earlier this year, Hines underwent treatment for breast cancer. “I had this realisation that this is all around me,” she gestures to the open fields. “But I am not going into it. I felt I needed to make memories because I don’t know whether next time I go to the doctor there will be another diagnosis.” For me, Osho’s retreat offers a chance to peel myself away from the frenzy of day-to-day existence. I found space to embrace both the moment and the trust of the women who shared it with me. The spirit of care and openness we quickly establish leaves me with a sense of vitality that comes through feeling connected. The last night of our retreat coincides with a full moon. I have finally abandoned my laptop and the compulsion to be productive. We begin our night by dancing the Electric Slide, and afterwards we build a fire under a 200-year-old oak tree. Osho has instructed each of us to bring two pieces of paper. On one we write what “no longer serves us”, on the other what we are “inviting more of into our lives”: health, acceptance, sisterhood. It is a beautiful closing ceremony and ends with a midnight dip in the cold outdoor pool. After our swim, we return to our fire and sing along to R&B classics. It feels like a homecoming.

1436;1436;Australians urged to ditch ‘tough on crime’ mindset for youth justice as it does not work;2023-01-25T01:00:57Z;['Ben Smee'];['Crime - Australia', 'Queensland', 'Youth justice', 'Queensland politics', 'Australia news', 'Prisons'];;"The head of the Queensland Family and Child Commission says he is “deeply concerned” at public sentiment calling for more punitive responses to youth crime in the face of clear evidence that “tough” approaches don’t work. Luke Twyford, the QFCC’s principal commissioner, told Guardian Australia that the government and community needed to be “smart against crime, not tough on crime”. “I am deeply concerned there’s a contradiction between what is evidence-based good practice in youth justice and what the public expects youth justice to do,” Twyford said.
Last month the Queensland government announced “even tougher” responses to youth offending, including longer sentences and the construction of two new youth detention centres, in response to the stabbing death of Brisbane woman Emma Lovell. The situation has been labelled a “crisis” by some media and the Liberal National opposition. Another stabbing death, in the Brisbane suburb of Wilston on Sunday, has further heightened an already fraught debate. The government has made clear its approach to youth justice involves “listening to the community” and responding to public sentiment. But multiple experts, including leading criminologists and advocates, say a punitive approach is likely making crime problems worse. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Prof Ross Homel, a criminologist at Griffith University, says the detention of young people “makes the community less safe”. “Detention centres are the worst possible places for fixing our broken kids,” Homel said. “The current incarceration rate of children in Queensland is about double New South Wales on a per-capita basis. It’s not as if we don’t already resort to detention as a deterrent.” Homel said increased penalties would not deter young offenders. “I’ve never met any youth offender who would even know what the maximum penalty was, or if it’s about to go up. If they did, it would not be likely to affect their decision making at 2am.” Many of the Queensland government’s strategies in recent years have been aimed at recidivist offenders. A 2019 Griffith university study, commissioned by the Queensland police service, found that the number of young offenders has declined steadily in recent years; but there had also been “a concurrent growth in the size of the chronic offending population”. On Tuesday, the Courier-Mail reported on Productivity Commission data that found for children given detention, probation, bail or parole, 56.8% reoffended within a year. This was portrayed on the front page as a “revolving door”, but experts say such statistics actually highlight the failure of “tough” punitive approaches. Studies have consistently shown that young people placed in detention are more likely to reoffend. A 2009 study on peer influence concluded that “considerable evidence suggests that the detention of juvenile offenders in programs characterised by high exposure to deviant peers and minimal adult interaction fails to reduce, and in some cases may exacerbate, rates of recidivism”.
The 2019 Griffith University study said that “criminal justice system responses that do not address the drivers or contexts for the offending behaviour are unlikely to encourage desistance or more prosocial behaviours among this offending group, and may inadvertently contribute to their repeated recidivism though entrenching offender identities and social networks”. Twyford said people in the youth justice system were disproportionately from lower socioeconomic communities, came from families with domestic violence issues, and had disengaged from schooling. “Young people should not be in a prison-like setting. They don’t work, they’re more harmful,” he said. “They come back into the same life situation before they entered, and they repeat crime. “It’s a shared responsibility – our public leaders, people who have a public voice, our media, and our institutions – to be building an evidence base and promoting that evidence base.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/25/australians-urged-to-ditch-tough-on-mindset-for-youth-justice-as-it-does-not-work;guardian;politics;1436
4911;4911;‘Moving ice can sound like it’s alive’: the musicians delving into Antarctica;2023-01-06T14:00:05Z;['Elissa Blake'];['Music', 'Sydney festival', 'Antarctica', 'Australia news', 'Culture', 'Opera'];;"The Antarctic – the idea of it, the harsh reality of it – has fascinated humans for centuries. Artists have tried to conjure it. Explorers have tried to conquer it. Scientists and environmentalists are trying to save it. It’s a fascination we’re unlikely to overcome, librettist Tom Wright says, ahead of the Australian premiere of the new opera Antarctica, composed by Mary Finsterer for the Sydney Chamber Opera. It is one of two works about the great white continent at this year’s Sydney festival: alongside Wright and Finsterer’s avant garde opera is the experimental sound performance Polar Force. Both works attempt to draw audiences into the nature and existential crisis of the polar continent.
“[The Antarctic is] not ours, it’s not for us, and so by way of analogy, it becomes either our hell or our heaven,” says Wright. “The Antarctic represents the limits to our knowledge and our pride. I like the idea of it being like a forbidden garden, a place we shouldn’t exploit, something to remind us that the world is not our oyster.” In Polar Force, audiences are drawn sonically and thermally into today’s Antarctic. “We’re cooling the space down to 17C, which is roughly what the temperature inside an Antarctic base station is,” says Speak Percussion’s artistic director, Eugene Ughetti, who performs Polar Force with sound artist/designer Philip Samartzis. “Then we slowly allow it to warm up during the performance. You won’t feel uncomfortable in any way, but you will experience climate change over the course of the hour.” Audiences will enter an inflatable structure, a bit like an igloo, erected in Carriageworks’ Track 12 space, and observe the performers engage in a “sonic dialogue” with field recordings made by Samartzis during his time as a resident artist with the Australian Antarctic Division in 2009-10 and 2015-16.
The performance looks more like laboratory work than traditional music-making. Ughetti and Samartzis play bespoke machines and manipulate compressed air and water. The space is alive with the sounds of thawing permafrost, cracking ice, grinding glaciers. “Right from the start, I didn’t want to work with conventional musical instruments at all,” explains Ughetti. “They didn’t feel right for capturing a place where everybody is a scientist or a researcher of some kind.” The resulting sounds can be unfamiliar and unsettling. “Sometimes, moving ice can sound like something that’s alive,” says Ughetti. There will be recognisable sounds in the mix too – the anthropogenic racket that is the inevitable byproduct of exploration: diesel generators, transport planes, machine tools, trucks and transporters.
“It’s all part of the lived experience of the continent now,” says Ughetti. “That’s the message, I guess. That we can’t experience the Antarctic without having a physical impact on it. The more we want to be there, see it, feel it, the more fingerprints we leave on it.” That sense of a continent in peril is also present – though less obviously – in Wright and Finsterer’s opera, which occupies Carriageworks’ Bay 17. Antarctica had its world premiere in the Netherlands in 2022; Sydney festival is its Australian premiere. If Polar Force plugs into the present plight of the southernmost continent, then Antarctica taps into its past – that of a mysterious, semi-mythic place, a tabula rasa destined to become the last frontier of imperial ambition. The story begins with a cartographer discovering an ancient manuscript describing a great southern continent, who then persuades two other scientists to get aboard a ship and find it. Each of the three has their own reason for wishing to voyage into the unknown – about which none of them are being entirely honest.
It’s a story of pride and hubris, Wright explains, “a journeying of the human soul that ends with enveloping ice and snow and glaring light.” Polar Force is an intimate spectacle, while Antarctica is epic in every sense. Designer Elizabeth Gadsby’s set presents a towering 9-metre-high wall of LED screens pierced by a department-store-sized window, behind which the cast perform as if in a human fish tank. The five singers are like “ghosts in a milk-fog” inside that box, which is filled with a vocally safe haze. Singer Jane Sheldon says the show is “relentlessly challenging” for the performers. “Normally, we sing in the same acoustic space as the audience so singing the entire show inside this container is really, really strange for us,” she says. “We knew the stage design would be abstract and not realistic. I mean, how do you put Antarctica on stage? Whack a few icebergs on?” The Dutch contemporary classical ensemble Asko|Schönberg is arranged in full view of the audience. At times, the auditorium is flooded with clouds of coloured light that envelop the senses.
“We try to evoke a big conceptual imaginative seascape through this piece,” says Wright. “There are characters and plot, but we’re also creating a sense of what this enormous nautical and ice-based world without humans is like.” Human impact on the Antarctic, however, is unlikely to diminish in the near future. According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators , Antarctic tourism is booming. About 100,000 tourists – mostly aboard cruise ships – are expected to visit the shores of Antarctica in 2023, a doubling of the pre-pandemic numbers. “I talked to a scientist in the Antarctic Division in Hobart and he said the best thing the world could do with Antarctica would be to get out, pack up all of our rubbish and leave it alone,” says Wright. “I think that’s one of the messages of the piece – that there are places we just shouldn’t go. There’s more to this planet than just tourism or mining opportunities. There is something calming and eternal about that.” Antarctica and Polar Force play at the Sydney festival until 8 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/07/moving-ice-can-sound-like-its-alive-the-musicians-delving-into-antarctica;guardian;entertainment & culture;4911
5481;5481;Will 2023 be a year of muddling through for the UK economy?;2023-01-03T18:03:05Z;['Nils Pratley'];['Oil and gas companies', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Economic recovery', 'Cineworld', 'Film industry', 'Film'];;"Typical. After a round of new year prediction punditry that made one think that 2023 could only be bleaker and weaker than 2022, the FTSE 100 index charged off in the opposite direction. It was up 180 points after two hours of trading to a shade over 7,600, enough to bring the all-time high (7,877, in the faraway pre-Ukraine, pre-Covid days of 2018) into view, a prospect that did not feature heavily in most “what to expect” checklists. By the close, the gain was a more modest 102 points but still out of tune with the general diagnosis that a third of the world would be in recession this year (the IMF) and that the UK’s downturn was likely to be the worst and longest in the G7 (a Financial Times poll of 101 UK economists). Never mistake share price for the real economy, but it’s worth asking the question: is it possible that 2023 could be a tale of muddling through, as opposed to a story of unmitigated financial gloom? If there is a case for relative optimism, it lies in the demonstration over the holiday period that wholesale energy prices can fall as well as rise. A UK month-ahead gas of 179p a therm still looks horrible against a 10-year average of roughly 50p but it’s a lot better than the terrifying 500p seen back in August. Even a few weeks ago, few would have bet that we would enter 2023 with gas prices lower than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The real test of Europe’s energy resilience lies ahead, it should be added quickly. Blackouts are still possible this winter and, as virtually every energy analyst points out, the biggest challenge is replenishing storage for next winter without Russian supplies. The current lull in wholesale prices could be highly misleading. Alternatively, one can see how lower energy prices may start to ease financial pressure on governments and business. The cost of protecting consumers via price caps falls; bills become lower for companies versus what they were expecting. Central banks’ freedom to hold off on interest rate rises also improves if the energy shock is believed to have passed its most shocking phase. None of which should be taken as a prediction of cheer. The debate is not about the fact of recession – just its severity. But a notable feature of the final few months of 2022 was the number of chief executives in consumer-facing companies who sounded more hopeful about medium-term trading than bald big-picture economic forecasts said they should be. Retailers’ Christmas reports over the next fortnight could puncture that picture in an instant, by delivering a hard reminder of how far cost-of-living pressures reach up the income spectrum. But, for the time being, the muddle-through thesis is intact. The second half of 2023 should be better than the first, which was about as upbeat as the new year forecasts came. One big swing factor – the price of energy – is currently behaving. A lot hangs on whether it continues to do so. Tit-for-tat point-scoring at Cineworld must feel irrelevant to many Recovery in any form is not on the cards for poor old shareholders in Cineworld, however. The once-mighty London-listed cinema group is in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US and financial realities must be spelled out in every utterance to the stock exchange. Any debt restructuring or sale “will result in a very significant dilution of existing equity interests”, according to Tuesday’s announcement, which has been the refrain since September. So what was the point of the latest statement? Well, it seems that Cineworld has been fuming over its rival AMC Entertainment’s claim to have held talks over cherry-picking a few cinemas in the US and Europe. There were no talks with us, said Cineworld, adding that it “understands” that its ad hoc group of lenders did not talk either. Such is the messy business of chapter 11. Nobody can agree on what constitutes proper talks. The tit-for-tat point-scoring must feel irrelevant to outside shareholders in Cineworld. Rather than listen to the chief executive Mooky Greidinger’s digressions on AMC, they would surely rather hear an explanation as to why a deal with lenders was not attempted last spring when Cineworld still had a share price that offered some negotiating clout. Instead, Greidinger gambled on a strong bounce-back in revenues that never quite materialised.

1365;1365;Total alcohol ban won’t solve problems in Alice Springs, say Indigenous groups;2023-01-25T10:28:43Z;['Sarah Collard'];['Indigenous Australians', 'Northern Territory', 'Australia news', 'Anthony Albanese'];;"Alice Springs traditional owners have said that a total alcohol ban of the type suggested by Anthony Albanese will not address the root causes of the social issues engulfing the town. While some elders have welcomed curbs on alcohol sales, local Indigenous leaders say “punitive” and race-based alcohol bans will do nothing to ease the problems in the area. Albanese said on Wednesday a total alcohol ban could be introduced in remote communities if recommended by a report into whether more intervention was required.
“That’s an option that we completely have said is there on the table,” Albanese told Sky News. But locals like Shirleen Campbell, Tangentyere Women’s Safety Group’s coordinator, said alcohol bans could create bigger problems in the region. “It’s a Band-Aid, I’ve seen this before,” the Warlpiri and Arrernte woman said. “I’ve seen this impact before around the alcohol and the timing of the hours sales. That’s not gonna stop – that’s going to create more problems.” She said such a move could inflame tensions within the town.
She said she did not believe the town’s Indigenous population had been adequately consulted before Tuesday’s announcement by the prime minister of tougher restrictions on alcohol sales. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
“It’s going to create more problematic racism. There was no consultation and collaboration with people on the ground who actually gonna live and see this and experience it. People are just coming in and making up and creating all these assumptions.” On Tuesday the prime minister and the Northern Territory’s chief minister, Natasha Fyles, flew into town to meet with two Indigenous organisations, NT police and local businesses about concerns about a rise in assaults, family and domestic violence, break-ins and property offences over the past 12 months. They announced a suite of immediate restrictions including takeaway alcohol-free days on Monday and Tuesday, and alcohol-reduced hours on other days, along with a limit of one transaction per person each day, with a progress report due in February.
Interventionist bans on alcohol in remote Aboriginal communities came to an end in July, when liquor became legal in some communities for the first time in 15 years, and others were able to buy takeaway alcohol without restrictions. Since then, NT police statistics show that reported property offences have jumped by almost 60% over the past 12 months, while assaults increased by 38% and domestic violence assaults were up 48%. But Campbell said punitive bans are not the solution and are not the drivers behind violence against women and girls, and that working together and empowering communities was key to reducing violence and antisocial behaviour. “Alcohol is not the driver of domestic violence, it often numbs people from the intergenerational trauma which we carry that every day, these problems come from the colonisation, we need to unpack that as well and that involves education,” she said. “It’s still ongoing today, the impact of colonisation. We have racism, the removals of our children. We have incarceration in the prisons of men and women.”
Cherisse Buzzacott, an Arrernte midwife and head of health at Children’s Ground Central Australia, was born and raised in Alice Springs. She said she was disappointed that the solution from government was simply more restrictions. Buzzacott said the community was dealing with several complex challenges including a lack of safe or secure housing and access to recreational activities. “There’s been no planning for this younger generation to come in and they’ve taken everything away from the kids. So what else can they do but get into trouble? “None of our communities have got functional playgrounds. We don’t have internet access, lots of the kids are coming into the CBD for wifi, there’s nothing really for kids to do,” she said.
Felicity Hayes, elder, traditional owner and educator who lives in Irrkerlantye, a town camp on the outskirts of Alice Springs, said she felt frustrated and ignored. “They need to talk to us, no one comes and asks us what we want, it’s always what they want,” Hayes said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/25/total-alcohol-ban-wont-solve-problems-in-alice-springs-say-indigenous-groups;guardian;politics;1365

6375;6375;Rishi Sunak's plans are far removed from what the country is experiencing right now I Beth Rigby;Wednesday 4 January 2023 21:03, UK;['beth rigby', '@bethrigby'];['rishi sunak'];['plan', 'beth', 'rigby', 'prime', 'set', 'waiting', 'public', 'sunaks', 'rishi', 'minister', 'experiencing', 'small', 'far', 'deliver', 'country', 'plans', 'sunak', 'right', 'removed', 'nhs'];"A term coined by Franklin D Roosevelt, ""the first 100 days"" has taken on a symbolic significance for political leaders as a benchmark to measure the early successes of a president - or, in our case, a prime minister.

But for Rishi Sunak, it has taken 71 days for the new PM to even set out a serious domestic policy speech, finally on Wednesday laying down his five priorities for his time at Number 10.

And what he has come up with misses the mark when it comes to grasping the nettle of the crisis Britain is now in.

For this is a prime minister facing the worst strikes since the 1980s, as nurses, rail workers, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and other public sector employees, all walk out over pay.

Politics live: PM accused of being 'detached from reality' by nursing union

The NHS is, according to many health leaders, facing the worst crisis in its history.

The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine estimates that 300 to 500 people a week are dying as a result of delays to emergency care - a figure challenged by NHS England.

People are struggling to see a GP and worrying about whether an ambulance will turn up in time if they have to dial 999.

And the rail network is crippled by rolling strikes.

Yet in his keynote speech, the prime minister had few answers to the issue of ending rail strikes or settling with nurses.

Instead, he set out a five-point plan on which the public should judge him - pledges to halve inflation; grow the economy; get national debt falling; cut NHS waiting lists; and pass laws to stop small boat crossings

He told the public he was not going to be one of those politicians who ""promise the earth and then fail to deliver"" (in an apparent dig at his two predecessors) and would focus on what he identified were the people's priorities - the high cost of living, NHS waiting times and illegal migration.

And he should be confident he can deliver, given that pretty much all of his five pledges are already in train.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:50 Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks the prime minister: 'How are you different to your predecessors?'

His economic pledges - halving inflation, growing the economy, getting national debt falling - look very simple to meet given that these are targets economists expect to happen too.

Inflation is expected to halve from its 11% high this year, while some forecasters expect the economy to be growing by the end of 2023.

As for reducing public debt, the prime minister has set this out as a medium-term goal, so it's already baked into his plans.

When it comes to cutting NHS lists - latest figures have those waiting for treatment in England at 7.2 million - NHS England has already set out a plan of reducing wait times over several years, with the PM repeating the promise to get waiting times falling without setting out fresh targets.

Under current plans, waits of longer than a year for elective care are to be eliminated by March 2025, while the ambition is that 95% of patients needing a diagnostic test receive it within six weeks by the same deadline.

If he sticks to this plan, Mr Sunak could claim success without the country necessarily feeling it.

And his final pledge, to pass laws to stop small boat crossings, has already been announced by the PM.

Last month, Mr Sunak promised new legislation to tackle small boat crossings as a record near 46,000 people crossing the channel on small boats in 2022.

His plan is to bring in new legislation that would bar anyone entering the UK illegally the right to remain in the UK.

So if the pledge is to pass laws to stop small boat crossings, he'll deliver it.

But how effective the government will be in actually stopping the crossings or returning people to their countries of origins remains to be seen, given that many people will come from countries to which they cannot be returned. This could prove a pledge that is hardest to deliver.

Is it enough?

Mr Sunak ended his speech saying he'd only make promises on what he can deliver and will deliver on what he's promised. And by that yardstick, he'll probably be able to claim success.

But the reality of what the country is experiencing right now is far removed from his five-point plan.

And with the Conservatives still 20 points behind in the polls, the bigger question for this government and the Tory Party is whether what Mr Sunak is offering is anywhere near enough to turn the tide.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104213219/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunaks-plans-are-far-removed-from-what-the-country-is-experiencing-right-now-i-beth-rigby-12779996;skynews;politics;466
412;412;‘We’ll fight until the end’: a journey through the centre of Peru’s uprising;2023-01-30T07:15:10Z;['Tom Phillips'];['Peru', 'Americas', 'World news'];;"One by one, the rebel campesinos clambered up to the improvised podium they had built atop a 6ft earth barricade, to declare their determination to topple the president of Peru. “Brothers and sisters, right now our Peru needs us more than ever,” Nilda Mendoza Coronel, a 35-year-old farmer, told hundreds of strikers who had gathered under a ferocious morning sun. “We’ll fight until the very end, carajo!” Mendoza bellowed through a megaphone. “No one will stop our struggle!” Another speaker, Aparicio Meléndez, urged the crowd in the Andean town of Sicuani to ignore reports that army troops were en route to extinguish their revolt. “We’ll stay here until they’ve spent their very last bullet,” the 55-year-old grazier vowed as he looked out on the protest blocking the 940-mile highway through the Peruvian Andes. A two-word rallying cry had been painted on to the tarmac behind the barricade: “People’s insurgency.”
Sicuani is at the heart of the seven-week-old insurrection against Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, and the country’s political establishment that began in early December after its leftist president, Pedro Castillo, was unseated and arrested after being accused of trying to stage a coup. Strange and violent political winds have been buffeting Latin America and the Caribbean of late, with a far-right uprising in Brazil, political and social meltdown in Haiti, and protests after the arrest of one of Bolivia’s most prominent opposition leaders. But nowhere has the turmoil been more widespread or deadly than in Peru, where at least 58 lives have been lost since Castillo’s dramatic demise. Huge swaths of South America’s fourth most populous country have been paralysed by protests and roadblocks since Castillo’s downfall, as his supporters – and those outraged at the government’s deadly response – hit the streets to demand Boluarte’s resignation, fresh elections and justice for the dozens allegedly killed by security forces.
The Guardian travelled through the most affected region, between the Andean cities of Cusco and Juliaca – where 17 people were killed in the worst day of violence – to hear the voices of the mutiny against the Peruvian government.
The gruelling 210-mile journey took three days and involved navigating scores of checkpoints guarded by campesino protesters, as well as hundreds of barricades made from boulders, tree trunks, dilapidated vehicles, glass and scrap metal. Beyond the roadblocks, it was also a journey through the profound social inequality, grinding poverty and discrimination that lie behind the explosion of rural anger against what many protesters call the corrupt, self-serving and largely white political establishment in the capital, Lima. “It’s as if we aren’t humans … It’s as if we are worth nothing,” said Raúl Constantino Samillán Sanga, whose 30-year-old brother was gunned down in Juliaca during clashes between police and protesters. “The whole of the Andes is now saying we’ve had enough – this must change.” The trip through the centre of Peru’s political earthquake began in Cusco, once the capital of the Inca empire and, today, the South American country’s most important tourist destination, with nearly 3 million visitors each year. The tourists have vanished since the uprising began, with Cusco’s airport repeatedly shut down by authorities and the nearby Machu Picchu closed earlier this month. “Everyone’s on edge and worried and a bit scared too,” said Hannah Jenkinson, a British fashion designer who runs a boutique in Cusco’s now largely deserted historic centre.
A few streets away, hundreds of demonstrators marched towards the plaza where in the 18th century the Indigenous leader Túpac Amaru was quartered and beheaded after rebelling against Spanish rule. “She’s going down! She’s going down! The murderer’s going down!” the crowds chanted of Boluarte as they surged through Cusco’s cobbled streets waving Peru’s red and white flag. Twenty-five miles south-east of Cusco, past pre-Incan ruins and eucalyptus-dotted mountains, lay the village of Villahermosa – the location of the first major roadblock along Peru’s Route 3S highway. Dozens of villagers, including elderly women clutching traditional huaraca whips woven from alpaca fleece, had blocked the road with tree trunks and tyres to express their fury at decades of government neglect and the recent wave of killings, most of which have been blamed on security forces. Juvenal Luna Jara, 22, said he had joined the rebellion one week earlier, incensed that so many protesters had been killed in Peru’s long-neglected rural south, which was at the centre of the brutal 12-year war waged by the Shining Path guerrilla group. As he saw it, the majority of lives were lost in such regions because provincianos (country folk) were considered second-class citizens, or worse. “It’s as if they were killing dogs,” he fumed. Hours earlier, Boluarte had implored protesters to accept a nationwide truce. But there was no hint of compromise in Villahermosa as farmers gathered to vent their rage at the president’s role in the ousting of Castillo, a former union leader who was born into poverty and was propelled into the presidency in 2021 by impoverished rural voters in places such as this.
“If there’s no solution, the struggle will go on,” the villagers roared before the Guardian’s vehicle was allowed to continue its journey. In village after village along the boulder-strewn highway, the message was the same, as disillusioned and downtrodden farmers gathered by their blockades to offer impassioned speeches about the state of their nation and how their resource-rich mining region had been milked for profits that were never seen. ﻿Dina Quispe wept as she denounced how Peruvian authorities had branded the protesters narco-funded terrucos (terrorists) and met their call for political change with repression and bloodshed. “We have been humiliated and forgotten,” said the 41-year-old saleswoman from the community of Checyuyoc. “They are killing our brothers with bullets.” Through her tears, Quispe voiced disgust that she shared a first name withPeru’s first female president. Boluarte has become a lightning rod for far deeper disillusionment with the broken politics of a country that has had seven presidents in the last six years and where a quarter of the population struggle to properly feed themselves. Quispe said to reporters: “Please, take this voice of protest from deepest and humble Peru [to the world].”
A few miles away in Sicuani, a town now almost completely cut off from the outside world by the roadblocks, hundreds of Quechua women wearing sombreros, pollera skirts and dazzling quilts were on the march. “We are fighting for our future and the future of our children and our grandchildren,” said Roxana Chahuanco, 40, as locals prepared to debate their next move after the government announced it would deploy troops to clear the roads. There, Mendoza Coronel evoked the Indigenous martyrs Túpac Amaru and his wife, Micaela Bastidas, as she urged locals to intensify their peasant rebellion against the “corrupt” Lima elites. “They look down on us because we are the children of campesinos and for being men of the fields,” she said.
At the next village, a cow’s skull had been placed on a pole above a barricade fashioned from two heaps of rubble and earth. “It’s Dina,” joked one of the women policing the checkpoint. From Sicuani, the highway climbed even higher into the Andes towards the spectacular 4,300-metre border with the department of Puno, where Aymara Indigenous communities are also in revolt against the new government. Boluarte further infuriated the region’s inhabitants last week when she told foreign journalists “Puno isn’t Peru” – a declaration the president subsequently claimed had been misunderstood. “We are Peruvians,” said one woman guarding a roadblock outside the town of Ayaviri. “It was in Puno that the Inca empire was born.”
After Ayaviri, the highway descended towards Puno’s largest city, Juliaca, a dilapidated and edgy mining and smuggling hub, where anti-government protests continue to rage as local families mourn their dead. Behind a metal door decorated with a black ribbon of mourning sat María Ysabel Samillan Sanga, who lost her younger brother one Monday in early January. Marco Antonio Samillán Sanga was a medical student who had been working as a volunteer medic in Juliaca when protesters tried to storm the city’s airport and security forces responded with live ammunition.
The 30-year-old student was shot through the heart as he attended to a boy who had inhaled teargas – one of at least 17 people to die in Juliaca that day. “It was a massacre,” said his sister. “There is no other word for it.” Samillán Sanga wept as she remembered how her brother had worked his way out of extreme poverty and into medical school. He had dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon and creating health programmes for Puno’s rural poor. “Right now, I feel like I’m being obliged to live … If it was up to me, I’d die too because there are days I just cannot cope with this pain,” she said, tears coursing down her cheeks. Samillán Sanga also saw prejudice and discrimination at the root of her brother’s death and Peru’s uprising. “We have feelings. We are humans. We feel. We cry. We have emotions. And we are in pain,” said her brother, Raúl Constantino. The family said they feared government reprisals for speaking out but would not be silenced. “I hope someone reads this and thinks: how is the Samillán Sanga family?” said María Ysabel. “Because the truth is we have been shattered. My family will never be the same again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/30/journey-through-the-centre-of-peru-uprising-dina-boluarte;guardian;politics;412
3283;3283;‘Devastated’ Nick Kyrgios pulls out of Australian Open with knee injury;2023-01-16T05:05:21Z;['Emma Kemp'];['Nick Kyrgios', 'Australian Open 2023', 'Tennis', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'Australian Open'];;"A devastated Nick Kyrgios has already set his sights on recovering from his untimely knee injury in time to better his sparkling 2022 season following his “brutal” 11th-hour withdrawal from the Australian Open on the eve of his home grand slam. Kyrgios confirmed the news with a “mixture of emotions” in an unexpected media conference alongside his physiotherapist on Monday afternoon, the day before he was due to play his first-round match against Roman Safiullin.
The world No 21 pulled out of Australia’s United Cup campaign late last month before also withdrawing from the second of the Adelaide International warm-up events, leaving him with little preparation. On Monday it was revealed an MRI uncovered a cyst caused by a tear in his left meniscus, which his physio, Will Maher, said is not career-threatening but would not allow him to play at his best and risked affecting the remainder of his 2023 season should he attempt to put it through the rigour of a grand slam campaign. “I’m devastated, obviously,” Kyrgios said. “It’s my home tournament, I’ve had some great memories here – obviously last year winning the title in doubles and playing the best tennis of my life probably. Then going into this event as one of the favourites, it’s brutal. “It always goes back to the last grand slam I played, the US Open … I was extremely hard on myself after that loss in the quarter-finals, thinking that I could win it from there on. I just had the Aus Open on the back of my mind from that day forth as soon as I got off the court against [Karen] Khachanov. I always wanted to just do everything right and train right and tick every box, and just be ready for the Aus Open.” Maher said Kyrgios “didn’t pull up great” from Friday’s exhibition match against Novak Djokovic and been experiencing discomfort the last week. “We used the match, the charity event against Novak, as a gauge to see if he could compete at that highest level,” Maher said. “He didn’t pull up great, and he still tried to give himself every chance in the following days to have subsequent training. But it was clear with each passing session that he was getting sorer and sorer. “I think we’ve made the sensible decision to withdraw him because at this stage he wants to feel mentally comfortable that he can go seven matches, he can go the distance, and needs to be able to do potentially seven three-hour matches. Getting on the court simply wasn’t enough for him.
“The situation now is, which we wanted to prevent him from having further injury or making that injury worse.” The 27-year-old will return to Canberra at the end of this week for arthroscopic surgery to remove the cyst and “clean up” his meniscus before using February to recover, with a slated return in time for Indian Wells in March. “Obviously this coming around is just bad timing, but that’s life – but injury is a part of the sport,” Kyrgios said. “I guess I can draw some inspiration from someone like Thanasi [Kokkinakis] who has had a bunch of injuries and has bounced back. “I’m not doubting I will be back to my full strength and playing the tennis I was playing prior to this event. All I can do now is just look forward, do what I need to do and come back.” It means Australia will be without its top-ranked men’s and women’s singles players, after Ajla Tomljanović also withdrew injured over the weekend.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/devastated-nick-kyrgios-pulls-out-of-australian-open-with-knee-injury;guardian;sports;3283
1912;1912;Jacinda Ardern is a leader to look up to | Letters ;2023-01-22T16:14:23Z;['N/A'];['Jacinda Ardern', 'New Zealand', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'United Nations'];;Regarding Jacinda Ardern’s resignation (Jacinda Ardern knew when to quit. Unlike some other politicians I could mention, 19 January), Gaby Hinsliff asks: “Would a man have had the self-awareness or humility to step aside?” She may be interested to learn that Ardern was catapulted into the leadership of the Labour party here when the then leader of the opposition, Andrew Little, resigned in her favour shortly before the 2017 election. Few recognised that he didn’t have what it takes to win an election. Many of us in Aotearoa/New Zealand are grieving the loss of such a kind, honest and authentic leader, one of the greatest of our lifetimes. We are dismayed that an unrelenting campaign of hate and lies, often misogynistic, has taken her from us. She would, however, be perfect in the role of secretary general of the United Nations. Please note, world. Peter Haynes Auckland, New Zealand • After witnessing so much corruption, dishonesty and self-aggrandising during the Johnson/Truss/Sunak era in the UK, how refreshing to see a political leader elsewhere who demonstrates the importance of public service, integrity and humility. Matthew Ryder St Neots, Cambridgeshire • I think the reason Jacinda Ardern has nothing left in the tank is that she has done the job properly for the benefit of her country, and not for self-aggrandisement and enrichment, unlike the succession of entitled millionaires we have had running (down) our country for the last 13 years.

1811;1811;The Dallas Cowboys keep rewriting the book of playoff incompetence;2023-01-23T08:05:16Z;['Hunter Felt'];['Dallas Cowboys', 'San Francisco 49ers', 'NFL', 'US sports', 'Sport'];;"For the second straight year, the Dallas Cowboys’ season ended at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers after a botched final play. In 2022, Dak Prescott futilely ran out the clock rather than try a Hail Mary. This time around, their attempt to reach their first NFC Championship Game since 1995 ended in a blown trick play during which they couldn’t even get a lateral off. The 49ers beat the Cowboys 19-12 and there are already calls for Dallas head coach Mike McCarthy’s job.
Would firing McCarthy be an overreaction? Possibly. However, this was Dallas’s seventh straight loss in the divisional round (and that’s before we get to the defeats in the wildcard round) and Cowboys fans have legitimate reasons to believe that the most valuable franchise in sports has established itself as a perennial underachiever. While McCarthy isn’t responsible for the vast majority of those playoff losses, he hasn’t exactly turned the ship around either. It’s not just that the last-gasp play didn’t work, or even have time to develop, it’s that Kyle Shanahan outmatched McCarthy during Sunday’s game. Now, the 49ers’ head coach did not pitch a perfect game: the only reason the Cowboys had the chance to win late was that the Niners left too much time on the clock after their final possession. Yet, they only had that possession thanks to McCarthy’s inexplicable decision to punt on 4th and 10 with two minutes left, something which felt dangerously close to giving up.
A crisp, well-played game this wasn’t. For most of the contest, it felt like the result would hinge on Cowboys kicker Brett Maher’s struggles after his first PAT of the day was blocked by the San Francisco defense. Not only had Maher missed four such tries during their last playoff game, but he was also apparently struggling with kicking accuracy during Sunday’s warmups. That McCarthy seemingly forgot that the two-point conversion is an option in the NFL did not really speak well of his game-managing skills either. The main difference between head coaches in football isn’t in these details, it’s in overall results. Shanahan now takes the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game for the third time in the last four years, and he’s been doing this without the benefit of a star quarterback (apologies to Jimmy Garoppolo). This year may be his most impressive season as he’s done it all with third-string QB Brock Purdy, who was so overlooked that he was the final player picked in the 2022 draft. Be prepared to hear that fact often next Sunday when the 49ers face off against the Philadelphia Eagles for the right to play in the Super Bowl. The Cowboys, as has been the tradition since the Clinton Administration, will be watching at home. That detail alone should tell you that this organizational dysfunction predated their head coach. McCarthy isn’t the main problem here. But there’s growing evidence that he won’t be the solution either. MVP(s) of the week
The Cincinnati Bengals offensive line. Heading into Sunday’s game against the Buffalo Bills, the Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line was meant to be their achilles heel. Thanks to injuries, they were without starting right guard Alex Cappa (who was replaced by Max Scharping) and starting left tackle Jonah Williams (who was replaced by Jackson Carman), all this while right tackle La’el Collins was already on injured reserve (he was replaced by Hakeem Adeniji). The only remaining regulars were rookie left guard Cordell Volson and center Ted Karras. The Bengals, who have historically had difficulties keeping quarterback Joe Burrow on his feet, had acquired those now-unavailable players just for high-pressure playoff games like this one. Now they had to rely on backups against the preseason Super Bowl favorites on the road in snowy conditions. It turns out the Bengals’ makeshift O-line was able to neutralize the Bills’ on-paper advantage at defense. Burrow was sacked just once, threw for two touchdowns and crucially didn’t commit a single turnover. Burrow deserves praise for the 27-10 Bengals victory – and for releasing the ball much quicker than Josh Allen – but he would be the first to give credit to the linemen who protected him all game. It also helped that the Bengals adjusted their gameplan for the weather conditions better than the home team did. Despite normally being a pass-first, pass-often offense, they lent on running back Joe Mixon, who rushed for 105 yards and a key second-half touchdown. As much as we love handing out individual awards, the Bengals’ road win on Sunday was the ultimate proof that this is a team sport. Now this team will head to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game. If Patrick Mahomes’s ankle holds up, the Bengals will be underdogs, but it’s clear they’re perfectly happy being underestimated. Video of the week
It probably sums up the New York Giants game against the Philadelphia Eagles that the most memorable moment for the visitors came when New York QB Daniel Jones lost a contact lens and the team had to burn a timeout. Things would not improve for the Giants. Maybe it wouldn’t have made a difference if he had just left the contacts out for the rest of the game. The Eagles took a 28-0 half-time lead and didn’t look back, eventually winning 38-7. The Giants’ offense did itself no favors by not playing to its strength and emphasizing the run game, but that may well not have been enough anyway. After all, New York’s defense couldn’t stop the Eagles from scoring. No 1 seed Philadelphia will host the NFC Championship Game on Sunday. Quote of the week
“I’m not coming out of a playoff game unless they take me out. I love this game … pain is pain, and you’re going to have to deal with it either way” – Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, explaining why he returned to play in the second half of their 27-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars had a solid opportunity to win on Saturday afternoon, particularly when Mahomes left with an ankle injury in the first quarter. Backup Chad Henne came into the game to complete the first half, depriving Kansas City of their most important player, and giving the Jaguars a clear shot at an upset. However, the Jaguars’ defense couldn’t stop the Chiefs’ Travis Kelce, who had 14 catches – the most by any tight end in playoff history – for 98 yards and two touchdowns. They also couldn’t pressure a limping Mahomes when he returned, and the Chiefs advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the fifth straight year. Now the question is whether Mahomes’ injury – ESPN reports that he has a high ankle sprain – will allow him to play next Sunday and, if so, at what level. Tony Romo, who had a similar injury during his playing career, said on CBS that he thinks it will be a “huge challenge” for Mahomes to return at 100% against the Bengals. Mahomes has an extra day’s rest as the Jaguars game was on Saturday rather than Sunday. But NFL players rely on adrenaline (and often an ample amount of painkillers) to push through injuries in the immediate aftermath of suffering them, only for the true extent of the pain to become apparent in subsequent days. If Mahomes can’t play, the Chiefs will have to rely on Henne. And if they were fully comfortable doing that, we wouldn’t have seen Mahomes return to the field against Jacksonville. The Jaguars’ season is over, but let us praise rather than bury them. This is a team that had the league’s worst record last season. It turns out that all it took was a desperately needed change at head coach and a drastic improvement from quarterback Trevor Lawrence for the Jaguars to become a playoff team. They outperformed expectations and could be an even bigger threat now that they have some postseason experience under their belts. Stat of the week 11. That’s how many touchdowns Philadelphia Eagles running back Boston Scott has scored in nine games against the New York Giants in his career, after his latest in Saturday night’s divisional battle. Meanwhile, the “Giant Killer” has played 52 games against other teams, scoring just seven TDs total against non-Giants opposition. So, a player named Boston enjoys sticking it to a New York sports team above all others. Go figure. Elsewhere around the league
• The NFL offseason hasn’t officially begun but – make no mistakes – it has very much begun. On Sunday morning came reports that Lamar Jackson rejected a $133m fully guaranteed deal from the Baltimore Ravens. While the Ravens could still apply the franchise tag on the 2019 NFL MVP now that his rookie contract has expired, there’s a growing sense that Jackson could be on another team soon enough. In other words, expect chaos this upcoming offseason, maybe even more than usual (which is saying something). • Was there some off-the-field tomfoolery before the Giants-Eagles game? The Giants were treated to a rude surprise when their hotel in Philadelphia left them without water for “an unspecified period of time,” apparently the result of a broken pipe. Merely an unfortunate coincidence? Some Giants players were unconvinced.
• Some good news: former NFL running back Peyton Hillis was discharged from hospital this weekend. According to reports Hillis, who rushed for 1,177 yards with the Cleveland Browns in 2010, was injured while rescuing family members from drowning. There were a lot of winners in football this weekend, but it’s difficult to think of a bigger victory than this.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/23/dallas-cowboys-playoff-loss-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-football;guardian;sports;1811
77;77;Nurse! My pen! Hanif Kureishi’s hospital musings and the art of sickbed writing;2023-01-31T16:30:03Z;['Lara Feigel'];['Hanif Kureishi', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Death and dying', 'Society', 'Thomas Mann', 'Disability', 'Hilary Mantel'];;"“What could we possibly be afraid of after having admitted to ourselves that we had dealt face to face with death and not embraced it?” Audre Lorde asked herself in her journal in 1978, a few days after undergoing a mastectomy for breast cancer. “For once we accept the actual existence of our dying, who can ever have power over us again.” Lorde insisted on the new clarity, creativity and power enabled by the revelations of illness. The women she saw as succumbing to the lure of prosthetic breasts had for her refused enlightenment. This is empowering but also relentless: why should the ill be wiser than anyone else? What makes Lorde’s Cancer Journals genuinely revelatory is that insights of this kind are packed in amid despair and anger – accounts of staring out of the window and masturbating into exhaustion.
There’s a particular value in writing in real time about illness, which we’ve seen in what Hanif Kureishi has been hurling out into the world from his hospital bed in Rome. Since his mysterious fall on 26 December, possibly following a fit, he has sent daily missives, dictated to his wife and son and published on Twitter and Substack, now amounting to 10,000 words. Kureishi’s dispatches have proved incredibly popular. The Covid years confronted us with our mortality and reminded us that we’re all a constant amalgam of health and disease. Simultaneously we’re ground down by the attention economy, and here is the bite-sized revelation we can handle. There’s the intimacy of it: suddenly I get daily emails from Kureishi in my inbox, telling me how many hours of sleep he’s had and what it’s like to think about sex when your body has ceased to be sexual. The broad movement of Kureishi’s letters is from self-pitying disbelief and despair to a more open sense of the insights that bodily disorder can bring. The early ones talk about living a “half life” and being a “vegetable”. One onlooker rightly commented on Kureishi’s Substack that the “half life” description is “an insult to millions of people living full and productive lives with disabilities”. Kureishi must know this, but he’s a man used to bearing the weights of insults – in one of the entries he itemises the terrible racist slurs he encountered in adolescence. It’s as though he’s invoking his own prejudice and shame in order to reach rock bottom and find somewhere to grow from.
On 9 January, the day Kureishi sits up for the first time, he tells his pianist doctor to try to make a wholly new sound on the piano, in order to find a new self. The doctor is alarmed, so Kureishi tells him that “fear is the engine of art, the engine of conversation and love”. Gradually, in the days that follow, he convinces himself of the truth of this in his own situation, relishing the creative thoughts he’s having amid the stillness, and celebrating his dependence on others even as he envies them their able-bodiedness. And in the hospital gym, he learns to find the “mutual work” between patients and therapists a source of “beauty, collaboration and respect”. He berates the able-bodied for the kinds of prejudices he displayed in his early letters. “It is as if we want to believe that we live in a world of many healthy and well-functioning people. We do not.” The lineage behind him, of writers investigating illness as a source of truth and creativity, is long and complex. Alongside Lorde there is Gillian Rose, who in her incandescent 1995 memoir Love’s Work reveals the terrifying enmeshedness of life, death and love. And there is Susan Sontag, warning us not to moralise illness – which probably means not seeing the ill as wise, any more than we would see their illness as the result of moral failings. In the background of all this there was Schopenhauer, insisting on the body both as a seat of “pain and deficiency” and as “the ground of our knowledge”, and Nietzsche claiming that it’s because man is “courageous and richly endowed”, “discontented and insatiable”, that he is “the most chronically and profoundly sick of all sick animals”.
It was Thomas Mann who turned Schopenhauer’s pessimism and Nietzsche’s ecstatic nihilism into a theory of art. In notes made for his Goethe and Tolstoy essay while writing The Magic Mountain, he defined sickness as “the truly human tragic contradiction”. In The Magic Mountain he found a form capable both of portraying the growth enabled by sickness and of ironising any notion of such growth. So its protagonist Hans Castorp, who has grown up romanticising both illness and death, comes in the snow to see that “who knows the body, life, knows death”, transcending the separation of mind and body, life and death. For Mann, as for Castorp, sickness was a kind of precondition of genius, but he also needed to see the comedy of illness, and especially of the medical world, in his fiction. Castorp doesn’t write during his illness, though he reads and listens to music with new intensity. But the desire to work often consumes sick writers, whatever Virginia Woolf may have said about illness not being a major theme for literature. Kureishi returns lovingly in his letters to his first discovery of his vocation, and of the fountain pens he fears he’ll never hold again. “Writer” was an identity to hold up against the bullies who taunted him with other labels, so there’s a fear now that if he stops writing he’ll fall into their hands. Hilary Mantel wrote in her extraordinary memoir Giving up the Ghost that after her body was rendered unrecognisable by its medical maulings, she wrote in order to locate herself “if not within a body, then … between the lines where the ghosts of meaning are”. Meaning remained as elusive as ever but her disembodied self needed somewhere to hover. Among the writers I’ve mentioned here, Kureishi is unique in dictating his writing to others. I’ve found the depiction of his relationship with his wife Isabella that has emerged through their collaborations to be the most moving aspect of his letters. We have the impression here of a woman at once utterly generous and rightly insistent that she has to survive this herself. Self-pity of the kind seen in Kureishi’s early letters can consume everything; this is the writer, after all, of Intimacy, the 1998 autobiographical novel in which an unfaithful husband showed endless interest in his own capacity for boredom and desire and very little curiosity about the brittle estrangement of his wife.
In Lorde’s journals, she worries about how it will feel to brush her chest against a lover and only feel one breast. Kureishi has similar anxieties, which he assuages by looking forward to renewing the act of cunnilingus and looking back to the sexual conquests of early middle age. His accounts of sex and drugs with a young woman in Amsterdam would be unbearably smug were it not for this interjection: “If this was a film, the camera would be close on Isabella’s face as she writes this down for me.” Isabella, mocking his limited insights into Italian politics, despairing of cleaning his teeth successfully, giving up in exhaustion and handing over to his son, is an autonomous figure here. The most powerful, painful moment is when she turns to him and asks: “Would you have ever done this for me?” Kureishi can’t answer. “I don’t know,” he dictates in the retelling. He may reveal more than he means to here. This isn’t a novel, where he’s in control; his writing escapes his grasp and reveals the pain of love. We give each other what we can, which is everything, but may also be terrifyingly imbalanced. I wonder if Isabella is writing her own journal. I’d like to see them published together. I wonder, too, how Mann would write Kureishi – which of the insights of “our hero” would remain unsatirised? Nietzsche’s sick animal is a creature constantly spinning fictions and Kureishi is too good a writer not to be aware that this is what he’s doing. At the end of The Magic Mountain, Mann terminates Castorp’s revelations and sends him off to the front. I look forward to Kureishi’s own novel about these experiences and wait to see what larger sense of the historical world he’ll use it to reveal. Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

2113;2113;Jacinda Ardern proved a true leader knows when to step back. If only US politicians could do the same | Arwa Mahdawi;2023-01-21T14:00:09Z;['Arwa Mahdawi'];['Jacinda Ardern', 'New Zealand', 'World news'];;‘Can women have it all?’ It was inevitable that someone was going to ask that most cliched of questions and, voilà, they did. Shortly after Jacinda Ardern’s shock resignation as New Zealand prime minister this week, the BBC tweeted out a story about Ardern balancing motherhood with politics, with a headline asking if women can really have it all. After being accused of “staggering sexism”, the BBC deleted the headline and apologised. Having it all. Please, someone, ban that stupid phrase already. It is 2023! I’m pretty sure we’ve spent at least a decade talking about the fact that nobody ever asks whether working dads can have it all. When Boris Johnson had two new kids during his tenure as prime minister of Britain there wasn’t a lot of handwringing about how he’d balance life with a newborn, and the responsibilities of being a father of seven with his job. When Elon Musk became a dad for the umpteenth time the BBC didn’t ask how he was going to balance fatherhood with colonizing Mars. Or, if they did, I must have missed that article. Forget “having it all”, Ardern showed us all a powerful new model of leadership. Our current model of leadership (which, shameless plug, I’ve written an entire book called Strong Female Lead about) often treats empathy as a weakness. Ardern showed us all that kindness and compassion aren’t weaknesses, they’re strengths. Our current model of leadership prioritizes confidence over competence and tends to reward arrogance. Ardern, meanwhile, has spoken about the importance of self-doubt. “Some of the people I admire the most have that self-consciousness and that slight gnawing lack of confidence,” the politician said in a 2020 interview. When impostor syndrome creeps in, she explained, she thinks about how to use it constructively. “Does [that self-doubt] mean I need to do a bit more prep, do I need to think more about my decision making?” Wouldn’t it be nice if more politicians went through that exercise?! For a long time, women have been told to “lean in” to a patriarchal model of leadership. They’ve been told that, in order to be successful, they have to mold themselves into the image of a leader dictated by men. Ardern didn’t do that. She led on her own terms. And, perhaps, most powerfully, she stopped leading on her own terms. “I know what this job takes,” Ardern said when she announced her resignation. “And I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.” We tend to equate leadership with being the loudest voice in the room. But true leadership means knowing when it’s time to pass the mic. True leadership means knowing when it’s time to step back. Unfortunately most lawmakers, particularly in the US, seem desperate to hold on to power for as long as humanly possible even if it’s not for the greater good. I mean, do you know how old the average senator in the US is? 64.3 years old. That’s over 20 years older than Ardern. Joe Biden, the oldest president in American history, is 80 and is expected to run again in the 2024 election. Senator Chuck Grassley is 89 as is Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. There have been a lot of concerns about Feinstein’s cognitive health and yet she still refuses to say whether she’s going to run for another term or not. Does it really serve her constituents for her to have another term, or does it serve it her ego? I’m not saying that there should be an age limit in politics, by the way. Experience is important. But there’s a real problem when the same people cling to power for decades and refuse to make room for new blood. Ardern, 42, says she no longer has enough in the tank to do her job justice. I’ve got to wonder what on earth some long-serving politicians in the US have in their tanks. I’ve got a feeling it may be narcissism. Is Milf Manor the queasiest new dating show on TV? Betteridge’s law states that: “Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.” But having read this Guardian piece on a horrifying new reality show called MILF Manor I think I’ve found the exception to that law. The Taliban bought a ‘verified’ check mark on Twitter It now appears to have been removed after some understandable outrage. Sierra Leone passes landmark law on women’s rights Under the new Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Act 30% of public and private jobs must be reserved for women. The law also requires some employers to give at least 14-weeks of maternity leave. The ‘virgin speculum’: proof that medicine is still rife with outrageous myths about women Out of the 16 million women in the UK who were eligible for a cervical screening test in 2022, only 11.2 million took one. That’s the lowest level in a decade. As Jenny Halpern Prince writes in the Guardian, women might feel more comfortable taking the test if it were updated a little bit. As it is, the speculum that is used for the examination is called a “virgin speculum”. Prince is calling for it to be renamed the “extra-small speculum” or for its medical name, the Pederson speculum, to be used. “The term virgin speculum should be removed from use by medical device advertisers and the medical profession (it is currently taught in medical schools),” writes Prince. That does seem a little bit like a no-brainer. The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is having a #MeToo moment Top athletes have accused the WFI’s president and several coaches of sexual misconduct. This goes beyond wrestling because the WFI president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, is also a lawmaker for the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. The week in passwordarchy Netflix has been threatening to crack down on password sharing for a while and now it looks like it’s finally happening. During its recent earnings report the streaming service announced that it will enforce password-sharing rules “more broadly” in the next few months. Not sure this is a great idea, Netflix.

8996;8996;LGBT activists welcome Pope to Congo as he dismisses anti-gay laws;Wednesday 1 February 2023 16:51, UK;[];['pope francis', 'democratic republic of congo'];['antigay', 'lgbt', 'welcome', 'laws', 'francis', 'ndolo', 'activists', 'kinshasa', 'homosexual', 'pic', 'dismisses', 'world', 'congo', 'pope', 'homosexuality', 'mass', 'airport'];"Pope Francis is being welcomed by gay rights activists as he begins a tour of Congo and South Sudan.

Speaking last week, ahead of his Africa trip, the head of the Catholic church said ""being homosexual isn't a crime"" - something described by an activist in Kinshasa, Scaly Kep'na, as a ""beautiful message"".

Francis also said that laws which criminalise homosexuality are ""unjust"", and that the Vatican should help put an end to them. ""It must do this,"" he said.

His comments ""mark an evolution of the church"", Mr Kep'na added.

There are 64 countries that still criminalise same-sex relations and Africa accounts for half of them, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association World (ILGA World).

Congo is an important destination for Francis, where about half of the 105 million population are Catholics.

A mass being held at Ndolo airport in the capital, Kinshasa, was expected to draw as many as two million of the faithful.

Africa is one of the few places in the world where the Catholic church is growing, both in the number of worshippers and individuals wanting to become priests.

This is Francis's fifth trip to the continent in his 10-year pontificate. He will be there until Sunday.

While it is unclear whether he will talk about homosexuality, Julia Mukuala, 38, a Congolese activist and member of the Pan-Africa ILGA Board, welcomed his recent comments.

""We think it will change the perception of all the religious people in our countries who think that when you are homosexual, you are to be slaughtered, to be dehumanised, you are devils,"" she said.

Her organisation put up a large banner in Kinshasa on behalf of the Congolese LGBT+ community, decorated with a rainbow flag and a welcoming message to Pope Francis.

Not everyone sees the Pope's comments in quite such a positive light, however.

""The Holy Father is far from being a supporter of homosexuality,"" said Father Alain Difima, head of Kinshasa's Catholic abbots.

He added that the Pope ""simply wanted to show that a person who practices homosexuality is still capable of remaining in society"".

Father Difima continued: ""It's his way of giving a chance to a homosexual person whom the world sees as a criminal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/lgbt-activists-welcome-pope-to-congo-as-he-dismisses-anti-gay-laws-12800746;skynews;politics;3087

Brighton scored three goals in six minutes at Goodison Park as Everton collapsed to an eighth defeat in 11 games in all competitions. Fans turned on the board as Roberto De Zerbi’s side strolled to victory, calling for them to be sacked following years of mismanagement under the owner, Farhad Moshiri – but it is the club’s seventh permanent manager inside seven years whose job is under immediate threat.
Lampard, who was deep in conversation with Everton’s director of football, Kevin Thelwell, after the defeat, said: “Since I have been here we have been in this situation of a relegation battle, last year and through this season. It is not a case of fear [for my job], it is a case of keep working. I cannot control the talk or the decisions when you are around this area of the table. This is what happens. When you lose a game like this, I absolutely understand any reaction. I don’t listen to too much of it because if you do it becomes your focus point.” The Everton manager refused to divulge what he said to the players after their third successive home defeat but admitted it was up to them, and him, to take responsibility for the team’s latest relegation fight. Lampard added: “I don’t think it is time to go into the dressing room talk. It is about personal responsibility and that is down to every player and myself. What could I do better? What can you do better the next time? I have seen enough on Saturday [in the 1-1 draw at Manchester City] in terms of parts of the performance [to believe I can turn things around]. What isn’t good enough is the consistency to get results. The first half I didn’t hate but the six minutes is not good enough from us and if you are going to perform like that defensively then you will lose games.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/frank-lampard-cant-control-talk-over-future-after-everton-thrashing;guardian;sports;5437

The first three episodes of Harry & Meghan were released on 8 December, followed by the final three a week later, in the lead-up to the publication of the duke's controversial memoir Spare.

Reporting its fourth-quarter earnings, Netflix revealed it had gained 7.7 million subscribers during the October-December period, which included the debut of an ad-supported option for $7 (£5.65) per month.

Both Buckingham and Kensington Palace have remained silent over the allegations in the documentary series, which included Harry saying that the Prince of Wales left him terrified after screaming and shouting at him during the Sandringham summit.

The duke, 38, claimed that Kensington Palace ""lied to protect my brother"" when it issued a statement denying a story William had bullied him out of the Royal Family.

He also accused his father, King Charles, of lying at the tense Megxit crisis meeting with the Queen in January 2020.

Harry's autobiographical book Spare had no shortage of explosive revelations either, which became the fastest-selling non-fiction book in the UK since records began in 1998 after its release on 10 January.

The duke has used the 550-plus pages of Spare to make headline-dominating claims including accusing William of physically attacking him and teasing him about his panic attacks, saying King Charles put his own interests above Harry's and, in a US broadcast interview, branding Camilla as the ""villain"" and ""dangerous"".

In the book, he admits for the first time that he has taken cocaine, smoked weed and tried magic mushrooms, and claims to have killed 25 people in Afghanistan during his two tours of duty.

Bradley Green, 24, and Nathan Daniels, 21, broke into Marwell Zoo in Hampshire and threw the object at a giraffe leaving it with a leg injury.

The pair broke into the zoo on 15 February 2021 when it was closed during lockdown and acted in a ""deplorable fashion"", according to a sentencing judge.

Appearing at Winchester Crown Court, the pair were sentenced to a 12-month community order with 120 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £750 compensation each to the zoo.

Judge Richard said: ""You, Green, broke a door at the rear of the giraffe house. You threw the bucket and bottle of disinfectant into the enclosure and you threw something at the giraffe which we see from the video that you took.

""It struck the giraffe on the neck. One of the giraffes had an injury to its leg, with two long gashes, which was discovered the next morning.

""It happened from the giraffe being distressed, knocking itself against the door.""

Penguins enclosure also damaged in break-in

A police helicopter and armed officers were called out after someone spotted the video on the social media site and called 999.

The injured giraffe was called Ursula, prosecuting Ellie Fargin said.

The zoo's exterior fence was cut so the pair could get into the grounds, while the doors of the giraffe and penguin enclosures were damaged.

Ms Fargin said the morning after the attack, a plastic disinfectant bottle, sticks and stones were found in the tiger enclosure, while a bucket and another bottle of disinfectant were found in the giraffe enclosure.

The penguins displayed ""behaviour consistent with anxiety and distress from being disturbed"".

Green, of Salterns Estate, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and damaging the giraffe enclosure.

Daniels, of Alexander Grove, pleaded guilty to damaging the penguin enclosure and a fence surrounding the zoo.

Daniel Reilly, defending Green who is said to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, said his client has ""deep regret and remorse"" for his actions and threw the bottle at the giraffe ""to get its attention"".

Graham Gilbert, defending Daniels, said: ""The behaviour showed a marked lack of maturity on his behalf.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230119161407/https://news.sky.com/story/men-sentenced-after-breaking-into-marwell-zoo-and-hitting-giraffe-with-bottle-before-posting-video-on-snapchat-12790305;skynews;entertainment & culture;1837

Keenan Anderson, the cousin of BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors, was arrested by police on 3 January following a traffic collision in Los Angeles.

Bodycam footage of the incident shows Mr Anderson initially complying with police before running away into traffic.

An officer on a motorcycle pursued Mr Anderson, catching up with him and ordering him to lie on the ground.

Back up officers arrived and struggled to restrain the 31-year-old English teacher on the ground, eventually tasering him multiple times.

Distressing footage shows Mr Anderson screaming for help and repeatedly shouting that the police were ""trying to kill"" him.

At one point, when an officer had his arm across his throat, he could be heard yelling that the officers were trying to ""George Floyd"" him, then accusing the police of being ""actors"".

He was then handcuffed and his legs restrained.

Following the arrest Mr Anderson, a father of one, was attended to by paramedics before being taken to a local hospital.

He went into cardiac arrest at hospital and died, around four and a half hours after officers began trying to restrain him.

A preliminary toxicology report showed Mr Anderson tested positive for cocaine and cannabis, police said, adding the Los Angeles County coroner's office is expected to conduct its own independent toxicology tests.

His cousin, Ms Cullors, said on Instagram that her cousin was ""killed by the LAPD"".

She added: ""Keenan deserves to be alive right now, his child deserves to be raised by his father. Keenan we will fight for you and for all of our loved ones impacted by state violence.""

Identities of officers involved not revealed

BLM supporters have since staged a protest outside the LAPD headquarters.

Footage of the incident involving Mr Anderson has been published online by the LAPD.

Police chief Michel Moore said the videos were released to ""demonstrate our commitment to full transparency and to judge this on the merits of what the investigation shows us and to ask for the public's patience as we go about this engagement"".

He added that it was ""unclear what role"" the officers played in Mr Anderson's death and they have, as yet, not been named by the LAPD.

Los Angeles County coroner's office is still investigating.

Three people have died since the start of the year during or following interactions with the LAPD, something which Mr Moore said he was ""deeply concerned"" about during the press conference.

Along with Mr Anderson's death from cardiac arrest, Oscar Sanchez, 35, and Takar Smith, 45, have both been shot and killed since the turn of the year.

Mr Smith was shot after threatening officers with a butcher's knife. The officers had failed to call a specialist mental health team to the incident after being informed by his wife on the 911 call that he suffered from schizophrenia and hadn't been taking his medication, meaning he was likely to be violent.

Mr Sanchez reportedly brandished a ""makeshift spear"" at police and, following a confrontation, was shot multiple times by the arresting officers.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230114144724/http://news.sky.com/story/relative-of-black-lives-matter-co-founder-dies-after-being-repeatedly-tasered-by-us-police-12786349;skynews;politics;1350

With his commitment to integrity, professionalism and accountability he pledged a new chapter of government.

His vision seemed to be one of getting things done efficiently and drama-free rather than lurching from one self-inflicted scandal to another.

But as he is quickly finding out, it's easier said than done.

And so he has begun 2023 with a new set of sleaze allegations.

The characters and the plot lines though are all too familiar.

Firstly, Conservative Party chair Nadhim Zahawi is accused of impropriety over his financial affairs, and not for the first time.

He has always insisted he does everything by the book, but the latest revelation that he agreed to a multimillion-pound deal after a dispute with HMRC during his time as chancellor, eventually became too embarrassing for the Prime Minister.

Under mounting pressure over the weekend, the PM eventually referred it to his ethics advisor, admitting there are ""questions to be answered"".

And as if that wasn't enough, his old frenemy Boris Johnson has proved he does not need to be in Number 10 to cause problems.

At the heart of this controversy is an issue that plagued him in office and has followed him to the backbenches.

A tendency to live well beyond his means and periodically ask for handouts has dragged down another of Johnson's willing friends, this time BBC chair Richard Sharp who helped him secure an £800,000 loan in 2020.

2125;2125;Rashford’s reset at full tilt after Ten Hag reshapes United’s headspace;2023-01-21T12:30:06Z;['David Hytner'];['Marcus Rashford', 'Manchester United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"When picking over the Marcus Rashford renaissance, surely the feelgood story of the season, one that no football fan resents irrespective of allegiance, it is easy to linger on the biggest moments. The decisive goals for a resurgent Manchester United in the Premier League against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City. The comeback strike for England at the World Cup against Iran with virtually his first touch at international level since the penalty miss in the Euro 2020 final. The two-goal salvo against Wales in the next tie, including the banging free-kick. Rashford’s managers though, for club and country, are drawn to something else, a lower-profile flicker but one that captures his essence – the drive and clarity that has underpinned his journey from the time when United first scouted him as a six-year-old. It was the towering header against West Ham at the end of October that gave United a 1-0 home win. Christian Eriksen had stood up the cross and, when Rashford threw himself at it, Erik ten Hag could feel a glow of satisfaction.
The United manager had identified heading as an area Rashford could improve on and asked his assistant coach, Benni McCarthy, to work on it with him. “Marcus is a truly dedicated trainer and after every session he always wants to finish a series of balls on goal,” Ten Hag told Voetbal International in December. “Right foot, left foot. From different angles, from crosses. And then with those headers.” Rashford had scored with one in United’s previous game against Sheriff in the Europa League. Now this. “The higher you go, the more it’s about the details,” Ten Hag said. “It was a great moment against West Ham.” Gareth Southgate agreed. “I’ve seen Marcus arrive at the far post with a header, which is quite staggering,” the England manager said on the day he recalled him for his World Cup squad. Perhaps, West Ham was the point that sealed the deal. “They are the things that we’ve talked about over the years,” Southgate said. “He’s looking more like the player we’ve seen.”
Rashford’s commitment has never been in doubt. Even during his lost season last time out, the United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, always felt he trained well. But something was blocked and there came to be the sense that the harder Rashford tried, the worse things got for him. When he crossed the white line for games, it was as if all the old certainties deserted him. Rangnick considered him an enigma. He could not explain what was happening. Rashford told Rangnick he wanted to play off the left rather than the right but it was not one specific factor that made everything come off the rails, rather a damaging accumulation of them. Rashford’s season had been framed by his final act of the previous one – the missed penalty in the Euro 2020 final shootout defeat against Italy and the trauma of the fallout, which was marked by racist abuse on social media. There was the shoulder surgery that meant he did not return until mid-October and by then United were in crisis, enduring the dog days of Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the Old Trafford humiliations against Liverpool and Manchester City. Rangnick took over in early December after the brief Michael Carrick interlude but the rot was deep, United set for the worst season of their Premier League history; condemnation as the club’s worst team since the late 1980s. When United suspended Mason Greenwood after rape allegations on 30 January, Rangnick demanded the club sign a new forward before the winter window closed only to be denied; a player in that area was not a part of the long-term plan at that point, he was told. Rangnick went crackers at the board. What the episode also tells us is that he did not see Rashford as any kind of solution.
Then there was Cristiano Ronaldo, who Rashford has described as one of his idols. “To have the opportunity to play with him is unbelievable, it’s something I can keep with me forever,” he said during the World Cup, after Ronaldo’s United contract had been terminated. But Ronaldo’s presence last season was not always a positive for Rashford; he would sometimes have a go at him if Rashford did not get the ball to him. Rangnick felt United had to play two games – one against the opposition, the other to keep Ronaldo happy – and Rashford could be guilty of looking for impossible passes to him. The situation sapped at Rashford’s fragile confidence and the low points piled up. Rashford heard howls of frustration from the Old Trafford crowd (previously unthinkable) but some of his performances were difficult to watch. Atlético Madrid at home, anyone? That was on 15 March and two days later Southgate named his England squad for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. Everyone could see Rashford did not merit inclusion but those around him hoped Southgate could do him a favour, give him a needed boost by calling him up and sparking something. They felt Rashford would benefit from the secure environment Southgate has created with England and it probably said a lot by inference about the one in which the player was labouring at United. Southgate omitted him and did so while making the point that Rashford had pulled out of six of the previous eight squads. Rashford was in and out of the United team. He was reportedly considering his future at the club. This was yet another setback. The dressing room at United was fractured. There was no team spirit, no fighting for each other, no mental toughness. In his Voetbal International interview, Ten Hag described the attitude of the squad he inherited as “blase” while he remembered an episode from his second game – the 4-0 drubbing at Brentford last August.
“Beforehand, I saw one of our players shake his head and say with a sigh: ‘It is much too hot to play football,’” Ten Hag said. “I thought: ‘What is this? The opponent also suffers from it. You have to pull yourself together. You must have hardness.’ That was what was missing – that ambition. It’s purely about mentality. Brentford ran eight miles more than we did that afternoon.” Rashford used a rare full pre-season to enter beast mode, working out from early June with a personal coach. He posted a picture on Monday – in the wake of his derby winner against City – training in only his shorts, socks and boots. The caption? “Summer ’22.” But the more important reset came on a psychological level, with Rashford admitting in October that mental health problems had been a part of it last season.
“It’s a complete different energy around the club and the training ground and that puts me in a better headspace,” he said. “I was struggling at times with more mental things. That’s the biggest difference from last season. Too often, I wasn’t in the right headspace for games. I wasn’t surprised by some of the stuff that was happening.” Rashford has celebrated his most recent goals by pointing at his temple. He has looked freer this season, happier; the hard graft at Carrington once again transferring to matchday. Maybe, the engagement to his long-term girlfriend, Lucia Loi, after the end of last season has added to the serenity. The goals are back (it is 16 in 27 games for United); and so are the jet-heeled bursts past opponents, the silky skills. When Rashford overslept and missed the pre-match meeting before Wolves on New Year’s Eve – an uncharacteristic lapse – Ten Hag dropped him but he came off the bench to score the winner. When he took his first penalty since the Italy final against Everton in the FA Cup this month, he scored. And so to Arsenal on Sunday afternoon, against whom it all started for Rashford. In February 2016, Louis van Gaal gave him his league debut against them as an 18-year-old and watched him score twice in a 3-2 win. Now, as then, Rashford can sense possibility.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/rashfords-reset-at-full-tilt-after-ten-hag-reshapes-manchester-uniteds-headspace;guardian;sports;2125
2243;2243;Mystery of England’s crab and lobster die-offs deepens as experts find no clear cause;2023-01-20T16:54:57Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Marine life', 'Fishing', 'Fishing industry', 'Pollution', 'Fish', 'England', 'UK news', 'Oceans', 'Conservation', 'Wildlife', 'Food', 'Environment', 'Animals'];;The mystery behind the deaths of thousands of crabs and lobsters along England’s north-east coast has developed a further twist, with experts saying it could be down to a new disease. The die-offs, which began in autumn 2021 and recurred at various points in 2022, affected at least 70km (43 miles) of the coastline, with some of the crustaceans showing an unusual twitching while dying. An initial government investigation, published in May 2021, said the phenomenon could have been caused by a naturally occurring harmful algal bloom. However, research commissioned by the North East Fishing Collective (NEFC) and carried out by researchers at the universities of York, Newcastle and Durham and Hull suggested pyridine, a common industrial chemical, was a more probable cause. Now a report by an independent panel of experts, convened by the chief scientific adviser to the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, has said that while it was not possible “to identify a clear and convincing single cause for the unusual crustacean mortality” it was unlikely algal blooms were to blame, as they were unlikely to explain the twitching or deaths during winter months. The team also add it is very unlikely that the die-offs are a result of a pyridine or another toxic pollutant. Crispin Halsall, a professor of environmental organic chemistry at Lancaster University and an author of the report, said the team scrutinised the findings from Newcastle University and other sources carefully – although it did not collect or analyse new samples. “The finding of the panel and my group was that we just could not find evidence for high levels of pyridine in the coastal seawater at levels, which are going to cause acute toxicity to crabs,” he said. The report noted that a prolonged, substantial release of a toxic chemical would be necessary to result in the observed die-offs, which Halsall said was not the case, adding that the paper put “the pyridine story to bed”. Another suggested cause, capital dredging on the Tees, was deemed exceptionally unlikely to be the reason for the die-offs. However, the report suggested another possibility: the deaths could be down to a novel pathogen, a cause deemed “about as likely as not” – however they stress there is a lack of direct evidence of such a pathogen. The report added it was possible that several of the stressors considered could have operated together to lead the die-off, a point reiterated by Dr Tammy Horton, a research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre and co-author. “For example if there was a harmful algal bloom, that could have given greater stress to the environment generally, there could have been slightly lower oxygen as a result of that, and that could have triggered the mass mortality as they are less able to cope with viral load, for example, of this potential new pathogen,” she said. The report was met with criticism by academics from the universities of York, Newcastle and Durham. “Given that the weight of evidence indicates an industrial source for the die-offs, it is disappointing to see that the independent expert panel have reached the conclusion that the die-offs were probably caused by an unknown pathogen, despite there being no direct evidence for this.

5625;5625;The Guardian view on Afghanistan’s suffering: the war against women | Editorial;2023-01-02T18:30:22Z;['Editorial'];"['Afghanistan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Taliban', 'Women', 'Society', ""Women's suffrage"", 'Pakistan', 'Islamic State']";;"The Taliban’s relentless campaign against women is not only a matter of rights, but of survival. It is not only cruel and oppressive, but deadly. In a country already on its knees, where 97% of the population live in poverty, two-thirds need humanitarian assistance, 20 million face acute hunger and parents sell kidneys to feed their families, it has made life still more desperate. By banning women from working for NGOs, they are denying essential, life-saving services to women and children. Almost all the large aid agencies have suspended operations and the United Nations has paused some “time-critical” programmes. Major world powers have urged the Taliban to immediately reverse their “reckless and dangerous” decision, while UN agency chiefs described female staff as key to every aspect of the humanitarian response. In many cases, these staff – who number in the tens of thousands – are also the only breadwinners in their households. Denying them their salaries ensures that women, children (and, incidentally, men too) will starve. The Taliban’s earlier decision to bar women from universities – and reportedly even primary education – means that no more female doctors or teachers will be trained. Teenage girls have already been kept out of school for almost a year and a half. The Taliban strove to create the impression of a more moderate “Taliban 2.0” before their return to power, promising not to repeat the cruelties of the 1990s regime. But the new Taliban look more and more like the old one. If there are more moderate figures in the ranks, they are unable to prevail. Last month, there was the first public execution since their return to power. Women have been among those punished in public floggings. If the Taliban’s priorities were not so horrific, they would be bizarre: this viciousness appears to be all they care about, despite the country’s parlous state in every possible regard. Relations with Islamabad are breaking down as cross-border attacks by the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) increase. In December, members of the TTP – separate to but allied with the Afghan Taliban – overpowered guards at a counter-terrorism facility in Pakistan and seized control. As the security situation deteriorates, Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on the Pakistani and Russian embassies in Kabul. The Chinese ambassador ordered all nationals to leave the country after gunmen attacked a hotel used by Chinese businessmen. These developments are not merely a diplomatic problem for the Taliban; hopes of income to help replace the vanished foreign aid that shored up the country for so long have disappeared. Now the last props are being removed as aid operations halt, at terrible cost. In these grim times, women have demonstrated extraordinary courage and resilience in challenging the Taliban’s harsh rule. Men have taken a stand beside them. They deserve not only admiration, but support. The UK did extremely poorly at evacuating Afghans before Kabul fell last year. As of early December, not one person had been accepted and evacuated under the Home Office’s Afghan citizens resettlement scheme, which was launched in January for those at risk because they had worked for or were affiliated with the British government. Afghans, and especially those brave enough to challenge this regime, need more than words from the British government.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-afghanistans-suffering-the-war-against-women;guardian;politics;5625
4172;4172;Pegasus by Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud review – spyware hiding in plain sight;2023-01-11T11:00:15Z;['Charles Arthur'];['Science and nature books', 'Books', 'Espionage', 'Culture', 'Technology', 'Society books'];;"When asked what superpower they would wish for, quite a lot of people choose invisibility. The desire to be able to spy unnoticed on others appeals to something in our nature: a wish for knowledge without retribution. The arrival of the mobile phone, and then the smartphone, has brought that power of invisible oversight to governments willing to pay the comparatively small cost – some millions of pounds – of licensing invasive software that will silently monitor a phone. The most popular one (that we know about) is called Pegasus, created by an Israeli company called NSO. Pegasus originally arrived in the form of a text message from an unfamiliar number. If the recipient clicked on it, the phone would be infected. Later versions didn’t even need that interaction: the text message alone could be the agent of infection. The phone then became a portal for the government controllers: they could download any content, surreptitiously turn on the camera or microphone, listen to any call. The infection persisted until the phone was restarted – at which point the controllers would notice, and send another infecting message. The fundamental problem with Pegasus is that of any superpower: it’s too easy, and tempting, to misuse. NSO, and especially its chief executive, have publicly insisted that sales are conditional on the software being used only to target criminals. (And never American phone numbers; NSO knows not to anger the biggest beast.) But plenty of authoritarian states, and those wobbling on the edge, see telling the truth as a criminal act – and thus target journalists and lawyers too. NSO implies that it can’t know which individuals have been targeted. The opening of Pegasus appears to contradict that: two journalists, Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud of the French investigative journalism outlet Forbidden Stories, receive a list of 50,000 phone numbers from all over the world with a mysterious series of dates and times attached. As they discover, the numbers, dates and times accord with mobile phones in multiple countries, and the time of attempted or successful infection. (The leak’s timing overlaps intriguingly with a case heard in London in 2021, during which it emerged that Pegasus was used to spy on a British lawyer, Baroness Shackleton, and her client, Princess Haya, who was seeking a divorce from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.)
The book focuses on how the duo first builds up a team that can establish who has been targeted and then coordinates media partners, including the Guardian, to reveal how widespread this abuse is. It makes for absorbing reading, in which key roles are played by an app called Truecaller, which once installed on a phone will upload your contacts’ names and numbers to create a global “identity list”, and a former hacker from the LulzSec group, which for a few wild months in 2011 made headlines around the world for, among other things, leaking the names of 73,000 X Factor US contestants. He spots the tiny residues left behind by Pegasus on infected phones. Overall, it’s a celebration of journalism and hacking being used to unmask the bad guys. As part of their work, the team also released an app that would let people find out if they’d been infected by Pegasus. It’s a neat piece of table-turning on the surveillance society. The one frustration is that NSO refuses to be held accountable for how its product is abused. This spites our sense of justice. Since the book was written, the US Department of Commerce has blacklisted NSO, and its CEO is leaving while NSO says it will focus on sales to Nato members. But the latter still includes countries that targeted journalists. We are not yet safe from the invisible man. • Charles Arthur is the author of Social Warming: How Social Media Polarises Us All.

557;557;Secret Byrd review – cloak-and-dagger concert hails a musical genius;2023-01-29T11:07:15Z;['Clive Paget'];['Classical music', 'Choral music', 'Culture', 'Music', 'William Byrd'];;"When William Byrd and his mentor Thomas Tallis published their Cantiones Sacrae in 1575, it might have suggested a bright future for Anglican music. Yet within a decade Tallis was dead and Byrd had embraced Catholicism. As recusants refusing to attend Protestant services, Byrd and his wife were repeatedly fined, their names placed on a government watchlist. For England’s Catholics, worship was driven underground, the mass conducted by outlawed priests in private houses. The spirit of that clandestine celebration of a Catholic mass is at the heart of Bill Barclay’s Secret Byrd, an immersive concert held in the candlelit crypt of London’s St Martin-in-the-Fields. The celebrants are vocal ensemble the Gesualdo Six, nattily done up in doublet and hose, with director Owain Park swapping contemporary civvies for sombre robes as the officiating priest. Clasping hands around a fruit-laden supper table, they sing Byrd’s sublime Mass for Five Voices from authentic single-voice part books while Parks anoints them with holy water. At an ominous pounding on the door, the audience is instructed to huddle on the floor as the candles are extinguished. It’s all chillingly authentic, but while Barclay intends spectators to move around during the performance, he provides little directorial impetus for doing so, making sightlines an issue at times.
Musically it’s glorious. The all-male voices ring out with intonational precision and an almost ecstatic connection to text that would have delighted Byrd, who intended the words to cut through the polyphonic underpinning. The choristers even double as waiters, serving bread and soup to the audience at the moment of communion. Their partners are Fretwork, the masters of viol consorts, who occasionally support the voices but chiefly fill in between the mass movements. Their uplifting contributions, including a buoyant account of Byrd’s folksong-inspired Fantasia upon Browning, leaven a fascinating but otherwise sober-minded affair. Dubbed the “father of English musick”, Byrd was a great artist, a brave man, and a practising believer in freedom of thought. What better way to open this year’s 400th anniversary celebrations. • Touring the US and the UK throughout the year.

2099;2099;Back to the future: how Mastodon is restoring the lost art of online conversation | John Naughton;2023-01-21T16:00:11Z;['John Naughton'];['Mastodon', 'Technology', 'X', 'Blogging', 'Internet', 'Digital media', 'Social media', 'Elon Musk'];;"When Twitter first appeared in July 2006, I was enchanted by it. At one point, some geek created an app that logged tweets and geolocated them in real time on a map of the world, so you could watch little dots popping up all over the globe. (I even made a short video recording of my screen and set it to music, but didn’t put it online because I didn’t own the music rights, and now I can’t find it. Sigh – such is digital life.) What I loved about Twitter at the beginning was that it enabled you to plug into the thought streams of people you liked or admired. Like all good things, though, that came to an end when the platform embarked on the algorithmic curation of users’ feeds to increase “engagement” (and, it hoped, profits). And from then on, it became increasingly tiresome, though I kept my account. But when it became clear that Elon Musk was going to buy the platform – and wreak havoc – I decided to explore possible alternatives. Like many other people, my gaze alighted on Mastodon as a possible refuge from the Musk-induced madness. After all, it offered its users the same kind of microblogging facilities. But there the similarities ended. Twitter is a single site. Mastodon, in contrast, is a protocol – “a system of rules for spinning up your own social network that can also interact with any other following the same code”. So whereas Twitter is a universe, Mastodon is what has come to be called a “fediverse” – that is, a decentralised network made up of a large number of semi-independent nodes, or as one observer put it: “A distributed network of Twitter-like services.” That sounds intimidating, but in reality, it’s relatively straightforward. Joining Twitter involves just signing up on twitter.com; but to become a Mastodon user, you have to sign up to one of those semi-independent nodes. They’re basically just servers run by individuals or groups, and Mastodon helpfully provides a list of ones that you might consider joining. Once in, your identity is linked to the server on which you have an account. So if you’ve chosen the username “vici” on the server arsenalfc.social, then your username will be @vici@arsenalfc.social. And you can follow any other Mastodon user, no matter what server they happen to be on.
From then on, it’s a bit like using Twitter – posting rather than tweeting, reposting, liking and so on. The big difference is you only see stuff that those whom you follow have posted: your feed is not algorithmically curated for some venture capitalist’s benefit. (Mastodon is open source and administered by a German-based non-profit company, Mastodon gGmbH.) If you’re coming from Twitter, the first thing you’ll notice about Mastodon is that it seems quieter, somehow – there’s less shouting, less aggro, less posturing, less humblebragging. And of course it may also seem duller at first, because you’re only seeing what your “followees” (is that a word?) have posted or reposted. You’ll also notice that if one of your contacts wants to post something that they feel might be shocking or disturbing, they have been able to flag it beforehand so you don’t click on it. So far, so good. But since this is technology, there are downsides. The most obvious one is that while you are no longer at the whimsical mercy of an erratic digital emperor called Elon, the administrator of your chosen Mastodon server may not be an angel (or a Democrat) either – as one blogger discovered. “I believed the Mastodon propaganda,” he wrote, “and picked out a small site from the list at joinmastodon.org. That small site turned out to be run by fascists and does not allow one to cancel one’s account. I left and moved on to a small political site… which kicked my moderate liberal ass out for being too radical. I then decided that being one bird in a large flock was a good idea and signed up for an account at mastodon.social, the Mastodon mother site.” So is it a substitute for Twitter? I don’t think so, any more than avocados are a substitute for mangoes. Twitter is really for broadcasting – for letting the world at large know what you think, or alerting people to your forthcoming book/event/podcast, or complaining about potholes, Rishi Sunak, Brexit, the metaverse and the general awfulness of everything. At its best, Mastodon seems to be more about conversation rather than shouting, and in that sense reminds me of the early internet – in the 1980s, before the world wide web – and in particular of Usenet, the network’s first global online discussion space. In which case, wouldn’t it be ironic if the Martian adventurer Musk’s chaotic ownership of Twitter turned out to be bringing us back to the future? What I’ve been reading Freedom of religion Remembering Pope Benedict’s Challenge is a fascinating editorial in Noema magazine by Nathan Gardels on the late pontiff’s debate with German philosopher Jürgen Habermas about democratic values.

833;833;Sean Dyche set to be Everton manager as Newcastle strike £40m Gordon deal;2023-01-27T16:28:39Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Everton', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Sean Dyche is expected to be named as Everton’s manager this weekend after Marcelo Bielsa told the club he would only take full charge in the summer. The arrival of Dyche is set to coincide with the departure of Anthony Gordon to Newcastle in a £40m deal. Bielsa was the first choice of Everton’s owner, Farhad Moshiri, and flew to London on Thursday to hold further talks with club officials. That raised their hopes of enticing the Argentinian to Goodison Park, despite his reservations over the state of the club and the squad and his record of never taking over a European club mid-season.
The 67-year-old remained unconvinced about taking charge of Everton’s fight against relegation at this stage, however. Bielsa informed Everton he would join now but would work behind the scenes until the end of the season, coaching the under-21s and younger players as the club adapted to his methods. That would have left Everton needing an interim manager for the precarious task of keeping them in the Premier League and was not a situation the club was willing to accept. The end of negotiations with Bielsa cleared the way for Dyche to succeed Frank Lampard and negotiations started on Friday over what is likely to be a two-and-a-half-year contract for the former Burnley manager. The make-up of his backroom staff is being finalised, with his long-time Burnley assistant Ian Woan involved.
Dyche has been out of work since being sacked by Burnley in April and, unlike Bielsa, made it clear he would relish the opportunity to relaunch his Premier League managerial career at Everton during talks with the director of football, Kevin Thelwell. He would take over a team that have lost 11 of their past 14 matches in all competitions and lie joint-bottom of the Premier League. Gordon is preparing to head out of Everton after Newcastle agreed to buy the forward for £40m. Everton rejected a similar sum last summer from Chelsea. The 21-year-old missed three days of training this week while negotiations were being held and is keen on the move. His transfer, which is subject to a medical, would release funds for Everton to spend before Tuesday’s deadline.

2012;2012;Can victims of crime  hope for justice from a crumbling system? | Yvonne Roberts;2023-01-22T07:30:29Z;['Yvonne Roberts'];['Rape and sexual assault', 'Law', 'Society', 'Police', 'Crime', 'Domestic violence', 'UK news'];;"Channel 4’s drama series, The Light in the Hall, featuring the remarkable Joanna Scanlan, exposes the damage inflicted on the family and friends of a teenager murdered 18 years earlier whose body has never been found (hence the light on in the hall) and whose alleged killer is released on parole against the wishes of dead girl’s mother. However, the mental injuries, the injustices inflicted and the disregarded demands of victims are rarely so central. After police officer David Carrick’s conviction on 51 charges of rape and domestic abuse, the Met announced it was reviewing a further 1,633 cases of domestic and sexual abuse involving more than 800 officers. Every police force in England and Wales is reviewing allegations of domestic and sexual abuse relating to officers dating back a decade. Potentially, that’s a significant number of historical victims and more women coming forward. But how much faith can they have in what follows? Victims face loss, injury and trauma. Months pass in which no information is forthcoming about what has happened to their case. By last September, the crown courts had 62,766 outstanding cases – 28% of them outstanding for more than a year. In magistrates courts, there were 347,820 such cases. Justice is not being seen to be done. The Victims’ Code establishes 12 principles, including a victim’s right to be kept informed about an investigation and the aftermath, support and compensation. In a survey in 2021, only 29% of victims knew about the code. Last May, after a delay of seven years, the government published draft legislation paving the way for the first victims law. Among the measures, victims will have the right to attend Parole Board hearings and submit questions.
The cross-party justice committee subsequently delivered a blistering critique of the bill’s failings and made 47 recommendations. Last September, the redoubtable Vera Baird resigned as victims’ commissioner, champion of the interests of victims, saying that her post had been downgraded and sidelined. A new commissioner won’t be appointed until the spring, so the “weak” bill may miss some proper scrutiny as it passes through parliament. Last Friday, the government said it had accepted some of the committee’s recommendations, including officially classifying bereaved families and the children born of rape as victims in need of increased support. The victims’ commissioner’s powers will also be strengthened and the number of independent sexual violence advocates and independent domestic violence advocates, vital in supporting women, will increase from 300 to 1,000. Welcome – and yet. Women’s support services are exhausted, broken and unable to meet demand, let alone a tidal wave that may be triggered by increased confidence that victims’ voices will be heard. The government’s promised extra funding is but a brick in a collapsing wall. Justin Russell, chief inspector of probation services for England and Wales, has expressed “deep concerns” about the service’s ability to assess risk. His comments followed the sentencing of Damien Bendall, who killed three children and his pregnant partner while on probation. Six-year-old Collette Gallacher was raped and murdered by Adam Stein in 1986. Twice he has been paroled, against the wishes of Collette’s sisters, Claire and Lauren. Twice Stein, given a false name and a location unknown to the sisters, has been recalled to prison. He has just been jailed for four years for another offence. The sisters believe they have a right to know his offence in a bid to stop him being given parole in 2026. A right denied. Too often, bereaved families are the guardians of the public’s safety and victims are left isolated as they battle for their rights. • Yvonne Roberts is a freelance journalist, writer and broadcaster";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/can-victims-of-hope-for-justice-from-a-crumbling-system;guardian;politics;2012
831;831;Paul Ince rolls back into Old Trafford primed for another battle;2023-01-27T16:32:01Z;['David Hytner'];['FA Cup', 'Manchester United', 'Reading', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Everybody remembers the story of how Sir Alex Ferguson broke up a party at Lee Sharpe’s house, with Ryan Giggs also there, mainly because it was so hilarious and for the way that both of the Manchester United players have told it. According to Sharpe, before Ferguson absolutely carpeted him and Giggs, the manager “had the face on with bits of froth at the corners of his mouth”. Not everybody will remember what Ferguson did next. He sent Giggs to live with Paul Ince for six months or so in an attempt to keep his young star on the straight and narrow. At which point, it is probably worth clarifying that it was not just Ince – rather Ince and his wife, Claire. Putting Giggs with Paul Ince alone at that point, in the early 1990s, would not have been smart. Ince, who is six years older, had signed for United from West Ham in 1989 – aged 21 – and it is fair to say that he enjoyed a night out, too. So perhaps this is really a tale about Claire, Ince’s rock, and what an incredible woman she is. But what it showed was the trust that Ferguson had in Ince, how he always saw him as a leader, somebody to guide his first great team at Old Trafford.
The memories of Ince’s United career will hurtle back on Saturday night when he emerges from the Old Trafford tunnel as the Reading manager for the FA Cup fourth-round tie. Back in his playing days, Ince would walk out last, pulling on his No 8 shirt as he did so, and that was the point when he was primed for battle, to do whatever it took to win, to be – as he liked to put it – the Guv’nor. Talk to anybody who knows Ince and one word recurs – relentless. Ince was the boy from Dagenham who had very little, no stability at home, who had to fight for everything and would do so literally with the street gang that he was drawn into as a teenager. When it was game time at United, it was as if he flicked a switch. The power would surge and continue surging. Ince arrived at Old Trafford under something of a cloud owing to the publication of a photograph of him in a United shirt before the transfer from West Ham had been signed off. It was not his fault. The picture was taken on the understanding that it would be used only when everything was done. Hearing an erroneous rumour that it was, the photographer and the Daily Express jumped the gun. Ince was a villain in the eyes of the West Ham support. He would also leave United in acrimonious circumstances, forced out by Ferguson in 1995 after their sometimes volatile relationship soured; the manager felt that Ince had become too arrogant and lacked the tactical discipline to play how he wanted him to play. Ince then complicated his United legacy by returning from Internazionale to join Liverpool. But what about the years in between when Ince was one of the principal catalysts for change at United? He started slowly. His dream was to play with his idol, Bryan Robson, and, at first, he seemed to be in awe of him. The sheer scale of United as a club was a problem. Ince would not score a league goal until March 1991.
By then, he was an FA Cup winner after the run that saved Ferguson and, by the end of 1990-91, he had a European Cup Winners’ Cup medal, too, having been part of the victory over Barcelona in Rotterdam. It was becoming clear to the United support why Ferguson had placed his faith in him. The following season brought the League Cup but the agony of missing out to Leeds in the title race, Ince now a mainstay in midfield, and then it truly came together. Ince has said that the highlight of his career was the 1992-93 title win, United’s first in 26 years, which would not have been possible without him. Ferguson signed Eric Cantona from Leeds in November and played him up front with Mark Hughes while Brian McClair dropped back into midfield, although only nominally. McClair’s instinct remained to get forward, leaving Ince to hold it together in what felt like a 4-1-5 formation, the width supplied by Giggs and Sharpe or Andrei Kanchelskis. Ince was a one-man wrecking crew, the best midfielder in the league that season and in the two that followed; an automatic pick for the team of the year each time. He enabled everyone around him to play but, boy, did he play himself, bringing goals – some spectacular – and barnstorming dribbles. Things got even better when Ferguson added Roy Keane to play alongside Ince in 1993-94, United winning a league and FA Cup double. Ince’s Guv’nor nickname was the source of debate. It reflected his brashness – the number plate on his car was GUV 8 – and there was a north-south divide element to it; the assumption in Manchester that this was what you got with cockneys. It was the same with David Beckham and Teddy Sheringham, Ferguson once muttering about there being “something in the water down there”. Yet Ferguson knew if you did not have a character, you did not have a player, and what the United fans loved about Ince was how he would fight. That included him dispatching Anders Limpar into the Old Trafford hoardings during the 21-man brawl with Arsenal in October 1990 and his involvement in the Cantona kung fu kick game at Crystal Palace in January 1995.
Ince was tried at Croydon magistrates court for threatening behaviour and assaulting a Palace fan, with the prosecution alleging that after the Cantona incident Ince had beckoned opposition supporters to him and said: “Come on. We will take the fucking lot of you.” He would be found not guilty. Ince is rather more cerebral these days, his head ruling his heart in the Reading dugout, his renaissance as a manager the story he would rather push. The United crowd will see someone else.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/paul-ince-returns-to-manchester-united-as-a-more-cerebral-character;guardian;sports;831

What are your consumer rights? What should I do if I’m due to travel on Saturday? First things first: flights have been cancelled, so the advice from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is not to go to the airport. In the short-term, Flybe customers are being told it would be most effective to find another way to travel, such as booking new flights, or, if possible, taking a train or a coach. The CAA added: “For flights operated by Flybe franchise partners (Stobart Air, Eastern Airways, and Blue Islands) passengers should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements. Richard Moriarty, the CAA’s chief executive, said: “Flybe also operated a number of codeshare partnerships with international airlines. If you have an international ticket, you should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements.” Can I get reduced fares if I rebook? The CAA said passengers with Flybe bookings may be able to find reduced air and rail fares on offer from airlines who operate Flybe’s old routes and other providers. Am I protected if I booked with a credit or debit card Passengers who booked with a credit card could be protected under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which makes the lender jointly liable. In practice, this means the cost of bookings valued between £100 and £30,000 could be refunded by the credit card company. Debit cards are not covered by the same provision, but users could have some protection under the card issuer’s charge-back rules. The CAA said that, if passengers bought travel insurance that includes cover for scheduled airline failure, known as Safi, they should contact their insurer. “If you did not book directly with Flybe and purchased your tickets through a third party, you should contact your booking or travel agent in the first instance.” However, travellers should not assume their policy will cover them in this case – many do not include provisions for airlines entering administration.
What if I bought a package holiday? The CAA said: “If you have booked a trip that includes flights and hotels with a travel firm that holds an Atol (air travel organiser’s licence) and received confirmation that you are Atol protected, the travel firm is responsible for your flight arrangements and must either make alternative flights available for you so that your trip can continue or provide a full refund. If you are abroad, it should make arrangements to bring you home at the end of your trip. Contact the Atol travel firm for more information.” Will the government repatriate me? In a word, no. The CAA said: “The government has not commissioned the CAA to organise any repatriation flights as there is capacity in the market for people to travel via alternative airlines, rail and coach operations.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/28/your-consumer-rights-flight-with-flybe-administration;guardian;entertainment & culture;693

The child's mother, Jennifer Keppie, has warned other parents of the 'deodorant bomb' stunt, which has left her son Jay with the life-changing injury.

She wrote on social media: ""There is a 'craze' at the moment of making deodorant bombs, where kids are sticking sharp objects into deodorant cans and hitting them, hoping to release the gas and watch the can spin (or something to that effect).

""As kids we have all done things that were risky and dangerous without a second thought at the consequences if anything went wrong. Unfortunately for us, it went wrong.

3187;3187;Allegri’s unhappy parallel propels ‘zany’ Spalletti and Napoli in pasting | Nicky Bandini;2023-01-16T12:47:20Z;['Nicky Bandini'];['Serie A', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"It took 30 years for Massimiliano Allegri’s career to come full circle. In May 1993, as a young midfielder, he scored the goal that set Pescara on the way to an unforgettable 5-1 win over Juventus. The Bianconeri would never concede that many again in Serie A until Allegri, as manager, took them to face Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Friday night. The context was very different. Pescara were already relegated in 1993 while Juventus’s minds were on the beach after winning the Uefa Cup a fortnight before. This season, everything is still to play for. Allegri’s team travelled to Naples with aspirations of reopening the title race.
They had won eight league games in a row, keeping a clean sheet every time. After a shabby start, Juventus were suddenly back in contention, seven points off top spot. Napoli, for the first time, looked vulnerable, their undefeated start to the season ended with a 1-0 loss to Internazionale on their return from the winter break. Among Juventus’s greatest successes during their recent run of nine consecutive league titles was to make even outsiders buy into their “fino alla fine” mantra – “until the end” – creating an aura of inevitability. They were the team who won 25 out of 26 to climb from 12th to first in 2015-16, the ones who always found a goal in the 90th minute when they needed it. – that villain at the end of the horror movie who simply refuses to die. There is more than one genre of script to be written in football, though. Napoli, owned by the film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis, have been working on an old-fashioned underdog tale. They are chasing a first league title in 33 years on a budget half the size of their opponents this weekend. No side from outside Milan or Turin has won Serie A since 2001. Napoli’s manager, Luciano Spalletti, leaned into the narrative last week, insisting: “There is no comparison between me and Allegri. His medals speak clearly … he is part of a different category. He is above me and I need to learn from him.”
Does he really believe it, or was he just playing a role? Spalletti has a reputation as a nearly man within Italian football, yet his trophy cabinet is hardly empty. He was the one who led Roma to Coppa Italia triumphs in 2007 and 2008 – their first cup successes since 1991, and not repeated since. He won back-to-back league titles with Zenit in Russia. He did the better job of putting his team in position to succeed on Friday, sending Napoli out in their usual 4-3-3 and with familiar instructions to hold the ball high up the pitch. Allegri gambled with something new: drafting Federico Chiesa in at right wing-back in a 3-5-2.
The Italian had sparkled in cameo appearances, but this was a bold gambit to line him up in an unfamiliar position for his first start since tearing a cruciate ligament a year ago. Even more so when you consider that he would be opposite the breakout talent of this Serie A season, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. With a different manager, this might have been conceived as an aggressive strategy, attack as a form of defence. But Allegri’s Juventus simply do not play that way. Their run of wins had been built on a deep line, disciplined positional play and ruthlessness in key moments. That and, looking at the xG data, a good pinch of luck. Napoli went after Chiesa repeatedly in the first half, or rather went behind him as he repeatedly got caught up the pitch. Then again, they were dominating Juventus on the opposite flank and through the middle as well. Their opening goal came from the right, Matteo Politano’s cross met by an acrobatic volley from Kvaratskhelia, which Wojciech Szczesny could only claw away for a moment before Victor Osimhen arrived to head home. A defence that endured 770 minutes without conceding a goal lasted just 14 in Naples, and Kvaratskhelia made it 2-0 before half-time, striding on to Osimhen’s square ball with Chiesa lost at sea. Ángel Di María quickly halved the deficit and Juventus nearly pulled level when Amir Rrahmani deflected a cross toward his own net, but Alex Meret intervened with a stunning reflex save. At their best, going forward, Juventus were dangerous, as should probably be expected of a side featuring a pair of World Cup winners (one, Leandro Paredes, off the bench) as well as another finalist in Adrien Rabiot. Without the ball, though, they were a mess, and Napoli made sure they did not have it very often. In the second half the visitors yielded completely. Rrahmani drilled in first-time from a corner, Osimhen headed home another cross from Kvaratskhelia and Eljif Elmas cut in from the right, where he had replaced Politano, to finish with his left foot. The game ended with fireworks and Spalletti chasing Allegri for a handshake with devastatingly deadpan expression.
We have been here before, right, Naples getting prematurely carried away? Were there not explosive celebrations, too, when the Partenopei beat Juventus in 2018, only to blow their title bid against Fiorentina the very next week? The parallels are obvious but so too are the differences. On the one hand, there is much more of this season left to play; no title was ever won after 18 games. Yet we should also remind ourselves that Napoli were not even top of the table after that victory five years ago – their enthusiasm founded on closing the gap to an exceptional Juventus side who would finish on 95 points. No such rival has emerged in the first half of this season. Juventus have fought hard to drag themselves back into contention but showed all their underlying frailties on Friday. Inter, after beating Napoli on 4 January, drew at Monza three days later, highlighting their inconsistency. They have lost five games already and conceded 24 goals – the joint-most (alongside 10th-placed Fiorentina) of any team in the top-half of the table.
The defending champions Milan are closest, but still fell nine points behind after drawing at Lecce on Saturday. They were 2-0 down after 23 minutes, leading some observers to question whether they had “lost this game in the hotel”, discouraged by Napoli’s emphatic win just as the Partenopei were by seeing Juventus beat Inter just before that ill-fated Fiorentina match in 2018. There is time yet for twists and turns, but Napoli’s position is no accident. Kvaratskhelia and Osimhen offer one of the most devastating attacking combinations anywhere in Europe. This is the same team that beat Liverpool 4-1 and Ajax 6-1 in the Champions League, and the Nigerian did not even play in the latter game. Even in worst-case injury scenarios, the likes of Giacomo Raspadori, Hirving Lozano and Giovanni Simeone are waiting in the wings. Allegri had delivered Spalletti a backhanded compliment in the buildup to this game, describing him as “buffo e divertente” – “zany and fun” – but while there is an undeniable joy to Napoli’s play, embodied in the almost childlike enthusiasm that Osimhen manages to couple to his astonishing technical qualities, this team is deadly serious about where it can go. Asked if his team had sent a message with this latest win, Spalletti said they had done so “only to ourselves. We have always had that question about whether we were up to these levels. Now we’ve given ourselves a reply.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/16/massimiliano-allegri-luciani-spalletti-napoli-juventus-serie-a;guardian;sports;3187
2131;2131;‘We’ve always been very divisive’: Måneskin on fighting fascists and breakfast with Chris Martin;2023-01-21T11:55:06Z;['Michael Cragg'];['Måneskin', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Eurovision', 'Culture'];;"Damiano David is bent double over a large glass table, gleefully snorting an imaginary line of cocaine. His Måneskin bandmates – bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi and drummer Ethan Torchio – collapse in fits of laughter around their frontman, each one pretending to wipe the nonexistent powder off the table in their rented LA flat. David is playfully reimagining the Italian rockers’ most infamous moment: hours after winning Eurovision 2021 with their pogoing glam-rock stomp Zitti e Buoni, in front of a global audience of 183 million, footage circulated of David appearing to snort something off a table in the green room. The images quickly went viral, with Emmanuel Macron reportedly calling for the band to be disqualified (France’s entry was in second place). In the end David offered to take a drug test, which cleared him of any wrongdoing; the results are still pinned proudly to his fridge at home. “I think the view people have of us, and of me, it’s very off-target,” David says now, his usual rock star uniform – Gucci-styled 70s glam idol mixed with Rocky Horror Picture Show vamp – replaced by an oversized beige sweater and a violent cold. (Every band member is struck down with it, rendering a grey-looking Raggi almost mute.) “People think we behave like the Sex Pistols, or Mötley Crüe, but we’re nothing like that,” David continues. “We’ve got more educated on the risks of drugs and how they affect your body. I don’t even drink alcohol any more.” “At the time we got so upset about it and now we don’t give a fuck,” smiles De Angelis, the band’s most outspoken member, sat looking resplendent in an Italians Do It Better T-shirt.
David, however, is having none of it: “No, I am still upset about it, actually. I think it’s dumb to tarnish the victory at Eurovision. I think we should go back and hand flowers around.” Måneskin, despite their throwback vintage rock vibe, represent a very modern take on the rock’n’roll mythos. Prior to Eurovision – a DayGlo pop jamboree not renowned for its links to rock excess – the band gained notoriety via Italy’s version of karaoke conveyor belt The X Factor. Their origin story has led to some music purists taking umbrage at the band’s success, with their CV now including two UK Top 10 singles, more than 4bn streams, multiple world tours, a collaboration with Iggy Pop, plus a support slot with the Rolling Stones in Vegas.
“Some of the stupid comments we get are probably because of [having done The X Factor and Eurovision],” shrugs De Angelis. “People are so narrow-minded that they can’t see beyond the idea that if we went on Eurovision we must be shit. They can’t listen to our songs with an open mind and judge them based on what they really think.” On their highly anticipated third album, Rush!, Måneskin’s first since becoming one of the few new rock acts to break through globally, the band can often be found grappling not only with the speed of their ascent (hence the title), but also a complicated relationship with what rock’n’roll means in 2023. “The whole concept of rock music is not conforming to what society would love you to be,” De Angelis says. “It’s ignoring those made-up rules and being yourself. We don’t think real rock music is about these stereotypes of the sex and drugs and rock’n’roll lifestyle,” she continues. “It’s about expression and creative freedom.”
Still, Rush!, which was mainly co-produced in LA by Swedish hitmaker Max Martin, is stuffed with songs about sex, drugs and, indeed, rock’n’roll, but often with a twist. While lead single Supermodel criticises, rather than valorises, LA’s vapid party scene (“Everything [in LA] is so huge and big and wants to impress you, it’s all showing off,” sniffs De Angelis), the band confess to having enjoyed at least one A-list schmooze with Coldplay’s Chris Martin, who invited them over to his and girlfriend Dakota Johnson’s house for breakfast. “Dakota cooked us eggs, Chris didn’t cook,” remembers Torchio. “He was enjoying the moment,” suggests David. Supermodel also references the band’s apparent drug of choice, cocaine, as does the frenetic Bla Bla Bla, though it largely serves as a warning of sorts, as David sings: “I’m too drunk and I can’t get hard.” “It happens when you drink too much,” the 23-year-old shrugs, ignoring his bandmates’ giggles. “Even when you haven’t had a drink. [That song] is a mixture of honesty and putting on ‘crazy guy’ shoes. [That character] says some things I would never say.” Perhaps the best example of stereotypical rock’n’roll swagger arrives on the ludicrous Kool Kids, a punky marauder that finds David aping the spit-flecked delivery of Slowthai. “That [was written] three days after Eurovision so our feeling was: ‘Fuck off, we won and everybody has to eat our shit,’” David says. “Before Eurovision we went through a very tough year; everybody was trying to stop us doing this kind of music and doing Eurovision. Nobody believed in us. So we had this feeling of being the underdogs that won.”
That feeling has helped cement Måneskin’s sibling-style bond. It’s been fostered since they formed at high school in Rome in 2016, with David, De Angelis and Raggi coming together after their various other bands didn’t work out (Torchio was later recruited via Facebook). “I remember when I started playing guitar at school, everyone was like: ‘Oh my God, you play electric guitar. Are you a lesbian?’” De Angelis says. “It’s all these stereotypes you know.” Suddenly her eyes dart around the room. “But then actually they were right,” she adds with a huge roar of laughter. The band, named after the Danish word for moonlight (De Angelis is half-Danish), would quickly garner similar reactions across Rome for their style, which often involved every band member donning makeup. “I remember even when we were busking or playing at school parties everyone always looked at us like freaks,” says De Angelis. “This gave us even more of an attitude of wanting to tell them to shut up. Growing up and being inspired by a lot of the artists from the 70s, the glam, it showed us something we hadn’t seen.” In 2017, the band appeared on The X Factor, eventually finishing second and landing a chart-topping album in Italy a year later. “When we went on The X Factor we were the first rock band to [appear], but we just played as if it was our own show,” De Angelis continues. “We didn’t have to change.” While more success quickly followed in Italy, including five Top 10 singles in two years, the band say they felt a shift at home after Eurovision sent them interstellar. “We’ve always been very dividing,” David says. “There are a bunch of people that love us and are very proud of what we’re doing, and then there’s a whole other part made of conservatives and traditional rock’n’roll fans and fascists that hate us with everything they’ve got. Then there’s this conspiracy building up … ”
Everyone at the table looks bemused. “What?” splutters Torchio. “Yeah, guys you have to be informed,” snaps David. “It says that we’re getting famous because we’re being paid. That we’re working with the Italian government to share this gender-fluid culture!” “A lot of people are really proud,” De Angelis says. “But Italy is a very conservative country and they’re intimidated by the fact that someone can wear makeup or high heels or appear half-naked or not be straight. But fuck them.” This passion for nudity caused problems last August when the band performed at the MTV VMAs, where they won best alternative video for single I Wanna Be Your Slave. While David donned a dog collar, leather chaps and buttock-revealing thong, De Angelis covered one nipple with a silver star before her top slipped down revealing the other one to be unadorned. Cue lots of hastily edited aerial shots to save everyone’s blushes. “We’re too hot for US television,” smiles De Angelis. “It’s so stupid because they want to appear so open-minded and then they get scared about a pair of nipples. There is this difference between men’s and women’s bodies and how you’re perceived and sexualised all the time. Everyone has nipples.” “It’s very clear the different standards people have because I was literally butt-naked,” adds David.
Perhaps it’s no surprise that a band whose success was forged in controversy are now under the microscope. For David and Raggi, the band’s straight contingent, there have been accusations of queer-baiting, thanks to their penchant for sporting makeup and experimenting with a more fluid style. “There are some cases where it happens, but sometimes [the accusations are] so extreme,” says De Angelis. “It’s stupid for queer people, who should fight these stereotypes, to label it as this and create more hate. The fact [Raggi and David] are straight doesn’t mean they can’t wear makeup. Or heels.” David agrees: “Everything me and Thomas do is always filtered by two people who are [queer]. Of course we don’t experience the same stuff, but we live every day very closely with people from the community.” They are keen to also deflect their spotlight on to more immediately concerning issues, with Rush!’s throbbing Gasoline – performed at last September’s Global Citizen festival in New York – aimed at Putin (“How are you sleeping at night? How do you close both your eyes? Living with all of those lives on your hands?” run the lyrics.) The song, they say, is a message of support for their Ukrainian fans. Rather than shy away from politics, the band see it as entwined with who they are. “Everything you do as an individual is political,” says David. For now, however, they are keen to get some sleep. There is a discussion around how much time they’ve had off since winning Eurovision in 2021, with the general consensus landing on about two weeks in total. With another tour booked for this year, including a sold-out show at London’s O2 Arena, and a Grammy award to fight for (they’re nominated for best new artist), their schedule seems unlikely to let up any time soon. “Two weeks off in two years!” repeats a dazed David shaking his head. Rock’n’roll stops for no one. Rush! is out now.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/21/maneskin-eurovision-interview;guardian;entertainment & culture;2131

The relative near miss will be streamed live using robotic telescopes - here's what you need to know about the asteroid and how you can watch it.

What do we know about this asteroid?

The asteroid was first spotted on 21 January and has been named asteroid 2023 BU.

It is due to whizz past Earth shortly after midnight on Friday 27 January.

When it passes by at its closest point it will be 3,500km above Earth's surface. That's less than 3% of the average distance between the Earth and the moon.

It may sound like a long way, but this asteroid will be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began.

By comparison, most satellites orbit at an altitude of more than 35,000km.

Should I be worried about the asteroid crashing to Earth?

In short, no. The asteroid is between 3.8 and 8.4 metres in size - small enough to incinerate on entering Earth's atmosphere.

Apparently it's roughly the size of an elephant.

According to NASA, asteroids smaller than 25m are likely to burn up, leading to little or no damage on the ground.

The Virtual Telescope Project is run by the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy and consists of several robotic telescopes that are accessible online.

What is an asteroid?

An asteroid is a ""relatively small, inactive body orbiting the Sun"", according to NASA. It's normally made of rocky, dusty, and metallic materials.

Most orbit within the main asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some follow paths that circulate into the inner solar system (including near-Earth asteroids).

A NASA website displays the next five asteroid approaches expected near Earth, showing how they are typically extremely far away.

5452;5452;Frank James pleads guilty to terrorism charges in Brooklyn subway shooting;2023-01-03T21:35:46Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['Brooklyn subway shooting', 'New York', 'Brooklyn', 'US news'];;"The man who fired more than 30 shots on a New York City subway train last spring pleaded guilty to terrorism charges on Tuesday. Frank James was arrested on 13 April 2022 after opening fire on the subway, shooting 10 people.
James, 63 and from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of committing a terrorist attack or other violence against a mass transportation vehicle – one count for each gunshot victim, the Department of Justice noted – and one count of discharging a firearm in furtherance of his attack. About 30 people required medical treatment after the shooting, which happened on 12 April, including four schoolchildren aged 12 to 16. In addition to bullet wounds, victims suffered smoke inhalation and injuries from falls and panic. “The defendant terrifyingly opened fire on passengers on a crowded subway train, interrupting their morning commute in a way the city hasn’t seen in more than 20 years,” federal prosecutor Sara K Winik said in court. “The defendant’s attack was premeditated, was carefully planned, and it caused terror among the victims and our entire city.” James fled the scene by boarding another train and throwing out the neon jacket and gas mask he had worn during the attack. He was arrested following a 30-hour manhunt. A member of the public called in a tip that James was in a McDonald’s in downtown Manhattan. When police arrived, James had already departed the fast-food restaurant, and they started driving around the area. Officers spotted him at St Marks Place and First Avenue, one of the busiest intersections in that neighborhood. The mass shooting not only renewed attention on constant gun violence in the US but also showed that cities and states with strong firearms laws can fall victim to other locales’ more relaxed statutes. The 9mm Glock that James used in the subway attack was sold to him in Ohio by a licensed firearms dealer. James, who grew up in New York City but moved to Milwaukee, also has a criminal history prior to the shooting that includes nine arrests between 1992 and 1998 in the state of New York, largely for misdemeanors. James’s criminal record also includes three arrests in New Jersey in 1992, 1993 and 2007 for charges such as disorderly conduct and trespass. James had posted hours of video missives on social media, including one published a day prior to the shooting, in which he raved about racism, society’s treatment of Black people, violence and homelessness. In March, James specifically cited the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, slamming his new public safety policies that single out homeless people in the subway. James also discussed his history of post-traumatic stress disorder as well as the failing state of mental health services. Prior to the shooting, Adams had sent thousands of additional police to patrol the subway and kick out homeless persons staying there after a series of violent incidents on the subway.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/03/brooklyn-subway-shooting-frank-james-pleads-guilty;guardian;entertainment & culture;5452
5030;5030;Befriending a wild animal will make you a better human – here’s why | Kate Ahmad;2023-01-06T01:04:56Z;['N/A'];['Wildlife', 'Fish', 'Marine life', 'Oceans', 'Environment', 'Birds', 'Insects', 'Spiders', 'Australian film', 'Diving', 'Conservation', 'Animals', 'Animal welfare'];;"The movie adaptation of Tim Winton’s novel Blueback is out this week. It focuses on a friendship with a big friendly fish – the blue groper; and the powerful response to humans threatening the animal. As with My Octopus Teacher, it’s a highly emotive story, and seen by most people as unusual or unique. Because humans only befriend domestic animals such as cats and dogs. Or do they? Let’s start with the blue groper. This is a charismatic Australian native, with many interesting characteristics. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as juveniles with the potential to be male or female; and always starting as green-coloured females. The dominant male has a harem and, if he dies, the largest female will become male and adopt the striking blue hue which gives the fish its name. These fish can live up to 70 years and are the state emblem of New South Wales.
Beyond the science, these are extraordinarily curious and friendly fish. As a regular snorkeller and diver, I am often greeted by a groper who will shove his face in my camera, rub up against my hands, bop me with his lips and follow me around. Gropers appear to recognise divers and are curious about what we are doing. It is illegal to spear these animals in my home state but such is my emotional response to their friendliness, I can imagine jumping in front of a weapon aimed at one of my friends. Octopuses are similarly interactive and interested in us. They are invertebrates who have developed unique, extraordinary intelligence, diverging from us evolutionarily more than 600m years ago. They use tools and mimicry, construct shelters, steal things and are known to be escape artists when kept in captivity. In Sydney we primarily interact with the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus). One of my life’s highlights was the first time one of these creatures unfurled a tentacle and explored my hand. Since then I’ve had many interactions, including octopuses riding on my hand, trying desperately to steal my camera, and some who tell me to go away by blowing sand at me. Unfortunately, octopuses don’t live long – usually becoming senescent after breeding and lasting only one to two years. The ones we see regularly are often eaten by smooth stingrays in the blink of an eye. It’s hard to get too fond of them as the end is always near.
Moving to the land, and most of us are familiar with wild birds seeking human company. Yes, they are often after food, but who isn’t? My neighbourhood is dominated by sulphur-crested cockatoos, but it only takes a little patience to have a rainbow lorikeet or a king parrot work up the courage to stand on a human hand. Even tiny insects can notice humans and change their behaviour to interact with us. Jumping spiders are in almost everyone’s garden but you might miss them if you don’t look hard. Most are less than half a centimetre long. Lock eyes with one, however, and there’s no doubt that they see you, moving their bodies to make eye contact. Also fans of cameras, they sometimes jump right at you! Relationships with wild animals are possible and common – you can have your own Blueback or My Octopus Teacher experience. Return to the same place often enough and you’ll get to know the regulars. Getting to know animals as individuals with varying personalities and behaviour grants them elevated importance. But be aware that it is likely to push you closer to vegetarianism and inspire you towards conservation. Because once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassion. And then there is no choice but to protect both the animal and its environment. A “pet” blue groper or a labrador? You can have both, and it will probably make you a better human.

The US author of It Ends With Us announced The Official It Ends With Us Coloring Book on social media on Thursday. But after a furious backlash from readers, she apologised that same day, writing that she could “absolutely see” how the idea was “tone-deaf”. She said her publishers would not be proceeding with the book.
“I hear you guys and I agree with you,” Hoover posted on Instagram. “No excuses. No finger-pointing. I have contacted the publisher to let them know I would prefer we don’t move forward with it. Thank you for the respectful discourse and accountability. Nothing but love.”
Hoover’s publisher, Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, confirmed the cancellation of the colouring book, writing: “We developed this book to be uplifting and empowering, mirroring Lily Bloom’s story; we appreciate the feedback and discourse and have the greatest respect for Colleen Hoover’s fans.

Inside the eastern Chaoyang Hospital, COVID-positive patients fill the wards. Almost everyone is elderly and only the lucky ones have beds. Many more line the hospital floor.

This is clearly a place where the virus is surging, and the system is straining.

Signs of the crisis are also visible outside the hospital, with frequent ambulance arrivals as well as patients brought in wheelchairs.

As families desperately try to get beds for their unwell relatives, one family arriving at the hospital told Sky News: ""We've been waiting 10 days at least. Almost everyone inside is elderly and infected.""

Previously running a zero-COVID policy, over the last three weeks, almost every restriction has been removed.

People no longer need to scan into public venues with health codes, get regularly tested, or go to a quarantine facility when they catch it. Business travel visas are also set to be eased.

The result has been swift, with over 50% of the population of Beijing thought to have been infected.

China has a large population with low levels of immunity, and a hospital system that is under-resourced with not enough intensive care beds. Combined, this means the healthcare system is under immense pressure.

1224;1224;Good governance should bring cash rewards, insists football clubs’ body ;2023-01-26T00:01:44Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Football politics', 'Finances'];;"Football clubs should be financially rewarded if they show good governance and engage properly with their fans, according to a group of clubs championing greater sustainability within the game. A new ‘sustainability index’ created by Fair Game, which counts 34 EFL and non-league clubs among its members, paints a troubling picture of the state of England’s top two divisions. The index combines scores awarded on financial stability, good governance, fan engagement and equality standards. Weeks before the expected publication of government plans for an independent regulator, only two Championship clubs and half of the Premier League are given a score ranked ‘good’.
Fair Game proposes to publish the index, the first version of which is the result of 18 months’ work, every year and its CEO, Niall Couper, believes its calculations should be included in any potential settlement reached by a new regulator. “We believe that things like financial sustainability, good governance, equality standards and fan engagement – all elements within the fan-led review – are what should really be held in the highest regard in football, and it shouldn’t just be about the results on the pitch,” Couper said. “They are the route to long-term sustainability. “Ultimately we want to be developing a system that starts rewarding football clubs for good behaviour financially. When you look at the best regulators in the country they are the ones that incentivise good behaviour and that means rewarding. We have got huge revenues coming into the game and what we should start to look at is a way of distributing funds to those clubs that are run well. “If you do that, you start to get clubs, and fans, saying this sustainability score is the one to aspire to; not simply because of what it measures but because it’s also financially rewarding.” Fair Game is a strong supporter of the government’s fan-led review into football governance and has lobbied politicians to get behind the idea of a regulator. Its concerns are shared by many MPs, but persuading the game to take up the ideas will be more complicated. The Premier League and the EFL remain deadlocked over a new financial settlement for the professional game, something recommended by the fan-led review 15 months ago. The possibility of a form of financial redistribution to EFL clubs being based in part on sporting merit, as in the Premier League, has been discussed between the two bodies but rewards based on governance have not. Those close to negotiations believe it is not something many clubs would want.
The sustainability table finds Liverpool top of the Premier League, their position driven by a high score on ‘governance’, calculated using a weighted sum of values on ‘clear governance’, environmental measures and whether the club pay the living wage (Liverpool were the first Premier League club to commit to this in 2017). At the bottom of the Premier League table are Nottingham Forest, the result of a financial stability score of one out of 40. Calculations of financial stability take into account assets, debt and loans owed in the coming year alongside the key industry measure of wages as a percentage of revenue. Fair Game analysts said the most recent financial information from the club showed Forest’s wage bill is equivalent to 202% of turnover. Norwich City topped the Championship table ahead of Burnley, the only clubs to generate an overall score of higher than 60, judged by Fair Game’s panel of 40 experts to be a ‘good’ rating.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/26/good-governance-cash-fair-game-sustainability-index-premier-league-championship;guardian;sports;1224
652;652;‘Happiness can be ignited by making something small infinite’: what makes me happy now;2023-01-28T19:00:28Z;['N/A'];['Health & wellbeing', 'Australia news', 'Culture'];;"It’s a nightmare, a barbaric farce. The city is first taken by Russians, then by Ukrainians, then by Russians again; foreign forces join the struggle, gangster hordes go on killing sprees, thousands are butchered, and a plague engulfs the survivors. It’s Kyiv. The year is 1918. A young nobody called Konstantin Paustovsky (fisher, paramedic, student) has just arrived with an itch to write. He’s unusual: in the midst of the slaughter he thinks about happiness. Decades later he will be nominated for the Nobel prize for literature, but won’t, of course, get it. The happiness he thinks about is always the wrong kind. In Kyiv in 1918, for example, Paustovsky believed that the safest, the happiest refuge from the avalanche of catastrophes engulfing his homeland lay in three things: nature, domesticity and intimacy. As it happens, when the Covid pandemic first struck in Australia, it was in a shack in the middle of “nature” that our little family of two humans and a dog first sought refuge. Needless to say, we didn’t live off nature, we didn’t forage, we just lived among the gum trees. We hoped for comfort amid the chaos in small domestic tasks and intimacy, enjoying the mild intoxication that comes from being unencumbered by the unhappiness of the wider world. We “sucked on country pleasures, childishly”, in the poet John Donne’s words in The Good-Morrow.
Eventually, Donne said, you really need to be weaned off this sort of thing. In the 1950s, Americans, who have a right under their constitution to “the pursuit of happiness”, came up with a similar formula: vacuuming, baking and watching television, they hunted happiness down in close-knit families on decent-sized, leafy acreages. It could be argued they have never been fully weaned off these practices, remaining oddly infantile in their tastes and behaviour to this day. For a week or 10 days intimacy and the performance of household tasks in the Tasmanian wilderness worked well for us. Then all of a sudden it palled. Something was missing. Like Nimbin, it had an unexpected air of melancholy about it. We had to think again. What sort of happiness was now possible? To be honest, in the wake of the famines, droughts, flooding and wars that followed the outbreak of the pandemic, the question itself began to seem frivolous. It’s hardly a new problem, although some recent commentators, in their excitement, have declared our sufferings “unprecedented”. They are actually par for the course. Four hundred years ago, for instance, Robert Burton, the author of the monumental Anatomy of Melancholy, was bemoaning the ceaseless reports of “war, plagues, fire, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets and omens” afflicting England. Yet by all accounts Burton was a cheery chap: writing his encyclopaedic work on every variety of melancholy known to humankind being a brilliant antidote to the condition itself. Art often is, but let’s not forget – that’s not what it’s for. Even the Assyrians, two thousand years earlier, resorted to the arts, if the reliefs in the British Museum are any guide. Despite the ferociously brutal rule of the Assyrians and the endless droughts, floods, plagues and mass slaughter, some people were apparently happy some of the time – falling in love, dancing, writing poetry and composing music for their flutes and tambourines. There they are in the reliefs. How could this be?
Contentment is often within our grasp, but contentment is not happiness and can never be complete in times such as these. You could feel bolts of happiness during the blitz in London, for instance, but could rarely feel contentment. It’s impossible now to be truly content anywhere in the world as Bangladesh goes under water and Brazil is turned into a wasteland. After all, your own sense of ease and tranquillity is always contingent on other people’s. From time to time, however, even in the direst situation, even knowing what we know about the waves of violence and disease washing over the planet like some cosmic curse, we can certainly be happy – even ecstatically. If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that happiness and sadness, even misery can go together. I have a friend in Yogyakarta who could not sleep for months during the first Delta Covid wave because of the sirens of ambulances rushing the dying to hospital. Yet there was also happiness: a new grandchild, a blossoming close friendship, reading Turgenev at dusk in the garden – love, in other words. What else? Donne would not have been surprised. Happiness is like being struck by lightning: the storm merely heightens it. Knowing we could die quite soon means each moment is unrepeatable. It seems to me more and more now that what invites a bolt of happiness to strike is a heightened need to be creative. I wrote and made new friendships, which takes an artist’s minute attention. When the mind is focused on finding a balance between what it feels deep inside itself in the pond of memories and what it sees and hears and even smells, all around it, there is a sudden radiance that has nothing to do with contentment but is happiness. When the I behind the eye is illuminated in a flash of new perception – of feeling, understanding, resolution – something flares up that I would call happiness. The flash won’t last, of course, that would be unbearable, it will dim, but so what? There will be an afterglow. Our inner selves are like pieces of music, Eva Hoffman writes in her study of time (called Time) – “patterned performances, made up of micromovements, like a gamelan composition”. During isolation one had the time to hone a virtuoso performance.
One of the opportunities the pandemic offered us was to consider time afresh. After all, inhabiting time well, rather than befuddling ourselves with notions of either immortality or the pointlessness of everything, is one of the keys to a happy life. It’s not easy. I recognise now that all the things that make us happy happen in time: falling in love, escapes from the domestic, finding paradise, or creating beauty (gardens, paintings, connections). There is, as Hoffman puts it, “a right rhythm and scale of lived experience – of being-in-the-world – which we need to find for ourselves for the sake of our wellbeing”. The rooted kind of existence that became the norm in recent years made it easier to acquire “a right rhythm”, which opened the door to unthought-of happiness, not just fulfilment or pleasure, but something more dynamic: bursts of happiness. Finding the inner world more reliable than the outer one, some people I know started to dally with Buddhism, adopt rescue dogs and join choirs. The dogs and choirs show promise, I think, while the Buddhist notion of achieving bliss either through eradicating desire or embracing the non-self has never appealed strongly to me. In my experience, wanting, and either getting or deliciously not getting what I’ve wanted, has been the very stuff of life. Besides, I’ve been visiting Buddhist strongholds from Dharamsala to Cambodia for most of my life, but have seen little sign in any of them that the secret to happiness has been found – to tranquillity perhaps, but not happiness. Nor do I even now, in the face of cosmic annihilation, see much point in “living in the moment” like a blowfly or a dementia patient, although it’s a cliche people still toss around. Living in time now seems a more realistic, more rhythmic, more joyful framework for a good life than striving to transcend it in the hope of a selfless immortality.
Actually, what Robert Burton, John Donne and Eva Hoffman all accentuate in their writing and in their lives is the happiness ignited by making something small infinite. Burton’s obsession with melancholy was almost infinitely enriched by his boundless curiosity in the wider world – in everything from Christianity to astrology, astronomy, Latin poetry and Peruvian goldmines. Donne expressed it differently: love for a beloved, he writes in The Good-Morrow, especially as he wakes with her in the morning, “makes one little room … an everywhere”. And this is what I’ve learned: to cross Himalayan passes or do the tango or dream of Venice by all means, but also learn to do it in the intimacy of the “little room” where my heart is anchored, my “everywhere”. It’s almost impossible, but, in my experience, worth a shot.

""While the news will come as a blow to those who can't remember life before the app, fear not. For those left wondering where they can get my latest updates, I'll be keeping you posted on TikTok.""

Some Matt Hancock users who commented on the post appeared to be disappointed with the decision.

The child's mother, Jennifer Keppie, has warned other parents of the 'deodorant bomb' stunt, which has left her son Jay with the life-changing injury.

She wrote on social media: ""There is a 'craze' at the moment of making deodorant bombs, where kids are sticking sharp objects into deodorant cans and hitting them, hoping to release the gas and watch the can spin (or something to that effect).

""As kids we have all done things that were risky and dangerous without a second thought at the consequences if anything went wrong. Unfortunately for us, it went wrong.

Ms Keppie noted: ""What was just a bit of fun, quickly turned to tragedy and even with four of the best ophthalmology consultants, the vision in one of Jay's eyes could not be saved.

""He has been left permanently blind in one eye.""

The incident occurred at Ross High School in Tranent earlier this month.

East Lothian Council said the school has since spoken to all pupils about the dangers of aerosol cans and other risks to personal safety.

1496;1496;Graham Oakley obituary;2023-01-24T17:41:11Z;['Julia Eccleshare'];"['Picture books', ""Children's books: 7 and under"", 'Books', 'Illustration', 'Art and design']";;"Graham Oakley, who has died aged 93, was an illustrator and writer known almost entirely for one series of picture books: The Church Mice, published over a period of nearly 30 years from 1972. Beautifully illustrated, written and designed, the warm-hearted and witty series demonstrates perfectly that a successful picture book needs to be subtle and layered, on the assumption that it may be read and reread many times over and that its audience will be intergenerational. Art-school trained and with a background in set design, latterly as a production designer at the BBC, Oakley was as interested in the settings of his stories as the characters and their actions. Drawing on the Victorian illustrative painters as well as, in particular, the work of the American artist Norman Rockwell, Oakley’s painterly illustrations for The Church Mouse (1972) appealed immediately, both for their colourful scene-setting and their wonderful observations conveyed in line illustrations. Into these Oakley crammed a mass of detailed action commented on in witty asides presented as part of the picture. The story about Arthur, the church mouse, and Sampson, a large and handsome church cat, all within the finely drawn setting of an English church, could be read on many levels and spoke to adults and children alike. Oakley viewed the text as having equal importance to the illustrations and frequently wrote it first. Long by traditional picture book standards, Oakley’s words amplified the humour of the illustrations but cleverly never repeated the same joke.
In both words and pictures his story of the friendship between mouse and cat, and the action-packed drama that follows, shows a sharply observant view of English society – whether animal or human – that enjoys its foibles and absurdity. Oakley’s crisp authorial tone had the effect of making the unlikely flights of imaginative action remarkably plausible. Designed with every spread divided up ingeniously to allow for many angles on the action, The Church Mouse was quickly recognised for all its qualities. Oakley began to create the series that, despite being a novice author, he had always imagined the original title would launch. Initially he planned to have each new title in a different building in the fictional town of Wortlethorpe, but such was the success of The Church Mouse that the publisher persuaded him to keep Arthur, Sampson and their friends in the church. Oakley was happy to oblige as he felt that the ecclesiastical setting offered the most interesting architectural features, which he enjoyed drawing in detail. Instead of changing the location, Oakley put his energies into coming up with a stronger and more ambitious theme for each of the new stories. The Church Cat Abroad (1973) revolved around making advertisements for cat food, while in The Church Mice and the Moon (1974) the cast took off on lunar adventures.
As the plots grew more complicated so, too, did Oakley’s drawings, which had an increasing number of asides and general busyness. New titles, including The Church Mice Adrift (1976) and The Church Mice in Action (1982), both of which were highly commended for the Kate Greenaway medal, appeared annually at first and then with slightly more time between them until The Church Mice and the Ring (1992) and The Church Mice Take a Break (2000). By 1977 the books were doing well enough for Oakley to be able to leave the BBC and concentrate on writing. Born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Graham was the only child of Flora (nee Madelay) and Thomas, who ran an electrical repair shop in the town. He grew up living above the shop before the family moved to Warrington, now in Cheshire, where he subsequently attended grammar school. Thought to be what he described as a “duffer” at school, Oakley was good at art and, as a teenager, decided he wanted to be an artist. He went to Warrington Art School in 1946, but his studies were interrupted the following year when he was called up for national service. He spent the next two years in the headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine in Germany. Returning to Warrington, Oakley finished his course as a commercial artist in 1950 and worked briefly in London until, following a long interest in theatre, he took a six-month course in stage design at the Bradford Civic Theatre School. Oakley became a scenery artist for several repertory companies before moving in 1955 to the Royal Opera House, London, where he worked as a designer’s assistant, adapting paintings by artists, including John Piper, into opera and ballet sets. Two years later Oakley tried a spell as a freelance illustrator, but earning a living from book covers and book illustrations proved to be impossible. He turned instead to advertising, becoming a layout artist, and swiftly concluded that he preferred designing scenery to advertising. Leaving in 1962 he swapped theatre and opera for television, as a scenery designer at the BBC. Eventually becoming a production designer, he created backdrops for shows such as Z-Cars and Softly, Softly and classic BBC dramas including How Green Was My Valley and Treasure Island.
Despite working full time, Oakley still did freelance illustration commissions and also created his own work. The first book he produced, Magical Changes, allowed readers to create imaginative pictures of various combinations through split pages; it was published later, in 1979, following his success with The Church Mice. In addition to the Church Mice titles Oakley wrote a brief series, The Foxbury Force, about a team of fox detectives, between 1995 and 1997. He moved out of London when he left the BBC, and lived briefly in France before buying a ruined mill on the River Avon near Chippenham in Wiltshire. It needed extensive restoration, which he undertook during the summer months, and worked on his books in the winter. In the 1980s he moved to Dorset, first to Lyme Regis and later to Poundbury. Oakley remained fit and active, and continued to write and illustrate to the end of his life. He created a new version of Beauty and the Beast, a long labour that he did for himself rather than for publication. He had many friends and enjoyed music, reading and walking in the countryside. • Graham Thomas Oakley, writer and illustrator, born 27 August 1929; died 19 December 2022 • The photo caption for the main image on this article was amended on 7 February 2023 to credit Peter Wiles as the photographer.

1796;1796;How the US far right and progressives ended up agreeing on military spending cuts;2023-01-23T10:00:03Z;['Joan E Greve'];['US politics', 'Republicans', 'US Congress', 'US military', 'Joe Biden', 'Democrats', 'US news', 'US national security'];;"Progressives have recently found themselves in an unfamiliar position: in agreement with members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Some of the latter caucus’s members have recently called for re-examining the amount of money spent by the US military, echoing demands that progressives have issued for years. Although progressives are clear-eyed about their ideological differences with “America first” Republicans on foreign policy, they encourage a renewed debate over the Pentagon’s budget.
“The idea that effective American foreign policy requires this [level of spending], I think, is not only wrong,” said Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to progressive senator Bernie Sanders, “it’s just absurd and unsustainable.” The Freedom Caucus reportedly pushed for spending cuts as part of their negotiations with Kevin McCarthy, who offered concessions to fellow Republicans to secure the House speakership earlier this month. One of those concessions involved a promise to cap fiscal year 2024 discretionary spending at fiscal year 2022 levels, after Republicans expressed outrage over the $1.76tn omnibus funding bill that Joe Biden signed into law last month. If such a fiscal policy were evenly applied to all federal agencies, the department of defense would see its budget cut by $75bn compared with this fiscal year. That possibility has simultaneously sowed division among House Republicans and attracted the interest of progressives. They hope the latest dust-up over the Pentagon’s budget will spark what they consider to be an overdue conversation over US defense spending, which will hit a record high of $858bn this fiscal year. Among House Republicans, the proposal to cut the Pentagon’s budget has won some support from far-right members who have embraced Donald Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy. Speaking to Fox News this month, Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of the Republican holdouts in the speakership battle, partly blamed the Pentagon’s large budget on America’s financial assistance to Ukraine amid its war against Russia. “We can defend this country and project power more efficiently and more effectively than we do,” Gaetz said. “How about we start with Ukraine?” McCarthy himself previously promised that Republicans would not provide a “blank check” to Ukraine if they won back the House. But aid to Ukraine has continued to win bipartisan support in Congress. “I do not see that money getting taken away from us,” Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this month. “It is there. It is rock solid through nearly all or all of 2023.” McCarthy has expressed openness to examining the Pentagon’s budget, but the proposal has stoked outrage among many of the more hawkish members of his conference. Republican congressman Tony Gonzales of Texas cited the potential cuts to explain his opposition to the House rules package, saying he thought the proposal was a “horrible idea”. “How am I going to look at our allies in the eye and say, I need you to increase your defense budget, but yet America is going to decrease ours?” Gonzales told CBS News.
While a number of House Democrats have joined Gonzales in rejecting the idea of defense spending cuts, the idea of reconsidering the Pentagon’s budget has long held sway with progressives. When Biden called for an increase in funding for the defense department last year, leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus attacked the proposal as “simply unacceptable”. Progressive activists and their congressional allies note that the US military has a larger budget than the next nine largest militaries combined and urged lawmakers to reallocate some of that funding to other needs, such as healthcare or education. “For far too long, we have blindly and excessively pumped money into the Pentagon, which – despite its massive budget – has yet to pass an audit,” said the progressive congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has long championed fiscal reform at the defense department. “Imagine what we could do with even a fraction of [the Pentagon’s funding]. We need to rethink our foreign policy priorities and invest in diplomacy first and defense second.” Ro Khanna, a progressive congressman from California, said he would welcome a bipartisan conversation about the Pentagon’s budget, but he rejected Republicans’ efforts to tie spending cuts to the looming fight over the debt ceiling. The US hit its debt limit this month, and the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned that the government is at risk of defaulting this summer if Congress does not increase its borrowing capacity – a move that would have catastrophic effects on the US economy. Democrats fear that House Republicans will attempt to extract concessions on government spending in exchange for helping to raise the debt ceiling. “I do not support any debate on spending demands that threaten a debt-ceiling showdown. If Republicans want to have conversations about future defense cuts that are strategic, then I am open to that,” Khanna told the Guardian. “While I support the funding for Ukraine’s defense, we need to take ourselves off the path to a trillion-dollar Pentagon budget.” Progressive advocates similarly rejected the notion that the US must choose between cutting the Pentagon’s budget and supporting Ukraine. Stephen Miles, president of the progressive group Win Without War, blamed the Pentagon’s ballooning budget on ineffective weapons systems and excessive contracts to private companies, which have accounted for as much as half of US defense spending in recent years. “The spending on Ukraine is not what’s driving the Pentagon’s growth,” Miles said. “We’re talking about major weapon systems procurement; we’re talking about private service contracting. We’re talking about a lot of things that aren’t being driven by Ukraine.” Duss, now a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the war in Ukraine should not prevent any debate over defense spending. He noted that politicians like Sanders and Lee have demanded reductions in the Pentagon’s budget for years, long before the war in Ukraine began. “There’s always going to be some crisis of the moment that prevents us from thinking about how to spend less on defense,” Duss said. “But this is a conversation that we absolutely have to have.” As of now, the prospects for enacting Pentagon budget cuts appear bleak. Even some of the House Republicans who, like Gaetz, initially opposed McCarthy’s speakership bid have downplayed the possibility. Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, a key negotiator in the talks between McCarthy and his Republican detractors, claimed that “cuts to defense were NEVER DISCUSSED” during the speakership fight. “In fact, there was broad agreement spending cuts should focus on NON-DEFENSE discretionary spending,” Roy’s office said on Twitter.
A funding bill that solely cut non-defense discretionary spending would almost certainly be rejected by Democrats, who still control the Senate and the White House. In addition to the procedural hurdles of Roy’s proposal, Miles mocked the idea of excluding defense spending from potential cuts as utterly unrealistic. “You can’t look at the level of spending that the US government is doing and say we’re going to exempt more than half of discretionary spending,” Miles said. “When you have the Pentagon taking up as much money as it is now, there’s no way to look at cutting government spending without it.” Even if Congress could somehow reach an agreement on the need to reduce the Pentagon’s budget, conservatives would inevitably clash with progressives over what programs to cut and how to reallocate that funding. “The reason Matt Gaetz wants to cut defense spending is not the reason why I would,” Duss acknowledged. Still, Duss argued that progressives and some lawmakers on the right have a “shared interest” in starting a reinvigorated conversation over defense spending. That communal goal could work to progressives’ advantage. “If Republicans want to prize this open and look inside this budget … that’s a debate I think everyone should welcome,” Duss said. “And I think it’s quite telling who’s not welcoming it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/defense-spending-cuts-military-budget-congress-far-right-progressives;guardian;politics;1796

Manchester United have performed well, but their slide last term, as the season wore on, has meant Marc Skinner’s side have been somewhat overlooked. But as United travel to Reading on Sunday and the season passes its midpoint, the picture is increasingly rosy for them. They sit second in the league, three points behind Chelsea who have played a game more, and are level on points with third-placed Arsenal – with a superior goal difference. In the second half of the season, United host Arsenal and Manchester City, teams they took four points off away, and travel to Kingsmeadow to face Chelsea. The champions must also play their title rivals, while Arsenal and Manchester City still have to play each other twice.
The schedule has been kind to United, especially with Arsenal and Chelsea having progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals and adding extra high-intensity games to their calendars. But it is not just the fixture list that has helped United bridge the gap between the established top three and the rest. Skinner says: “The difference is we’ve had experience together, we believe in each other, we trust each other, and it’s not always rosy, you have challenges and so on. It’s the experiences we’ve had together and it’s the disappointment that fuels you. But we’ve done nothing yet. We know what we want to achieve here, and we are fiercely ambitious.” It is that cautiousness and an attempt to switch off from the increasing expectation that has been critical to United’s success. The humbling slump in the second half of last season that saw them finish five points off third-placed City was a crushing blow, but it has instilled a doggedness. In November they were 2-1 down to Arsenal with five minutes to play, having thrown away the lead, but fought back to win 3-2.
“It’s about belief most importantly,” says Skinner. “Unfortunately, losses set you up for success, because you learn from them. What we’ve decided as a group is we’re not going to worry about the noise around us. For us, it’s about focusing on what we can control and that alleviates any pressure. This badge wears heavy if you’re not prepared for it.” Time has been critical. Not only does the core of Skinner’s squad now have experience of a few seasons in the WSLbut his players have benefited from the addition of four European title winners. Mary Earps, Alessia Russo, Ella Toone and Nikita Parris have tasted success at the top level and are feeding that back into their new club. The maturity of the squad has meant United have been able to plan for the long term, too, recruiting Carrie Jones and Grace Clinton only to send them out on loan: a strategy commonly used by the top teams, but not usually a luxury afforded those with weaker squads.
“I want an ultra-competitive team,” says Skinner, now working with a new head of women’s football, Polly Bancroft. “We can’t stand still. Talented players that will make us better, if they’re not ready for now then they’ve got to be ready for the next two or three seasons. “I’m trying to plan ahead with Polly and the crew here to put us in a good position so that if we do achieve success, we don’t stand still beyond that. We don’t want to be a flash in the pan. We want to be planning and preparing and that’s why we’re using the loan market.” A settled squad has given Skinner and his staff the space to work on tactics, and it shows. United have the fourth best defence in Europe. “There are different systems, different ways of doing things, some teams can go back to front and score very quickly without really having to defend from the front,” he says. “My teams will always defend as a group. That starts from Alessia and goes all the way back. “I just believe that as a team you function better. That’s why we keep clean sheets and that’s why we create so many chances and have so many different goalscorers. Our team will never be about one star player, it will be a collective. So we work hard at that, we work hard at pressing, we want to gain the ball so we can play with the ball, and when you keep the ball like we do it’s always difficult for the other team to attack. “Our defence is really solid, our positioning is excellent and it is the collective which is key.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/manchester-united-determined-to-create-more-waves-in-wsl-title-race;guardian;sports;2078

3864;3864;Chicago mayor faces backlash for asking students to work on campaign for credit;2023-01-12T17:33:37Z;['Gloria Oladipo'];['Chicago', 'US education', 'US news', 'US politics'];;Chicago’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is facing criticism after her office attempted to recruit students with school credit to help with her re-election campaign. Emails encouraging students to volunteer were sent to several Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers’ work emails from Megan Crane, who identifies herself as Lightfoot’s deputy campaign manager on LinkedIn. According to screenshots that circulated on social media late on Wednesday, Lightfoot’s office asked teachers to encourage their students to submit their résumés for an externship program for those “interested in campaign politics and eager to gain experience in the field”. Those who join the externship would be expected to contribute 12 hours a week in exchange for “class credit”, WTTW first reported. The email further elaborated that Lightfoot’s office was seeking “enthusiastic, curious and hard-working young people eager to help Mayor Lightfoot win this spring”. Many were quick to call out Lightfoot’s office for the recruitment attempts. “Looks like desperate times call for desperate measures,” tweeted the Illinois representative and Chicago mayoral candidate Jesús García. Mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson wrote on Twitter that Lightfoot’s actions were “outrageous, desperate, & downright unethical”. Former Chicago inspector general Joe Ferguson also called the initiative “deeply, deeply problematic”. The solicitation of volunteers using the CPS email system is specifically discouraged in an ethics guideline published by CPS, though Lightfoot’s campaign claimed to have used emails made publicly available, reported the Chicago Tribune. Shortly after the email was publicized, Lightfoot’s campaign sent out several follow-up statements about the emails. In one statement, Lightfoot’s campaign wrote that staff would “cease contact with CPS employees” out of an “abundance of caution”, reported the Tribune. Less than two hours after that statement, Lightfoot’s campaign announced that contacting “any city of Chicago, or other sister agency employees, including CPS employees, even through publicly available sources” would be “off limits”. In light of the controversy, a spokesperson from CPS told the Tribune that the school district does not “coordinate with any political candidates or campaigns”, highlighting that teacher emails are publicly available. But leadership from the Chicago Teachers Union called the recruitment efforts “unethical and wrong”, noting concern that teachers who decline to participate in volunteer efforts or do not encourage their students to do so could face retaliation. “This is the same mayor who promised to clean up corruption and make good ethics an anchor in her administration. This latest scheme shows she’s a rank hypocrite on ethics issues – including her attempt to use our schools and students as her campaign tools,” wrote union leaders in a statement, reported WGN 9, a local news affiliate. The Chicago board of ethics told WGN that they were aware of the emails and planned to discuss it at the next board meeting, currently scheduled for 23 January. The Chicago mayoral election will be held on 28 February.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/lori-lightfoot-students-campaign-chicago-mayor;guardian;politics;3864

More than 25 protests across at least 17 cities took place on Sunday, the highest number since 5 December.

Sky News has mapped the location of every protest made up of 12 or more people since 16 September, with data provided by the Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute with support from the Institute for the Study of War.

Strike action also took place, as recorded by this Iranian driver who says: ""This is Kermanshah, the heart of Kurdistan on Sunday the 18th, a general strike."" Sunday the 18th in the Iranian calendar is 8 January in the Gregorian calendar.

The protests and strikes took place as the Iranian people continue to demand largescale change in the country.

Demonstrations began after the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed while in detention after police said she was wearing her hijab (head covering) ""improperly"".

The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reports that 519 protesters have died since 17 September. The group's figures, published on 9 January, also report that almost 20,000 people have been arrested and that 111 are ""under the impending threat of a death sentence"".

Civil unrest on Sunday was also fuelled by anger over the downing of a Ukrainian civilian plane by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) three years ago. All 176 people on board died.

Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down in Tehran on 8 January 2020 by two anti-aircraft missiles in what Iran called ""human error"" but families of the victims have labelled a ""war crime"".

Iranian forces appeared to expect heightened protest action.

For example, last week cameras were installed in the city of Javanrud, in the west of the country.

Two protesters were executed on Saturday, potentially fuelling the large Sunday protests.

Mohammad Mahdi Karami and Seyed Mohammad Hosseini were killed on Saturday. Iran sentenced them to death for killing a paramilitary force member, drawing condemnation from the UN human rights office who said the executions were the result of ""unfair trials based on forced confessions"".

The men became the third and fourth protesters whose executions have been publicly confirmed, following the killings of Majidreza Rahnavard and Mohsen Shekar in December.

Tensions around the execution of the men continued into Monday, with the authorities blocking roads to the burial site and reportedly firing on mourners.

This footage, which Sky News has confirmed is taken just outside the cemetery, shows a man in black firing on cars driving to the site.

Two more men reportedly face execution imminently. Dozens of Iranians gathered outside Rajaeeshahr prison (also known as Gohardasht Prison) near the capital Tehran to try to stop the killings of Mohammad Ghobadloo and Mohammad Boroughani.

The mother of 23-year-old Mohammad Ghobadloo made a speech and, as this footage shows, was embraced by the crowd who chanted: ""Honourable Iranian! Support! Support!""

The two men were expected to be put to death in the early hours of Monday, but the demonstration outside of the prison appears to have delayed the executions.

Other protests took place across the country on Sunday.

Social media users reported gunfire in Karaj and Mashad. Sky News was unable to independently verify these claims.

Forces used tear gas against protesters in Bandar-e Anzali and Tehran.

Press freedom is restricted in Iran. Much of what is known about the situation comes from information shared on social media by protesters who manage to evade the state's attempts to block them from uploading evidence online.

Sky News has been monitoring this footage since the protests began in September. Less footage has been emerging and the levels of blurring and audio distortion used to hide faces and voices appears to be becoming more thorough over the last two months.

This makes it harder to verify and report what is happening within the country's borders.

Barry Martin, 38, from Fife, sustained serious injuries while fighting a blaze at the historic Jenners building on Rose Street on Monday.

He had been in a critical condition at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh but died today, Police Scotland said.

Four other firefighters were also taken to the hospital for treatment and were subsequently released.

Two were treated for burns and two for smoke inhalation.

A police officer was also treated for smoke inhalation at the hospital and later released.

Superintendent David Robertson, of Edinburgh Division, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Barry at this very difficult time.

""Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.""

More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was reported around 11.30am on Monday.

Witnesses saw a soot-covered firefighter being helped from the building by colleagues.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the death as a ""terrible tragedy"".

""This is dreadfully sad news,"" she tweeted.

""My deepest condolences go to Barry's family, friends and colleagues.

""This is a terrible tragedy for all who loved him - but also a reminder of the selfless courage our firefighters demonstrate in the line of duty each and every day.""

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's interim chief officer said he and his colleagues were ""devastated"" by the death.

Ross Haggart said: ""I speak for the entire service when I say that we are all devastated by the loss of Barry and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and colleagues at this deeply distressing time.

""Both Barry's family and the service have been overwhelmed with the messages of support we have received and we thank everyone for the time they have taken to share these.

""Barry's family would also like to thank all the medical staff who have cared for him.""

3949;3949;Wagner forces claim to have found body of one of missing Britons in Ukraine;2023-01-12T11:13:22Z;['Pjotr Sauer'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'UK news', 'New Zealand', 'Europe', 'Voluntary sector', 'Yevgeny Prigozhin'];;The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed his forces have found the body of one of two British voluntary aid workers reported missing in eastern Ukraine. In a statement published on his Telegram channel late on Wednesday, Prigozhin did not mention the name of the dead man but said documents belonging to both Britons had been found on his body. The statement was posted alongside a photo that appeared to show passports bearing the names of Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry, the two missing workers. The pair were last known to have been travelling from Kramatorsk to Soledar, in eastern Ukraine, on 6 January, according to Sky News. The salt mining town has endured days of heavy fighting as part of Moscow’s months-long offensive to capture Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The Guardian was unable to verify the claim. Donetsk police said they could not confirm Wagner’s claims. Oleksandr Polosukhin, deputy head of the communication department of the Donetsk region police, said in a comment to Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne, that officers were continuing to try to find the missing men. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the families of two British men who have gone missing in Ukraine.” Aiden Aslin, a British national serving as a Ukrainian marine since 2018, who was earlier captured by Russia before being released in a prisoner exchange, tweeted: “In regards to the Two Foreigners, do not believe anything Russia says regarding their status. They’ve lied before and broken int[ernational] law and they’ll do it again trying make it sound like they were something which they weren’t.” Parry, reportedly a running coach from Cheltenham, recently told Sky News he had been driving to towns and villages on the frontline to evacuate residents. He said: “I take each day as it comes. Sometimes when you see some pretty terrible things it does stay with you. But you’ve got a job. You’re in a position of care and as soon as you pick these people up you’ve got to get out and get away from the artillery, which is constantly going off around us. “When you get back and think, ‘that was kind of close, that was only 100 metres away from us’ that’s when you think maybe my luck might run out, but it’s worth it to save these people.” Bagshaw travelled to Ukraine from New Zealand, and had been delivering aid and evacuating citizens, according to a statement by the group Kiwi Aid and Refugee Evacuation. His parents, Philip and Susan Bagshaw, who founded the Canterbury Charity hospital, confirmed their son was missing. He is “a very intelligent, independently minded person”, who went to Ukraine as a volunteer, they said. “He was born in the UK, and Philip and Susan are very grateful for all the agencies, from both London and NZ, who are working so hard to find him,” the statement added. “Andrew’s parents love him dearly and are immensely proud of all the work he has been doing delivering food and medicines and assisting elderly people move from near the battlefront of the war.” In August, Bagshaw, a genetics researcher, told the New Zealand news outlet Stuff that he had been evacuating mostly older people from Soledar for about a month. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said it was aware of reports a dual New Zealand-British national was missing in Ukraine and it was in contact with the UK government.

5973;5973;Climate change: Next year set to be warmer than 2022 and one of the hottest years on record, Met Office experts say;Tuesday 20 December 2022 07:20, UK;[];['weather', 'climate change'];['hottest', 'say', 'temperature', 'office', 'met', 'warmer', 'set', 'average', 'temperatures', 'record', 'change', 'experts', 'nina', 'climate', '2023', 'la', 'world', 'global', 'preindustrial'];"Next year is forecast to be one of the hottest years on record and even warmer than 2022, experts have said.

Met Office scientists estimate that 2023 will be the 10th consecutive year in which global temperatures will be at least 1C above pre-industrial levels, measured as the period from 1850 to 1900.

The current hottest year on record is 2016, a year that saw an ""El Nino"" climate pattern in the Pacific, pushing up sea temperatures and therefore global temperatures on top of global warming trends.

In recent years, the Pacific has experienced the opposite effect, ""La Nina"", which has kept temperatures lower.

However, this is set to come to an end, says Dr Nick Dunstone, who has led the Met Office's 2023 global temperature forecast.

""The global temperature over the last three years has been influenced by the effect of a prolonged La Nina - where cooler than average sea-surface temperatures occur in the tropical Pacific,"" he said. ""La Nina has a temporary cooling effect on global average temperature.

""For next year our climate model is indicating an end to the three consecutive years with La Nina state, with a return to relative warmer conditions in parts of the tropical Pacific.

""This shift is likely to lead to global temperature in 2023 being warmer than 2022.""

The Met Office's forecast predicts global average temperatures in 2023 will be around 1.2C above what they were before humans started to drive climate change.

Last year, experts predicted 2022's global temperature would be between 0.97C and 1.21C above pre-industrial levels, with a central estimate of 1.09C. Data for the year to October suggests the temperature is around 1.16C above the pre-industrial era.

At the COP27 climate summit, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, countries agreed a historic dedicated fund to help vulnerable nations hit by climate disasters, but failed to step up efforts to tackle the damaging emissions that cause them.

Professor Adam Scaife, the Met Office's head of long-range prediction, said that while 2023 might not break the 2016 record it will likely see further high temperatures.

""Without a preceding El Nino to boost global temperature, 2023 may not be a record-breaking year, but with the background increase in global greenhouse gas emissions continuing apace it is likely that next year will be another notable year in the series,"" he said.

5095;5095; Surrey’s Alec Stewart takes break from cricket to care for wife ;2023-01-05T16:10:51Z;['Simon Burnton'];['Surrey', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];;"Alec Stewart has taken a temporary leave of absence from his role as Surrey’s director of cricket to care for his wife, Lynn, as she begins a new round of treatment for the cancer she was first diagnosed with in 2013. “In order to care for his wife and family at this difficult time, Alec has decided to temporarily step away from his day-to-day duties,” Surrey said in a statement.
Steve Elworthy, Surrey’s chief executive, will take over director of cricket duties on an interim basis. “All of our thoughts are with Alec, Lynn and the family and we wish them the very best,” Elworthy said. “The Club will fully support Alec and the family through this leave of absence and ask everyone to please respect his request for privacy.” Stewart, who played 133 Tests for England and made 266 first-class appearances for Surrey across a 22-year senior playing career, has been married to Lynn since 1991. He retired from first-class cricket in 2003 and was named an executive director at the Oval in 2011, and has been director of cricket since 2014. Under his guidance Surrey have won promotion from Division Two of the County Championship the following year, and have gone on to win the title twice, including last year. Last March, having been considered among the favourites for the then-vacant position of managing director of England men’s cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board, he withdrew from the selection process for unspecified family reasons. Rob Key, who eventually got that job, then attempted to recruit Stewart as England’s head selector, but again he decided against the move, with Luke Wright appointed instead.

4018;4018;Libyan politicians’ pay goes up 40% as election impasse continues;2023-01-12T05:00:00Z;['Patrick Wintour'];['Libya', 'United Nations', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Africa', 'World news'];;Western leaders are losing patience with an entrenched Libyan political elite that has collectively failed to agree on the basis of elections for more than a year but has boosted politicians’ salaries by more than 40%, according to official figures. Special envoys from the US, France, Germany, Italy and the UK are due to meet in Washington on 13 January to discuss their next steps after two rival Libyan factions last week failed to reach a final agreement in Cairo on the constitutional basis for national elections. The presidential and parliamentary elections were aborted in December 2021. A previous French-led effort to stage elections, in 2018, had also foundered. A series of unelected and competing interim governments have governed Libya for nearly a decade. Elections planned for 2022 were cancelled due to disputes over the qualifications of candidates to stand, which masked a deeper reluctance by politicians in both the east and west of the country to risk a democratic winner-takes-all process that might see them lose access to state patronage and power. One exasperated western diplomat said: “They are some making sincere efforts at mediation, but the abiding character of too many Libyan politicians on both sides of the divide is [to] pay lip service to the necessity of elections and then do everything possible to throttle them so they can continue lining their pockets. We may have to stop hoping we can persuade these people to agree to elections and instead find a way to work around them.” The meeting on 13 January of special envoys convened by the US envoy, Richard Norland, will look at how to stage elections and whether to urge the new UN special envoy Abdoulaye Bathily to set a deadline for establishing a national Libyan body to agree on elections. The growth of the Libyan economy is projected to be 17.9% this year, the highest in Africa, but despite this some estimates show that nearly a third of Libyans, especially in the south, live at, or below, the poverty line. Libya’s political leaders have gone round in circles with competing proposals for the constitutional basis of the elections. Months of talks in Cairo between Libya’s House of Representatives speaker, Aguila Saleh, from the east of the country, and the head of the high council of state, Khaled al-Meshri, representing the western area, made some progress, but did not resolve whether dual nationals could stand for the presidency, or for how long candidates would have to permanently resign from any existing position if they wished to stand. Behind these disputes are efforts from either side to bar controversial candidates from standing. Norland has claimed there is no impediment to Meshri and Saleh setting an election date, but the two men have refused to do so. The reputation of the political class has hardly been enhanced by Central Bank of Libya figures published last week showing total state spending rose last year to 127.9bn Libyan dinars, an increase of 42bn dinars or about $9bn in 2021. Figures on how the state is spending money have been unclear for years, with a full UN-commissioned audit of the CBL accounts never published. Public salaries, including those for politicians, rose 42% to 47bn dinars for 2022, compared with 33bn dinars the previous year. This was the single biggest expenditure item. Fuel subsidies racked up 20bn dinars, and development and projects 17.5bn dinars. The Libyan National Oil Corporation was given 34bn dinars – about $6bn. Oil remains the chief source of state revenue, worth 134bn dinars ($29bn). The House of Representatives, last elected in 2016, was paid 144m dinars or $30m. The high council of state, the remnants of an oversight parliament elected in 2012 under the control of the west and led by Meshri, received 49m dinars, or $10m. The interim Tripoli-based government, also supported by Turkey and led by the interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, has also paid out billions in benefits. Critics say even allowing for the devaluation of the Libyan dinar, the scale of the salaries and disbursements suggest that an unaccountable political class is eager to avoid the verdict of the ballot box. Tim Eaton, a Libya expert at Chatham House, said: “These central bank figures are still opaque, but clearly spending on salaries is staggeringly high. Given the amount of money that is supposedly being spent on public services, ordinary people in Libya are simply not receiving an adequate level of service.” The experienced former UN envoy in Libya, Stephanie Williams, recently said: “A transactional ruling class, some of whose network can be traced back to the days of the former regime, uses Libya’s state and sovereign institutions as cash cows in what could be described as a ‘redistributive kleptocracy’, bringing into their circles on a regular basis just enough of their compatriots to sustain the system.” She said some Libyan politicians simply did not see the need for elections. Popular frustration with the lack of elections exists. In a statement Aref Nayed, chairman of the Ihya Libya movement, said: “There is nothing to prevent elections except for a corrupt political junta that is fighting each other over everything, but it is united in confiscating the right of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny and share their wealth.” Zahra Langhi, a women’s rights activist, said “political elites including [the] governor and central bank board have long benefited from a culture of impunity. Libya is witnessing a stalemate in the political track as well as division and capture of state institutions that defrauds the Libyan people of their right to elect their representatives”. The debate among western diplomats is about whether to set a hard deadline for Libya’s political institutions to reach agreement on the basis of elections, and if that deadline is not met, whether to launch a new process. Libyan political institutions have long lost legitimacy with the House of Representatives, which was elected in June 2014 on a turnout of less than 20%. Saleh, the speaker, was elected with little more than 1,000 votes.

This series returns the favour. Initially, it feels like a slow burn: we are introduced to Joel (Pedro Pascal) and his daughter Sarah (Nico Parker) as they muddle through their fraught but essentially functional domestic life. But things go haywire, thanks to a rapidly spreading fungal infection. When teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey) enters the scene, it leads to a genuinely thrilling escape sequence which feels like an intense first-person shooter game. It’s essentially a post-apocalyptic drama, but thanks to its origins, the story has real white-knuckle jeopardy.

5686;5686;Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 313 of the invasion;2023-01-02T13:05:57Z;['Samantha Lock', 'Tom Ambrose'];['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'World news'];;A New Year’s Day attack on a complex in the Russian-controlled city of Makiivka has killed scores of recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow, according to reports on both sides, in what could be one of the deadliest known incidents involving Russian conscripts so far. Without claiming the strike, Ukraine’s military command said up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in the city in the Moscow-controlled parts of the Donetsk region. Pro-Russian authorities late on Sunday acknowledged that there were casualties, but did not comment on the Ukrainian figures. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has praised Ukrainians for showing gratitude to the troops and one another and said Russia’s efforts would prove useless. “Drones, missiles, everything else will not help them,” he said of the Russians. “Because we stand united. They are united only by fear.” Ukraine’s air defence systems worked through the night to bring down incoming drones and to warn communities of the approaching danger, Reuters reported. Several waves of Russian drones targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv and surrounding areas early on Monday morning. Air raid alerts were issued in Kyiv and across eastern Ukraine, beginning just before midnight and still wailing hours later. Debris from a destroyed drone hit Kyiv’s northeastern Desnianskiy district, wounding a 19-year-old man who was later taken to hospital, the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. The Ukrainian ministry of defence claimed it shot down 39 Iranian-made Shahed drones, as well as a cruise missile, last night. Earlier we reported that Ukraine’s regional military command in the country’s east said air defence systems destroyed nine Iranian-made Shahed drones over the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions by the early hours of Monday. Zelenskiy, added that “45 ‘Shaheds’ were shot down on the first night of the year” in his Monday evening address. Ukraine has published the latest figures in relation to Russian losses since the beginning of the invasion last February. It says an estimated 107,440 Russian soldiers have been killed, while it claims to have destroyed 283 aircraft and more than 3,000 Russian tanks. Over the last five days, Russian and Ukrainian forces have probably been fighting for control of the P66 highway, north of the Russian-held Luhansk town of Kremina, the UK Ministry of Defence reports. The P66 is a “key supply route for the northern section of Russia’s Donbas front from the Belgorod region of Russia” and its use has been disrupted by Ukrainian artillery since October, the ministry adds. As a result of overnight strikes on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, energy infrastructure facilities were damaged, causing power and heating outages, city mayor Klitschko said on Monday. Ukraine’s most senior defence officials have said they believe Russia will attempt a second invasion from the north in the next couple of months, using troops who have been training for the past three months since being mobilised in October. But the Ukrainian forces defending the border say the Russians will not be able to break through as they did in February, when the Sumy region had no defensive lines. Russia claimed its strikes against Ukraine on New Year’s Eve – including the launch of more than 20 cruise missiles that killed at least three people – were targeting its neighbour’s drone production. A children’s hospital was among the buildings said to have been hit by Russian shelling. Ukrainian officials claim Russia is deliberately targeting civilians to sow fear. Russian leaders issued a series of defiant messages ahead of the new year. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would “never give in” to the west, and was fighting for its “motherland, truth and justice … so that Russia’s security can be guaranteed”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-313-of-the-invasion;guardian;sports;5686
243;243;TikTok CEO to testify before US Congress next month over data privacy;2023-01-30T22:18:23Z;['Kari Paul'];['TikTok', 'US Congress', 'Social media', 'Technology', 'US news', 'Digital media', 'Media', 'US politics'];;"As the US legislative battle over TikTok continues to escalate, Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of the video-sharing app, will make his first appearance before Congress to testify next month. Chew will testify before the House energy and commerce committee on 23 March, Republican representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers confirmed in a statement on Monday, as scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app over data privacy concerns grows.
The news comes after the app was banned on government devices and school campuses in a number of states in recent months, as well as on federal devices after a ban was passed in Congress in December. Next month the House foreign affairs committee plans to hold a vote on a bill aimed at blocking the use of TikTok entirely in the US. “ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist party to access American user data,” McMorris Rodgers said, adding that Americans deserve to know how these actions affect their privacy and data security. TikTok has denied these claims, stating: “The Chinese Communist party has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok,” according to a company spokesman. It confirmed on Monday that Chew will testify. “We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance and the commitments we are making to address concerns about US national security before the House committee on energy and commerce,” the spokesman said, adding the company hopes “by sharing details of our comprehensive plans with the full committee, Congress can take a more deliberative approach to the issues at hand”. McMorris Rodgers and other Republican lawmakers have demanded more information from TikTok regarding the app’s impact on young people, concerns about harmful content and details on potential sexual exploitation of minors on the platform. TikTok was first targeted in earnest by the Trump administration in 2020, with a sweeping executive order prohibiting US companies from doing business with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. In the three years since, the company has sought to assure Washington that the personal data of US citizens cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by China’s Communist party or anyone else under Beijing’s influence. While Biden revoked the Trump administration ban in June 2021, the reversal was made with a stipulation that the US committee on foreign investment (CFIUS) conduct a security review of the platform and suggested a path forward to avoid a permanent ban. That review has been ongoing as the CFIUS and TikTok have been in talks for more than two years aiming to reach a national security agreement to protect the data of US TikTok users. The White House on Friday declined to comment on whether it would support a legislative ban on TikTok or the status of the talks.

1104;1104;Labor flags law reforms to stop cases involving national security being cloaked in secrecy;2023-01-26T14:00:23Z;['Henry Belot', 'Christopher Knaus'];['Australia news', 'Law (Australia)', 'Australian security and counter-terrorism', 'Labor party', 'Witness K case', 'Mark Dreyfus', 'Australian politics', 'Law'];;"The federal government has flagged amendments to national security laws to ensure that the near total secrecy that hid the prosecution and imprisonment of a former Australian intelligence officer cannot happen again. The former government faced persistent criticism of its use of the National Security Information (NSI) Act to enforce extreme secrecy in cases of clear public interest, including the prosecutions of Bernard Collaery, Witness K and the former military lawyer David McBride. Lawyers and transparency campaigners expressed particular concern about use of the NSI Act to secretly prosecute and imprison a former intelligence officer, known variously as Alan Johns and Witness J, in 2018.
The case prompted a review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), which found the total secrecy in the Witness J case “should not have happened … and it should never happen again”. The INSLM urged the government to ensure at least some level of transparency and open justice in future cases that involve sensitive national security. The federal government’s response to the review, tabled last week, signalled its support for a suite of reforms, such as changes compelling the attorney general to seek that reasons be given and published when the NSI Act is used to close courts to the public. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the government was committed to ensuring “appropriate laws are in place to ensure the proper administration of justice and protect national security information”. “That is why the government has accepted all of the INSLM’s recommendations,” Dreyfus said. “Recognising the importance of the principles of open justice, the government has implemented revised practices to give effect to the INSLM’s recommendations.” The government’s changed approach was taken in the alleged foreign interference case of Di Sanh Duong, 67, where the attorney general submitted to the court this week that it should publish reasons for making orders under the NSI Act.
The government has also signalled it supports publishing more details about how and when the NSI Act has been used to enforce secrecy on court cases, and to better support the court to appoint contradictors, who can argue against closed court orders. The INSLM is separately conducting a broader review of the NSI Act. The government said it “will consider legislative options” after the conclusion of that broader review. In Collaery’s case, the former government attempted to use the NSI Act to hide “significant” parts of the then looming trial from the public. Collaery said the proposed NSI Act reforms would be a good first step, and described Dreyfus as “courageous” for his decision to drop the prosecution and change the NSI Act. “It’s a good interim step,” Colleary said. “While the Alan Johns [Witness J] matter raises very, very serious concerns, some concerns of a most profound nature are yet to be examined by the national security legislation monitor and the future integrity commission.”
Greens senator David Shoebridge said the change was welcomed, but questioned why the government’s new approach would not be immediately entrenched in legislation. “Without these legislative changes we remain at risk of secret trials, secret convictions and all the injustice that flows from that,” he said. Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the secret trial of Witness J should never be allowed to happen again. “This is an important first step in better balancing secrecy and transparency in Australia’s courts when national security issues arise,” Pender said. The chief executive of Transparency International Australia, Clancy Moore, welcomed the government’s response. “For far too long, the NSI Act has acted as a blanket of secrecy on important whistleblower cases and was used to hide the prosecution and then jailing of Witness J in the act,” Moore said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/27/labor-flags-law-reforms-to-stop-cases-involving-national-security-being-cloaked-in-secrecy;guardian;politics;1104

The plan will introduce around 1,800 new shift leader roles in stores, leading on the day-to-day operational duties on the shop floor, the UK's largest supermarket chain said.

The counters and hot delis will close from 26 February, the retailer added, after ongoing reviews of the counters have taken place since 2019. But most hot counters and delis have already been removed from the majority of shops, it said.

Since 2019 Tesco said it has seen a significant decrease in demand for the counters and that customers no longer say they are a significant reason for them to visit stores.

All workers affected by the closures will be offered alternatives roles, it said, but it did not say how many staff work on counters and delis.

Hot and deli counters may not disappear entirely, Tesco said. ""Where we can work with a third party to offer a counter experience in-store, we will continue to do so.""

Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and ROI chief executive, said: ""These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most.""

The changing management structures will impact around 1,750 workers as the number of lead and team managers in large shops will be reduced.

Tesco said those affected will have the option of moving into shift leader roles ""with financial support"" or taking redundancy.

An estimated 350 workers will be impacted by a series of localised changes, such as the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices, the store group added.

Providing more detail about the management staff affected, Tesco said in a statement: ""With the introduction of these new shift leader roles and realignment of management roles, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce the number of lead and team managers in our large stores, impacting around 1,750 colleagues.

""We are supporting colleagues impacted by these changes, who will have the option of moving into shift leader vacancies with financial support or taking redundancy.""

4607;4607;A new start after 60: I became a naturist at 75 – and it felt like freedom;2023-01-08T14:00:49Z;['Paula Cocozza'];['Naturism', 'Life and style', 'Art', 'Art and design'];;"Shortly before his 76th birthday, Stuart Haywood made his debut as a naturist. He was visiting Abbey House gardens in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, with his wife Rhona (who is not a naturist), for a “clothes optional” day. He and Rhona share an interest in horticulture, but being able to walk around the gardens naked added a new dimension to Haywood’s experience. He “felt free and relaxed”. Yet, he says, “at school, I was very bothered about nudity. I wouldn’t have wanted to go around the showers naked.” Over time, “it all altered.” The turning point occurred a few years earlier, when Haywood, 86, and Rhona signed up for an art course at the adult education centre near where they live in Newhall, Derbyshire. When Rhona was diagnosed with breast cancer, they cancelled, vowing that “once she had been cleared, we would do the next available course”. It turned out to be life drawing. “I was quite taken by the chap who was a male model,” Haywood says. “The fact that he could sit in position for a long time without being able to move. I said to the woman who ran it, ‘I could do that. Can I have a go?’” The teacher put Haywood in touch with Jackie Adshead, an artist with an erotic element to her portfolio. Haywood went alone to Adshead’s house. “She explained all the chalks and different things you can draw with … That was the very first time I stripped off before anybody, except my wife.”
One of Adshead’s pictures of Haywood now hangs at home in the front room. “Everyone who comes into the house sees it,” says Haywood. “If people don’t like it? As far as I’m concerned, I don’t see anything wrong in the human body. Why they should get so excited about seeing a little bit of flesh hanging down, I don’t really know.” Haywood prefers not to wander naked in his own garden, at the sheltered accommodation where he and Rhona live. “You don’t want to upset your neighbours,” he says. Instead, they holiday at Lakeside Farm naturist resort near Skegness. Rhona, 91, stays clothed, but “doesn’t mind being in the midst of people that way inclined”. When the couple renewed their wedding vows in 2015, after 55 years of marriage, Haywood, the officiant and most of the guests were naked. So, how did Haywood come to find freedom in nudity? Were his parents very relaxed about the body? “No, I should say not at all,” he says. They “wouldn’t have thought very well” of his enjoyment of naturism. Haywood’s father, who became a bus conductor after the war, wanted his son to leave school at 15, but his mother insisted he complete his exams. The teenage Haywood lost interest in education when it became clear that university was not an option: “I was expected to bring some money into the household.”
He got a job with a bookmaker, where he met Rhona, who was a co-worker. Stints as an accountant, and running a temping agency and a greengrocer, both also with Rhona, followed. When they sold the grocery, Haywood was 57, and he struggled to find more work and so he took a horticulture course and volunteered at Calke Abbey gardens in Derbyshire, rekindling his love of the great outdoors. As a child, Haywood had roamed for hours around the 2,000-acre Bretby Park with his grandfather. He remembers looking up into a foxglove that towered over him, and seeing its blooms full of bees. Each spring, frogs laid their spawn in a ditch that filled with rainwater. “You could see all these things happening, just at the bottom of the garden.” In a sense, his interest in naturism has sprung from these moments. “It gives you an extra dimension to being in the natural world,” he says. On holiday at Lakeside, he was wandering alone when he came face to face with a fox cub. They took each other in, before the fox shot off. “For some reason, because you’ve got no clothes on, it’s a better experience.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/08/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-naturist-at-75-and-it-felt-like-freedom;guardian;entertainment & culture;4607
3849;3849;The Guardian view on Peru’s political violence: stop the killings | Editorial;2023-01-12T18:25:16Z;['Editorial'];['Peru', 'Americas', 'World news'];;"Peru’s president is its seventh in six years. It may soon be on its eighth. As vice-president, Dina Boluarte legitimately inherited the top job when Pedro Castillo was ousted and detained last month after attempting a “self-coup” – dissolving the congress in the hope of avoiding a third impeachment trial. But the deadly violence turned upon protests by his supporters has increased the anger. Thirty-nine civilians and one police officer have now died, with 17 killed on Monday alone in the southern region of Puno. Even by the security forces’ brutal standards, this is an appalling escalation. The UN human rights office demanded an investigation and Peru’s top prosecutor has now opened a genocide investigation into the new president. Peru has struggled to establish political stability since its return to democracy in 2000 after the ousting of the autocrat Alberto Fujimori, now serving a 25-year sentence on human rights abuse and corruption charges. The situation deteriorated from 2016, particularly with the emergence of Fujimori’s daughter Keiko as a political force on the right. One of Mr Castillo’s predecessors lasted just a week. Congress and presidents are unable to function together, with many legislators essentially dedicated to pursuing their own economic interests – even exploiting the current chaos by pushing through unpalatable new measures, including removing essential protections for Indigenous peoples, with little attention. The turmoil is all the more alarming in the context of threats to democracy elsewhere in the region, most glaringly in Brazil, where former president Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters last week attempted to topple his successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The domestic background is the longstanding gulf between a wealthy, white political elite in Lima and rural poor and Indigenous people elsewhere, facing discrimination and unable to access basic services. The anger and sense of abandonment mushroomed in the pandemic, when lockdowns ravaged the economy but Peru still had by far the highest Covid-19 death rate in the world. Mr Castillo – a former rural schoolteacher with no political experience – appealingly promised “no more poor people in a rich country”, but had no way of realising that pledge and packed the government with similarly inexperienced cronies. Yet his supporters feel that their man’s real crime was representing them and challenging the oligopoly. Though he identified as working class, rather than as a member of an ethnic group, his support for Indigenous groups spurred racist attacks on him. Even critics – found across the spectrum, given his social conservatism and worrying stance on human rights – acknowledge that prosecutors pursued the allegations against him with unusual speed and vigour in a country where corruption is rife. The priority now is to stop the killings by security forces. The political path ahead is harder to identify. Should Ms Boluarte step down, she would be succeeded by the far-right speaker of the congress, hardly likely to pursue the dialogue and mediation needed. Given the utter distrust in political institutions, bringing forward elections by two years to 2024 – the current plan – is clearly insufficient; but if a new president and congress were elected this year, it is unclear that they would fare any better than their predecessors. Longer-term hope may lie in the demands of ordinary citizens for better representation, and in the activism of civil society, which brought Mr Fujimori to account for brutal state killings, challenged Mr Castillo and continues to mobilise to build a better Peru.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-perus-political-violence-stop-the-killings;guardian;politics;3849
5416;5416;Disaster response charity enlisted to aid drivers stuck in UK queues for Channel;2023-01-04T06:00:10Z;['Pippa Crerar'];['Transport', 'Kent', 'Couriers/delivery industry', 'Emergency planning', 'Brexit', 'Trade policy', 'UK news', 'Business'];;The government has commissioned a £200,000-a-year contract with a disaster response charity established by the former head of Britain’s armed forces to help drivers stuck in lorry queues in Kent. The charity RE:ACT, which uses military veterans to distribute humanitarian aid in war zones and following natural disasters, has been enlisted amid concerns over driver welfare. The year-long contract, which started in November, means that food and water will be supplied to queues of vehicles on approach roads to Dover and the Channel tunnel if drivers are at a standstill for two days. The summary says the Department for Transport’s welfare plan was needed because of “regular disruptions” to the road network in the area during previous national events which had severely overstretched local responses. The plan applies to unscheduled waits of longer than two days suggesting that the government anticipates lorry drivers being forced again this year to queue on the M20 for more than 48 hours at a stretch. The decision to bring in outside experts follows the disruption to cross-Channel deliveries after Britain left the EU in December 2020, when panicked businesses attempted to stockpile goods, and a 17-mile queue of stationary lorries was reportedly visible from space. Local groups, including HM Coastguard and members of the Kent Voluntary Sector Emergency Group, stepped in after the border was closed for two days, with the taxpayer funding £34,000 to provide basic food, water and sanitation for drivers. There were further hold-ups in April 2022 when more than 2,000 lorries were stuck in a 20-mile queue due to disruption to P&O ferry services, the Easter holiday demand, and technical issues with the website needed for documentation post-Brexit. The RE:ACT charity, which won the contract through its trading arm, RE:SILIENT Response, was set up in 2015 by General Sir Nick Parker, former head of the British armed forces. His team are described as being mostly military veterans who “possess the compassion, grit, resilience and unshakeable determination to save lives and alleviate suffering in the worst situations”, according to their website. They usually deploy to “major natural disasters and on emergency operations”. This has included emergency water purification training in Sierra Leone following floods, and extensive emergency humanitarian work in Ukraine, such as provision of hot food to vulnerable displaced people in Dnipro. Nick Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent, said: “The government’s incompetence around the border has resulted in them having to bring in companies more used to providing humanitarian support for people in war zones and in the aftermath of natural disasters. That the government has turned to them shows the scale of the chaos unleashed by their failure to deliver a Brexit that works.” The DfT’s advert for the contract, which lasts until November 2023, was signed by Kent county council and has been funded by the Department for Levelling Up said: “Historically, locally procured food and water supplies were distributed direct from suppliers to those caught on to the road network. After the events of Christmas 2020 where prolonged delays resulted from the border being closed for two days, it was recognised that local response capabilities had been severely overstretched. “It was agreed with the [DfT] that a new centrally funded procurement and distribution plan was required to respond to events that were triggered by ‘national events’ and where they are going to last for longer than 1-2 days.” A government spokesperson said: “Driver welfare is our priority and it’s only right we have robust emergency support in place in case of unprecedented issues at the border. “There are currently no known congestion issues, and we continue to work across government and with our partners, including the French government, to ensure passengers have the smoothest journey possible.” • This article was amended on 9 January 2023. The DfT clarified after publication that while the contract was commissioned by the department, it was signed by Kent county council and paid for by the Department for Levelling Up.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/04/disaster-response-charity-enlisted-to-aid-drivers-stuck-in-uk-queues-for-channel;guardian;business & economy;5416
521;521;‘Spirituality and sexuality – people shouldn’t have to choose’: the Australian church celebrating queer joy;2023-01-29T14:00:53Z;['Sian Cain'];['Religion', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Religion', 'Festivals', 'Australia news', 'Culture', 'Melbourne', 'Victoria'];;"The Rev Dr Margaret Mayman walks to the pulpit and beams out at her flock inside St Michael’s Uniting Church, a deceptively austere-looking establishment dwarfed by the luxury haunts in Melbourne’s Paris end. The liturgy has ended, but she wants to do something different today, she explains – which is in keeping as a married, openly lesbian minister in Australia’s most progressive church. Instead of communion, the congregants are invited to come forward with their partners, lovers, friends and family to receive a blessing, from either herself or the Rev Clare Brockett, her wife and partner of almost three decades. People shuffle forward. Some are alone, some are in pairs. Some are young: trans people in their Sunday best, a small girl with a unicorn horn on her head. Some are older, slower; an older couple help each other down the stairs with a tight, shaking grip. Many weep openly. And to all of them, the two reverends offer a radical act of grace that is somehow both gentle and fierce: an apology for the pain religion has caused many in the room, delivered through soft touches and whispered words before sending them back to their seats.
The Uniting Church of Australia has always tended to the more progressive end of the country’s religious spectrum; in 2021, it inducted its first transgender minister, the Rev Josephine Inkpin, at Sydney’s Pitt Street Uniting Church (in fact, Inkpin took over from Mayman there.) But this morning in St Michael’s is special, even for Mayman’s regular flock: it is a service overtly celebrating queer spirit, justice and joy, as a quieter footnote in this year’s Midsumma festival, Melbourne’s annual LGBTQ jamboree.
Afterwards, in a bright, neat room nearby, the congregation mills around for morning tea. The fare is colourful: rainbow fruit skewers in an arch above a marshmallow cloud alongside vibrant cupcakes and cream biscuits dipped in sprinkles. Some of those here have come to St Michael’s for decades, others never. Some spend every Sunday at the church; for others, it is their first time inside a place of worship for years.
“I know how many people feel alienated from religion, and hurt by it,” Mayman says, delicately eating a fruit skewer. “And yet, they take the risk and come to us. So I want to make sure that our church is really, truly inclusive. Some churches say they are, but they have agendas that are not. “Spirituality and sexuality – people shouldn’t have to choose between them. It is so important to overtly honour who people are, their spirit. And I’m glad to do it.” Here are some of their stories.
Oscar, member of St Michael’s for three years Until recently, I was spiritually homeless all my life. I have been rejected from all places of worship – I tried the mosque, I tried the synagogue, I tried the church, but they all said, you’re gay, stay out. I didn’t want to hide my sexuality. I did sometimes pretend to be straight, but often the service still didn’t feel right to me. One day, my psychiatrist told me about St Michael’s, so I came along. It was the first time I heard a minister talk about gay people in a church! Afterwards I went up to the minister [Mayman] and told her how amazed I was.
“Are you gay?” she asked. “Yes,” I said. And she said something so beautiful, I will never forget it: “Come as you are, no matter your background, your gender, who you are. Just come as you are and Jesus will accept you.” Last year, I was baptised at St Michael’s. I know I will come here for the rest of my life. Cookie, choir member in the Consort of Melbourne
I have been a church musician for more than 25 years. I have had some challenging experiences as a queer person in religion, so it has been quite important for me to find a church that is accepting and inclusive. During Covid, I was very grateful to St Michael’s and St Paul’s [an Anglican church in Melbourne] – they have both created very safe places for queer people and their allies to enjoy and embrace religion. I have come to realise that I have a gift in my voice, so I am quite selective now about where I will give my gift to, mainly churches that align with my values. And St Michael’s is one of them, for sure. Laura, member of St Michael’s for 24 years, now chair of the church council I started coming to St Michael’s in 1999. Back then, my partner and I were living interstate but every time we came to Melbourne, we come to St Michael’s. The minister then had some amazing sermons – he talked about homophobia and protecting people who were different. I came out straight away, and they welcomed me and my partner. I knew it was a safe place to be.
A lot of people have been rejected by the church. My friends would often ask me, “Why do you go to church, as a lesbian?” My response would be: “Why do you go to the gym?” They go to get fit and healthy, whereas I go to church for my spiritual health. And for the community. That may sound strange to people – a lesbian in the church – but I have always felt welcomed. It gives me a great sense of peace. During today’s service you could feel it, everyone felt safe and loved. All of those beautiful people and their beautiful souls, needing to connect – that feeling is sacred. I kept coming to St Michael’s for 20-odd years and eventually became interested in working with the church. Throughout that time, my partner died; I met my new partner in 2006 and she now comes to St Michael’s. I have been the chair here for five years now. We all need to feel safe and loved. We have our friends, we have our family – if they haven’t thrown you out – but this, this is a sacred community. Here, we love you for who you are. And I will come here for the rest of my days and one day, my ashes will be kept here.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/30/spirituality-and-sexuality-people-shouldnt-have-to-choose-the-australian-church-celebrating-queer-joy;guardian;entertainment & culture;521
4259;4259;Guardiola ponders ‘ridiculous’ plans for Manchester City’s derby date at United;2023-01-10T22:30:00Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Manchester City', 'Pep Guardiola', 'Manchester United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Pep Guardiola says he is considering “ridiculous” plans for Manchester City’s derby at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday. City first play at Southampton in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, but the manager is already assessing strategies to try to defeat their crosstown rivals.
“I have a few ideas, thoughts – ridiculous ones against United – but still I didn’t watch their last games,” Guardiola said. “I have to see the way they play at home and if they change something. I still have to review it; that is why I don’t have a clear lineup [yet] against United.” After City beat Chelsea in last Thursday’s league fixture at Stamford Bridge Guardiola rested key players for the FA Cup win against the same opposition at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, including Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Freshness will be a factor in Guardiola’s selection for the derby. “The [Cup] game against Chelsea I made a lot of changes for one reason: how tired I saw some players after the game [in London], after the trip. We arrived too late back and in the training the day after I saw the players tired. It also depends on those who didn’t play against Chelsea. I would like to arrive against United with the average of minutes in the legs of the players quite similar.”
Guardiola does not feel De Bruyne or Haaland necessarily need minutes against Southampton to be at their peak to face United. “You think about that but at the same time these players have played a lot of games in the last years. Kevin: if for four or five days he doesn’t play, will he lose something? I don’t think so. I don’t think it is an issue if they do not play for eight or nine days.” Kalvin Phillips is poised to make his first City start at Southampton and Guardiola urged the midfielder to ensure Rodri “cannot sleep” by competing with the Spaniard for a regular place in the team. “He has to fight with Rodri for the benefit of all of us,” he said. “Rodri cannot sleep and [has to] have the feeling there is someone close to him to do it.” Guardiola was asked whether Phillips could win this battle. “Why not?” he said. “It depends on him how he is able to fight with Rodri.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/10/pep-guardiola-ridiculous-plans-manchester-city-manchester-united-derby-premier-league;guardian;sports;4259
6365;6365;Rishi Sunak says public sector pay rises will fuel inflation. Economists say they won't;Wednesday 4 January 2023 19:04, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];['inflation', 'rishi sunak', 'strikes', 'uk economy'];['wagepush', 'say', 'workers', 'wont', 'inflation', 'wages', 'sector', 'rises', 'sunak', 'prices', 'unemployment', 'fuel', 'public', 'increase', 'pay', 'rise', 'rishi'];"Rishi Sunak has said he cannot raise public sector wages because doing so will fuel inflation.

The government has warned of a ""wage-price spiral"", also known as wage-push inflation, in which prices rise (inflation) due to higher wages which, in turn, increase prices in a perpetual loop.

As more workers go on strike this month demanding their pay matches or beats inflation - which stands at 10.7% - two economics experts have told Sky News the government is not correct in its assessment.

They agreed increasing public sector wages would not push up inflation.

Dr Ethan Ilzetzki

Associate professor of economics, London School of Economics

""It's very wrong-minded of the government to approach it in this way,"" Dr Ilzetzki said.

""Private sector wages do feed into inflation - wages increase, costs increase and they want to pass that on to the consumer.

""So private sector wages are more likely to lead to inflation or a wage-price spiral but there's no similar way that the public sector could cause inflation.

""The caveat is, of course, an increase in public expenditure could lead to inflation and public wages are one way public expenditure is increased, but the government could increase wages and cut other parts of the budget.""

He said the conflict between the government and public sector workers is essentially political and about ""who burdens the cost"".

The Bank of England's job is to keep inflation close to 2%, he added, so ""the first order of business is to bring inflation down"" to that figure.

""The Bank of England always has the ability to bring inflation down, even if its caused by global energy prices or geopolitical conflict,"" Dr Ilzetzki said.

""That does have a cost: the further slowing down of the economy which has already plummeted, so the Bank of England does have an unenviable task but it has a very clear mandate to keep prices at a constant level.""

He added that the friction between the unions and the government is ""about taking responsibility for economic problems"" that politicians ""need to address"".

Professor Alex Bryson

Professor of quantitative social science, University College London

""The government's concern with wage-push inflation is misconceived as they're missing much of the bigger picture: unemployment and shrinking of the size of the economy,"" Prof Bryson said.

""Past periods of recession inflation were often followed by deflation - this happened in 2008.

""But this episode is different, the chief reason [for inflation rising] was not wage-push but COVID-induced restraints, which hike prices but will die back over time, as well as energy prices and ongoing uncertainty over Ukraine.""

He said unemployment rates have been low for a long time and wages have been relatively stagnant, which has meant workers' arguing power is ""not so great"".

""There are more benefits for the government paying public sector workers more than not, it's conceivable they could benefit from an increased low turnover, which would cost the public less than it does now,"" he said.

""Even a substantial pay rise will not see public sector workers catching up on the pay gap with the private sector that has been widening since 2010.""

Prof Bryson said he thinks the UK is already in recession and it will be ""long and deep"".

""We're seeing a deeper recession than is currently identified, we saw that before with the great recession of 2008 so you would expect that would normally mean a spike in unemployment,"" he said.

""Surveys in recent months show an increased proportion of indexes in the labour market saying unemployment will rise in the next 12 months.

""That will mean GDP is lower than it currently is which will mean inflation will start to fall.""

He added that at the moment, the government should be more worried about high non-employment - those not in work and not seeking work - and underemployment - those who want to work more hours but do not have the opportunity to.

""Their focus should be on reducing the rate at which real wages are falling,"" Prof Bryson said.

""It's not clear to me whether the government will be able to hold their line on wage-push inflation, especially if the unions are holding out as they seem to be.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104202443/https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-says-public-sector-pay-rises-will-fuel-inflation-economists-say-they-wont-12779761;skynews;business & economy;456
2434;2434;Scholz stalls on Ukraine tanks decision but looks poised to give go-ahead;2023-01-19T19:54:57Z;['Kate Connolly'];['Germany', 'Ukraine', 'Olaf Scholz', 'Europe', 'World news'];;"Less than a year ago it would have seemed barely imaginable that the German state would be supplying arms in a conflict. Yet now the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, finds himself under mounting international pressure to give an unconditional green light for German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine – having tentatively signalled his readiness to do so, but only if the US agrees to do the same. Even though Germany is often reluctant to spread the message itself, it is among Ukraine’s leading supporters in terms of defence aid and humanitarian and economic help. It has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, a very underreported aspect of its support. Its policy shift on Russian gas – from which German industry profited for so long, and which it has managed to wean itself off in double-quick time (even as it has opened a new brown coal opencast mine and extended the life of three nuclear power plants) is a reminder of how good at swift U-turns Germany can be. Scholz has made clear he wants to protect Germany from accusations of going it alone. Since the start of the invasion, he has repeatedly expressed his insistence that Germany will only commit to an increase in military support if it is in conjunction with a decision from other countries to do the same. Ukraine has continuously stressed that the tanks are necessary to give its troops the mobile firepower they need to drive out Russian troops. Scholz used an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to insist that Germany would “continue, together with our partners” to deliver weapons in large quantities. He went on to cite at length the list of specific items Germany had already sent, including anti-aircraft systems, artillery guns and armoured personnel carriers, calling it part of a deep and extensive “sea change” in German foreign and security policy. But he stopped short of responding to Ukraine’s request for Leopard 2 tanks, even as he was repeatedly pushed to do so. Wolfgang Ischinger, a former head of the Munich Security Conference, warned Scholz that he was in danger of isolating Germany. “The whole world is waiting for Germany – with or without the USA – to give the green light,” he told the broadcaster DLF. Observers of the Scholz government believe that even as its message over arms to Ukraine has more often than not appeared ambivalent, the fact that Germany has so far committed to the effort in a manner that would have seemed almost unthinkable before the invasion is a strong indication that it will soon say yes to the tanks. It nevertheless remains morally trapped, on the one hand by the haunting fact that continues to horrify many Germans – that under the Nazis, it was fighting on Ukrainian soil against ancestors of the very people it now wants to protect – and on the other by the fact that it is as a direct result of that war that it has more of an obligation than any other country towards Ukraine. Scholz’s struggle has been to communicate domestically, in particular, the necessity to protect Ukrainians, even as he fears that to upgrade to contributing fighter tanks could risk an escalation of the conflict, with Germany pinpointed as an aggressor. Critics meanwhile are quick to point out that Germany’s defence industry has made billions from exporting lethal weapons to highly questionable regimes around the world. In this light, they argue, its hesitancy to provide a fledgling democracy on its doorstep with the means – in the form of its bestselling Leopard – to defend itself against Russian aggression is perverse.
An editorial in the Süddeutsche Zeitung said Scholz could be expected to deliver the tanks, explaining it was in his manner to put off making decisions until there was no other choice. It expressed sympathy for his hesitancy. “It is far from being cut and dried that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will continue to take it on the chin that Nato states are increasingly involved in the war. Might he consider the use of atomic weapons in the case he feels he is at an impasse? No one can exclude this possibility,” it said. But it said Scholz would have no other option than to deliver the tanks, owing to his promise to “support Kyiv until the war is over” and the “undeniable” fact that tanks would help Ukraine fend off attacks from Putin’s army. “He will jump through the hoop – just too late for many who have been holding it up for him for months,” the paper wrote. Ralf Stegner, of the Social Democrats, stuck up for Scholz during a Bundestag debate on the future of weapons to Ukraine on Thursday. What others called “hesitation” was “in truth intelligent leadership”, he said, while one member of the conservative CDU said history was in danger of remembering the current German government as being most efficient as “a brake block”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/scholz-stalls-on-ukraine-tanks-decision-but-looks-poised-to-give-go-ahead;guardian;politics;2434
446;446;Belgium: family say death of Belgian-Tunisian woman in custody not suicide;2023-01-30T05:00:08Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['Belgium', 'Europe', 'World news'];;"The death of a Belgian-Tunisian woman in police custody earlier this month has been rejected by her family as a case of suicide, while casting a spotlight on the treatment of minority ethnic citizens by Belgium’s police. Sourour Abouda, a 46-year-old NGO worker, was found dead in a police cell early in the morning of 12 January, after being arrested several hours before. She had been found drunk in the fashionable district of Place Châtelain in Brussels and taken to a police station in the city centre, according to local media reports that have not been officially confirmed. Her family were told she had killed herself by strangling herself with her jumper, a hypothesis close relatives have robustly rejected. “My sister was not someone suicidal,” an unnamed relative told Belgian’s francophone public broadcaster RTBF. “She had a son of 19 years old who she lived with and who meant everything to her. She would never have abandoned him.” A lawyer acting in the case, Selma Benkhelifa, said the family “did not believe at all” the suicide hypothesis, adding that it seemed impossible Abouda had strangled herself with her own jumper. Writing on Instagram, Sourour Abouda’s son, Allan, described his mother as an “extraordinary person who loved life” and “exemplary mother” to him and other children who crossed her path. “Whatever happened, procedural mistakes were made,” he wrote. “I think it is clear to all of us that a death in a police station is abnormal, impossible and unforgivable. The police are only there to protect us. Something like this should never happen.” The case has now been referred to “Committee P”, the Belgian police watchdog, which is analysing CCTV footage from the cells.
In a preliminary finding, the Brussels prosecutor’s office has ruled out foul play by the police, or anyone else in Abouda’s death. “Based on initial findings and an interim report from the autopsy, it would seem there was no intervention by a third party,” the Brussels prosecutor said on 16 January, adding that the results of a toxicological analysis would be available in the coming weeks. Contacted on Friday, the Brussels prosecutor said there was nothing to add to this previous statement and the investigation remained ongoing. A spokesperson for the local police station declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Sourour Abouda is the third person of north African origin to die at the same police station on Brussels’ Rue Royale in controversial circumstances in two years. In January 2021, a 29-year-old Algerian national, Ilyes Abbedou, was found dead in a cell, after being arrested for not having the right to stay in Belgium. In December 2021 a second Algerian man, Mohamed Amine Berkhane, born in 1995, died in a cell in the same station, despite efforts by an ambulance crew called to save him. In both cases, following autopsies, the authorities ruled out any intervention by a third party in their deaths. Both official investigations remain open and the Brussels prosecutor declined to comment on the cases. In the days after Sourour Abouda’s death, about 100 people held a vigil on a rainy night outside the Rue Royale police station, an event organised by Sarah de Liamchine, co-director of Presence and Cultural Action, the NGO that employed Abouda. Speaking to the Guardian, de Liamchine said there were questions to answer about the death of her colleague. “There are a series of cases when following a police intervention people have died – and in 95% of these cases they are people of foreign origin,” she said, also referring to the deaths of the two Algerian men and a two-year-old Kurdish girl shot dead by police in a high-speed pursuit of suspected people smugglers. De Liamchine said anyone arrested for drunkenness should be seen by a doctor before being put into a cell: “The procedure was not respected and that we know already. A person arrested by the police in a state of intoxication should be safe in the custody of police. On no account should that person be found dead either by their own hand or some other means.” The afternoon before she died Sourour Abouda joined a few dozen colleagues at the NGO for a staff gathering, where she seemed like her usual self, recalled de Liamchine. Abouda had talked to colleagues about an upcoming holiday to Portugal and her plans for the year ahead. “Everyone was shocked [by her death], because everyone said she was no different from her usual self.” De Liamchine recalls her colleague as someone who liked her job and was always ready to help out. “She was truly someone who turned towards others, very participative at work and very sociable.” The case is also being followed by Tunisia’s government. In a message to its citizens in Belgium, Tunisia’s embassy said everything necessary was being done, in coordination with Belgian authorities, to find out the exact circumstances of the death of a Tunisian national in police custody on 12 January, without naming the individual.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/30/belgium-family-say-death-of-belgian-tunisian-woman-in-custody-not-suicide;guardian;entertainment & culture;446

751;751;Missing radioactive capsule: WA officials admit it was weeks before anyone realised it was lost;2023-01-28T06:29:46Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Western Australia', 'Australia news', 'Health'];;"Western Australian authorities are scrambling to find a missing radioactive capsule that is a fraction of the size of a 10c coin, conceding it was not found missing until more than two weeks after it left a Rio Tinto mine site. The 8mm by 6mm capsule is a 19-gigabecquerel caesium 137 ceramic source, commonly used in radiation gauges, and was supposed to be contained in a secure device which had been “damaged” on a truck which travelled from the mine site north of Newman in the Pilbara to a depot in Perth. Authorities are now searching along the 1,400km stretch of the Great Northern Highway for the capsule, which they warn can cause skin burns, radiation sickness and cancer.
At a news conference on Saturday, Darryl Ray, the acting superintendent for Western Australia’s Department of Fire and Emergency Services, said authorities were largely searching for the capsule at “strategic sites”. He said an incident management team including the Department of Health and police had been formed. “We have continued the search on strategic sites along the route that the vehicle had taken, concentrating on sites close to high-population areas within the metropolitan suburbs,” he said. “The search involves the use of radiation survey meters to detect the radiation levels which will help us locate the small device. “What we are not doing is trying to find a tiny little device by eyesight. We are using the radiation detectors to locate the gamma rays, using the meters, that will help us then locate the small device. “We have secured the GPS data from the trucking company to determine the exact route and stops that the vehicle has taken on its journey. “We will continue to use specialist equipment to help us search the remaining known locations ... in particular, the Great Northern Highway between Perth and Newman.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The WA chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said there were screws missing from the protective gauge holding the capsule when it was discovered missing. “These gauges are designed to be robust and to be used in industrial settings where they may be exposed to weather and vibration, so it is unusual for a gauge to come apart like this one has,” Robertson said. “We are conducting an investigation on all of the circumstances from when it was originally transported from the mine site, the whole of the transport route, and then its handling on arrival in Perth.” Robertson urged anyone who found the capsule not to handle it. “People could end up developing redness of the skin and eventually burns of the skin from the beta radiation,” he said. “If it were kept long enough and they were exposed long enough, they could also have some acute effects, including impacts on their immune system and the gastrointestinal system.” Robertson said the capsule was “most dangerous if it is handled or if it is close to the body”. “If you are further than five metres away from the source, certainly if you are more than 20 metres away from the source, it will pose no danger to you,” he said. “If it is closer than that, and we strongly discourage people from picking it up, certainly don’t put it in your pocket or put it in your car, don’t put it on your sideboard, it will continue to radiate. “While you may not have immediate health effects, they can occur relatively rapidly over a short period of time if it is close to the body. “If you see it [or] identify it, move away from the source, contact 13DFES and report it. We will get somebody out there to have a look at the source and we will use our radiation meters to identify whether it is the source.” Robertson said officials did not know the date the capsule fell off the truck. Ray said the capsule was placed on to the pallet on 10 January at the mine site, transited and arrived at the radiation service company in Malaga on 16 January. “It was not until the 25th, late morning, when they opened it up to reveal that the device had fallen apart, was damaged in transit, and that the actual capsule was discovered missing, which is when authorities were first notified.” Ray said police had determined the capsule was not taken in a criminal act. Robertson said specialist equipment had been requested from agencies within the commonwealth, including the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. “What we are looking for is mobile radiation detection equipment that we can put in a car and then drive at a reasonable speed,” he said. “But, you know, there are a number of variables here: it could have been knocked further out into the bush, it could have been picked up and carried in a tyre wheel in another direction. We have to look at all of those options.” Mining giant Rio Tinto confirmed earlier on Saturday that the capsule had come from one of its mining sites. The company said it had contracted an expert radioactive materials handler to “package the capsule and transport it safely” to the depot. “Rio Tinto was informed of the missing capsule by a contractor on January 25,” a spokesman said. “The contractor, an expert radioactive materials handler, was engaged by Rio Tinto to handle and package the capsule and transport it safely off site. “Safety is our highest priority, and we are working with and supporting the Radiological Council, the contractors involved, as well as emergency services to assist in the search.” • This article was amended on 29 January 2023.

3956;3956;British Gas owner forecasts eightfold rise in earnings amid soaring gas prices;2023-01-12T10:30:22Z;['Alex Lawson'];['Centrica', 'Gas', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Energy industry', 'Energy bills', 'Business', 'Commodities', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money', 'Utilities', 'Family finances', 'UK news'];;The owner of British Gas, Centrica, expects a near eightfold increase in its earnings this year due to its balance sheet being boosted by soaring wholesale gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The FTSE 100 group said on Thursday it expected earnings a share to be more than 30p this financial year. That represents an upgrade on City expectations of 23.6p to 26.6p a share, far outstripping the 4p a share generated in 2021, when pre-tax profits hit £761m. It is the third time Centrica has upgraded its annual expectations this financial year, and the second time in three months. In a brief, unscheduled statement to investors, Centrica said it had “continued to deliver strong operational performance from its balanced portfolio” and expects to have more than £1bn of cash on its balance sheet for this year. The statement risks stoking further anger over the profits made by energy producers since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, which has pushed up wholesale gas prices far above historical averages. The company – alongside UK oil and gas giants BP and Shell – faced criticism on reporting bumper profits while consumers struggled with bills last year. Centrica said in November that the performance of its North Sea gasfields and electricity generation assets – it owns 20% of the UK’s nuclear fleet – meant full-year profits would be towards the top end of expectations. “The upgrade appears to be driven by stronger profits in the trading and gas storage businesses, which is a continuation of the themes Centrica has seen through the year,” said RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler. The company reinstated its dividend with a £59m payout to shareholders last year and in November launched a £250m share buyback, the first since 2014. However, analysts expect Centrica’s business supplying homes with gas and electricity to make a loss in the second half of the year. British Gas last year announced it would donate 10% of its profits to help its poorer customers manage rising gas and electricity bills for the “duration of the energy crisis”. Centrica’s shares – which have risen more than 30% over the last 12 months – increased 6% to 97p on Thursday morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. It will report full-year results on 16 February.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/british-gas-owner-forecasts-eightfold-rise-in-earnings-amid-soaring-gas-prices;guardian;business & economy;3956

People will no longer have to quarantine on arrival but a negative COVID test - taken within the last 48 hours - will still need to be shown.

The change has led to long queues at Hong Kong airport as people take the chance to finally travel to the mainland - many of them for long-overdue reunions with family.

""I'm so happy, so happy, so excited. I haven't seen my parents for many years,"" said Teresa Chow at a China-Hong Kong border checkpoint on Sunday.

Some 300,000 bookings from Hong Kong to mainland China have already been made, according to media in the city.

However, it could take a while until the number of international flights gets close to pre-pandemic levels.

Beijing's Capital airport was expecting just eight flights from overseas on Sunday. Shanghai had its first international flight at 6.30 am, with just a few more expected.

China has also resumed issuing passports and travel visas.

With foreign travel off the table since 2020, travel companies have reported a big increase in inquiries about holiday destinations near China, such as Indonesia and Thailand.

Sunday's border change is a significant moment after China cut itself off from the rest of the world as it enforced its zero-COVID strategy.

The government finally rowed back from that after its citizens grew increasingly exasperated and took to the streets at the end of 2022 in some of the biggest protests for years.

However, coronavirus infections in China have surged as a result, with hospitals said to be inundated with patients.

Many Western countries, including the UK, have responded in recent weeks by imposing fresh rules on arrivals from China, such as the need to show a negative test before flying.

Governments and the World Health Organisation are concerned that China is concealing the extent of its surge in deaths and infections - something it denies.

The reopening of borders also coincides with the start of New Year travel, during which people traditionally return to their hometown to see family.

Rescue teams worked through the night in sub-zero temperatures to find survivors in the rubble of the nine-storey apartment building, with screams heard beneath the wreckage.

Russia accuses UK of 'escalating conflict' - latest updates

Pictures from the scene of the attack showed the tower had been largely toppled, with large plumes of smoke billowing into the air as emergency services carried out their search.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the death toll would likely rise in the country's fourth-largest city, centrally located on the Dnipro River and home to a large Holocaust memorial and museum.

More than 60 people were injured and 38 have been rescued so far, but around two dozen were still missing as of 2.50am local time (0.50am UK), said regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko on Telegram.

Dnipro's deputy mayor Mikhailo Lysenko said in a social media video that desperate residents were sending text messages from their destroyed flats, adding: ""We stop our work now and then to keep silence, and we hear people scream from underneath the rubble.""

'Russian terror' hits key infrastructure

Saturday's flurry of Russian strikes also hit critical infrastructure in several major cities: in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital; Kharkiv in the east; and Lviv in the west.

Ukraine's air force managed to shoot down 25 of 38 missiles fired by the invaders, but those which landed caused disruption to parts of the cities' power supplies.

Moscow has stepped up its bombardment of Ukrainian energy infrastructure since October, causing large blackouts, cutting central heating and running water.

Mr Zelenskyy decried the latest attacks as ""Russian terror"", as Vladimir Putin's forces seek to increase Ukrainian suffering during the freezing winter months.

Ukraine's energy minister warned that the coming days would be ""difficult"" due to the impact of Saturday's onslaught, which also left one person dead in the steel-making city of Kryviy Rih.

Allies pledge more assistance

Ukraine's allies have promised to send more military aid, with the White House's ambassador to Kyiv condemning the attacks against Dnipro as ""horrifying"".

""More security assistance is coming to help Ukraine defend itself,"" Bridget Brink said on Twitter.

The US has promised 50 Bradley tank-killing armoured vehicles in its biggest military assistance package to date.

Meanwhile, Britain has become the first Western nation to pledge tanks to Kyiv.

Fourteen Challenger 2 tanks will be sent in the coming weeks, along with around 30 AS90 propelled guns, which are large armaments operated by five gunners.

Mr Zelenskyy thanked the UK for its ""impenetrable"" support following a call with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but appealed for more help from other allies.

""The whole world knows what and how to stop those who are sowing death,"" he said in his nightly address.

It is hoped that other allies will follow suit, most notably Germany, unlocking the Leopard 2 tank, which was manufactured in far greater numbers and is used by several other European countries.

Ukraine's allies meet in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments will announce their latest pledges.

Battle for hotly-contested town continues

Despite Russian claims of victory, fighting continued in the town of Soledar on Saturday - a site in the eastern Donetsk region that has seen some of the bloodiest fighting of the war.

The town's fall would mark a rare victory for the Kremlin after a series of battlefield setbacks, as Moscow says taking control would allow its forces to cut supply lines for Ukrainian troops in the nearby city of Bakhmut.

But pockets of resistance remain, and Ukrainian officials said the battle continued.

""Our soldiers are constantly repelling enemy attacks, day and night,"" deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said.

""The enemy is sustaining heavy losses but is continuing to carry out the criminal orders of their command.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230115040208/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-at-least-14-dead-as-dnipro-apartment-block-struck-in-brutal-wave-of-russian-strikes-12787032;skynews;politics;1386
8076;8076;Investigation launched into appointment process of BBC chairman after Boris Johnson loan claim;Monday 23 January 2023 15:47, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['bbc', 'boris johnson'];['sharp', 'mr', 'boris', 'richard', 'johnson', 'blyth', 'investigation', 'claim', 'chairman', 'appointment', 'bbc', 'public', 'review', 'sam', 'process', 'loan', 'launched'];"An investigation will be launched into the appointment of the BBC chairman following reports he helped Boris Johnson secure a loan.

William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said he would review the competition which led to Richard Sharp's appointment while Mr Johnson was prime minister.

He made the announcement in response to a request from shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell.

He said: ""The role of the commissioner is to oversee the public appointments process and ensure appointments are made fairly, openly and on merit.

""I intend to review this competition to assure myself and the public that the process was run in compliance with the government's governance code for public appointments.""

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020, and that the then-prime minister went on to recommend him for the top job at the BBC.

Earlier on Monday, the chairman asked for the BBC to review any potential conflicts of interest he may currently have to ensure that ""all appropriate guidelines have been followed"" since he joined the broadcaster.

""We have many challenges at the BBC and I know that distractions such as this are not welcome,"" he said in a statement read out on BBC News.

The review will not look at his links to Mr Johnson's loan, but in a letter to BBC staff, Mr Sharp clarified some of the details surrounding the Sunday Times report.

He confirmed he introduced multimillionaire Canadian businessman Sam Blyth to cabinet secretary Simon Case ""as Sam wanted to support Boris Johnson"".

""I was not involved in making a loan, or arranging a guarantee, and I did not arrange any financing. What I did do was to seek an introduction of Sam Blyth to the relevant official in government,"" he said.

""Sam Blyth, who I have known for more than forty years, lives in London and having become aware of the financial pressures on the then-prime minister, and being a successful entrepreneur, he told me he wanted to explore whether he could assist.""

Mr Blyth is a distance cousin of Mr Johnson's.

The statement was released moments after Mr Johnson said that Mr Sharp ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances"".

Speaking to Sky News he said: ""This is a load of complete nonsense - absolute nonsense.

""Let me just tell you, Richard Sharp is a great and wise man but he knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding-dang sure.

""This is just another example of the BBC disappearing up its own fundament.""

The BBC reported that Mr Sharp ""has agreed with the board's senior independent director"" that the nominations committee will look at conflicts of interest when it next meets and, ""in the interests of transparency, publish the conclusions"".

Timeline November 2020:

According to the Sunday Times the loan guarantee was first suggested by Canadian millionaire Sam Blyth during a dinner with Richard Sharp. Early December 2020:

In early December, Richard Sharp put Sam Blyth in contact with the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. Late 2020:

Before the end of the year, Richard Sharp and Sam Blyth met with Boris Johnson for dinner at his country residence, Chequers. They insist the prime minister's finances were not discussed. January 2021:

At the start of January, the government announced Richard Sharp as the preferred candidate to be BBC chairman.

Ms Powell said there also needed to be an independent investigation into the hiring process ""to satisfy the public and parliament of its integrity. ""

The party has also reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, saying the former prime minister's financial affairs are ""dragging the Conservative Party deeper into yet another quagmire of sleaze"".

The Cabinet Office has insisted Mr Sharp was appointed ""following a rigorous appointments process"".

This included assessment by a panel of experts and ""additional pre-appointment scrutiny by a House of Commons Select Committee"", according to a statement released yesterday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123154804/http://news.sky.com/story/investigation-launched-into-appointment-process-of-bbc-chairman-after-boris-johnson-loan-claim-12793498;skynews;politics;2167
1078;1078;Football Daily | Duncan Ferguson takes his first bite of full-time football management;2023-01-26T15:31:58Z;['Barry Glendenning'];['Football', 'Sport'];;"PUTTING THE ‘NAILS’ IN NAILSWORTH It was only after his retirement as a player whose largely successful career had spanned 16 years that it occurred to Football Daily that we had never actually heard Duncan Ferguson speak. Throughout spells at Dundee United, Rangers, Everton, Newcastle and Everton again, the fearsome striker enjoyed hero status, scored some memorable goals, and got himself in several on- and off-field scrapes, seemingly managing to do so without so much as a single public utterance. This refusal to stand in front of a microphone may have had its origins in a court conviction for an on-field incident that even nowadays would merit little more than a red card and certainly not the three-month stretch in the Big House handed down by a Scottish beak. Not entirely unreasonably, Big Dunc felt he had been the victim of a stitch-up and there were plenty who agreed with him. While we might not have heard him talk, fans of a certain age may remember reading Ferguson’s musings. Contractually obliged by his boot manufacturers to sit down for a magazine interview during the mid-90s, after consulting with his “people” the striker point-blank refused to talk about any other subject than Mitre boots. The subsequent six-page exclusive simultaneously contrived to be the most banal and fascinating interview with a footballer that has ever been committed to the printed page. Had your Football Daily not already hung up its boots in favour of more hedonistic pursuits, we would have never let any other brand sully our size 11s from that point on, due in no small part to the amusement we derived from that interview. Post-retirement, a new, more outgoing, jocular and – dare we say – extrovert Ferguson began to emerge. When he wasn’t engaged in the serious business of making domestic burglars regret their poor career and life choices, he could be heard conducting interviews in which he seemed happy to discuss all manner of subjects, including his new coaching role at Everton. Up for the occasional punditry role, on social media disgraces he could also be seen doing regular good deeds, admonishing idle schoolboys for being less than diligent in their studies and generally being a lovely man. He was also sighted braving touchline blizzards in his shirtsleeves upon taking caretaker charge of his beloved Everton. And now, armed with his Uefa pro licence and a wealth of knowledge learned at the knees of high-profile gaffers, Big Dunc has taken his first official job in management.
The 51-year-old has been appointed by Forest Green, who currently sit bottom of League One, are without a win in any of their past eight games and find themselves in all sorts of relegation bother. “It’s fantastic, I’ve been waiting for this for a long time,” tooted a beaming Ferguson at their famously eco-friendly stadium, without once mentioning which cobbler had made his shoes. “I’m really delighted to join Forest Green Rovers for the next step of my career and I plan to be here for a while. We have a bit of a fight on our hands to stay up and I am ready for the challenge. I am grateful for the opportunity to come and lead such a progressive and forward-thinking club too. Their world-leading green creds are seriously impressive.” It’s a new reign at the New Lawn and Big Dunc’s feeling good. QUOTE OF THE DAY “At basically any point in my life, if someone had told me I’d be the head coach of a Ligue 1 side at 30, I’d have told them to punch me in the face” – Will Still’s remarkable story, from Football Manager to actual Reims manager, in his own words. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS That photo of Jacob Murphy waving off Duje Caleta-Car after his red card (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition) made me think: why stop there? Next time the opposition receive a red card, maybe the other team can form a guard of (dis)honour, all wave and clap as the disgraced red-carder departs the pitch, walking off on a hastily-deployed red carpet, to the sound of a 21-gun salute from canons specially deployed on top of the stand, as the floodlights flash from white to red, and Nelson Muntz’s trademark ‘ha-haaaa’ played on a loop. Maybe a quick entry in the ‘How Far Can I Kick a Drinks Bottle’ competition sponsored by a betting company on the way out too, complete with officials in white coats with tape measures? And if they take an age arguing with the ref about the decision, have an opera singer stroll out to the middle of the pitch and sing the national anthem. All six verses. Hopefully there’ll still be time for a quick firework display and marching band before they eventually get to the tunnel” – Steve Malone.
How fitting that yesterday was Burns Night, and I feel the need to give Big Website a proper scalding for their attempt at ‘100 best male footballers in the world 2022’. Being connected in some way to the self-appointed ‘best league in the world’ seems to be enough to merit a place for the likes of debut red-card enthusiast, Darwin Núñez, and stab-pass connoisseur, Declan Rice. Yer honest sonsie faces could do yersels a favour and look north of the border at red-hot Kyogo Furuhashi and the ever-present Callum McGregor for a bit of inspiration, for auld lang syne” – Johnny Connelly. Re: yesterday’s main Football Daily story about Everton pointing in the same direction (down?) and groundbreaking films. Can I suggest Everton Everywhere All at Once? It works quite well if you do it in a Scouse accent” – Joe Lowry. It’s testament to Everton’s bad run that Arnaut Danjuma actually managed to find an Avanti train to take him from Liverpool to London. In normal circumstances, Toffees’ suits probably could’ve tracked him down to the Caffè Nero by platform nine, staring disconsolately at his phone while he despaired about his delay” – Jim Hearson. Mention of Bolton (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition) has reminded me of the uncanny resemblance between the current Wanderers manager Ian Evatt and the Rob Hepworth character from Happy Valley” – Elaine Shaw.
I was intrigued by the 1984 photo of Chelsea players (yesterday’s Memory Lane, full email edition), while studying – not admiring – the shaven chests. I am closing in on 74 years old, with a hairy chest my wife continues to enjoy. However, in 1984 as a football player, I never saw anyone in the showers with a shaven or even a hedgehog cut. Today, studying modern players lounging on their super yachts with chests polished like a bald head, not a porcupine quill to be seen.

5628;5628;‘I had to say goodbye’: thousands pay their respects to Pelé in Brazil;2023-01-02T18:18:16Z;['Andrew Downie'];['Pelé', 'Brazil', 'Fifa', 'World news', 'Americas', 'Football'];;"Thousands of mourners braved punishing heat to pay their final tribute to footballing legend Pelé on Monday as the president of Fifa said he would ask every member country to name a stadium after the recently deceased Brazilian player. Fans lined up outside the 106-year-old Vila Belmiro ground in Santos – the city in south-eastern Brazil where Pelé first made his name as a star goal scorer in the 1950s – overnight and at about 10am mourners began filing past the coffin that had been placed under a shaded tent in the middle of the field. Family members, including Pelé’s widow, Marcia Aoki, and sons Edinho and Joshua, as well as dozens of friends and former teammates, stood over the open coffin, some of them weeping. The world’s media watched on from the main stand as, a few metres to one side of the coffin, fans – most of them wearing shorts and many of them dressed in Santos shirts – walked by in silent tribute.
Three sides of the16,000-capacity stadium were draped with Santos flags celebrating the life of the city’s favourite son, and the public address system occasionally played some of the songs Pelé recorded during a parallel career as a singer and songwriter. “LONG LIVE THE KING,” said one massive banner alongside others depicting his face and famous number 10 jersey. “I had to come and pay tribute,” said Roberto Morais, a 67-year-old who had travelled 50 miles to see Pelé one last time. “I had to say goodbye. He was the king – he taught the whole world.” Pelé passed away at São Paulo’s Albert Einstein hospital on Thursday afternoon after a long illness. The former Brazil international and Santos and New York Cosmos player was diagnosed with colon cancer in September 2021 and was in and out of hospital for a year. His cancer stopped responding to treatment in November and doctors said his death came as a consequence of “multiple organ failure”. Pelé’s body was kept in the hospital over the new year and driven 50 miles to the Santos ground early on Monday morning where it was laid out in the middle of the pitch. Fans will be allowed to pass by the coffin for 24 hours before it is taken for a private burial on Tuesday. Pelé will be laid to rest in a private service at 10am on Tuesday in the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 14,000 bodies.
Long queues formed throughout the day on Monday, snaking through the narrow streets that surround the ground where Pelé played many of his more than 1,000 games for the club. The mood was respectful but noisy, with the presence of dignitaries and politicians guaranteeing a heavy police presence and helicopters flying overhead. Among the mourners who made their way past the barriers and through the scrum of fans and media were Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, and Alejandro Dominguez, the president of the South American Football Confederation (Conmebol). Infantino announced he would ask Fifa’s member countries to pay a special tribute to the three-time World Cup winner. “We will ask every country in the world, every federation in the world, and there are 211 countries who are members of Fifa, to name one of their stadiums with the name of Pelé,” Infantino said. “Because everywhere in the world, children – in 20 years and 50 years and 100 years from now – they need to remember Pelé. “And they need to remember [Pelé] in a place where you score goals, where teams are winning – and maybe also losing – but where emotions are happening.” Other fans paid their own tributes, including with flags and fireworks, and members of the organised fan group known as the Torcida Jovem (Young Fans) were present in the narrow streets outside the ground.
“Pelé called us young fans, so that’s what we named ourselves,” said Cosme Damião, who founded the group in 1969. “And he has meant so much to me since then, and we became friends. “Brazil was one thing before Pelé and another thing after. The city of Santos was one thing before Pelé and another after.” Edson Arantes do Nascimento was born in the town of Tres Corações (Three Hearts) but was brought up in Bauru, a mid-sized city 250 miles inland from Santos. The 15-year-old was brought to the port city for a trial in 1956, and after impressing the coaches he quickly found his feet and became a fixture in the first team. Less than two years after making his debut for the club he was called up for the Brazil squad that went to the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Pelé missed the first couple of games through injury but scored six times in the last three matches, including a double in the final against the host country, to give Brazil their first world title.
Injury meant he played little part when Brazil successfully defended their trophy in Chile four years later, and in 1966 he was kicked out of the tournament as Brazil were eliminated at the group stage. However, four years later he made the most triumphant return possible by leading what is considered to be one of the greatest sides ever to a record third World Cup win in Mexico. Teammate Clodoaldo lauded his friend and repeated the oft-heard contention that Pelé was and remains the greatest ever to play the game. “Pelé showed in 1970 why he was the king,” Clodoaldo said. “The crown was his from that moment on.” “People who follow football know that young people who didn’t see Pelé play have doubts about him, and I am always being asked, : ‘Was he really that good?’ I tell them,: if you take a bit of every crack you admire today, you might get close to being as good as Pelé.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/02/thousands-mourners-file-past-pele-coffin-santos-brazil;guardian;sports;5628
3913;3913;Children in Australia’s poorest households have about 10% chance of becoming top earners;2023-01-12T14:00:13Z;['Paul Karp'];['Welfare', 'Inequality', 'Australia news', 'Australian economy', 'Australian politics', 'Jim Chalmers (Australian politician)', 'Poverty'];;"Children born into Australia’s poorest households will have little more than a 10% chance of becoming top income earners in their lifetime, according to new Treasury research. Treasury research on intergenerational income mobility, to be released on Friday, found children in the bottom fifth of households in Australia had a 12.3% chance of reaching the top fifth by income. It said they were “60% more likely” to make this leap than in the US, where just 7.5% make it into the top fifth. The report found that “poverty in the bottom decile is particularly entrenched”, a conclusion likely to add to calls to combat disadvantage through measures including raising the rate of jobseeker. The report, by Nathan Deutscher in the structural analysis branch, examined the incomes of more than 1 million children born in Australia between the 1978 and 1982.
It found that, on average, having parents 10% higher in the income distribution lifted an Australian child’s income by 2.2%, compared with 3.4% in the US. In Australia greater income mobility was driven by a strong labour market and education, with children in the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland particularly benefiting from high-paying jobs.
The report also noted the “striking success of second-generation Australians” evidenced by the “tendency of migrants to outperform locals with similar backgrounds”. “For example, Vietnamese Australians had fathers with an average income rank at the 29th percentile but ended up at the 54th percentile in the space of a generation.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Migrant upward income mobility tends to reflect upward educational mobility … second-generation Australians aspire to more education, attain it, and earn more as a result.” The report also noted increased “headwinds” for current generations including declining test scores, barriers to geographic mobility including due to house prices, and slowing productivity. In two comparator countries, Sweden and the US, those born into the top 1% of households by income did better than Australia due to “inherited wealth (and hence capital income) rather than IQ, non-cognitive skills or education”. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said it would be unfair if prospects were determined solely by where Australians were born or who their parents were. “Social and economic mobility is the secret to a stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive economy in the future,” he said. “We’re doing well but we can do better.”
That will be reflected in the Albanese government’s agenda for 2023 including “investing in the high-wage jobs of the future, giving Australians the skills they need for those jobs and doing more to tackle entrenched disadvantage in parts of our country”, he said. The Albanese government has come under pressure from crossbench senator David Pocock to increase jobseeker welfare payments, eventually agreeing to establish an expert committee to advise on the adequacy of welfare before every budget. On industrial relations, Labor has already passed one bill to boost workers’ bargaining power and will introduce a second tranche of reforms to legislate its promises of same-job same-pay in labour hire and minimum conditions in the gig economy. In the education portfolio, Labor has boosted fee-free Tafe places but has come under fire for delaying a new schools funding agreement by one year, which advocates warn will slow scheduled increases in public school funding.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/13/children-in-australias-poorest-households-have-about-10-chance-of-becoming-top-earners-research-shows;guardian;business & economy;3913
7377;7377;Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick pleads guilty to string of sex offences including 24 rape charges;Monday 16 January 2023 12:04, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];['david carrick', 'hertfordshire', 'london', 'metropolitan police'];['victims', 'met', 'offences', 'david', 'women', 'including', 'guilty', 'pleads', 'string', 'carrick', 'serving', 'metropolitan', 'counts', 'sexual', 'sex', 'officer', 'rape'];"A serving Metropolitan Police officer has pleaded guilty to a string of sexual offences including 24 rape charges.

PC David Carrick - who was known to his colleagues as ""B*****d Dave"" - entered guilty pleas when he appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday.

The 48-year-old was charged with 49 offences against 12 women over a period spanning 18 years.

They included the rape of nine different women, but some of the charges are multiple incident counts, meaning they relate to more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes.

Carrick served with the army before he joined the Met Police in August 2001 and worked with the force's parliamentary and diplomatic command from 2009.

The armed officer's role included policing parliamentary, government and diplomatic premises.

He was only suspended after a second rape complaint was made against him in October 2021.

Carrick met some of his victims through online dating sites, such as Tinder and Badoo, or on social occasions - and used his position as a police officer to gain their trust.

He admitted raping women on multiple occasions over months or years, with many of those attacks involving violence that would have left them physically injured.

Officer whipped and urinated on victims

Some victims were locked in a small cupboard under the stairs in his Hertfordshire home for hours without food or forced to clean his house naked.

Carrick whipped one woman with a belt, urinated on some of his victims, and told them when they could eat and sleep.

He called women ""fat and lazy"" or his ""slave"" as he controlled them financially, isolated them from friends and family, and forbade them from speaking with other men or even their own children.

Carrick denied a further count of rape relating to a 13th woman, whose allegation triggered the investigation, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on the charge.

The court heard that over drinks in a pub in September 2020, Carrick told her he was a firearms officer nicknamed ""B*****d Dave"", showed her his warrant card and boasted of meeting famous people, including then-prime minister Boris Johnson, in the course of his work.

Victims 'intimidated and humiliated'

Detective Chief Inspector Iain Moor, the senior investigating officer, said Carrick ""thrived on humiliating his victims and cleverly used his professional position to intimate there was no point in them trying to seek help because they would never be believed"".

""The coercive nature of his offending undermined his victims in the most destructive way,"" he added.

Mr Moor described the false imprisonment charges as ""shocking"", adding: ""Carrick forced his victims into a small under-stairs cupboard at his home address where they stayed intimidated and humiliated until he chose when they could come out. I have seen bigger dog crates.

""It is unbelievable to think these offences could have been committed by a serving police officer.

""The offending was absolutely abhorrent and I'm disgusted by it.""

PC David Carrick's list of admitted offences 24 counts of rape

Nine counts of sexual assault

Five counts of assault by penetration

Three counts of coercive and controlling behaviour

Three counts of false imprisonment

Two counts of attempted rape

One count of attempted sexual assault by penetration

One count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent

One count of indecent assault

Met Police knew of previous allegations

Following his guilty pleas, the Met Police confirmed Carrick ""had come to the attention of the Met and other forces on nine occasions prior to October 2021"" but had not been charged over those allegations against him.

They included allegations of rape, domestic violence, and harassment between 2000 and 2021.

Carrick, from Stevenage in Hertfordshire, was also the subject of five complaints from the public while serving with the Met Police, the force said.

The Met said Carrick was vetted in 2001 and again in 2017, and passed on both occasions.

Met Police 'truly sorry'

Assistant Commissioner Barbara Gray, the Met's lead for professionalism, said Carrick's offending was ""unprecedented in policing"" and apologised to his victims for failing to remove him from the force.

""We should have spotted his pattern of abusive behaviour and because we didn't, we missed opportunities to remove him from the organisation,"" she said.

""We are truly sorry that being able to continue to use his role as a police officer may have prolonged the suffering of his victims.""

A misconduct hearing is due to be heard in Carrick's absence on Tuesday.

'One of most shocking cases'

Senior crown prosecutor Shilpa Shah said the degradation Carrick caused his victims was unlike anything she had seen in her career.

""This is one of the most shocking cases the Crown Prosecution Service has dealt with involving a serving police officer,"" she said.

""Carrick held a role where he was trusted with the responsibility of protecting the public, yet over 17 years in his private life he did the exact opposite.

""Carrick held a role where he was trusted with the responsibility of protecting the public, yet over 17 years in his private life he did the exact opposite.

""This is a man who relentlessly degraded, belittled, sexually assaulted and raped women.""

London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""absolutely sickened by the truly abhorrent offences that David Carrick has committed"".

""Serious questions must be answered about how he was able to abuse his position as an officer,"" he added.

Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said she will sentence Carrick over two days from 6 February.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230116130429/http://news.sky.com/story/metropolitan-police-officer-david-carrick-pleads-guilty-to-string-of-sex-offences-including-24-rapes-12787890;skynews;entertainment & culture;1468

Given Hornsby paid $144,479 notional GST in just the last year of the two decades of the tax’s operation, the claim could be worth several million to the council and tens or hundreds of millions across the 537 councils that make up the third tier of government in Australia.
The council argues that local governments are in effect forced to pay GST through an agreement between the commonwealth, states and territories in 1999 that councils either account for and pay “notional GST” or equivalent amounts will be withheld from their grants if they refuse. That breaches the constitution’s guarantee that the federal government “cannot impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a state”, it submitted. The commonwealth rejects the council’s claim, arguing the “voluntary” payments are not a tax because there is “no compulsory exaction of property” involved, including in withholding grant payments. It says councils “have no legal right to receive” grants and Hornsby’s case amounts to seeking a “windfall” of keeping both the full value of grants and not paying GST. Ruddock, the mayor of Hornsby council, was a cabinet minister in the Howard government from 1998 to 2007, including during the time the GST was designed and legislated. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A spokesperson for the council said it was pursuing the case in “the interests of its ratepayers and residents” and that this was its priority “whatever the effect on the tax base if the notional GST scheme is unconstitutional”. “Wearing his current hat, the mayor supports council’s decision to commence these proceedings.” Ruddock confirmed he and other councillors had been briefed by the general manager and supported the court battle. “My role is to make decisions in council’s best interests,” he told Guardian Australia. “The fact I may have been in a previous role doesn’t influence that I have a responsibility to make sound decisions. “I’m acting for council in the context of costs we have to meet, as we are constrained financially due to council amalgamations.” In a writ launching the case in December 2021, Hornsby sought a declaration that it was entitled to GST it had paid since July 2000 plus interest – a yet to be calculated amount. In its May 2022 business activity statement alone, the council reported paying $144,479 GST on sales and $981,929 GST on purchases, a net amount of $836,450 refunded by the tax office. In September the parties agreed to facts narrowing the case to consideration of one set of transactions: the council’s $35,000 purchase of a Holden Colorado Trailblazer four-wheel drive in September 2018, and its sale, which included the payment of $3,182 in GST, in May 2022. In July 2022 the council’s general manager, Steven Head, wrote to the Australian Taxation Office stating it had reported and paid the GST “under protest”. In its submissions, Hornsby council argues although the commonwealth can place conditions on grants to states, it cannot “require action which is in contravention of a constitutional prohibition”, including requiring the states to withhold funds from local government. The council says it was “compelled” to pay GST or suffer “detrimental consequences”, including deductions from grants that make up 2% of its annual revenue, compromising its ability to maintain “sporting ovals, grandstands, bridges and … infrastructure”. Though notionally voluntary, the council says this makes GST payments a form of “forced benevolence” that amounts to an unconstitutional tax. It described the 1999 agreement and legislation giving effect to it as “a circuitous device” to avoid the prohibition on taxing states’ property. “In the event the plaintiff does not pay the notional GST, the amount will be taken from it.” The council’s spokesperson told Guardian Australia that the GST regime required council pay the ATO “notional GST on supplies of council’s property”. “But for the regime, council would have been entitled to retain this money for the benefit of its residents.” The council’s spokesperson confirmed that, if successful, “a claim for restitution of notional GST paid by council will be pursued separately”.
The commonwealth submitted that it had agreed with states and territories to treat councils “as if” they were subject to GST to achieve “equality of treatment” between government and non-government entities. The agreement “enabled the GST system to work as intended (as a value added tax, the burden of which is ultimately borne by the consumer) by ensuring that the interposition of a state in the supply chain did not disrupt the system of input tax credits on which the system depends”, it said. The commonwealth submitted that the threat of withholding grants did not make “notional GST” payments a tax or “forced benevolence” because councils were under no “legal obligation” to pay it, and were explicitly given the choice not to do so. The commonwealth submitted that councils can pay notional GST or receive a reduced grant but this left them “no worse off” because they would be in the same position either way. “To deny the plaintiff a windfall gain is not to ‘compel’ it to make a payment of notional GST.” The commonwealth is supported by New South Wales, which is the second defendant, and interventions from Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. Hornsby council will file reply submissions in February, before the case is heard in early 2023.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/18/philip-ruddocks-sydney-council-challenges-legality-of-gst-levies-on-local-government;guardian;politics;2974
6792;6792;NI protocol: 'New basis' for resolving row after UK and EU agree data sharing deal;Monday 9 January 2023 22:30, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['brexit', 'malta v northern ireland'];['resolving', 'protocol', 'row', 'deal', 'data', 'eu', 'sharing', 'agreement', 'ni', 'northern', 'secretary', 'work', 'ireland', 'working', 'uk', 'basis'];"The EU and UK say there is a ""new basis"" for resolving the Northern Ireland Protocol row after an agreement was reached on sharing trade data.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris met EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic in London on Monday, as efforts to find a way forward over post-Brexit arrangements in the region continue.

The agreement will allow the EU to access UK IT systems which will provide detailed information about goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

Both sides hailed an agreement as a key step in resolving the deadlock over the protocol, which has left Northern Ireland without a devolved powersharing executive since early last year.

But David Lammy, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, said: ""Three years after we left the EU, the government's progress on fixing the Protocol it negotiated is pathetic. A working data arrangement with the EU is of course welcome, but just one aspect and long overdue.""

The protocol has overshadowed Northern Irish politics since it was agreed as part of the Brexit deal in a bid to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Members of the unionist community are unhappy with the difficulties it creates for trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) refusing to co-operate with forming a devolved Executive in Stormont until the issues are resolved.

The UK government says the protocol is not working and wants to override it with new legislation if the EU does not agree to changes - a move Brussels has warned is ""illegal and unrealistic"".

A joint statement, issued after the meeting on Monday, described it as ""cordial and constructive"".

It said the data-sharing deal ""was a critical prerequisite to building trust and providing assurance, and provided a new basis for EU-UK discussions"".

The statement said that officials in London and Brussels would now ""work rapidly to scope the potential for solutions in different areas on the basis of this renewed understanding"".

Mr Sefcovic also called it a ""new basis"" for UK-EU discussions - a sentiment echoed by Ireland's foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin.

However, the prime minister's official spokesman stressed: ""There are still significant issues at the heart of the protocol that need addressing.""

An unofficial deadline for an agreement - and the possible resumption of the Stormont power-sharing government - is 10 April, the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland, and a potential visit from US President Joe Biden.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230109234702/http://news.sky.com/story/ni-protocol-new-basis-for-resolving-row-after-uk-and-eu-agree-data-sharing-deal-12783377;skynews;politics;883

3798;3798;Pollutionwatch: citizen science helps raise alarm on UK air pollution;2023-01-13T06:00:09Z;['Gary Fuller'];['Air pollution', 'Environment', 'Lancashire', 'Climate crisis', 'UK news'];;"More and more people are making their own air pollution measurements and using these to press for action from national and local governments. Last year Mark Tebbutt installed Chorley’s seventh air pollution monitor. Since 2013 Tebbutt, his family and friends have been buying and operating their own air pollution instruments. These are mounted on garden fences and on the sides of houses across the Lancashire town. You can find their data online alongside those from more than 30,000 citizen scientists around the world. Tebbutt’s network often measures particle pollution in the evenings, as people sit around their fires: “I began making measurements out of concern about wood smoke pollution from the proliferation of domestic solid fuel burning in Chorley. I wanted to prove to the council that the area has an air pollution problem. I also use the real-time levels to lobby various people and agencies on social media.” Air pollution concerns are not confined to towns and cities. Jo Clark, who lives in rural north Wales, also has her own monitor: “I have been able to show others, such as my local authority, how the particle pollution goes up and down over the days, months and years – and how it can vary from the very general ambient levels forecast and reported by Defra or the Welsh government.” The London mayor and Bloomberg Philanthropies are taking a different approach by distributing 60 free Breathe London sensors to community groups. Andrew Grieve, who works on the project at Imperial College London, says: “In our experience the groups see collecting local air quality data as an opener to discussing broader visions for their neighbourhood with their community and as a way to get a seat at the table with city authorities.” That is certainly how some of the groups are seeing it. Rectory Road residents’ association in north London, which has joined the Breathe London project, said: “As a large BAME community, we feel we have been ignored; our asks haven’t been met and we are struggling to have any serious commitment and action to tackle toxic air pollution.” Others including Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets athletics club are keen to use the data to help their community at times when air pollution is bad and to help them advocate for change. Governments have struggled to act on the concerns of citizen air-quality scientists and harness the opportunities they present. Citizen science has a long history in observations of the natural world. For example, ornithological research relies heavily on volunteer observers who share their data but air pollution measurements are usually the domain of university or government scientists that use standardised approaches and expensive instruments. Although less accurate, citizen measurements may help to raise awareness of air pollution problems and make the case for more action.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/13/pollutionwatch-citizen-science-alarm-uk-air-pollution;guardian;environment;3798
8611;8611;Endangered shark meat sold in Australian fish and chip shops, study finds;Saturday 28 January 2023 14:32, UK;[];['australia', 'sharks'];['meat', 'finds', 'australian', 'fillets', 'sold', 'flake', 'shops', 'university', 'endangered', 'chip', 'study', 'fish', 'species', 'shark'];"Meat from endangered sharks is being served up in Australian fish and chip shops, researchers have found.

The study, from the University of Adelaide, discovered meat from four threatened species was being sold as ""flake"" in some takeaways in South Australia.

Flake, an umbrella term for shark meat fillets in Australia, is popular because of its white colour, mild flavour and soft texture, but according to the Australian Fish Names Standard, only two types of shark - gummy shark and New Zealand rig - should be sold under the term.

The study analysed the DNA of fillets from more than 100 retailers across Adelaide and regional areas of South Australia, and found nine different types of species being sold under the term.

Among them were threatened species, including the shortfin mako shark and the smooth hammerhead, while some were sharks not found in Australian waters, the study found.

""Only 27 per cent of all samples were identified as gummy shark, a species that has a sustainable population, and is one of only two species that is recommended to be labelled as flake in Australia,"" said Ashleigh Sharrad, the lead author and a researcher from the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences.

""Our results highlight the need for clearer national guidelines or labelling laws for shark fillets.""

Of all the flake samples analysed, only one in 10 retailers could correctly identify the type of fish being sold.

About a fifth of the fillets were mislabelled and the remainder had ambiguous labelling.

Professor Bronwyn Gillanders, from the University of Adelaide, said: ""Food fraud in the seafood industry is a growing concern and mislabelling may occur. It can have potential implications on human health, the economy, and species conservation.""

575;575;‘Mental torture’: six years after Grenfell, UK residents still live in fear as cladding deal falters;2023-01-29T10:00:45Z;['Jon Ungoed-Thomas'];['Housing', 'Grenfell Tower fire', 'Grenfell Tower inquiry', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Michael Gove', 'Communities', 'Politics', 'London'];;"In June 2021, Charlotte Meehan received a safety inspection report for her block of flats as part of the nationwide checks after the Grenfell Tower fire. It made for grim reading, warning that the block had been built with combustible cladding and insulation. Last April, the government announced a “wide-ranging” agreement with developers to fix the crisis of unsafe tall buildings, but Meehan, 34, and her fellow residents in the four-storey block in east London, are among tens of thousands still waiting for their homes to be made safe. Since last spring’s announcement, the government has been wrangling with the house building industry over the terms of the deal and funding. Campaigners warned last week it may take until 2030 for many blocks to be made safe, with residents “stuck in limbo”. Meehan, an events producer who owns a third-floor flat she bought with her husband for £362,000 in October 2016, said an initial “wave of fear” over the fire risk of the building was quickly eclipsed by anxiety over the impact on her finances and resale value of the flat. The developer, Bellway, has given no starting date for the works at the Mojo development in Bow. She said: “There is this feeling of pure frustration and anger, and that you’ve been completely let down. There is this mental torture of feeling completely trapped. I just want to get my life back.”
A key government focus after the Grenfell fire in June 2017 that killed 72 people was to strip flammable aluminium composite cladding (ACM) from high rise blocks above 18 metres. By the end of December 2022, 463 out of 487 of these buildings (95%) had started or completed remediation work. There is also a £5.1bn building safety fund that covers the cost of removing unsafe non-ACM cladding on high-rise tower blocks. But Meehan’s flat is in what the government classifies as a “medium-height” block between 11 and 18 metres. In many of these blocks, work has not yet started to remove unsafe cladding or insulation. There are about 75,000 residential buildings in England between 11 and 18 metres tall, according to government figures, with 2.93 million people living in them. It has been estimated that the cost of fixing safety issues will be £4bn, but there are no reliable figures on the number of properties affected. Michael Gove, the housing secretary, announced last year that some of the country’s biggest housebuilders had pledged to fix all buildings above 11 metres that they had developed in the past 30 years. A draft contract was published in July, with the aim of finalising it within four weeks. The government and the housing industry have since been at loggerheads over the potential scale of the liability for companies that sign the contract, but the latest version is expected to be published as early as this week. Even then, there is no legal requirement for developers to sign the agreement. In November, a pilot fund was launched to provide finance for medium-height blocks where developers cannot be traced. A wider scheme is due to be rolled out this year, funded by a proposed new building safety levy.
Giles Grover, a campaigner with End Our Cladding Scandal, said it may take until 2030 or longer to complete the works in these medium-height blocks, and that there were also delays and funding disputes over high-rise developments. He added: “The vast majority of us are still stuck in unsafe building with serious cladding and non-cladding defects.” Darren Matthews, 57, who lives in a 14-metre high apartment block in Salford, suffered a stroke in December after months of worry about a £3m bill for his block for works to remove insulation and improve fire resistance. He was told he would need to pay £97,000. Matthews, who bought his flat at Transport House for £63,000 under a shared ownership scheme in October 2005, said he believed the stress had contributed to his stroke, from which he is now recovering. “I just felt crushed,” he said. “I couldn’t sleep properly and it was always on my mind. We’ve been stuck in limbo.” Irwell Valley Housing Association, which manages Transport House, said last week it had reviewed the previous proposed works based on the Building Safety Act 2022. It said it now considered the key remediation works required were a new sprinkler system and the leaseholders would not be charged. A meeting would be held with residents once a starting date for the works was confirmed, said the association. The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said it was concerned the government was proposing a new tax on the industry, the building safety levy, when the scale of works required in medium-height blocks was still unknown.
David O’Leary, an executive director at HBF, said: “Six years on from Grenfell, the government has still not produced an accurate assessment of the number of buildings in need of work or the cost of remediating them, and yet continues to progress plans with yet another tax on UK housebuilders.” Industry sources admit it will take years to fix the issues in the country’s apartment blocks. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Leaseholders and residents in buildings between 11 metres and 18 metres will get their properties made safe while being protected from extortionate cladding repair bills. Developers who have signed the pledge have committed to remediate the buildings themselves. Where the developer cannot be traced or held responsible, cladding repairs will be funded by the building safety levy.” Bellway, which paid for more than half of the “waking watch” fire patrol costs at the Mojo development, said a warranty claim had been submitted for the development, built in 2010, and that it was working with all parties to progress the claim. A spokesperson said: “Bellway remains committed to the principle made within the government’s building safety pledge and is continuing to work with government to resolve outstanding matters to enable remediation work to happen as soon as possible on affected buildings.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/29/mental-torture-six-years-grenfell-uk-residents-cladding-deal;guardian;business & economy;575
4894;4894;‘Interest is off the scale’: Cornish cinema fans snub Avatar for local folk horror;2023-01-06T15:00:03Z;['Steven Morris'];['Film', 'Cornwall', 'UK news', 'Culture'];;"Cinema fans in the Cornish town of Bodmin had three options: the behemoths of Avatar and I Wanna Dance With Somebody – or a mind-bending folk horror shot down the road on 16mm film with a tiny budget that would make most Hollywood directors shudder. By a considerable margin, for this one night at least, the patrons of the Capitol shunned James Cameron and Whitney Houston in favour of the latter, Enys Men, an unsettling, time-slipping movie that tackles big themes – loneliness, grief, fear – belying the modesty of its production. The film by Mark Jenkin, the follow-up to his cult arthouse black-and-white movie about fishing and second homes, Bait, has been playing to packed houses during an opening tour of the south-west of England before its UK launch. “It’s brilliant to see,” said Alex Jones, the operations manager of Merlin Cinemas, which runs the Capitol and other small cinemas mainly in English coastal and market towns. “Interest is off the Richter scale. This is going to be a huge hit not just in Cornwall but across the country. We’re definitely going to have to find more space for it in our cinemas.” Enys Men’s first night on Monday at the Newlyn Filmhouse, which is housed in a 19th-century fish cellar and smokery, sold out within hours. In subsequent days, screenings were packed in Penzance and Truro, and disappointed people were being turned away from the Bodmin show on Thursday night. The Regal in Redruth has put on an extra screening this month to meet demand. The tour, promoted with a Cornish-language poster and featuring a question-and-answer session with Jenkin, now heads out of Cornwall with Saturday’s screening at the Watershed in Bristol also sold out. During the Q&A at the Capitol, Jenkin said he was delighted that so many people had braved a rainy, windy January night to watch his film. He described how it had been shot in 21 days on the far western tip of Cornwall during a Covid lockdown with a tiny cast and crew. Jenkin said the film was not a horror in the traditional sense but, for him, focused on “the horror of time not making sense”, which felt particularly pertinent during the Covid lockdowns. In the film, Jenkin’s partner, Mary Woodvine, plays a wildlife volunteer whose daily observations of a flower on a Cornish clifftop take a dark turn into the strange and metaphysical. She drops stones down a scary old mineshaft; an eerie standing stone stands sentinel over the action. Jenkin said his inspiration had been the Pipers standing stones in west Cornwall, where he grew up. “I was really haunted by the Pipers. I’d look through the gateway and I’d think they’d moved slightly. I like the idea of a sentient stone.” The Covid restrictions reined in some ambitions, including a plan to fill a Cornish miners’ chapel with hundreds of extras for a key moment. Instead they had to film in a tiny chapel with just two characters, Woodvine and her father, John Woodvine, who plays a preacher. “It made it a much more intimate scene,” said Jenkin. An important element in Jenkin’s film-making is its low environmental impact. The average big budget film is said to generate about 3,000 tonnes of CO2. Enys Men created 4.55 tonnes, which it offset. Jenkin said working with a tight crew and cast “in our own backyard” meant the production had left a very small footprint. He said the idea was to “borrow space” to film rather than taking it over. Of course, the film cannot compete with the likes of Avatar over time but Kingsley Marshall, the head of film and television at Falmouth University, said it would find an audience. He argued that Enys Men felt like a truer representation of Cornwall than the picture-postcard version usually presented in big budget films. Speaking at the Capitol as Avatar rumbled away, Marshall said: “We often see Cornwall misrepresented in film. There’s a connection to real working environments in this, to Cornwall’s post-industrial landscape. And there’s a lot going on that resonates with us all – we’ve all felt isolated or grief or confused by our memories or haunted by our past. People connect with that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/06/interest-is-off-the-scale-cornish-cinema-fans-snub-avatar-local-folk-horror-enys-men;guardian;entertainment & culture;4894
5731;5731;As an ex-BBC presenter, I want to hear a vision that goes beyond cut, cut, cut | Roger Bolton;2023-01-02T07:00:09Z;['Roger Bolton'];['BBC', 'Media', 'Radio industry', 'Television industry'];;"Do we still think public service broadcasting matters? For those of us who do, these are worrying times. “The public service broadcasting system is undoubtedly facing an existential threat,” warns the former chair of ITV and much else, Peter Bazalgette. ITV, he reveals, has not yet decided to reapply for a new public service broadcasting (PSB) licence because it does not know what the terms will be. He and many others await the new broadcasting bill, which, they hope, will ensure that when their services are placed on a digital platform they do not own – such as Amazon, Apple, Samsung, LG, Sky and Virgin – they will be given “prominence” and not charged ridiculous amounts. If not, says Bazalgette, ITV has plenty of non-public service broadcasting options. Elsewhere in PSB-land there is heartening news, for it now seems unlikely that the broadcasting bill will propose privatising Channel 4. But what next? Who knows. Could someone please offer an inspiring vision of what its contribution to public service broadcasting should be in the next 40 years? I understand why independent producers opposed privatisation with such vehemence – it threatened their businesses – but what about inspiring content? Does anyone have a vision of the future to compare with that which Jeremy Isaacs, its founding chief executive, displayed all those years ago? And then there is the BBC, the public service mothership just turned 100 years old. But what is its vision for the next decade, let alone the next century? Two noble baronesses hit the nail on the head very forcibly in a recent House of Lords debate. “It remains unclear what the BBC wants to be, beyond being a significant player in this global media world,” said the Conservative peer Lady Stowell, chair of the communications committee, who once worked for the BBC. She wanted to know “what it will do more of… continue to do … stop doing”. Lady (Dido) Harding, also a Conservative peer, fired a warning shot across the bows of Broadcasting House, saying, “No investment proposal should be approved without a compelling long-term vision and plan.” The implication was clear, she hadn’t seen one. But then, neither have the rest of us. It’s a creative vision thing: is there such a thing at and for the BBC ? There is certainly a business vision, as there should be. The BBC board is now top heavy with bankers and business people. The chairman, Richard Sharp, tutored Rishi Sunak at Goldman Sachs. The corporation’s future as a big, international business is pretty secure. A commercial version of it could survive without the licence fee, but is that what we want?
Contrary to what the Daily Mail constantly argues, the BBC is now a very efficient business, not least because of the herculean efforts of its director general, Tim Davie, who, while cleverly blunting government allegations of bias, has been faced with a 30% cut in real spending power. With inflation rampant, further cuts are in the offing, which will follow already announced cuts in essential elements of its public service offering, including news, local radio and the World Service. But no one voted for that. All this is happening without the people who pay for the corporation, the licence-fee payers, being consulted. The oft-used slogan “It’s your BBC” is in danger of ringing hollow. The BBC has never been very good on consultation or accountability, as I know from my many years presenting Radio 4’s Feedback, where all too often there was little feedback. When it came to inviting executives on to the programme, the press office would often intervene, saying, “We don’t think this is the right time to say something on this subject.” I would reply that the right time was whenever the listener wanted an answer. (There were some wonderful exceptions, such as the departing controller of Radio 3, Alan Davey, who would always come on and answer anything. He got it. Well, he had been – inside and outside the BBC – a very public servant.) When it came to inviting presenters and producers on to Feedback, requests also had to go through the press office, and if an interview took place a press officer would usually be present, at their insistence. The good producers, and there are a lot of them, would roll their eyes at being chaperoned. And I got the impression that some press officers were a bit embarrassed by their role as “minders”. Davie has said he is determined to improve accountability, and I am sure he is sincere, but he then presses on with his business plan – and those cuts – as though he were running a commercial business, not this much-loved, publicly owned, publicly financed institution.
Of course, someone has to take decisions, we can’t all vote on what has to go, but surely we would have a right to expect the ability to discuss priorities? For example, Radio 4 Extra may go online only, thus depriving some older listeners of a service they greatly value, while leaving them with many other, much more expensive, services they could well do without. They had no say. The BBC director of speech radio, Mohit Bakaya, says, rather mystifyingly, that the online move of 4 Extra is “not a done deal”. Maybe protests could tip the balance. BBC Four, which originally commissioned the wonderful series Detectorists, is also to go online and become an archive channel only. Again, no consultation. BBC local radio is being decimated, despite its role in serving so many communities. Truly, to use Bazalgette’s phrase, an existential threat, and with a new year we need new thinking: pause the BBC cuts now, postpone the debate on the privatisation of Channel 4 and ensure ITV remains a public service broadcaster, while conducting a proper cross-party inquiry into the future of the public service media and how to pay for it. We have, by accident and design, created a landscape and a tradition of public service broadcasting in this country that is very special. We must be vigilant of it. It would be careless, not to say criminal, to let it slip away. Roger Bolton is a former BBC executive and journalist.

It's a huge crime scene and they said they needed the team to start their work.

In reality, there's not much for them to see outside, but the criminal inquiry is in many ways a symbol of how importantly the authorities now realise a thorough investigation is needed.

Brazil is now contemplating the reality that democracy can be very fragile.

Like the protesters who overran the Capitol building in Washington DC two years ago in the name of Donald Trump, the supporters of the defeated right-wing former leader Jair Bolsonaro believe he is the rightful president.

Who carried out the attack, who organised it, and what the police did or didn't do are all being looked into.

Witnesses to the storming of the buildings say Bolsonaro's supporters came equipped and determined to get inside right from the very start.

""I saw masked people, people holding sticks and some with backpacks looking suspicious,"" Matheus Alves, a Brazilian photographer who has covered many of these protests in the capital, told me.

""Even on their social networks and their WhatsApp groups they were leaking information and talking about invading the Congress and the Supreme Court, so it felt like there was coordination in planning these attacks.""

Pointing to the road in front of the presidential palace, Mr Alves explained how the police retreated from the main ramp leading into the palace to a set of traffic lights nearby.

""And that's when the crowd felt comfortable to invade the palace,"" he added.

Critics say the response was disjointed and completely lacking, and President Lula da Silva says his government will investigate the behaviour of the police on the day.

Hundreds of people arrested at the scene and in front of army bases, are being housed in the gymnasium of the country's police training academy in Brasilia.

Many have been posting videos on social media, showing row after row of people being held, basically camping out in the gym.

Outside the building, lawyers, politicians, journalists, and some families wait for any news.

It's understood that as each case is heard the accused are then taken away to proper prisons where they will await trial.

Bianca Tereza Pires is waiting to hear what will happen to her cousin Arioldo Rodrigues Junior. The 50-year-old was arrested with others as part of the investigation into the incident on Sunday.

""I think they are very scared, because they're saying that they might go to prison at some point,"" she told me.

Despite her concerns, Pires says she supports her cousin's actions.

The man was found dead near Balmore Golf Club, in East Dunbartonshire, on 16 October 2011.

It is thought he could have been dead for up to six months before he was discovered.

But now, investigators at the Scottish Cold Case Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University have released a new facial reconstruction and 3D images of the man's clothing in a fresh bid to solve the 11-year puzzle.

There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death, who detectives have estimated as between 25 and 34 years old.

However, forensic analysis has revealed he suffered injuries before his death which may have affected his appearance, quality of life and gait.

Dr Maureen Taylor, co-director of the cold case unit, said: ""We know he had a chip to one of his front teeth and injuries to his nose and jaw that he sustained in the months leading to his death.

""These injuries were not only left untreated, but would have caused him significant pain.

""We also believe that he may have walked with a limp or had difficulty walking.""

Investigators said the white European man was between 5ft 8in and 6ft 1in tall and of slight build, with light-coloured hair.

He was discovered wearing a blue Topman T-shirt with a maroon diagonal stripe on the front, a blue zipped cardigan bearing the logo Greek Pennsylvania, light-coloured jeans and black waterproof walking shoes, commonly bought in Lidl.

In a nearby Nike messenger-type bag, investigators found items including toiletries, clothes, headphones, chargers, a lighter and cigarette papers.

The images were produced by the University of Dundee and are being shown online alongside photos of the man's belongings and drone footage of the woodland, close to Golf Course Road, where his body was found.

6467;6467;When have industries previously gone on strike and what has it achieved?;Thursday 5 January 2023 16:28, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['strikes'];['miners', 'workers', 'industrial', 'previously', 'went', 'union', 'gone', 'achieved', 'industries', 'strike', 'action', 'public', 'pay', 'strikes'];"The UK is facing the biggest outbreak of industrial action in a generation as thousands of workers across the NHS, transport, civil service and other sectors strike for better pay and conditions in the face of soaring inflation.

Union-led strike action has declined in recent decades - but this is not the first time mass walkouts have brought the country to a standstill.

From the onset of the industrial revolution, workers have been withholding their labour to bargain for more money and job security, achieving landmark gains such as eight-hour working days and equal pay for women.

But not all strikes are successful, with many resulting in a crackdown on union activity and no concessions for workers.

Often, the outcome has depended on the strength of the government at the time and public support behind the movement.

Here, Sky News looks at some of the biggest strikes in the last 100 years or so, and how they ended.

General strike of 1926

The current wave of discontent has been likened to a de-facto ""general strike"" as union leaders talk up the possibility of co-ordinated action in 2023.

The last - and only time - the UK faced a general strike was in 1926.

For nine days, more than 1.5 million workers went on strike to support coal miners, whose bosses wanted to reduce pay and conditions.

The strike ended when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called off the action without any concessions for the miners, after a court ruling that the action was illegal.

The miners were forced to accept the new terms and returned to work, while new laws were introduced to make general strikes and ""sympathetic strikes"" illegal.

Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968

In 1968, women sewing machinists at the Ford Motor Company plant in Dagenham, Essex, went on strike after their jobs were downgraded to unskilled, meaning they were being paid 85% of the rate paid to men.

Barbara Castle, Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity, intervened on behalf of the women and they returned to work three weeks later after their pay was raised to 92% of that of men.

Image: The Ford sewing machinists strike was the catalyst for the Equal Pay Act of 1970

The dispute was a trigger for the Equal Pay Act 1970, which made it illegal to pay women less for doing the same job as men - though not for doing work of equal value.

It was only in 1984, following a nine-week long strike and widespread solidarity action from their male co-workers, that the Ford Dagenham women won their original demand for the same pay.

Miners' strikes of the 1970s

During the 1970s, miners went on strike again for the first time since the failure of the general strike - this time with more success.

After talks over pay between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and PM Edward Heath's Conservative government broke down, the NUM called for industrial action at the start of 1972.

The action shut down coalmines, leading to power cuts and forcing the government to declare a state of emergency and three-day week to conserve electricity.

Despite the disruption, there was a great deal of public sympathy for the strikes, which came at a time of high inflation and unemployment.

Miners achieved an annual pay rise of 27% - well over the government's wage restraint policy target of 7% to 8%.

Image: The wife of a miner joins strike action for better pay in 1972

Inflation soon wiped out the gains and miners went on strike again in 1974. It led to another three-day week and marked the downfall of Mr Heath, who called a snap election in response to continued failed negotiations with the NUM.

This resulted in a hung parliament and a minority Labour government, led by Harold Wilson, who immediately increased the miners' wages by 35%.

Striking similarities to 'winter of discontent' in 1970s

Winter of discontent

In 1978-1979, widespread strikes across multiple trade unions brought Britain to a standstill in what became known as the 'winter of discontent'.

Unions demanded larger pay rises in response to attempts by James Callaghan, the Labour prime minister, to cap pay rises at 5% to bring down inflation.

The strikes resulted in empty shelves in supermarkets, a fuel shortage during the coldest winter in 16 years, rubbish on the streets and bodies not being buried.

Many of the strikes led to substantial pay rises - but the unrest fuelled a public backlash against trade unions and spelled disaster for Mr Callaghan's government and the wider Labour movement.

In May 1979, the Conservatives returned to power with a landslide victory under Margaret Thatcher, who introduced major restrictions on trade union power.

Miners' strike of 1984-85

Miners went on strike again in 1984 - but this one played out differently to the success of the 1970s.

The year-long dispute was dominated by violent clashes and ended in defeat for the miners, changing the face of Britain's industrial landscape forever.

It was over plans to close 20 pits deemed uneconomic - leading to the loss of around 20,000 jobs.

Image: Police grapple with a picketer at the Orgreave Coking Plant during the miners' strike of 1984

Controversially, the strike was called by the NUM without a ballot, causing divisions among miners and costing it vital support from the Labour party and TUC leadership.

At its peak, 142,000 workers went on strike and violence broke out at picket lines - the most notorious clash coming at the Orgreave Coking Plant near Rotherham in June 1984.

But unlike the strikes of the 1970s, Mrs Thatcher's government was prepared for the long fight and had gathered significant stockpiles of coal, meaning the disruption was minimal.

The strike began to crumble as more and more miners, running out of money and suffering huge financial hardship, returned to work.

In March 1985, the strike ended without a deal and the pits were closed.

Public sector strikes 2011

The most recent large-scale industrial action happened in 2011, during the coalition government between David Cameron's Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.

Around two million public sector workers went on strike on 30 November in response to pension reforms, with the unrest resulting in 60% of schools closing and thousands of cancelled hospital operations.

Unions objected to government plans to make their members pay more and work longer to earn their pensions, but ministers said the cost of public service pensions had risen by a third in a decade, so the changes were needed.

Image: Striking local government workers stand on a picket line outside Lambeth Town Hall in south London on 30 November 2011

Image: Pickets stand outside St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 30 November 2011

Polls suggested the majority of the public disapproved of the action, even though they opposed the changes Mr Cameron was proposing.

The strikes ended in a propaganda war over turnout and did not lead to any significant changes to the government's plans.

After their victory at the 2015 election, the Conservatives clamped down on unions with new laws imposing a series of conditions before they could go on strike.

Criminal barristers' strike

While a wave of industrial action is expected to continue this year, some sectors have voted to end their strikes after accepting pay offers.

In October, criminal defence barristers in England and Wales returned to courtrooms after the government offered a 15% fee rise - an extra £7,000 per year.

1086;1086;Donald Trump’s Truth Social posts bode ill for his return to Facebook;2023-01-26T14:52:50Z;['Dan Milmo'];['Donald Trump', 'Meta', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'US news', 'Media', 'World news', 'Technology', 'Social networking'];;If Donald Trump’s activity on his Truth Social account is a reliable indicator of what his return to Facebook and Instagram will unleash, then Nick Clegg is going to be busy. The former US president has used his rightwing social media platform to push baseless claims of election fraud and amplified content related to the QAnon conspiracy multiverse. These were two issues that received a special mention from Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister turned president of global affairs at Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent, as he explained the decision to end Trump’s two-year exile on Wednesday. Clegg, who presided over the Trump reinstatement process, said content that “deligitimises” an upcoming election or is related to QAnon could be blocked from appearing in other people’s feeds or have the reshare button removed. He said such content did not violate Meta’s community standards – or content guidelines – but could increase the risk of a repeat of the Capitol riot that got Trump banned in the first place. According to US campaign group Media Matters, nearly half of the posts on Trump’s Truth Social account in the weeks after the US midterm elections pushed election fraud claims or amplified QAnon accounts or content. If Trump continues in that vein on Facebook and Instagram, then he will immediately hit the “guardrails” that Clegg outlined in his post. Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently described his job as a series of body blows: “It’s almost like everyday you wake up and you’re punched in the stomach.” The reappearance of Trump will almost certainly result in further pressure on his solar plexus, judging by reaction overnight. Campaign groups warned it would be inflammatory, with the Anti-Defamation League saying Meta had chosen to “platform bigotry and divisiveness” and that the decision “isn’t a matter of free speech”. If Zuckerberg and Clegg had kept the ban in place, anger from the right of the political spectrum would have been equally loud, of course. But Clegg was clear that free speech was at the forefront of the decision, saying the public “should be able to hear what their politicians are saying” including a candidate for office such as Trump. This reflects Zuckerberg’s belief that Meta is a champion of “free expression”. Clegg reiterated that in his blogpost on Wednesday, using the opening sentence to state: “Social media is rooted in the belief that open debate and the free flow of ideas are important values.” The measures outlined by Clegg to limit the threat from content that veers towards “the risk of real-world harm” are largely already in place. These include a repeat offender policy that applies to public figures who have been banned but then allowed to return: if Trump posts further violating content it will be removed and he could be suspended for between one month and two years. The guidelines on restricting election falsehood and QAnon content are an update on the repeat offender policy. That balance between free speech and real-world harm, and the strength of that repeat offender policy, will be tested when Trump comes back. Although Trump has yet to tweet following his reinstatement to Twitter, he has made clear that he wants to get back on Facebook. In a letter to Meta this month his advisers said the ban “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse” and should be rescinded. That argument about distorting and inhibiting the public realm, where everyone has a right to feel safe, would be of interest to Ruby Freeman. The former Georgia election worker was subjected to a “deluge of intimidation, harassment, and threats” and was forced to leave her home after Freeman and her daughter were falsely accused of involvement in falsifying ballots in the 2020 presidential election. In a Truth Social post this month, Trump wrote: “What will the Great State of Georgia do with the Ruby Freeman MESS? Why not just tell the TRUTH, get rid of the turmoil and guilt, and take our Country back from the evils and treachery of the Radical Left monsters who want to see America die?” Meta’s community standards on bullying and harassment prohibit “calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or harassment”. If Trump repeats his Truth Social posts on Facebook and Instagram, another ban – or at least pressure to impose one – looms.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/donald-trump-truth-social-posts-bode-ill-return-facebook;guardian;politics;1086

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice across the centre of the UK covering all four nations, hundreds of flood warnings are in place, and temperatures are due to drop below zero in most places overnight.

Snow showers are predicted to hit northern areas, with hill snow developing in central areas and rain sweeping the south.

Temperatures are expected to plunge overnight to -2C in London, -1C in Cardiff, and -3C in both Edinburgh and Belfast, while Highland areas of Scotland could see -10C.

The Met Office issued a lengthy warning for snow and ice for northern Scotland from Sunday to Wednesday.

""A few centimetres of snow are likely at low levels over a given 24-hour period, with the potential for 10-15cm above 200 metres, especially across parts of the Highlands,"" it said.

""Ice will be an additional hazard, especially Tuesday night.""

Residents have been urged to be careful of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths, and longer journey times by road, bus and train services are likely.

The Met Office said in a statement: ""By Sunday most of the UK will be in the northerly airflow, with lower temperatures spreading further south overnight.

""Showers will fall increasingly as sleet and snow in the north, even to lower levels. Some showers further South and West, and perhaps a more persistent spell of rain overnight into Monday, could also turn to sleet and snow mainly over high ground such as the Brecon Beacons, Exmoor and Dartmoor.

""Overnight frost will become more widespread by Monday night, with overnight temperatures below 0°C across much of the UK. Temperatures could get down to -10°C in sheltered glens, or across high ground areas of Scotland where there is lying snow.""

The cold snap comes after widespread flooding left big parts of the country submerged in the past week.

Ian Withers, an Environment Agency worker for 30 years, said a ""huge operation"" is under way to control overflowing rivers in Somerset - an area particularly prone to flooding because it is below sea level.

Mr Withers said that water levels in several rivers are currently ""higher than the land around them"" and surrounding moors are being used as ""reservoirs"" to contain the overspill.

The duty manager for the Wessex area said: ""The situation at the moment is, catchments are just extremely wet and saturated.

""I think we've seen the worst of this wet weather pass through and we've got a few more settled days ahead which is really helpful.

""But as a consequence of all the rain we've had over the last week or so, the big rivers - the Severn, the Avon, the Wye - they're so full with water, and that water has now got to work its way out of the estuaries into the sea.

""While they're still high those pockets of flood risk will remain.""

Image: Apperley, Gloucestershire, where the River Severn burst its banks

The Environment Agency had 90 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, and 152 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, in place as of the early hours of Monday morning.

Earlier, flood defences, including boarding, were deployed in York.

City of York Council said it had taken the measure to keep the area ""safe and open"" as it urged visitors to plan their journeys in advance.

Likewise in whether it has broken the bad juju of game screen adaptations. All that matters to me is whether it works as gripping television drama. Like the marauding, zombie-esque creatures that inhabit it, does it truly grab you and bite you? Created by Craig Mazin (responsible for the matchless Chernobyl) and The Last of Us game developer Neil Druckmann, there are nine episodes of varying lengths, mainly set in a dystopian 2023, where the world has been devastated by a pandemic caused by a fungus – cordyceps – passed from ants to humans. The “infected” are transformed into crazed killer morels (scarier than it sounds). Civilisation has broken down: Earth resembles a vast junkyard; the autocratic military battle a rebel group known as the Fireflies. In the midst of the chaos, Joel, played by Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian), must travel across perilous territory chaperoning teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey from Game of Thrones), who could hold the secret to human survival. Don’t be put off by the mushroom monsters – this is a fully realised human parable, with TLOU evolving into a brutal, passionate, post-apocalyptic western par excellence. Along with echoes of Covid, there’s an underlying eco message (cordyceps is rendered dangerous by rising temperatures). An astonishing cast includes Anna Torv (brilliant as the lead in The Newsreader last year) and Melanie Lynskey. Crucial is the relationship between fiery, backchatting Ellie and Joel, a kind of knackered Burt Reynolds whose devastating backstory unfolds in the opener. Ellie and Joel aren’t just a cheap, off-the-peg proxy father-daughter deal, they’re warm, fractious, authentic: Saul and Carrie from Homeland sieved through The Walking Dead.
I’ve noticed some casting criticism, particularly regarding Ramsey not resembling the game’s Ellie enough (stay classy, gamers, it’s not supposed to be a lookalike competition). As it is, she does a brilliant job of making Ellie live and breathe. And while The Last of Us can sometimes be slow and repetitive (once you’ve seen one fungus bloodbath…), it’s worth it in the long haul. Whatever you do, don’t bail out before the third episode, featuring Murray Bartlett and Nick Offerman. I can’t say too much – it’ll turn into spoiler Armageddon – but it’s an unexpected emotional fireball of love, hope and sacrifice; a capsule masterpiece within a masterpiece. Are hospital dramas going out of vogue? Sure, we had last year’s This Is Going to Hurt, but it’s not like the old days when you couldn’t move for TV medics looking attractively anguished in white coats and stethoscopes.
The new ITV drama Maternal, from stage writer-director Jacqui Honess-Martin, has three main female characters – friends and mothers in the same NHS hospital, grappling with work and family. Maryam (Parminder Nagra) is an emotionally fragile paediatric registrar who suffers tragedy on her first day back at work. Lisa McGrillis (Somewhere Boy) is a registrar in acute medicine, with a boorish, unfaithful consultant husband. Catherine (Lara Pulver) is an ambitious surgeon who got pregnant after a fling and itches to get back on the fast track. The opener puts these characters through a lot – overwork, sexism, childcare issues, messy home lives – arguably too much (it sometimes feels like “oh woe is modern woman” boxes are being ticked). However, snooping a couple of episodes ahead (all six are on ITVX), Maternal hits its stride. There’s a solid sense of the beleaguered, under-financed NHS. The script is sharp (“I wasn’t interested in your father’s god complex and I’m not interested in yours either”). The female friendships are resolutely unsentimental rather than heart-emoji-ing each other into a state of brain death. Tune in if you’re interested in a smart quasi-soap with a dark undertow – a medical version of The Split. It’s easy to see why BBC gameshow The Traitors proved such a huge phenomenon. It was classic reality family viewing with addictive trimmings: a Scottish castle; betrayal (could the traitors dupe the “faithfuls” out of the prize money?); “banishments” and “murders” leading to tense breakfasts where no one so much as licked a croissant.
Moreover, while I recall the odd comic or TikTok magician (“I can read people”), it was mainly normal folk. A shame, then, that the The Traitors US, snapped up by the Beeb and now all on iPlayer, is heavily sprinkled with participants from other reality shows such as The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and The Bachelor. Otherwise, everything – the castle, the format – is exactly the same, including a massive prize pot ($250,000) and those (rather boring) tasks. It’s still good fun – I gleefully wolfed down the 10 episodes (all on iPlayer) – and Alan Cumming makes for a mischievous host, throwing on all shades of tartan and trilling: “I’m like a less butch Agatha Christie in a fabulous outfit.” Still, I hope the next series of the UK version doesn’t cast reality television regulars engineering fake drama to attract Instagram followers. That would ruin the show’s essential magic: not only was the first series exciting, it was also curiously innocent.
New 10-part tennis series Break Point comes from the makers of Formula 1: Drive to Survive, the magnificent docuseries (also Netflix) dealing with the life-and-death drama of F1. It not only featured drivers such as Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen (the latter rumoured to be returning for the next series), but F1 managers, including “team principals” Christian Horner (Red Bull) and Toto Wolff (Mercedes-AMG Petronas) – eternally feuding like the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford of the international pitstop circuit. I’m such a DTS-fan, I couldn’t wait for the first half-series drop of Break Point, but it’s a struggle. The premise (that less well-known players are coming through after the dominance of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams) is fine, and it’s great that it looks at women such as Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur, pundits including Chris Evert and Andy Roddick, and mental health issues. However, tennis (so grimly insular) feels like an uneasy fit. The opener features “bad boy” racket-smasher Nick Kyrgios, but even he’s a bit underpowered here. It’s telling that the most riveting sequence in five episodes features Nadal’s pre-match warm-up, involving some brazenly alpha (read: intimidating) bouncing about. I haven’t lost hope (yet) but I’m not sure Break Point is serving aces.

3161;3161;Iga Swiatek says Australian Open progression not to be taken for granted;2023-01-16T14:13:05Z;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Australian Open 2023', 'Australian Open', 'Tennis', 'Sport', 'Australia sport'];;"As night fell on Rod Laver Arena during the opening day of competition at the Australian Open, not everything was going Iga Swiatek’s way. Four months after Jule Niemeier had forced her to be down a set and a break at the US Open, the young German was once again causing problems with her varied, unorthodox style. Swiatek struggled to find a rhythm, her errors piled up and Niemeier established a 5-3 second-set lead. Yet under pressure, when she truly needed it, Swiatek pounced. First she navigated a tough hold, then she produced a flawless return game to cast aside the break. Swiatek rolled through the final four games of the match, recovering to defeat Niemeier 6-3, 7-5 and move into the second round. Even when far from at her best, the Pole closed off her first win with a statement. “I knew that I could get my focus up a little bit, the intensity a little bit more. So I did that,” she said, shrugging.
Swiatek’s return to Australia is particularly notable. Last year, the Australian Open proved a defining moment in her progression. She had started the season feeling out her partnership with her new coach Tomasz Wiktorowski and she had not fully bought into her potential on hard courts – she still felt so much more comfortable on clay. Ranked only ninth, she reached the semi-finals and it set the tone for the rest of the year. “At the beginning of last year I didn’t have that much confidence that I can also win big titles on hard court because all of them basically happened last season,” she said. “Also before I think the media kind of described me as a clay court player. Maybe that got into me a little bit. But, yeah, for sure working with Tomas, I don’t know, I just felt like I can be more aggressive on hard court, I don’t have to be the baseline player.” After a season that included two grand slam titles, eight titles overall, a 37-match winning streak and nine months at No 1, she returns to Australia as the heavy favourite to win the title. One of the defining questions of the new season is how she will follow up what was one of the greatest seasons of the 21st century, a challenge Swiatek believes that many underestimate. “For sure I feel the expectations, that people kind of want to take for granted that I’m going to win those first rounds,” she said. “It’s not always easy. Every match is a different story. You have to really work hard to win. I just feel like they’re taking it for granted a little bit. There’s no reason to do that honestly because I know I had a streak last year, and I was consistent. As I said, every match is a different story, every season is different.” In the second round, Swiatek will face Camila Osorio and a potential marquee third-round meeting with former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu could follow if they both win. Earlier in the day, Andreescu produced a statement win by comfortably defeating Marie Bouzkova, the 25th seed, 6-2, 6-4. Third seed Jessica Pegula also progressed, beating Jaqueline Cristian 6-0, 6-1.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/16/iga-swiatek-australian-open-progression-tennis;guardian;sports;3161
3257;3257;A Childhood: The Biography of a Place review – a classic of the deep south;2023-01-16T07:00:36Z;['Rob Doyle'];['Biography books', 'Autobiography and memoir', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Georgia'];;"If a cult writer’s aura endures long enough, their work might be elevated to Penguin Classics status. At leas, that’s what’s happened to Harry Crews, the author of many southern gothic novels populated by freaks and grotesques, including his most well-known novel, A Feast of Snakes. Born in Georgia in 1935, Crews died in 2012 and claimed to have sold only a few thousand books in hardback during his lifetime (a series of celebrity admirers including Sean Penn and Madonna failed to translate into mainstream popularity). Having published eight novels in as many years, beginning with The Gospel Singer in 1968, in his 40s Crews turned to nonfiction to recount his first six years alive and testify to “a way of life gone forever out of the world”. His memoir A Childhood: The Biography of a Place was first published in 1978 and is now reissued (along with The Gospel Singer) with a loving foreword by Tobias Wolff. In the US, there has been a corresponding surge of enthusiasm for Crews and his work, with the New Yorker recently describing A Childhood as “one of the finest memoirs ever written by an American”. Childhood memoirs (and novels) face a formal difficulty relating to the essence of childhood itself: if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Whereas adult life, differentiated by profession, sexual career and cumulative experience is infinitely diverse, all childhoods are basically alike – which is why the subtitle to Crews’s book is crucial. Bacon County, Georgia, in the 1920s and 30s is depicted as a violent, pre-modern backwater of poverty and squalor inhabited by the variably disfigured: scars, missing fingers, chewed-up ears and mangled extremities are more common than wholeness. Harry and his friends pore over the Sears, Roebuck catalogue in wonderment at how “all the people in its pages were perfect”, though he “had known for a long time that it was all a lie” and there surely couldn’t be a way to live in this world without mutilations. The first and more moving of the book’s two parts recount events that took place before Crews’s birth, portraying the biological father who died when Crews was two years old. We first encounter his father as a very young man, stricken with gloom after contracting “the clap” during a sordid sexual encounter with a Native American girl (he subsequently loses a testicle). This man “who I never knew but whose presence has never left” haunts both Harry and A Childhood as a shaping absence, a figure who, because he can never be known in reality, assumes mythic proportions in the boy’s imagination. Harry and his older brother are raised by his inventively foul-mouthed mother (“You the two sorriest boys that ever shit out of the gills of an asshole”) and his father’s brother, who takes to whiskey and eventually discharges a shotgun in the family home, provoking mother and sons to flee to Jacksonville. Amid the hard rural living we see glints of the writer young Crews will one day become. The aforementioned Sears, Roebuck catalogue is a fount of invented stories, Harry and friends imagining the conflicts, lusts and alliances that form between the models, who Harry imagines all know one another: “There had to be hard feelings, trouble between them on and off, violence, and hate between them as well as love.” Crews emphasises that he grew up in an oral culture of storytelling and that making up stories “was not only a way for us to understand the way we lived but also a defence against it”. Southern vernacular is rendered faithfully in dialogue – “When I hern tell about that gul taken and died after her snake was kilt, I known the same thing gone happen to me I keep goin out there” – and so is the era and region’s perfectly casual racism.
Typical of memoirs and especially childhood ones, Crews’s book lacks any strong narrative pull beyond the simple passing of time, settling for a descriptive neutrality in its succession of anecdotes and incidents, some more engaging than others. The degree to which a reader enjoys it will depend on how compelling they find the details of country life in bygone times (for me, there were quite a few humdrum passages). The rural world Crews evokes is harsh and brutal, but a sweet, unsentimental sadness softens the pages, his generous and forgiving consciousness declining to come down hard on the volatile figures who make up his past. Everyone has their share of sorrow and trauma, including him. After he falls into a trough of boiling water used to scald the hairs off slaughtered hogs, he watches his skin peel away, leaving severe burns he is fortunate to survive. When he contracts polio, his legs bend back grotesquely (a faith healer assures him the cruel deformation won’t be permanent and so it transpires). Both experiences are a schooling in empathy that will later serve him well as a novelist: “I hated it and dreaded it and was humiliated by it. I felt how lonely and savage it was to be a freak.” It seems that writing A Childhood took its toll on Crews. Afterwards, his heavy drinking escalated and he endured a decade-long fictive drought. In preserving a vanished form of American life, he admits to his own incurable estrangement: “If you do not have a home place, very little will ever be yours… there is nowhere I can think of as the home place.” • A Childhood by Harry Crews is published by Penguin Classics (£12.99).

348;348;Tannhäuser review – Lise Davidsen gleams though Albery’s Wagner misfires again;2023-01-30T12:31:58Z;['Tim Ashley'];['Opera', 'Richard Wagner', 'Royal Opera House', 'Classical music', 'Music', 'Culture'];;"Tim Albery’s 2010 production of Wagner’s Tannhäuser is now back at Covent Garden for its second revival, and remains a flawed piece of theatre that only fitfully illuminates the opera’s complexities. Wagner examines the conflict between sexuality and spirituality in the soul of an artist, presenting them as being at once polarised and mutually dependent by deploying contrasting developments of the same thematic material for each. Albery, however, muddles matters by adding too many glosses about the relationship between art and reality and the role of the artist in times of political turmoil. His Venusberg is a place of illusion, escape and irresponsibility, purposefully if unconvincingly modelled on the Opera House itself, where the curtains part to reveal Ekaterina Gubanova’s cabaret diva Venus presiding over a tawdry table dancing show. Taking his cue, meanwhile, from the Landgrave’s remark about artistic renewal after military conflict, Albery has the song competition take place in a bombed-out war zone inhabited by armed thugs, where the remains of the Venusberg are visible amid the rubble. There’s little sense of a society governed by religious values and consequently no real indication as to why Tannhäuser’s behaviour provokes such outrage. As a dramatic totality, I’m afraid, it doesn’t satisfactorily cohere.
Musically, it’s uneven, too, for which some of the responsibility rests with conductor Sebastian Weigle, usually an impressive Wagnerian, though here he took time establishing adequate dramatic momentum: the first act was unaccountably sluggish, the great Venus/Tannhäuser confrontation notably lacking fire. Stefan Vinke, meanwhile, cast as Tannhäuser, was indisposed on opening night, acting the role while Norbert Ernst sang from the side of the stage with a metallic tone but plenty of staying power and expressive verbal shading: his Rome Narrative was keenly intense. As Elisabeth, Lise Davidsen gave us a gleaming Dich, Teure Halle and proved sensationally good later on when she took on the Landgrave’s men in order to save Tannhäuser’s life and soul. Gerald Finley, meanwhile, made a truly great Wolfram, incomparably sung, and acted with breathtaking subtlety. Gubanova sounded glamorously sensual, though Venus ideally needs a fractionally warmer lower register than she possesses. Mika Kares was the dark-voiced Landgrave, while among the smaller roles Egor Zhuravskii’s imperious, lyrical Walther particularly stood out. The Royal Opera chorus were superb here, too, singing with wonderful fervour and beautiful control. • Tannhäuser is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 16 February.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/30/tannhauser-review-tim-albery-lise-davidsen-stefan-vinke-roh;guardian;entertainment & culture;348
6038;6038;Julian Assange to apply for prison leave to attend Vivienne Westwood's funeral, says wife;Saturday 31 December 2022 05:31, UK;[];['julian assange', 'vivienne westwood'];['leave', 'vivienne', 'dame', 'prison', 'wore', 'apply', 'westwood', 'funeral', 'attend', 'wife', 'friend', 'wedding', 'westwoods', 'assange', 'julian'];"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is to request leave from prison to attend the funeral of his friend Dame Vivienne Westwood, according to his wife.

Dame Vivienne, known as the Godmother of Punk, died aged 81 on Thursday surrounded by her family in south London, prompting Mr Assange to search for a way to say goodbye, despite being behind bars in London's Belmarsh prison as he fights extradition to the US.

His wife Stella Assange told Australia's Nine Media of the funeral: ""Julian's going to put in a request to be able to attend.""

Mr Assange and Dame Vivienne had been friends for more than a decade, with the designer a vocal supporter throughout his time in the Ecuadorian embassy and prison.

She even dressed as a canary and suspended herself inside a giant birdcage outside The Old Bailey in July 2020 to protest his potential extradition.

The designer's death prompted the WikiLeaks founder to issue his first statement since being imprisoned in 2019.

Released by Mrs Assange, it said: ""Vivienne was a Dame and a pillar of the anti-establishment. Bold, creative, thoughtful and a good friend. The best of Britain. She will be missed terribly by me and many others.""

Mrs Assange wore a dress designed by Dame Vivienne and her husband Andreas Kronthaler when she married the 51-year-old at the prison in a small ceremony in March.

Mrs Assange said following the death: ""Vivienne was a rebel at heart. Julian and I loved her company.

""Her gift to us took our wedding to the next level, so there was a lot of attention, and she just had this incredible talent for visuals and for messaging.""

She added: ""Our wonderful friend Vivienne Westwood has left us. A fierce campaigner and a true altruist, she fought to #FreeAssange and for humanity's future.

""Vivienne, you remain an inspiration. Your greatness will live on.""

Eccentric creations

Dame Vivienne, who was born in Cheshire in 1941, is largely accepted as being responsible for bringing punk and new wave fashion into the mainstream with her eccentric creations.

Her designs were regularly worn by high-profile individuals including Dita Von Teese, who wore a purple Westwood wedding gown to marry Marilyn Manson, and Princess Eugenie, who wore three Westwood designs for various elements of the wedding of the then Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Details of her funeral are not yet known.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101071913/http://news.sky.com/story/julian-assange-to-apply-for-prison-leave-to-attend-vivienne-westwoods-funeral-says-wife-12777307;skynews;entertainment & culture;129
3331;3331;Alexander Isak seals Newcastle win over Fulham after Mitrovic’s spot of bother;2023-01-15T16:30:21Z;['Louise Taylor'];['Premier League', 'Newcastle United', 'Fulham', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Who could have imagined Eddie Howe would become synonymous with thoroughly streetwise, defensive efficiency? Admittedly it might have been different had Fulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic not seen a second-half penalty disallowed for a freakish and entirely accidental double touch but Newcastle have conceded only 11 goals in 19 Premier League games. Despite being made to work extremely hard by Marco Silva’s side, they remain firmly in contention for Champions League qualification thanks to an 89th-minute intervention from a £60m striker who had become something of an invisible man on Tyneside in recent months.
Sweden’s Alexander Isak jogged a few memories after stepping off the bench to head Newcastle’s close-range winner on his first Premier League appearance since sustaining a thigh injury in September. “The missed penalty gave us a massive lift, gave our players a sense of freedom and really got the crowd behind us,” said Howe, whose team have kept five straight clean sheets. “I’m really pleased for Alex. It could be a very big moment in our season. We’ll do everything not to concede and we’re in a very good place.” Silva suggested a degree of cynicism had helped transport Newcastle there. “They have quality but Newcastle are also really physical,” he said, somewhat pointedly. The Fulham manager was extremely critical of the referee, Robert Jones, but did not go quite as far as endorsing suggestions that Howe’s players had deliberately scuffed the turf around the penalty spot just before Mitrovic stepped forward.
The Serbia striker, formerly of Newcastle, slipped in the process of executing his kick and knocked the ball on to his standing foot before watching it spin into the far corner of Nick Pope’s net. “I saw many players around the penalty spot beforehand but I cannot say,” said Silva. “I just like to say things I am sure about.” Certainty entered the Portuguese’s voice when he discussed the events prefacing that 69th-minute incident. Silva claimed Jones had missed two blatant fouls in the box, arguing Dan Burn should have been dismissed for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity by sending Andreas Pereira tumbling before Kieran Trippier tripped Bobby Decordova-Reid. Eventually a VAR review led to the penalty award but, by then, Silva was incandescent. “It’s difficult to see how the referee did not see at least one before the VAR,” he said. “There were many fouls from Newcastle but the decisions today were almost all against us. It can happen, I can have bad afternoons and the referee did not have his best game. But the first foul [from Burn] was a clear penalty and red card. It is a clear mistake from the referee and I don’t see how VAR missed the red card. It made a huge impact. I have much more problems with that than the penalty itself. If Mitrovic touched it twice, it has to be disallowed.” Howe’s principal worry was the ankle injury which necessitated the withdrawal of his key midfielder Bruno Guimarães at the interval. “Bruno needs a scan, which is never a good sign,” he said. “With hindsight I should have taken him off earlier. We hope it’s not long term.” Before kick-off a banner unfurled by home fans in the Leazes End declared: “We’re not here to be popular, we’re here to compete,” and Fulham soon received confirmation that Howe is an infinitely more pragmatic coach than during his days choreographing a defensively generous Bournemouth. He still likes his creative players, though, and the second-half introduction of Allan Saint-Maximin on the left wing enabled Newcastle to edge it on a day when their manager courted controversy by selecting Joelinton in his starting XI despite the Brazilian having been charged with drink-driving last week.
“I had a long meeting with my coaching staff yesterday and we debated it,” said Howe. “I didn’t underestimate what Joe did but there are a whole host of things to consider and I had to make the decision.” Newcastle looked appreciably more dangerous when Joelinton dropped into midfield to accommodate Saint-Maximin. They had earlier struggled to conjure clear chances against an obdurate Fulham defence bolstered by Bernd Leno’s goalkeeping excellence. Although Leno saved well from Callum Wilson, and Fabian Schär’s free-kick hit a post, inviting openings were at a premium until Wilson flicked Longstaff’s cross into Isak’s path. “I’m very proud of my players,” said Silva. “To lose like that was brutal.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/15/newcastle-united-fulham-premier-league-match-report;guardian;sports;3331
8068;8068;Man found guilty of knifepoint robbery of Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish and his wife in their home;Monday 23 January 2023 15:01, UK;[];['essex', 'police'];['olympic', 'cyclist', 'intruders', 'cavendish', 'court', 'guilty', 'robbery', 'man', 'knifepoint', 'mark', 'london', 'knife', 'wife', 'held', 'told', 'following'];"A man who robbed cyclist Mark Cavendish and his wife at their home and made off with luxury watches worth a total of £700,000 has been found guilty.

Romario Henry, 31, of Bell Green, Lewisham, south-east London, denied carrying out the raid but was found guilty following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court.

His co-defendant Oludewa Okorosobo, 28, of Flaxman Road, Camberwell, south London, denied two counts of robbery and was cleared by the jury.

It comes after the court heard how the Olympic cyclist had a ""Rambo-style"" knife held against his face by balaclava-wearing men, who broke into his home and stole a pair of watches.

The 37-year-old and his wife, Peta, were woken up when the intruders broke into the property in Ongar, Essex, at around 2.30am on 27 November 2021.

After hearing noise coming from downstairs, Mrs Cavendish went to investigate.

After spotting the intruders, she attempted to shout to her husband to get back into the bedroom.

Mr Cavendish, who at the time was recovering from a cycling injury, attempted to press a panic alarm but was jumped on by an intruder who began punching him in the head.

He told the court that one of the men took out a knife and ""held it in my face"" before threatening to ""stab him up"" in front of his children.

Two Richard Mille watches, worth £400,000 and £300,000, were taken in the robbery.

The Olympic silver medalist, widely regarded as one of the greatest road sprinter cyclists of all time, told jurors that as a brand ambassador of the luxury watchmaker he is sometimes loaned custom-made timepieces to wear.

A phone and a Louis Vuitton suitcase belonging to Mr Cavendish's wife were also taken.

Prosecutor Edward Renvoize told the court that the couple had been ""terrorised in their own home"".

Just days earlier, Mr Cavendish had been discharged from hospital having suffered a collapsed lung and two broken ribs in a crash during a track event in Belgium.

Henry's conviction comes after another man, 28-year-old Ali Sesay, of Rainham, Kent, admitted two counts of robbery.

His DNA was found on Mrs Cavendish's phone, which was taken and found outside the property following the raid.

The court heard that police identified other suspects by communications on Sesay's phone.

Jurors were previously told how a fourth and fifth suspect, Jo Jobson, from Plaistow, east London, and George Goddard, from Loughton in Essex, have not been traced.

Henry, who was convicted by a majority verdict of 10 jurors to two following more than 14 hours of deliberation, is due to be sentenced on 7 February.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123151704/http://news.sky.com/story/man-found-guilty-of-knifepoint-robbery-of-olympic-cyclist-mark-cavendish-and-his-wife-in-their-home-12793499;skynews;entertainment & culture;2159
256;256;A rancid melody has been directed at Azeem Rafiq but he's not the only target | Jonathan Liew;2023-01-30T20:00:26Z;['Jonathan Liew'];['Azeem Rafiq', 'Cricket', 'Sport', 'Race', 'Yorkshire'];;"On the evening of 5 October last year, a man approached a house in Barnsley with a mobile phone in one hand and some toilet rolls in the other. According to written testimony submitted to a parliamentary inquiry, the man circled the house for several minutes talking into his phone, before walking into the garden and taking a dump. Then there was the bloke who stalked the house late at night carrying what looked like a length of chain. People shouting abuse through shop windows and car windows. Guys sliding into his messages to call him a “lying little scum”, a “fucking piece of shit”, a “Paki rat”, threatening to destroy his family business. The many times he has walked down the streets of his home town and wondered whether this is the day someone finally makes good on their promise of violence.
Azeem Rafiq has always insisted this was never about him. That his tragic tale was just one brushstroke on a much broader canvas. That those who wronged him were operating within a structure of power spoken and power unspoken. Stop looking at me, he told us, look at the whole picture. Stop hunting down individuals, he pleaded, hunt down the system that enabled them. Fourteen months ago, the world watched and listened to Rafiq as he wept on live television. It then proceeded to ignore almost every single thing he said. Fourteen months in which the world moved on. Gary Ballance has moved across the world to make a fresh start playing for Zimbabwe. Tom Harrison has just landed himself a new job as the head of Six Nations Rugby. With a few notable exceptions, the journalists and broadcasters who made Rafiq the biggest news story in the country for a couple of days took their likes and their listeners and hopped on to fresh pastures. And Rafiq? Let’s charitably call it a mixed bag. His sudden fame brought him opportunities and platforms that would never otherwise have been available to him: invitations to events, invitations to speak, prizes and praise. Then again, he has had virtually his entire past publicly raked over, now travels with a security detail and has been forced to leave the country as a result of the numerous threats to his security. When you hear him speak there is a kind of resignation to him: the empty desperation of a guy who has no choice but to keep making himself a target. If it were just a few fringe lunatics, he could probably understand it as the price of doing business. Except this is the sharp end of a series of stories being run by some of the country’s biggest newspapers. As Rafiq put it during his most recent appearance before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee: “Every time there is an article it has created a wave of online abuse.”
The past week brought a few more. One in the Mail casting aspersions on the role of the England and Wales Cricket Board in its forthcoming racism hearing. One in the Telegraph disclosing accusations from former teammate Ajmal Shahzad of Rafiq’s “hard-partying, drinking and smoking”. One in the Yorkshire Post reporting that Adil Rashid may have been “pressurised” into supporting Rafiq’s claim against the former England captain Michael Vaughan. It has been like this most weeks: a collage of accusations whose effect has been to paint a flawed man in the worst light. There have been extremely serious claims of sexual harassment, of antisemitism and homophobia, that Rafiq has only partially addressed but says are untrue. In an ideal world it would be possible to see only enlightened motives in the actions of Rafiq’s critics. Perhaps the man defecating in Rafiq’s garden was aggrieved at his antisemitic Facebook post and had symbolically chosen the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur to make his protest.
We should probably withhold the benefit of the doubt. Mercilessly discrediting the accuser, after all, is the default tactic of right-wing media the world over. Anybody who accused Rafiq of fabricating his experiences in November 2021 would have been shooed out of the room. So his detractors played the long game. An antisemitic Facebook post. OK, now can we claim he was lying? But he had gambling debts. How about now? But he was late repaying a coaching grant from Sport England. But he partied hard. How about now? Over time, the original injustices have receded further from the memory, obscured by a web of disinformation and distraction, complexity and fatigue, from which many ordinary cricket fans have long since tuned out. Play the same tune over and over and even the most rancid melody will worm its way into the brain. Rafiq, for his part, has had his life ruined for a second time. None of this was accidental, nor was it directed squarely at him. There are, after all, other potential whistleblowers out there, each with their own stories, each privately weighing up the costs and benefits of coming forward. Every week, the system of privilege and white supremacy they seek to overturn whispers quietly to them. See that? See what we did with the lad from Yorkshire? We can do that to you too. Old social media posts. Ex-teammates. Everyone with a story. How much do you really want this? Shhh. There’s a good lad.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/30/rancid-melody-azeem-rafiq-not-the-only-target-cricket;guardian;sports;256
2771;2771;New York, New England … Las Vegas? Where is Tom Brady heading next?;2023-01-18T13:09:43Z;['Hunter Felt'];['Tom Brady', 'New England Patriots', 'Sport', 'Tampa Bay Buccaneers', 'Las Vegas Raiders', 'New York Jets', 'San Francisco 49ers', 'US sports', 'NFL', 'Tennessee Titans'];;"You probably heard the talk somewhere during the Dallas Cowboys’ 31-14 thrashing of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night: could we have just seen the final game in the Hall of Fame career of Tom Brady? Maybe. But it’s also possible that he will prolong his battle with Father Time for another season. Listed for your approval are possible destinations. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Why it would make sense: Inertia is powerful. Sometimes, players (and the rest of us) stay in non-ideal situations because it’s too much hassle to move on. Brady made the playoffs with these Bucs this season and he probably could do it again next year. We already know that he’s going through upheaval in his personal life: maybe he doesn’t want to compound that by moving elsewhere. (It would also help if Tampa Bay secure Sean Payton as their next coach.) Why it won’t happen: Did you see the game he just played? Brady barely completed half of his 66 passing attempts. It was a shock when he unretired to play for Tampa Bay in the first place. It would make even less sense for him to return after a season in which it looked as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else. It’s not like Tampa can slap the franchise tag on him to prevent him from leaving, either. Las Vegas Raiders Why it would make sense: The Raiders are very publicly moving on from Derek Carr after a season in which they missed the playoffs despite a promising roster, meaning they may be in the most desperate situation of any of Brady’s potential suitors. Plus, Brady has worked with head coach Josh McDaniels before during their time in New England.
Why it won’t happen: The Raiders would be getting an ageing player in Brady, maybe not the ideal replacement for Carr. Meanwhile, Brady would be heading to a division where he would have to duel Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs alongside Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers. And the Raiders’ iffy offensive line is a problem for a quarterback who has shown an increasing aversion to being hit. Not exactly a relaxing way to end an NFL career. Tennessee Titans Why it would make sense: It’s the same situation as the Raiders: the Titans are looking for a quarterback with a higher ceiling than the one they had this last season. Brady would at least tick that box. Even if the Jacksonville Jaguars have made a leap, the AFC South would be more winnable than the AFCs East and West. Why it won’t happen: It’s the same situation as the Raiders: Brady is a stopgap answer and wouldn’t be a long-term replacement for Ryan Tannehill. New York Jets Why it would make sense: If Brady ever really wanted to give it to his former head coach, Bill Belichick, it would make plenty of sense to rejoin the Patriots’ historical rivals. The Jets have a solid team that has been consistently held back by poor quarterback play. In New York, Brady wouldn’t have to be the same as he once was, just better than Zach Wilson. Which, let’s face it, isn’t tough. Why it won’t happen: Once again, it’s a “grass isn’t greener” scenario. The AFC East is a much more hostile environment than the NFC South, where Brady was practically gifted a postseason slot. Plus, who knows if there is still bad blood between Brady and the Jets after all of those years in opposition. Lord knows it would take the fans some time to adjust to rooting for Brady. San Francisco 49ers Why it would make sense: Brady would be heading back home! Haven’t you heard that fact before? He grew up rooting for Joe Montana’s 49ers teams! Think of all the sentimental soft-focus television specials! Plus, the 49ers offer Brady the best supporting cast: they have already advanced to the second round of the playoffs while starting the “Mr Irrelevant” of last year’s draft, Brock Purdy. It’s hard not to fantasize about how far this team could go if Brady has one more great season left in him. Why it won’t happen: The 49ers already have three starting quarterbacks! It’s difficult enough to figure out what they’re going to do with Trey Lance, Jimmy Garoppolo and Purdy all on the roster. Why would they complicate matters by signing Brady? Would he even be a guaranteed improvement? After all, of the two parties, only one will be sitting at home this weekend. New England Patriots Why it would make sense: Brady has always had an eye on Hollywood. If he didn’t, it would be incredibly difficult to explain the mere existence of 80 for Brady. So, what’s a better-scripted ending than Brady returning to the franchise that drafted him and winning one more championship? It’s not like Mac Jones gives New England a better chance. Why it won’t happen: Brady has already won a Super Bowl without Belichick, but the Patriots head coach can’t say the same without Brady. Given that their partnership ended acrimoniously, it doesn’t feel like the two will be reuniting if any ill-will remains. Chances are they’ll save their inevitable “patching things up” moment for the cameras when Brady is inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The lucrative Fox Sports gig Why it would make sense: There are 375m reasons for Brady to give up playing football, not including the fact that he would be saving his mind and body from the dangers of the sport. Given the seven championship rings and endless NFL records he’s broken, Brady would has very little reason to stay in the league and every reason to become a talking head for Fox Sports. Why it won’t happen: Because, despite all this, Brady couldn’t remain unretired last year. At this point, we must appreciate that Brady’s desire to continue playing in the NFL may not be a rational impulse but his own personal raging against the dying of the light. Retiring makes the most sense, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the likeliest scenario.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/tom-brady-next-team-nfl-football-tampa-jets-raiders-patriots;guardian;sports;2771
1231;1231;£1m paid to Octopus Energy customers as part of power saving scheme;2023-01-25T22:36:51Z;['Harry Taylor'];['Energy bills', 'Household bills', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Energy efficiency', 'Energy', 'Environment', 'Consumer affairs', 'Money'];;"More than £1m was paid to energy customers with Octopus Energy on Tuesday as part of a power saving scheme. The energy supplier said more than 400,000 customers took part by reducing their electricity use between 4.30pm and 6pm. National Grid’s Demand Flexibility Scheme kicked in for the first time on Monday amid cold temperatures, meaning more energy was being used while less energy was being generated by wind power. There was also uncertainty over how much power Britain could import through undersea cables from Europe. Coal-fired power stations in North Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire were put on standby in case supplies ran low, but were later stood down. It had been feared that the mixture of weather conditions, demand and generation issues could lead to blackouts. Octopus, British Gas, EDF and E.ON are all taking part in the scheme. It is only available to households with smart meters.
The average customer was paid £2.50 in points for reducing their usage by an average of 60%. The top 5% were paid £15 in points. The Octopus deal can see the points turned into cash, “prizes” or donated to a fund for customers in need. More energy was saved on Tuesday, when the payment was larger, than on Monday, the firm revealed. Less than £1m was paid out on Monday. Energy firms had advised that customers could delay cooking their evening meal, or putting loads of washing on – as cookers and washing machines can use lots of electricity. The total amount of energy saved was about 250MWh (megawatt hours) nationwide, the same as the city of Liverpool going off grid for an hour, PA Media said. After being in action for two days, the scheme was not triggered for Wednesday. There had been trials before it was used properly for the first time this week. It will be in place until March 2023, the National Grid has said.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme;guardian;business & economy;1231
8816;8816;Woman who vanished while walking dog in Lancashire has 'two little girls that need their mummy home';Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:48, UK;[];['lancashire'];['need', 'girls', 'dog', 'nicola', 'searching', 'walking', 'school', 'vanished', 'woman', 'missing', 'little', 'lancashire', 'ansell', 'mummy', 'wyre', 'bulley'];"A woman who disappeared while walking her dog has ""two little girls that need their mummy home"", her boyfriend has said, as a major search continues.

Nicola Bulley, 45, was last seen at 9.15am on Friday by a member of the public.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

Her partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for the mother-of-two.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children, aged nine and six, to a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

Ms Bulley, a mortgage adviser, is originally from Chelmsford, Essex and has lived in Lancashire for 25 years. Police said she speaks with an Essex accent.

Police 'more and more concerned' for Nicola

Superintendent Sally Riley from Lancashire Police told a press conference that fears for Ms Bulley are growing as time passes.

She said: ""The police are keeping a really open mind about what could have happened but we do believe that the likelihood is that Nicola has gone missing and this is not a crime inquiry.

""We've mounted a really intensive operation to try to find Nicola. We've got a large area to search.

""People do go missing but clearly as time goes on we become more and more concerned for Nicola.

""But we're very much hoping that we will find something to try to bring her home safe and well soon.""

Ms Bulley is described as white, 5ft 3in, with light brown shoulder-length hair.

At the time of her disappearance she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive green ankle wellington boots. Her hair was in a ponytail.

Searches have been carried out by Lancashire Police - using a helicopter, drones and dogs - with support from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue team and the North West Underwater Search Team.

5149;5149;Sunak v Starmer: how did their new year speeches differ?;2023-01-05T13:00:20Z;['Peter Walker'];['Politics', 'Keir Starmer', 'Rishi Sunak', 'UK news', 'Labour', 'Conservatives'];;"They were delivered in more or less exactly the same location in east London and less than 24 hours apart. What were the key differences in the set-piece new year speeches by Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer? The big message Rishi Sunak: The prime minister unveiled what he called five “pledges to deliver peace of mind”, albeit ones with occasionally vague deadlines: halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing national debt, cutting NHS waiting lists and passing a law connected to unofficial Channel crossings. The other big promise was mandatory maths study to the age of 18, with an even more opaque timetable attached. Keir Starmer: The Labour leader had similarly few policies to unveil beyond a slightly cheeky new name for existing devolution plans: the “take back control bill”, borrowing a much-used Brexit slogan. More widely, Starmer promised hope and more long-term planning, contrasting this with what he called the government’s “sticking-plaster politics”, a phrase used no fewer than eight times in the speech.
The economy/growth/inflation Sunak: Most of this was contained within the five pledges. The post-speech Q&A seemed to indicate that even a single quarter of growth at the very end of 2023 would meet the target, which feels not hugely ambitious, while inflation is already forecast to more than halve. Beyond that, the PM had some slightly woolly words about the transformative economic power of innovation. Starmer: Even less specific on the economy than Sunak. Starmer’s main – and pre-trailed – pledge was that Labour would not be “getting its big government chequebook out” to boost everyday public spending, even if the party remains committed to significant infrastructure investment, notably on green energy, with a pledge to reach “100% clean power generation by 2030”. NHS Sunak: Shorter waiting times was one of the PM’s five pledges, even though it seems this might only be a target for spring 2024. On tackling the NHS crisis, Sunak had nothing new to offer, only citing existing policies on areas such as extra hospital beds and social care places. Starmer: Also generally a restatement of existing policies, including Labour’s plan to train more NHS staff, and an obligatory reference to the threat to the health service from “sticking-plaster politics”.
Strikes Sunak: He took a slightly more conciliatory tone than recently, saying ministers “hugely value public-sector workers”, and calling for “a reasonable dialogue”. This tone was slightly undermined when, hours later, news emerged of No 10’s plan for an anti-strike law that could lead to some staff being sacked for industrial action. Starmer: The Labour leader had notably less to say about this in his speech. In the subsequent Q&A, he refused to be drawn on any specifics about how a Labour government would solve the disputes, but he did pledge to repeal any anti-strike law. Small boats Sunak: Again, another one of his five pledges, although he only promised to pass a law to try to tackle the Channel crossings, not to actually reduce their number. Asked after the speech if he also promised this, Sunak was notably evasive. Starmer: No mention at all in the speech. When asked about the issue, Starmer reiterated Labour’s somewhat broad plans for the area, for example speeding up asylum decisions.
The personal bit Sunak: The old standby of family. As well as referencing his doctor father and pharmacist mother, Sunak said family “can help us answer the profound questions we face as a country”. In a mini-indication that this is modern Conservatism, he stressed that this was the case “whatever your family looks like”. Starmer: For the few remaining Britons unaware that he comes from a working-class background, the Labour leader recounted his family’s phone being cut off amid the earlier cost of living crisis in his 1970s childhood.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/sunak-v-starmer-how-did-their-new-year-speeches-differ;guardian;politics;5149
2372;2372;US couple who bid for pig at auction to rescue it find they were buying its meat;2023-01-20T07:00:31Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['Florida', 'Farm animals', 'US news', 'Animals'];;"A Florida couple who won a pig at a state fair auction, intending to save it from the slaughterhouse, discovered the animal would be killed anyway and they had spent $4,700 on its meat. Meg and Eric Weinberger, who run the Rescue Life sanctuary in Palm Beach Gardens, insist officials from the South Florida Fair gave no notification that they were bidding in a “terminal” auction of livestock raised solely for processing.
They believe but have not been able to confirm that the pig they fell in love with, named Bella B Swine by the teen who raised it, has now been killed. They say fair managers told them they were only entitled to the 186lbs of meat. “It did not say it was a slaughter–only auction, otherwise we’d have turned around and walked away,” Meg Weinberger said. “They said it was state law that the animal had to be slaughtered, but other fairs in Florida allow auction winners to take the animals with them. You can keep the meat, donate the meat or take the animal home.” Weinberger said she called the Florida department of agriculture after the fair refused to run her credit card, and established that a private sale was possible. But fair officials weren’t interested, she said. “I waited six hours until the end of the auction, and this lady walks in and says, ‘That’s the way it is, it’s a termination sale,’” she said. She said she called the slaughterhouse in a last-ditch attempt to save the hog, but “they called me back and said they weren’t willing to lose their contract with the state fair over one pig.” Victoria Chouris, president and chief executive of the South Florida Fair, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chouris conceded to the Palm Beach Post that the auction registration form did not indicate the pigs would be processed for food, but that its website did. On Thursday, the fair’s market auction handbook was inaccessible online. “We always assume bidders are familiar with the rules and review them on our website. We will revise the registration form to make it clear that this is a terminal auction,” Chouris told the Post, adding that the fair had conducted such auctions for decades. Most pigs at the fair sell for about $1,900, the Post said. Weinberger said she and her husband were willing to pay more to support teenagers getting a first taste in farming by participating in a 4-H agriculture program, raising the animals for auction. She said the teenager who raised Bella B Swine from a piglet, a 16-year-old girl, was upset by the dispute and had taken down an Instagram page used to chronicle the animal’s growth. “She’s been through so much,” Weinberger said, adding that she and her husband made sure the youth received the entire $4,700. Chouris told CBS Miami the meat would be donated to charity. “We are all learning from this experience,” she said. Becky Brashear, the fair’s director of business development, told the Post a private sale was not possible because the pigs were not raised to be with other animals. Weinberger dismissed the claim, saying she suspected the fair did not want to advertise it was conducting slaughter auctions for public relations reasons. “I know people eat meat, eat bacon, but they don’t want to know that the pig they just saw at the fair is the one that’s going to be on their plate,” she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/south-florida-fair-pig-auction-slaughter;guardian;entertainment & culture;2372
6033;6033;Why 2023 is shaping up to be a massive year for Britons in space;Sunday 1 January 2023 04:20, UK;[];['space'];['massive', 'women', 'sky', 'ms', 'really', 'britons', 'space', 'role', 'opportunity', 'think', 'seen', '2023', 'shaping', 'mission'];"Think of all the things you stumble across while aimlessly scrolling social media, and the height of any excitement would likely be spared for a good online shopping deal or a funny meme your dad would like.

For most of us, the possibility we might see an opportunity that would take us into space would seem unlikely.

But that's exactly what happened to Rhiannon Adam, a photographer who in 2023 will become the first British and openly queer woman to travel to the moon.

She's one of several explorers set to help make it a massive year for the UK's presence among the stars, as our collective fascination with the final frontier climbs to heights not seen in decades.

'Never in a million years would I think this could happen'

Of all the reasons to be excited about the coming year for space travel, nothing reflects the wonder it would have inspired among so many of us during our lives quite like the upcoming journey of Ms Adam.

""Never in a million years did I think I would ever be going to space,"" she told Sky News.

""When you are a kid, looking up at the sky, having all these constellations explained to you, and trying to find your place in the world, you do dream.

""But it was always just fantasy. I watched Star Trek, but never would I think it could happen.""

How did the opportunity come about?

The 37-year-old's space trip involves a seven-day flight to the moon, which the craft - dubbed Starship - will orbit before coming back to Earth.

She was one of eight artists picked to be in the all-civilian crew by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as part of dearMoon, a mission aboard a rocket developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Ms Adam was picked after applying in March 2021, having stumbled across others doing so on social media.

Another photographer on the team is UK-born Karim Iliya, who has had work published in National Geographic.

""This experience will be pushing my own practice into a new direction,"" said Ms Adam.

""The possibility to engage with science, and bridge that gap between art and science, is really exciting.""

Image: Starship is a rocket built by SpaceX

Who's leading the charge for Britain in space?

What's most notable about Britain's role in space exploration is the role of women.

As 2022 wound down, the country's first ever rocket launch was being overseen by Melissa Thorpe, the head of Spaceport Cornwall.

""It's been such a rollercoaster ride,"" the Canadian native told Sky News ahead of the historic event, which was pushed back from an early to mid-December launch.

""We're really proud of what this about to do for the UK.""

Another milestone has seen Rosemary Coogan, an astrophysicist from Northern Ireland, selected as only the UK's third ever astronaut.

Before her were Helen Sharman, who became the first Briton in space in 1989, and Tim Peake, who performed a historic spacewalk 27 years later.

Ms Coogan was among the European Space Agency's (ESA) first new astronauts since 2009, and will spend 2023 undertaking vigorous training for a future mission.

""It was a real privilege to get the call - I was incredibly excited,"" she said.

""So many people applied, and I feel extremely lucky to be in this position and really want to make the most of this opportunity to learn as much as I can and give as much as I can.""

'History hasn't been on our side'

The role of women in space travel is part of an international trend set to be taken to the lunar surface by NASA's Artemis mission, which is aiming to put a woman on the moon for the first time.

For Ms Adam, being part of an increasing number of women playing a very visible role in space is an honour.

""It's really important women are seen to be doing these things,"" she told Sky News.

""So often women don't apply for things, history hasn't been on our side. And as a queer person, it has been an extremely difficult time - there are so many places around the world where my existence is illegal.

""So hopefully this opportunity can help inspire others that they can be seen and heard for who they are, and that they don't have to hide in the shadows.""

Former Paralympian's 'inspiring' opportunity

Speaking of history, another British astronaut is making just that in 2023.

Former Paralympian John McFall will join Ms Coogan in training after becoming the ESA's first disabled astronaut, hailing the opportunity as ""inspiring and exhilarating"".

While he's getting ready to go into space, back home the UK will be gearing up for further launches of its own.

Hoping to follow the fabulously named Start Me Up mission from Cornwall are launches from Scotland, specifically Sutherland and Shetland.

These will be NASA-style vertical spectacles, rather than the jet-like horizontal take-off of Cosmic Girl, but with only satellites for cargo, it's mere British ingenuity being carried rather than any Britons themselves.

It's likely just the dearMoon mission doing that in 2023, though it's a different flag that Ms Adam will be flying.

Born in Cork, it's the Irish tricolour that she's chosen to fly high above the Earth instead.

""It's built in the Irish spirit to be adventurous,"" she says, and nobody would argue with that.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230101051734/http://news.sky.com/story/why-2023-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-massive-year-for-britons-in-space-12767773;skynews;science & technology;124

Actor and diplomat Sidney Poiter was the first black man to win the Oscar for best actor, taking home the famous statuette in 1964 for his performance in Lilies Of The Field.

Known for highlighting issues faced by black people at the time, the Hollywood star appeared in dozens of films and TV shows throughout his career, including In The Heat Of The Night, To Sir, With Love, and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. He also directed a number of projects, including Stir Crazy, Hanky Panky, and Ghost Dad.

As well as being a decorated actor, he was also an international diplomat, serving as the Bahamian ambassador to Japan between 1997 and 2007, and to UNESCO between 2002 and 2007. Knighted in 1974, in 2009 he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the US, by Barack Obama.

Poitier died aged 94, primarily of heart failure after also suffering from Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer, according to his death certificate. Mr Obama led the tributes to a star who ""epitomised dignity and grace, revealing the power of movies to bring us closer together"".

Real name, Michael Lee Aday, the performer known to the world as Meat Loaf sold more than 100 million albums worldwide throughout his career.

He also starred in dozens of films, including Fight Club, Focus, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Spiceworld, Wayne's World and The 51st State.

Meat Loaf's hits included Dead Ringer For Love, Paradise By The Dashboard Lights, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad and I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That), but it was his debut album and its titular song, Bat Out Of Hell, released in 1977, that made him a household name.

The album remains one of the biggest-selling records of all time (alongside the likes of Michael Jackson, AC/DC and Whitney Houston), despite never reaching number one in the US or UK.

The star died aged 74 after speaking openly of struggles with health issues including asthma in recent years.

Comedy great Barry Cryer started out as a variety performer before going on to write for and with some of the biggest names in the industry in the UK.

During a career that spanned seven decades, he was a presence on many much-loved TV series, a long-serving panellist on radio show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, and wrote for a generation of British comedians such as Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, and Tommy Cooper, as well as US stars including Bob Hope and Richard Prior.

Born in Leeds in 1935, he received an OBE in 2001 and in 2018 was given a lifetime achievement award for his comedy career by the British Music Hall Society.

Stars including Stephen Fry, Gyles Brandreth and David Baddiel were among those paying tribute after he died in hospital, aged 86, surrounded by his family.

While Jamal Edwards' name was not widely known outside the music industry before his death, the outpouring of love for the entrepreneur demonstrated just how instrumental he was in the careers of some of the UK's biggest stars.

Ed Sheeran, Rita Ora, Dave and Dua Lipa were among those who paid tribute to the YouTuber, who founded the online urban music platform SBTV which helped dozens of artists rise to prominence over the years.

He died at home aged 31 after taking recreational drugs, with his mother Brenda Edwards - a singer and Loose Women panellist - later warning others of their danger.

She also set up the Jamal Edwards Self Belief Trust, helping good causes in her son's memory, and he became the first person to be honoured posthumously at the annual Music Industry Trusts Award ceremony in November 2022.

Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar was one of India's biggest cultural icons, with a career spanning eight decades - from the era of Frank Sinatra to Adele, having begun singing on stage aged just nine.

At 13 she acted in a Marathi film and had some small roles in Hindi cinema, but singing was her passion. She went on to perform an estimated 15,000 songs in more than a dozen languages and was considered the voice of Bollywood, working with nearly every director, actor and actress in the industry.

Fondly revered as the ""Melody Queen"" and ""Nightingale of India"", a state funeral was held following her death at the age of 92.

Gary Brooker was the frontman of Procol Harum for more than five decades, the lead voice on the group's 13 albums.

Their biggest hit was the 1967 debut A Whiter Shade Of Pale, which held the number one spot on the UK singles charts for six weeks and was widely regarded as defining ""The Summer of Love"".

In 1977, the track was named joint winner alongside Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody as best British pop single 1952-1977 at the Brits and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.

The singer, pianist and composer had been having cancer treatment before he died peacefully at home, aged 76, his bandmates said.

Widely considered one of the greatest bowlers in history, having made his Test debut in 1992 against India in Sydney despite playing only seven first-class games, Shane Warne was a cricketing legend.

He retired from international cricket in 2007, after a stellar career during which he took 708 Test wickets in 145 matches. He won the 1999 50-over World Cup and claimed 293 dismissals in 194 one-day internationals between 1993 and 2004.

Following his international retirement, he continued to play franchise Twenty20 cricket until 2013 and worked as a cricket commentator and in various coaching roles, including with the London Spirit in the inaugural edition of The Hundred in 2021.

""Shane Warne didn't just inspire a cricket generation - he defined it,"" said Daniel Andrews, the premier of the Australian state of Victoria, following his sudden death at the age of 52.

Taylor Hawkins joined the Foo Fighters in 1997 after previously touring with singer Alanis Morissette, one of the biggest stars of the '90s, taking on the rather daunting task of playing drums behind master drummer Dave Grohl.

The Foos were just completing second album The Colour And The Shape, which includes one of their best-loved songs, Everlong, when he joined. With Hawkins on board, the band transitioned from the alternative rock scene to major mainstream success, becoming one of the biggest rock bands in the world.

Hawkins was a huge presence in the band, often coming front of stage at live gigs to sing songs by Queen, one of his favourite acts, while Grohl would return to the sticks.

His sudden death at the age of 50, as the band were touring South America, shocked the world. In September 2022, the Foo Fighters put on two star-studded gigs in London and LA to raise money for charity in memory of their ""badass bandmate, our beloved brother"".

Oscar-winning actor William Hurt was one of the leading men of film in the 1980s and best known for his roles in Broadcast News, Body Heat and The Big Chill.

He was nominated for an Academy Award three times in a row during his career, winning for 1985's Kiss Of The Spider Woman, in which he played a gay man who shared a cell with a political prisoner in Brazil.

He also got best actor nominations for 1987's news industry satire Broadcast News, and a year before for Children Of A Lesser God, a romantic drama set in a school for the deaf; and later received a fourth in 2005 for his supporting role in A History Of Violence, starring Viggo Mortensen.

He died peacefully aged 71 with his family around him, his son said, after previously being diagnosed with cancer.

Tom Parker was was one of five members of British-Irish boyband The Wanted, known for hits including Glad You Came, All Time Low, and Chasing The Sun.

In October 2020 he revealed he had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour and had gone through chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In later interviews, he told how the growth had shrunk and said he was feeling well - and even reunited with his bandmates on stage for their first show in seven years.

In the last few months of his life, he used his platform to raise funds and call for better treatment for those suffering from brain illnesses, telling an all-parliamentary group that he was ""staggered"" the COVID vaccine had been developed so quickly ""but, for decades on end, they haven't found better treatments let alone a cure for brain tumours"".

Parker died aged 33, leaving behind his wife Kelsey and their two children, Aurelia Rose, born in 2019, and Bodhi, who born in October 2021, as the star was being treated.

The Brain Tumour Research charity joined his bandmates and other stars who paid tribute following his death, saying he would be remembered for his ""passion, intelligence, eloquence and determination in the face of such adversity"".

Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, the country's longest-serving leader, was assassinated in a close-range shooting at a campaign rally in the city of Nara.

More than 4,300 people attended his state funeral, which sparked protests across the country over its cost and widening economic disparities caused by the former prime minister's policies. State funerals in Japan have historically been reserved for the emperor.

Mr Abe served two terms as prime minister before stepping down in 2020, saying a chronic health problem had resurfaced. He had suffered from ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager.

Following the divorce, Ivana Trump went on to become an entrepreneur in her own right, starting a fashion line and writing various books. She married and divorced her third and fourth husbands and even made a movie cameo as America's most famous ex-wife in The First Wives Club, in which she delivered the line: ""Don't get mad - get everything!""

She died aged 73 after falling down a flight of stairs at her home in New York City, suffering ""blunt impact injuries"" to her torso.

The original Star Trek's overriding message to viewers was that in the far-off future - the 23rd century - human diversity would be fully accepted. ""I think many people took it into their hearts... that what was being said on TV at that time was a reason to celebrate,"" Nichols said in 1992.

Like other original cast members, she also appeared in six big-screen spinoffs, starting in 1979 with Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and frequented Star Trek fan conventions.

Legendary British fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood died on 29 December.

A statement said she died in Clapham, surrounded by her family.

Dame Vivienne found fame in the 1970s when she brought punk fashions into the mainstream, running a boutique on London's King's Road alongside Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren.

She went on to establish a global fashion brand which today has stores in the UK, France, Italy, America and Asia.

""Vivienne Westwood died today, peacefully and surrounded by her family, in Clapham, South London. The world needs people like Vivienne to make a change for the better,"" her fashion house tweeted.

Her husband and creative partner Andreas Kronthaler said: ""I will continue with Vivienne in my heart.""

Former pope Benedict XVI, the first pontiff to resign in 600 years, died aged 95 on 31 December.

The Pope Emeritus had lived in the Vatican since he stepped down in 2013.

He had become increasingly frail in recent years after dedicating his post-papal life to prayer and meditation.

Benedict's surprise announcement to stand aside shocked the Catholic world, and forced the church to grapple with an event it had not seen in centuries.

He said he wanted to resign as he no longer had the physical and mental strength to run the church.

He held the powerful role for 24 years, earning the nickname ""God's Rottweiler"" for his strictly conservative theological views.

Some ultra-traditionalists even refused to acknowledge Pope Francis as a legitimate pontiff after Benedict stood down, criticising Francis for his more welcoming approach to members of the LGBTQ+ community and to Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church, arguing both were undermining traditional values.

John Bird died peacefully on Christmas Eve aged 86, almost nine years to the day after his comedy partner John Fortune passed away.

He was best known for sketches performed alongside John Fortune and Rory Bremner, in Channel 4's satirical show Bremner, Bird And Fortune.

The Bafta-winning star appeared in numerous TV shows and films across his six decade career, with a 2007 Bird and Fortune special later credited with having been among the first to predict the seriousness of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

She also played a fictionalised version of herself in Fat Actress, a show that played on the way she was treated in the media over her weight gain and loss.

In 2018, Alley took part in UK Celebrity Big Brother and came second, after sharing the house with British famous faces including Dan Osbourne from The Only Way Is Essex, and Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas.

Her Cheers co-stars Ted Danson and Kelsey Grammer, as well as Travolta, led the tributes following her death at 71, with Danson saying: ""I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh. I send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.""

Terry Hall (centre) rose to fame as frontman of ska band The Specials in the late 1970s, with number one hits including A Message To You, Rudy, Rat Race and Ghost Town.

Formed in Hall's home city of Coventry in 1977, the band became the multiracial flagship of the 2 Tone movement, with songs on racism, unemployment and injustice demonstrating a very clear political stance. They also provided a musical backdrop to economic recession, urban decay and societal fracture in the early 1980s.

The band split in 1981, after which Hall, Lynval Golding and Neville Staple went on to form Fun Boy Three while Jerry Dammers and John Bradbury released an album under the moniker The Special AKA. However, The Specials reformed in 2008 and released Encore, their first album of new material in 37 years, in 2019, followed by Protest Songs in 2021.

Hall died after a short illness at the age of 63, with his bandmates paying tribute to a ""beautiful friend"" whose ""music and his performances encapsulated the very essence of life"".

Hi-de-Hi! actress Ruth Madoc (above right with co-stars Su Pollard, Simon Cadell and Michael Knowles) was best known for playing Gladys Pugh in the 1980s holiday camp sitcom, but also starred in the film adaptations of Fiddler On The Roof and Under Milk Wood, and played the mother of Matt Lucas's Daffyd Thomas in the second series of sketch comedy Little Britain.

A star of stage and screen, she performed in an array of roles in theatre and musicals around the world, including Phantom Of The Opera, Gypsy, and Annie. She was also a panto veteran, playing roles including principle boy in Dick Whittington in Edinburgh, the bad fairy in Sleeping Beauty in Rhyl, and the fairy godmother in Cinderella in Mansfield.

In 2018, Madoc performed in the women's version of The Real Full Monty alongside stars including Coleen Nolan, Victoria Derbyshire and Michelle Heaton, raising awareness about breast cancer.

She died at the age of 79, shortly after pulling out of a performance in the Christmas pantomime Aladdin in Torquay following a fall.

734;734;Georgia is seeking to define ‘Cop City’ protests as terrorism, experts say;2023-01-28T08:00:14Z;['Timothy Pratt'];['Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'Protest', 'US news', 'Environment'];;"When author and environmental movement expert Will Potter saw the Atlanta police chief, Darin Schierbaum, tell a recent press conference “it doesn’t take a rocket scientist or an attorney to tell you that breaking windows and setting fires is not protest – it’s terrorism”, he could not believe his ears.
The problem, Potter told the Guardian, is that while you may not have to be a rocket scientist, “the reality is, it’s been difficult to come to an understanding of what terrorism is and what political violence is for decades”. Schierbaum was speaking about a march through midtown Atlanta, Georgia, last Saturday night that began peacefully, only to see several protesters separate and begin breaking windows of businesses and lighting fire to a police car. The marchers were protesting “Cop City”, an 85-acre, $90m training facility planned for South River forest, a wooded area south-east of the city. They were also protesting the fatal police shooting of Tortuguita, a fellow activist, less than a week earlier, on a raid in the Atlanta forest where dozens have been tree-sitting and camping for more than a year. The march, arrests of 18 activists charged under a state domestic terrorism law, a series of raids on the forest in recent weeks and Tortuguita’s killing have escalated tensions over Cop City. They culminated Thursday afternoon in the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, declaring a state of emergency. Under the order, up to 1,000 national guard troops will be available until 9 February or upon further order. These actions have also been matched by a strident rhetoric from police and politicians in Georgia, seeking to define a largely peaceful protest movement – often focused on environmental and racial justice issues – as terrorism and those who participate in it as terrorists. It has shocked many observers including Potter, who see a crude attempt to use as powerful tools as possible to crush opposition. “I can’t help but think it’s to shut the protest down and remove them from the public spotlight,” Potter said of Kemp’s order Thursday. Potter has looked at changing federal government approaches to pursuing terrorism charges against environmental activists in his book, Green Is the New Red: An Insider’s Account of a Social Movement Under Siege. These efforts culminated in attempts to charge activists with domestic terrorism during the 2000s on at least 70 occasions – succeeding in only 18, according to a 2018 report by the Intercept. On Saturday night, six activists in Atlanta were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism, bringing the total since December to 18. All have been charged under a Georgia statute, marking the first time state law has been used this way in the history of environmental movements in the US.
On 18 January, Tortuguita also became the first environmental activist killed by police in US history, experts said. The Georgia bureau of investigation said Tortuguita, or Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, had shot an officer first, and in recent days has produced photos of a gun and a Firearms Transaction Record that appears to be in Terán’s name. The agency charged with investigating Georgia police shootings also said ballistics evidence from the wounded officer matches the gun – and that there is no body-cam or other footage of the shooting. The arrests come on the heels of at least a year’s worth of rising public chorus from Kemp, law enforcement officials and others using the term “terrorist” to describe the protesters, even as opposition to the Cop City project has grown since Atlanta city council approved it in late 2021. Eli Bennett and Joshua Schiffer, two Atlanta attorneys representing some of the activists, both told the Guardian the state statute is “overly vague”. Four of the 18 cases brought under federal domestic terrorism charges during the 2000s were dismissed due to allegations being too vague, according to the Intercept. “It’s too easy to abuse, and I strongly have issues with how domestic terrorism is thrown around” in the state law, Schiffer said. Arrest affidavits obtained by the Guardian for seven activists arrested 18 January during the same police raid on South River forest in which Tortuguita was killed begin by alleging that the defendants were “participating in actions as part of Defend the Atlanta Forest (DTAF), a group classified by the United States Department of Homeland Security as domestic violent extremists”. But a homeland security (DHS) spokesperson responded to a query by the Guardian: “The Department of Homeland Security does not classify or designate any groups as domestic violent extremists” – adding that the agency also “regularly shares information” regarding perceived threats to the “safety and security of all communities”. Meanwhile, a White House bulletin issued early in the Biden administration underlined: “The two most lethal elements of today’s domestic terrorism threat are (1) racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race and (2) anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists, such as militia violent extremists.” Potter’s work looks at several decades of efforts by corporate leaders to create a legal and policy framework for prosecuting groups such as the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front, which in the 1990s used tactics such as vandalism and even arson to defend animals and the environment – but never harmed a person. In the mid-2000s, corporations such as Pfizer, Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline joined the United Egg Producers, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and others in pushing Congress to consider these acts “terrorism”, he writes. Broadening definitions and sentencing guidelines arising from these efforts resulted in a situation where “even writing pro-animal slogans on the sidewalk in chalk” could get you charged with terrorism, said Ryan Shapiro, co-founder of Property of the People, a national security-oriented nonprofit organization focused on transparency that has released thousands of FBI and CIA documents exposing government overreach. Similarly, Bill McKibben, author of 20 books on climate change and other subjects, wrote this week that, according to Georgia’s domestic terrorism law, “lie down in front of a police car and you’re a terrorist who could spend many many years behind bars”. Shapiro shared documents with the Guardian obtained through FOIA showing that lack of agreement on legal frameworks around terrorism inhibit DHS’s work. In one email chain between a DHS agent and a regional director from 2021, the former says: “The lack of a consistent, applicable definition of DVE [domestic violent extremism] that has been coordinated and agreed upon” is the “greatest challenge in preventing … the DVE threat”. The agent goes on to write:, “Anyone can fall into any category based on an independent interpretation of what DVE term is being implied.” The case in Georgia arises from another thread in the recent history of approaches to domestic terrorism, Shapiro noted. “The post-9/11 downward creep of national security justifications has provided local police with counterterrorism powers previously limited to the FBI and other federal agencies,” he said. An additional aspect of the ongoing conflict in Atlanta worth noting is that activists opposing both the training center and separate plans to expand a film studio on the South River Forest land approach the issue from “two of the most targeted groups” by the FBI for decades, Shapiro said. Those are the racial justice and environmental movements. The arrest affidavits appear predicated on the notion of arrestees allegedly belonging to a group that the state has linked to acts such as burning construction vehicles needed for the training facility or film studio, as well as vandalizing other property. “Language matters,” said Potter. “Terrorism and violence have meanings. It’s misleading to characterize broken windows, even arson, in the same breath as murdering people in a nightclub.” Potter pointed to other political movements throughout US and global history that have used similar tactics – including women suffragettes and gay rights activists, he said. “How we evaluate these things really depends on how we see the movements,” he said. “We’re going to look at the tactics of prior movements differently now, because they’re more mainstream.” Moving forward, another aspect of this movement may prove challenging to pursuing domestic terrorism charges due to supposed affiliation in a group, Potter noted. Opposition to development in South River forest has included neighborhood associations, established environmental groups, local schools, Atlanta-area citizens, and many others, he said. As for those who have chosen to stay in the forest, attracting the most attention of law enforcement (and media): “They don’t have an official leader. They don’t have a spokesperson. We don’t know who’s classified as a member … or not,” Potter noted. “It’s like trying to turn a political movement into a criminal organization,” Bennett said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/28/georgia-cop-city-atlanta-protests;guardian;evironment;734
4067;4067;Russia replaces general in charge of Ukraine war in latest military shake-up;2023-01-11T18:44:52Z;['Peter Beaumont', 'Pjotr Sauer'];['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Vladimir Putin'];;Russia has appointed Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, as its overall commander for the war in Ukraine, in the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscow’s military leadership during the stumbling invasion of its neighbour. In a statement on Wednesday, the defence ministry said that Gerasimov’s appointment constituted a “raising of the status of the leadership” of the military force in Ukraine and was implemented to “improve the quality … and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces”. Sergei Surovikin, a notorious general nicknamed “General Armageddon” by the Russian media, who was appointed as overall commander of the army in October, would stay on as a deputy of Gerasimov, the defence ministry said. Gerasimov, like the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has faced sharp criticism from Russia’s hawkish military bloggers for multiple setbacks on the battlefield and Moscow’s failure to secure victory in a campaign the Kremlin had expected to take just a short time. The latest change in leadership comes amid ongoing tensions between senior figures in charge of Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Tuesday evening, the head of Russian’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, lashed out against the country’s defence ministry, boasting that his combat experience was “in many ways significantly superior to those who have been in the service of the ministry of defence for decades”. Prigozhin, who has previously criticised Gerasimov and Shoigu, made his statements as he claimed his Wagner army had taken control of the small salt-mining town of Soledar. However, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mocked the claims, saying in a video address that fighting was still going on. “The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend” to have achieved some successes in Soledar, Zelensky said in his daily address, “but the fighting continues”. He said the Donetsk front was holding “and we are doing everything to strengthen the Ukrainian defence without any break, even for one day.” The claims about the status of the fighting on the eastern Donbas came as Poland announced that it planned to transfer 10 German-made Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, in a move with wide significance. Speaking on a visit to Lviv on Wednesday, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said: “A company of Leopard tanks will be handed over as part of coalition building. We want it to be an international coalition.” The transfer would require permission from Germany, which Kyiv has been pressing separately to supply Leopard 2s, perhaps suggesting a softening of Germany’s stance on the transfer of main battle tanks after recent contacts between Warsaw and Berlin. However, a German government spokesperson said it was not aware of any requests from allies to send the tanks to Ukraine. The Russian capture of Soledar and the town’s saltmines would have symbolic, military and commercial value for Moscow. But the situation in and around Soledar appeared fluid and neither claim could be independently verified. Prigozhin had released a photo showing him with a group of his fighters and a tank, which he said was taken in one of the tunnels of a saltmine in the south-west of Soledar. He also said that only units of his paramilitary company – many of them convicts who had been offered a pardon if they fought for him – had been involved in fighting for the city. Footage posted from Soledar by a Ukrainian soldier from a drone unit – identified by the call sign Maygar at 10am on Wednesday – suggested heavy clashes were continuing but Ukrainian forces were still holding positions. “This is the sound of Soledar,” he said to the background noise of constant artillery strikes. “Local fights are happening from time to time and artillery is working on both sides.” Accounts from Ukrainian soldiers on that sector of the front suggested Russia had moved Wagner fighters from Bakhmut to focus solely on the battle for Soledar. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: “Hard battles are going on to keep Soledar.” She added: “The enemy does not pay attention to the large losses of its personnel and continues to actively storm. The approaches to our positions are simply littered with the bodies of dead enemy fighters.” However, the Ukrainian military’s morning summary made only one mention of Soledar, listing it as one of several areas being shelled in the Donetsk region. A Ukrainian soldier who has been posting video updates from the Bakhmut area described the fighting in Soledar as fierce, with contested buildings changing hands multiple times and soldiers suffering frostbite. Russian forces have recently focused their efforts on the capture of Soledar as part of their ambition to take the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut and Ukraine’s larger eastern Donbas region, leading to fierce battles in sub-zero temperatures over the past five days. Seizing Soledar would be Russia’s most substantial gain since August, after a series of humiliating retreats in the second half of 2022. Russian forces have been fighting for months to capture Bakhmut. But any victory would come at a massive cost, with troops from both sides having taken heavy losses in some of the most intense combat since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago. The Kyiv government has released photos in recent days purporting to show scores of dead Russian soldiers in muddy fields. The issue of supplying tanks to Ukraine has become the centre of a frenzied round of recent diplomacy, as a number of countries have put pressure on the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to allow the supply of Leopard 2s.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/russia-replaces-general-in-charge-of-ukraine-war-in-latest-military-shake-up;guardian;politics;4067
3178;3178;Watchdog investigates charity set up by UK billionaire over £16m ski clubhouse;2023-01-16T13:23:22Z;['Rupert Neate'];['The super-rich', 'UK news', 'Business'];;"A charity set up by the UK’s richest person, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is being investigated by the Charity Commission after helping fund a £16m luxury clubhouse for an exclusive French Alps club where he and his daughter have skied for years. The Guardian can reveal that the charities watchdog has opened a “regulatory compliance case” to investigate “concerns about the governance and management of the Jim Ratcliffe Foundation”. Ratcliffe, 70, a multibillionaire tax exile who controls the petrochemicals and fracking company Ineos and is in the running to buy Manchester United, says he founded the charity to help build a new ski clubhouse in the exclusive resort of Courchevel to help underprivileged children learn to ski, and support other charitable endeavours. However, the Guardian has found that the ski club boasts that its new clubhouse is “dedicated solely to its members”. When a reporter attempted to join the club they were told “admission requirements” include being approved by two current members, and paying a £25,000 joining fee followed by annual membership fees of £6,000.
The club describes itself as “an exclusive and prestigious club which brings together its members around common passions: skiing, pleasure and the art of living”. Ratcliffe’s use of a UK charity to fund what appears to be a largely exclusive private members’ club raises questions about whether charitable funds have been used to fulfil its aim of providing a public benefit to a wide audience – or to support the hobby of one of the world’s richest people. A Charity Commission spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have opened a regulatory compliance case to assess potential concerns about the governance and management of the Jim Ratcliffe Foundation, and are engaging with the charity’s trustees on these matters.” The watchdog opened the case after questions from the Guardian about the charity’s work and governance. Launching a regulatory compliance case is not in itself a finding of wrongdoing but it could lead to a statutory inquiry. The commission said it could not comment further. The charity watchdog’s rules state that open membership is “essential” if a community amateur sports club is to meet the requirements of providing public benefit that applies to all charities. It has specifically proscribed sports clubs that have “restricted membership” from registering as community amateur sports club (CASC) charities.
A spokesperson for Ratcliffe said any suggestion that the Jim Ratcliffe Foundation was acting improperly or that the clubhouse was not operating in the benefit of the public was “both defamatory and wrong”. However, the spokesperson repeatedly declined to answer detailed questions put to them by the Guardian over several months, and did not explain what was “wrong” with the allegations. “Ineos completely rejects the allegations relating to the Jim Ratcliffe Foundation made by the Guardian newspaper,” the spokesperson said. “The JRF exists to promote the health and wellbeing of young people, improving the life chances of children and supporting wildlife conservation. “As part of these charitable activities, the JRF has donated money to the Club des Sports de Courchevel, a local charitable endeavour, to build a new clubhouse and training facilities.” Ratcliffe’s spokesperson said profits from the clubhouse help pay towards “the subsidy of more than 250 local children that now have access to world class training facilities throughout the year”. They pay €350 (£311) a season to train at the club, which they said was much lower than €1,000-a-season cost at other resorts. The spokesperson for Ratcliffe – a British tax exile with an estimated fortune of more than $15.5bn (£12.6bn) making him the richest living Briton, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index – also rejected suggestions that the clubhouse is private and said the members-only area “makes up less than 4% of the space of the building”. The charity, which Ratcliffe registered with the Charity Commission in 2019, said in filings that its “focus and initial target” was “creating a long-term partnership with an endowment fund in France whose express aim is in encouraging ‘healthy recreation, by developing the practice of skiing and any other similar physical and sporting activity to reach a wider public audience’, by the promotion of facilities to further these activities”. It added: “The purpose of the project being undertaken is supporting the building of a new clubhouse for Club des Sports Courchevel, which furthers a key objective of the charity, being to promote amateur sport. The significant investment in this project over an extended period of time will be in the interests of the general public.” Ratcliffe’s teenage daughter competes at Club des Sports de Courchevel. Ratcliffe owns a luxury chalet and the four-star Portetta hotel in the resort. Prospective members of the clubhouse are told that they can take advantage of a tax break on their fees, based on the club’s “mission” to help young people. “Due to the intrinsic mission of the Courchevel Ski Club, members can benefit from a tax deductibility,” they are told.
The charity is registered at the Hampshire address of Ineos Capital, part of Ratcliffe’s multibillion pound petrochemicals and fracking empire. It lists three trustees with the regulator, all of whom work for Ineos. The Charity Commission advises trustees to “avoid putting yourself in a position where your duty to your charity conflicts with your personal interests or loyalty to any other person or body”. The new clubhouse, which was opened with a glitzy champagne ceremony in 2021, has been renamed “the Ineos Club House” after the company Ratcliffe founded in 1998, which now generates annual revenue of more than $65bn. Accounts filed with the Charity Commission show that Ratcliffe personally donated £18.4m to his charity in 2021 and was the only donor. The charity then claimed another £7.4m in gift aid from the tax authorities, taking the total to £25.9m. His charity donated a total of £11.2m to the French endowment fund to support the construction of the new Ineos clubhouse. Accounts state that gift aid was not claimed on “restricted funds” that went to the French charity. HMRC charity guidelines raise concerns about buildings being renamed after donors. “The naming of the building or part of the building needs to be unsolicited and not expected in return for the donation,” they state. Ratcliffe’s spokesperson said the clubhouse was renamed in honour of Ineos because “the business has spent a total of £3,116,906.72 helping build it and sponsoring it”. Bruno Tuaire, the general manager of the club, has said Ratcliffe has been “a regular at the resort for 15 years” and “a partner for eight years”. Announcing the donation to local media in April 2019, Tuaire said: “This donation is not a surprise. Everything was organised with Mr Ratcliffe. His initial wish was to make us financially independent.” Didier Barioz, the president of the Club des Sports de Courchevel, said: “The aim of the whole building is to enable the Club des Sports de Courchevel to become financially self-sufficient: all the benefits made from the building with the restaurant or the ski club go directly for the training of the children.”";https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/16/watchdog-investigates-charity-set-up-by-uk-billionaire-jim-ratcliffe-over-16m-ski-clubhouse;guardian;business & economy;3178
1160;1160;Football transfer rumours: Onana out and Arnautovic in at Everton?;2023-01-26T09:07:21Z;['Will Unwin'];['Football', 'Sport'];;"Leeds want to add to their American brigade at Elland Road. Their head coach, Jesse Marsch, already has compatriots Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams on his roster, but is hoping he can lure Weston McKennie. The club have made a £24.6m bid for the Juventus midfielder, but the Italians are hoping for another £6m if they are to send McKennie on his way to the Premier League. The arrival of Arnaut Danjuma at Spurs could mean the end of the road for Bryan Gil. The Spanish winger has shown glimpses of his quality in the Premier League recently but looks unlikely to be a regular. La Liga clubs are said to be circling. It might not be the only knock-on exit at Tottenham, with Djed Spence being allowed to leave on loan because Pedro Porro looks set to join from Sporting.
Another right-back with options to consider is Brighton’s Tariq Lamptey, who could be targeted by Sporting. He has struggled to find a place in the team under Roberto De Zerbi. Lyon are supposedly one club tracking the Ghanaian international. One player who could arrive at the Amex is Mykola Matviyenko after Brighton made an improved bid for the Ukrainian centre-back of £14m, but Shakhtar Donetsk are holding out for £20m. The defender previously played under De Zerbi in Ukraine, which could help seal the deal. Newcastle fear being priced out of the market for Everton’s Anthony Gordon, forcing them to turn their attentions to the Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech. The Moroccan, however, could end up at Goodison Park as a replacement for Gordon who is destined for the Everton exit door. It’s just one big merry-go-round. In what feels like Chelsea’s very own transfer window, the latest player on their radar is Amadou Onana of Everton, because a deal for Benfica’s Enzo Fernández looks a long way off and one for Brighton’s Moisés Caicedo looks at non-starter at this stage. If Everton are to appease fans with a big-name signing while everything else falls apart around them, then there is only one man for the job: Marko Arnautovic. The Bologna striker was weirdly considered by Manchester United last summer but could finally be on the move back to England. Plenty of clubs are looking at Manchester City full-back João Cancelo, who is a little irked by his recent lack of playing time under Pep Guardiola. Milan are keeping an eye on the Portuguese defender in case he is available in the summer. Nathan Jones has returned to former club Luton to snap up right-back James Bree for Southampton. The two clubs have agreed a fee for the defender, who previously had a spell with Aston Villa. And Nottingham Forest are aiming to add to their midfield ranks with Internazionale’s Italy international Roberto Gagliardini. The player’s contract expires in the summer and it looks highly unlikely he will be offered new terms, allowing Forest to potentially get a January deal.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/26/football-transfer-rumours-onana-out-and-arnautovic-in-at-everton;guardian;sports;1160
2592;2592;‘Obi understands’: young Nigerians swell support of presidential hopeful;2023-01-19T08:00:04Z;['N/A'];['Nigeria', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Governance'];;"At a recent campaign stop, Peter Obi responded to a regular criticism. Bola Tinubu, a rival candidate in next month’s presidential elections in Nigeria, had called him stingy. Obi told a crowd of supporters that yes, he has been stingy with public funds, and that made him a better fit for the country’s top job. Nigerians go to the polls on 25 February to choose a replacement for Muhammadu Buhari, whose eight-year rule has been sharply criticised for failing to get to grips with rampant insecurity and a cost of living crisis. A former state governor running for the Labour party, Obi is the first third-party candidate to present a real challenge to the dominance of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its main opposition, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), since the end of military dictatorship in 1999. The 61-year-old has appealed to younger voters with a message that he is different from his old-guard rivals and wants to bring real change to Nigeria. Weyimi Lube, a voiceover artist, had just turned 24 when terrorists struck a Catholic church in the southern city of Owo in June last year, killing at least 40 worshippers. She said the trauma of the attack pushed her into Obi’s camp. “I told myself if we don’t push hard for Obi, I don’t think there will be a Nigeria in the future for me and the people I care about,” Lube said. Analysts say some younger people have turned towards Obi out of a sense of desperation with the status quo in Nigeria and continued anger over the brutal suppression two years ago of the #EndSars movement – named after a hated police unit – which demanded better governance. “The youth are disillusioned with the APC and PDP. Their hopes have been squandered,” said Stephen Lafenwa, a senior lecturer at the department of political science at the University of Ibadan. Obi is no stranger to presidential elections. In the 2019 vote he ran as the vice-presidential candidate for the PDP, whose losing presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar is running again this year. Last year Obi challenged Abubakar to be the PDP’s candidate but resigned just before the primaries and moved to the formerly fringe Labour party, where his grassroots campaign touting his experience as governor and his outsider status has gained momentum, with a vibrant social media following.
“It is really interesting because we now get to see competition beyond the two parties [and] we have an expansion of choice,” said Dengiyefa Angalapu, a research analyst at the Centre for Democracy and Development. “It is no longer a situation of the devil and the deep blue sea, now it is the devil, deep blue sea and perhaps the Red Sea.” Despite the excitement around Obi’s candidature, he faces an uphill battle against Abubakar and Tinubu, a two-term governor of Lagos state and veteran of Nigerian politics running for the ruling APC. Known as the “godfather of Lagos” for his political clout, Tinubu will benefit from the ruling party’s national network. Whoever wins will have to grapple with a dire economic outlook – record inflation is running at 21.47% and the naira’s value has rapidly depreciated – and an insecurity crisis that has seen a proliferation of terror attacks and attacks for ransom around the country. “Nigeria is on the brink,” said Chinua Ubabuko, a recently graduated university student and Obi supporter. “Ethnic militias have become forces to reckon with in basically every part of the country and so it is a no-brainer that the next president must be one who can attack the situation and bring peace.” Security forces are fighting a 13-year-old war against jihadists in the country’s north-east, bandit militias in the north-west and separatist tensions in the country’s south-east. Gunmen have repeatedly targeted local offices of the independent national electoral commission, known as INEC, which has warned that it may have to cancel or postpone the vote. Several online polls have placed Obi as the likely winner, but they are being treated with extreme caution by observers, who say their results have been skewed by the youthful profile of Obi voters.
Experts say displacing the APC and PDP would be nothing short of revolutionary, but that regardless of the final result, Obi’s candidature for the Labour party will leave a mark by showing a serious challenge to the big two’s dominance is possible. “[Previously] when we had those third forces, the people did not have trust in them. As soon as they [candidates] become strong, they join the ruling party. In Obi, they see someone who is willing to fight until the end,” Angalapu said. Another possibility is that Obi will take enough votes to prevent Abubakar or Tinubu winning in the first round, which requires a simple majority of all votes and 25% of votes in at least two-thirds of the country’s 36 states.

5301;5301;Boris Johnson allies behind bid to ‘take back control’ of Tory party;2023-01-04T15:38:17Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;"The former Conservative treasurer Peter Cruddas, a key ally of Boris Johnson, is set to launch a Momentum-style grassroots campaign to overhaul party democracy. The movement – Conservative Democratic Organisation – will have Lord Cruddas as president and aims to give members full say over candidate selections “with minimum interference by CCHQ [Conservative campaign headquarters]”, including the power to deselect MPs. The move has been endorsed by the former home secretary Priti Patel, who is also close to the former prime minister. Its vice-president is Stephen Greenhalgh, a former deputy mayor and minister in the Lords under Johnson. Another key Johnson backer, David Campbell Bannerman, a former MEP, will be its chair. Both Cruddas and Campbell Bannerman ran the campaign and petition to put Johnson on the ballot paper for the summer Tory leadership contest, which attracted grassroots support but was unsuccessful. In the announcement of the group’s formation on the Conservative Post website, it said “many of us are fed up with having leftwing candidates and a leftwing agenda imposed on us from above – we are in the Conservative party, not Labour, for a reason”. The CDO proposes a radical overhaul of party conferences, the role of CCHQ, party chairs and the selection and removal of MPs – strikingly similar aims to those of the campaigning group Momentum that emerged under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party Efforts to strengthen Conservative party democracy have been mostly rebuffed by senior Tory politicians, though there has been a growing frustration in the grassroots compounded by the removal of Liz Truss as prime minister after she was backed by members, replaced by Rishi Sunak without a members’ vote. The group will demand senior figures in the party, including party chairman and the chair of its policy forum should be democratically elected. It will also demand constituency associations should have the right “to select, and if necessary, deselect their MP”. It said: “Reforming candidate selections to put associations back in charge would reduce or eliminate the current dangerously unstable gulf between members’ views and those of their MP representatives, such as the variance over Brexit, and low taxes.” The group proposes reducing the role of CCHQ to grading candidates on their ability and core beliefs. “The centralising and controlling direction of Central Office would be ended; which has led to many MPs being selected who are not genuine Conservatives, do not have the necessary skills or commitment, and have insufficient loyalty to the party,” the group said. “This has manifested itself in the appalling behaviour of some current Conservative MPs, and previous ones who were stripped of the whip, and who are the root cause of political instability at present.” Another key proposal will be changing the voting system for party leaders, including setting a threshold of 15% of MPs in order to stand as a candidate. It will also campaign for a bigger role for party conferences “with the membership back in control” and to allow member debates after ministerial speeches – similar to how Labour and Lib Dem conferences are run. This year’s Conservative conference had just two hour slots of speeches, with no debate or contribution from members. In a statement endorsing the campaign, which is expected to hold a conference later this year, Patel said: “Our grassroots are the heart and soul of our party. They are our greatest assets and advocates and they should never be taken for granted. “Party members are committed to our values of freedom, enterprise and opportunity and we need to empower them to have more say over our policies and candidates. That will make us stronger, more successful in government, and boost our membership numbers.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/04/boris-johnson-allies-behind-bid-to-take-back-control-of-tory-party;guardian;politics;5301
6149;6149;The last dance? Bosses fear for future as 'perfect storm' sees third of nightclubs close;Monday 2 January 2023 16:23, UK;['claire gregory', '@claireskynews'];['music'];['nightclubs', 'sees', 'future', 'perfect', 'clubs', 'dance', 'close', 'different', 'things', 'economy', 'nighttime', 'lose', 'storm', 'really', 'bosses', 'music', 'fear', 'told', 'going'];"Christmas and New Year party season is one of the most lucrative times of the year for nightclubs.

But post-COVID pandemic many are continuing to struggle, with a third now being forced to close.

Those still open say a perfect storm is making it extremely difficult to operate.

Yuval Hen, founder of E1 nightclub in London, told Sky News he sometimes feels like a ""punching bag"".

""We need to please a lot of different authorities, from police, council, the local community, the residents, the customers, the agents, the management - so many different bodies and they are all pulling in a different direction,"" he said.

""It's a constant battle, and now recently, after two years of COVID, where we were hoping for a big comeback of having fun, of parties, of bringing back our businesses to pay back our big loans that we were taking during COVID, we thought 'this is our time' and the economy [has] again gone.""

""And we have the living crisis started and the war in Russia and Ukraine and yeah, everything hit us so hard at the same time.""

The night-time culture economy brings in £36.4bn - and also provides 425,000 jobs across the UK.

It's also an essential part of the music industry's eco-system, with even those at the top of their careers concerned by the impacts of closures.

Multi-award-winning singer-songwriter Craig David told Sky News clubs were an essential part of the machine that got him to where he is today.

""Grassroots is where I started my music, so I was in those clubs, I was in the social club practising and DJing,"" he said.

""So for me working my way up from a young kid with aspirations and dreams to actually being able to perform, grassroots, the clubs are everything to me.

""I really hope that that maintains the same - there has to be balance. I know people want to change things, they want to update, they want to build new things and things move on but there has to be balance, because you can't lose at the same time.""

Clubbers will also lose out as venues close their doors permanently, as they have provided a home for parts of British culture - and counterculture - for decades.

Image: An empty nightclub

If clubs are left empty it will not just leave a hole in the industry but could also force music lovers underground.

Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said: ""The worry that we have with everything is as we start to lose clubs and things like counterculture, electronic music, etc. If there are no spaces or platforms for people to perform, then they will find spaces for people to perform.

""We saw that in the late 80s when the freedom to dance movement came out and people decided that they weren't willing to allow their nights to end in line with where that current government was asking the terminal hour to be.

""They went out and there were underground raves, that really sort of were counterproductive for government, for policing and when you talk about costs to operate the night-time economy, that really put so much pressure on everybody because it exploded at that period.""

Image: Club 49 in Soho

""What we're concerned about is we're going to get to a point where clubs are going to be lost at such a level that people are just going to decide to start looking at other sites and places which are unregulated, potentially don't have the safety protocols in place, the licences, the security...

""And that's where there is a real fear.""

There are calls for the government to help the night-time economy by freezing alcohol duty, or helping with VAT bills, as without support it will be the last dance for many nightclubs.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230102164710/http://news.sky.com/story/the-last-dance-bosses-fear-for-future-as-perfect-storm-sees-third-of-nightclubs-close-12772099;skynews;entertainment & culture;240
8296;8296;George Santos: The truth about Republican 'fraud' and what does the future hold for him?;Wednesday 25 January 2023 14:22, UK;['olive enokido-lineham', '@olivelineham'];['congress'];['mr', 'george', 'future', 'fraud', 'truth', 'santos', 'told', 'santoss', 'claims', 'lies', 'republican', 'hold', 'jewish', 'does', 'york', 'republicans'];"'George, can you physically not stop lying?'

That was Saturday Night Live's take on the latest in the scandal surrounding US congressman George Santos.

The US politician is at the centre of a web of extraordinary revelations and accusations covering everything from his heritage to jobs he simply never held.

Described by critics as a ""total fraud"", he is accused of fabricating parts of his resume while running for Congress. While he denies some of the allegations made against him, he has admitted that some of his claims were lies.

Despite the media furore, currently only a ""handful"" of his fellow Republicans are calling for him to go. Speaking to Sky News, a political strategist attributes his behaviour to the ""Trump effect"".

Here's a round-up of Mr Santos's claims, how we got here and what could happen next to the controversial congressman.

Who is George Santos?

It's a seemingly simple question, but one that is becoming increasingly difficult to get a straight answer to. Here is what we know for sure.

Image: George Santos has admitted he lied about working on Wall Street

The Brazilian-American, 34, was elected to represent New York's 3rd Congressional District in November 2022, becoming the first openly gay Republican to win a House seat as a non-incumbent.

While his victory caused a buzz around Capitol Hill, it was soon dimmed by allegations starting in December over his resume.

A New York Times investigation found a number of false claims Mr Santos made on his resume including lies over his education and previous jobs.

From there, it's all unravelled.

His responses have varied too. He has admitted that some were lies, rejected others and has backtracked on a few too.

He's 'Jew-ish' not Jewish

Mr Santos has made conflicting remarks over being Jewish, taking part in a drag performance in Brazil and the circumstances around his mother's death.

So let's start with his heritage.

After his victory, he told the Republican Jewish Coalition summit, the election meant that ""now there will be three"" Jewish Republican members of Congress.

But then afterwards, he backtracked and told the New York Post he ""never claimed to be Jewish"", and said he was Catholic adding: ""Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was 'Jew-ish'.""

He said 9/11 'claimed his mother's life' - records show she wasn't in the country

It's also quite confusing when you take a look at the conflicting reports over the death of Mr Santos's mother, Fatima Caruso Devolder.

While running for Congress in 2021, Mr Santos tweeted that the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York ""claimed his mother's life"".

Yet on his campaign website, Mr Santos said his mother was in her office in the South Tower on the day of the terrorist attack but ""survived"" and died ""a few years"" later from cancer.

However, records obtained by Sky's affiliate NBC News and reports by the Washington Post citing immigration records, suggested Ms Devolder had not even been living in the US at the time of the attack and was in fact living in Rio de Janeiro.

He has not publicly commented on that since.

'Sue me for having a life'

Now on to one of the latest claims about the congressman's performance at a drag show.

A Brazilian performer, who uses the drag name Eula Rochard, told Reuters she befriended the now-congressman in 2005 in Brazil.

She said in 2008, he competed in a drag beauty pageant in Rio using the drag name Kitara Ravache.

While the congressman first called the reports ""categorically false"" on Twitter, when confronted on camera, he told US channel ABC7 - ""I was young and I had fun at a festival - sue me for having a life.""

The Trump effect

Political strategist Rina Shah said only a ""handful"" of Republicans are calling for Mr Santos's resignation and his behaviour echoes the ""Trump effect"".

The former senior staffer to two Republican Congress members described him as a ""conman"".

She told Sky News: ""The situation certainly highlights the Donald Trump effect. The impact of the 45th President, a real style of running to just regularly make claims to be boastful in a way of things that were simply not true and proven to be untrue.""

She added that Mr Santos has ""taken on"" that style ""in a defiant manner that says 'come and get me because even if you try to get me, I'll just continue to lie about it'.""

Despite the lies, Ms Shah said no top Republican will take action against him because they ""cannot afford to lose"" his House seat.

The Republicans won a razor-thin majority in the House following the midterms and she warned that Mr Santos's removal could endanger the seat.

He didn't work on Wall Street

While the long list of accusations against Mr Santos grows, he has admitted to lying about some things.

Mr Santos claimed on his campaign website he had a finance career working at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs - but the NYT investigation found neither institution had any record of his employment.

He admitted to lying about his education and the roles at the two firms and told the New York Post - ""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry.""

Stealing from a disabled veteran

But there are some cases where Mr Santos has flat-out denied certain claims.

He denied an accusation by veteran Richard Osthoff, who accused him of scamming him of $3,000 from a GoFundMe campaign page raised for his dying service dog in 2016.

Mr Osthoff told the news site Patch that he was told Anthony Devolder, one of the names Mr Santos used before entering politics, had a pet charity called Friends of Pets United.

He claimed Mr Devolder closed the page and disappeared after the funds were raised. Mr Santos has angrily denied the reports and called them ""shocking and insane"".

What makes his 'lies' different?

While some may say lying in politics is not new, one psychologist specialising in lying and deception research explains why Mr Santos's claims and accusations may seem a little different.

Dr Chris Hart, a psychology professor at Texas Woman's University, told Sky News: ""If we look at the lies most politicians tell they're often exaggerations and half-truths. They rarely lie in such a way that they are making a claim which has absolutely no basis in reality and that's where he is different.

""The frequency with which he appears to tell them is a bit surprising compared to other politicians.""

'I will NOT resign'

Revelations about Mr Santos's lies and the allegations against him have caused anger among Democrats who have described him as a ""total fraud"" and are calling for him to resign.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he is a ""complete and total fraud"" and he ""deceived and connived his way into Congress"".

Despite calls from some Republicans and Democrats, Mr Santos has repeatedly refused to resign.

For now, it seems he has no intention to go anywhere.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125150207/http://news.sky.com/story/george-santos-the-truth-about-republican-fraud-and-what-does-the-future-hold-for-him-12793631;skynews;politics;2387
623;623;Supawan Thai, London: ‘Takes your mouth on the ride of its life’ – restaurant review;2023-01-29T06:00:41Z;['Jay Rayner'];['Thai food and drink', 'Food', 'Restaurants'];;"Supawan, 38 Caledonian Road, London N1 9DT (020 7278 2888). Small plates £9-£11.50, mains £15.50-£24.50, desserts £5.50-£9.50, wines from £26.50 My late father, Des, had many talents. Early on he was an actor, part of Anthony Quayle’s original company at Stratford, the precursor to the RSC. He also worked on the very first TV series of Hancock’s Half Hour. He was a gifted artist who was exhibited in all the good places and he was blessed with the sharpest of commercial brains. He was a natty dresser. But boy, was he a lousy cook. Ingredients would beg to be taken to a place of safety when he approached. Vegetables would audibly start praying. I don’t think it was a lack of ability. He simply wasn’t interested. If he was left to feed us kids, his default dish – I use the term loosely – was worsht and eggs: a bouncy, dry, draught excluder of an omelette alongside slices of a blunt, salty kosher beef salami, dyed a worrying shade of red, which stained everything it touched pink including, I imagine, the lower intestine. It was the taste of parental abandonment, at least where dinner time was concerned. Chef Wichet Khongphoon of Supawan, in London’s King’s Cross, was differently blessed. For in the middle of his menu headed “Southern Thai Food”, is a dish entitled Dad’s Beef Curry. I really would not have traded my old man for anyone, but perhaps I can be forgiven for fantasising about a little light fostering by Khongphoon’s father, if it meant I would have been treated occasionally to this thrillingly intense stew of long-braised meat in a thick coconut sauce the colour of newly turned London clay. It both soothes and playfully slaps. There is heat, emphasised by vivid slices of fresh red chilli, but all of it is tempered by sweet caramel tones. There is the depth and fragrance of roasted spice. It is all kinds of fabulous. I can see why the recipe, a loving call back to the domestic, made the cut.
The interior of Supawan is a bright, candy-coloured space, its walls hung with cheery slabs of contemporary art. There’s no stage-set of ornate Thai wood carvings here. They let the cooking tell you where you are. From the outside, however, it’s an unassuming-looking spot; the sort an innocent traveller might tumble into fresh off the train, when hunting for something to eat, only to have their mouth taken on the ride of its life. It was recommended to me by a reader. They said it served Thai dishes they had not encountered before and that I might like it. With train strikes making out-of-London travel tricky, I decided to follow my reader’s advice. My reader was wise. They often are. We have a bowl of sweet, sticky cashew nuts crusted with chilli and black pepper and served still warm, to pick at while we study the relatively short menu. Yes, it includes a familiar pad Thai and a green curry. Order instead the things you have not stumbled across before. If you’re a meat eater, start with the chicken wings. Blink at what is laid before you. They are battered and crispy in the southern-fried style and seriously chunky. Bite in to discover they are boned out and stuffed with a briskly spiced forcemeat of minced chicken, prawns, mushrooms and, for texture, glass noodles. Drag them through the lake of the lip-spanking tamarind and chilli sauce that lies beneath. If you’re with a friend, mourn the fact that good manners demand you let them have the other one. Or weigh up whether the friendship really means that much to you. Conclude it doesn’t in the face of this chicken wing, and nick it.
From the non-meat side of the ledger, order the laab aubergine, a huge multilayered extravaganza of texture, and of sweet and sour and hot and salty. It’s a dish not merely to be eaten, but to be explored. The aubergine has been roasted until soft and almost creamy. It has then been piled under drifts of fresh mint, ground crunchy rice, dried chillies and shallots, both fresh and crispy. All of this is dressed with a tamarind and palm sugar sauce. Freshen up after that boom and clash with a knotty tangle of lawn-green morning glory stir-fried with chillies and garlic. To one side of the menu there’s the offer of “side salads”. These are side salads, much as Barbra Streisand is a backing singer; in the way Laurence Olivier was a spear carrier. Our Yum Hoa Plee banana flower salad tap dances out into the limelight. The ingredients are stacked into the canoe embrace of a purple and white petal. We never quite get to it, enthralled as we are by the tumbled filling of prawns, roasted coconut, shallots, cashew nuts and mint dressed with coconut milk and more tamarind. They do like their tamarind here.
Our table is completed by a stir-fry of prawns, squid and mussels, with wild ginger, green peppercorns, chillies, green beans and Thai holy basil. After we’ve sucked the last mussels from the last shells, we take to spooning away the broth, which is intense and seafood sweet and restorative. A word of advice: take note of the menu’s dot system for chilli heat. Nothing is as fierce and uncompromising as Thai food when it’s got its big boots on. The “three dot” dishes here really will make the sweat pool beneath your eyes and your tongue vibrate. Both this seafood stir-fry and the beef curry carry three dots. It’s good to be warned. Soothe all that with a scoop of their salted coconut caramel ice-cream with peanut brittle or perhaps their citrus-sharp makrut lime sorbet (listed on the menu as Kaffir lime, a term which, for good reason, is increasingly frowned upon). Supawan feels to me like a find, though on this Friday evening it has definitely very much been found. In a city where the pursuit of the next new dining experience can feel overheated and performative, it was joyous to be in a noisy room full of people just, y’know, having dinner with their mates, perhaps at the shiny communal table to one side, because that’s a nice way to end the week. With almost all dishes topping out in the mid-teens they know it will not ruin them. Start with a cocktail of galangal-infused gin, lemongrass syrup, Cointreau and bird’s eye chillies, accordingly marked by three heat dots. Finish with a Thai iced milk tea, which really isn’t. Raise either glass to Chef Wichet Khongphoon. And, of course, to his old dad. New bites The Israeli bakery and café group Roladin has opened what it says is London’s first “Donutelier”. Or, as people who don’t feel the need to invent irritating words would call it, a donut shop. It’s located on London’s Charing Cross Road and sells donuts in a variety of flavours including chocolate pretzel, dulcey peanut caramel and passion coconut (donutelier.co.uk). Chef Mark Poynton of The Shepherds in Cambridge is to open a new venture inside Caistor Hall, a country house hotel just outside Norwich. Mark Poynton at Caistor Hall will be open for lunch and dinner from Wednesday to Saturday only and will offer a five- and nine-course tasting menu, with only the £90 longer version available at night. Apparently, the dishes will be “flavour driven”, which is obviously far better than dishes driven by something other than flavour. The head chef will be Byron Franklin, currently at The Shepherd’s (mjpatcaistorhall.co.uk). Pasta delivery company Pasta Evangelists has announced plans for 800 takeaway units across the UK, with the intention to cover all major UK cities by the middle of this year. The company, which was sold to Barilla in 2021, has previously partnered with Deliveroo, but now has its own delivery operation offering a selection of dishes including beef shin and Barolo ragu, salmon carbonara and truffle mac and cheese. There are now 30 takeaway units in London, with others in Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol (pastaevangelists.com).

5831;5831;Russia launches fresh strikes on Ukraine as Zelenskiy delivers new year message of hope;2023-01-01T12:58:45Z;['Dan Sabbagh'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Vladimir Putin'];;"Ukraine was targeted by a fresh wave of strikes overnight as Russia’s attack on the country continued into a second year and embattled President Zelenskiy said in a new year’s message that he hoped for victory. Blasts were heard in Kyiv after midnight as people celebrated the new year indoors, but the destruction in the capital appears to have been limited to two cases of rocket debris falling on the city, damaging a car in the city centre. Three others were reported dead around the country, after attacks on Kherson, where a children’s hospital was also hit, in Khmelnytsky in the west of the country and in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. The country’s air force said it had successfully shot down 45 Iranian-designed Shahed drones either side of midnight, one of which had the message “Happy New Year” handwritten on its tailfin, according to a photo released by Ukraine’s police. Celebrations of the new year were limited by the curfew that is in force from 11pm in Kyiv and many other cities, although some in the capital shouted from their balconies: “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes!”
No casualties have been reported, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said in a lunchtime update on Sunday, but he described the night as “restless”. The damaged car was in the Shevchenkivskyi district, he added. All 32 of the drones launched after midnight were destroyed, Kyiv’s military administration said. However, an infrastructure site was damaged in the surrounding region, the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said.
The attacks came minutes after Zelenskiy delivered his first wartime new year address, with no end in sight to the war, more than 10 months since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Ukrainian leader said 2022 had “struck out our hearts” and described a period of great emotion: “We cried out all the tears. All the prayers were yelled; 311 days. We have something to say about every minute. But most words are superfluous. No explanation needed. Silence is needed to hear. Pauses are needed to realise.” Zelenskiy said he hoped the new year would bring a successful conclusion to the fighting, and peace to the country. “We don’t know for sure what 2023 will bring us. I want to wish all of us one thing – victory. And that’s the main thing. “Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers – to their families. Prisoners – to their homes. Emigrants – to their Ukraine. The return of our lands. And the temporarily occupied will become forever free. “Return to normal life. To happy moments without curfew. To earthly joys without airstrike alerts. The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children, the peaceful old age of our parents. “May the new year bring it all. We’re ready to fight for it. That’s why each of us is here. I’m here, we’re here, you’re here – everyone’s here. We’re all Ukraine.” Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting, although accurate figures are hard to come by in a conflict that has so far left Russia occupying a territory in the east and south of Ukraine roughly the size of Portugal. Earlier, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, released a new year video message in which he said his country was fighting in Ukraine to protect its “motherland”, and to secure “true independence”. In the nine-minute message aired on Russian state television – the longest such address of his two-decade rule – Putin blamed the west for provoking the war and attempting to “weaken and split Russia”. Standing in front of a group of men and women in military fatigues, Putin sought to justify the invasion. He said: “It was a year of difficult but necessary decisions, of important steps towards Russia’s full sovereignty and a powerful consolidation of our society. The speech was dominated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin lauded all the country’s servicemen fighting there as heroes, and argued the war was necessary to protect people in areas once ruled by Moscow.
“This is what we are fighting for today, protecting our people in our historical territories in the new regions of the Russian Federation. Together, we are building and creating,” the president said. Russia also fired more than 20 cruise missiles at targets across on Ukraine earlier on Saturday in what Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, called “terror on New Year’s Eve”. Saturday’s attack – Moscow’s second missile strike in three days – badly damaged a hotel south of Kyiv’s centre and a residential building in another district. A Japanese journalist was among the wounded and taken to hospital, Klitschko said. Separately, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the southern Russian region of Belgorod, bordering Ukraine, said that as a result of overnight shelling of the outskirts of Shebekino town there had been damage to houses, but no casualties.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/ukraine-zelenskiy-delivers-new-year-hope-of-victory-as-russia-launches-fresh-strikes;guardian;politics;5831
945;945;EFL urges Premier League to halve financial gap with Championship;2023-01-27T08:00:45Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Football League', 'Football politics', 'Championship', 'Premier League', 'Sport', 'Football'];;"The EFL is asking the Premier League to halve the financial gap between the top flight and the Championship as part of negotiations over a new settlement for English football. As the government revealed that the long-awaited white paper on an independent regulator is due to be put before parliament in a fortnight, the EFL and Premier League continue to wrangle over the details of a deal that would see more money move down the football pyramid.
The EFL has long called for the Premier League to share 25% of its TV revenue with its 72 clubs, but has met with strong resistance and recently wrote to clubs saying it was “not hopeful” of achieving such a goal. Although the EFL has not dropped its ambition, nor its hopes of greater funding for League One and League Two clubs to make them financially sustainable, the emphasis now appears to be on reducing the financial difference between the top tier and the Championship. Last season Norwich City earned £100m for finishing 20th in the Premier League and Fulham earned about £10m by winning the Championship. Halving this gap would be something closer what the Premier League could agree to, with the league having long said it was open to discussions about reducing the “cliff edge” between the tiers, but without funding what it considers the excessive spending of Championship clubs. Other possible areas of agreement include the introduction of merit payments in the EFL similar to the way prize money is distributed in the Premier League, as well as cost controls to ensure additional money does not drive inflation in wages and transfer fees. The abolition of the controversial parachute payment system may also be on the table. The EFL chairman, Rick Parry, said: “It remains the EFL’s aim to halve the financial gap between the Premier League and the EFL. Doing so would make clubs financially sustainable in a thriving and competitive pyramid. “English football now has the opportunity to make the changes required to fix the imbalance – the money is in the game, but a redistribution solution is not. As we have maintained throughout, a combination of redistribution and regulation is required to make clubs solvent and in order protect them in the long term.” In the House of Commons on Thursday the sports minister, Stuart Andrew, said discussions between the two parties had been progressing “rapidly” in recent weeks. “We have had extensive engagement with both the EFL and the Premier League, encouraging them to get on with the negotiations,” he said. “Sometimes they have progressed and sometimes they have stalled, but I am pleased to say that they have been progressing somewhat more rapidly in recent weeks – I think the prospect of the coming white paper may have encouraged that – and we hope they will come up with a solution that will bring financial stability to the whole of the pyramid.” The culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, confirmed to the house that the white paper was close, but urged the EFL and Premier League to reach a settlement. “We will publish the white paper in two weeks’ time,” she said, “[but] it is clear that football does not need to wait for the government to act.

7479;7479;Paperchase lines up administrators amid search for buyer;Tuesday 17 January 2023 11:45, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];['retail'];['plan', 'lines', 'administration', 'retail', 'search', 'firm', 'stores', 'chain', 'paperchase', 'administrators', 'buyer', 'curtis', 'potential', 'prepack', 'amid'];"The high street stationery chain Paperchase is lining up administrators amid a race to find new backers.

Sky News has learnt that the retailer has put Begbies Traynor, the professional services firm, on standby to handle a potential insolvency.

City sources said that Paperchase was continuing to seek a solvent rescue deal, and that Begbies' prospective role represented ""sensible contingency planning"" in the event that one did not materialise.

A further pre-pack administration was now increasingly likely, they added.

Earlier this month, Sky News revealed that Paperchase had been put up for sale just four months after its latest change of ownership.

The chain was taken over in August by Steve Curtis, an experienced retail investor who has been involved with Tie Rack and Jigsaw.

It is now being auctioned by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the accountancy firm.

Retail Realisation, an industry advisory firm with which Mr Curtis and turnaround firm Rcapital are affiliated, was also involved in last summer's deal.

Paperchase had previously been one of the numerous retail casualties of COVID-19, having undergone a pre-pack administration in January 2021.

It trades from about 100 stores, and Mr Curtis was said at the time of the most recent takeover to be backing an existing management plan to grow that number to approximately 150 in the coming years.

Permira Credit, the previous owner, had invested in Paperchase's digital offering as well as new shop openings and executive recruitment since its brush with administration.

At the time of its last brush with insolvency, Paperchase employed nearly 1300 people, and traded from more than 125 sites across the UK.

Its outlets included concessions at House of Fraser, Selfridges and a number of Next stores.

It was unclear on Tuesday how many stores and jobs might be put at risk by another administration process.

The plan to grow the chain by 50% was a bold bet on the potential of the Paperchase brand and business model given the challenging economic backdrop.

Paperchase was one of dozens of prominent retailers which crashed into insolvency during the COVID-19 crisis, with other notable names including Debenhams and the Dorothy Perkins-to-Topshop empire, Arcadia Group.

4687;4687;Mandarin Kitchen, London: ‘Seriously good’ – restaurant review;2023-01-08T06:00:41Z;['Jay Rayner'];['Food', 'Chinese food and drink', 'Restaurants'];;"Mandarin Kitchen, 14-16 Queensway, London W2 3RX (020 7727 9012; mandarin.kitchen). Starters and soups £4.30-£13.90, large plates £8.90-£55 (for sharing), desserts £4.20-£8.20, wines from £27.90 London has many Chinatowns. They may not be as extensive as the throng around Gerrard Street, but they are very much there. When I was a kid, deep-braised in the sweet soy broth of privilege, my family would go once a year, just after Christmas, to the theatre; to bathe in the spot-lit thrill of the overture, the sequin and the jazz hand. As is the non-observant Jewish way at that time of year, we would eat Chinese. It was usually somewhere in the small Chinatown at the southern end of Queensway, hard by Hyde Park, where intense men stood in the windows hand-pulling noodles, both as kitchen prep and come-hither marketing. They had to do it somewhere. They might as well do it in front of an audience. But time and fashion move on. Each generation rediscovers a city for themselves. Rarely did I eat on Queensway. I might happily review restaurants located at the very extremities of the United Kingdom. But home turf is a different place and I have always been a little suspicious of everything to the left of Marble Arch. Then a few months back I wanted somewhere to eat before a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Pink Martini – fabulous gig. The choices around our greatest concert hall are depressingly thin, so I looked north to the other side of Hyde Park. Which is how I found myself as a walk-in at the seafood temple that is Mandarin Kitchen, amid Queensway’s tiny Chinatown. I quickly recalled that it was where we used to go as a family back in the 80s, for many great things, including a huge heap of broken-up crab with ginger and spring onion. We regarded the mess left on the tablecloth afterwards as a mark of both achievement and family culture. This was who we were.
I made a bit of a happy mess again. It wasn’t the deep-fried baby squid with garlic and chilli. That was tidy. If any crumbs fell off the rustling pile of crisply battered tentacle and ring, I had ’em. The salty rubble of fresh red chilli and garlic went, too. You can get a lot of adhesion between a fat finger pad and that stuff, especially off a linen tablecloth. No, it was the whole steamed Dover sole in ginger and spring onion that caused the stains, as I filleted it off the bone, spraying fin and sauce hither and yon. It’s listed on the menu at “market price”. Don’t be embarrassed about asking them what that price is, because they won’t be embarrassed to tell you. Currently it’s £38, as compared to £48 at Scott’s and £65 at Wiltons. And oh my: the cooking of that fish was perfect. There’s nothing mushy here. It’s all sweet, tense fillet, slipping off the frame, like a silk dressing gown off a comely shoulder. In a city where restaurants come and go, Mandarin Kitchen has thrived. It first opened in 1978, a project between restaurateur Helen Li and seafood trader Stephen Cheung. It’s still run by the next generation of the Cheung family and this year will celebrate its 45th anniversary. A few years ago it had a makeover, creating a clean space of whitewashed curving vaults as if in a set of space-age railway arches. There are soft banquettes and downlighters and staff who appear genuinely pleased to see you. Making generalisations about the waiters in particular types of restaurants is risky, but it’s fair to say that a lot of central London’s Chinese establishments are staffed by brilliant people prized for their briskness and efficiency, rather than necessarily their warmth. Here, you get the whole package.
I accidentally fell into Mandarin Kitchen a second time within a few weeks and ordered it all again because I wasn’t reviewing and it was my money and nobody was looking. Eventually, I decided a third, more formal visit was in order, not least to have the dish for which they are most famous: a whole lobster broken up over a pile of soft, thin noodles in a banging ginger and spring onion sauce. It’s copied all over the world now, but they claim creation rights and I’m not going to argue. It costs a hefty £55, but will feed two with room to spare. In any case, if anybody tells you they’ve found a cheap source of lobster, back away. There is no such thing as a good cheap lobster. Ask for extra napkins for when you pick up the shells, coated in that lightly gelatinous sauce and give in to the urge to suck the sweet meat from the shell. Follow it with the peppery hit of the sliced ginger. It is that rare thing, the very comforting and the luxurious all in one. This time I had the Dover sole fried with dried chilli and onion, another inhouse creation. The fillets had been taken off the bone and the entire skeleton lightly battered and deep fried so it had curled into a crispy gondola, which may be the best kind of gondola. The fish had then been turned in a sweet, chilli-hot soy glaze and returned to the golden frame, with translucent petals of onion and lots of chillies. We alternated between pieces of fish with bits of the crunchy bones cracked off with our fingers. More napkins were sacrificed.
We had other things, including a soothing tangle of monk’s beard in oyster sauce, and scallops steamed on the shell amid a nest of rice vermicelli with a soy dipping sauce. Best of all was a slab of steamed minced pork with salted fish, fragrant with ginger and sesame oil. It is like being given a chunk of the inside of pork dumplings. We sipped thimbles of tea and celebrated making another mess and at the end had ivory cubes of almond bean curd, which is chilled and jelly-like and a little odd. We also had toffee bananas, which are crunchy spheres of childlike wonder. We were asked if we wanted ice-cream with that. It’s illegal to say no to a question like that, isn’t it? I recognise there’s an element of nostalgia gilding this review. My parents are both long gone, but here, at the table, was a whispered echo of those family visits when we would mount an armed assault on the crab without shame or embarrassment and adore being us. But none of that obscured the fact that Mandarin Kitchen has survived all these years for one simple reason: it’s seriously good. News bites Hrishikesh Desai has announced his departure from Gilpin Hotel and Lake House in the Lake District after eight years as executive chef across the resort’s three restaurants. He is being replaced by three chefs, each of whom will run a restaurant independently. Aakash Ohol has been promoted internally and will be joined by Ollie Bridgwater, formerly of the Fat Duck, and Tom Westerland, of Lucknam Park. Owner Barney Cunliffe has also announced a revised and more robust sustainability strategy (thegilpin.co.uk). For the whole of January Jacob Kenedy of Bocca di Lupo in London’s Soho is teaming up with food writer Rachel Roddy to celebrate the publication of her new book An A to Z of Pasta. They have chosen five dishes from across Italy, the initials of which spell out ‘An A to Z’. It starts with a fritto misto platter from Ancona, including breaded and fried lamb chops and olives stuffed with pork and veal, and finishes in Zafferana Etnea, with a liqueur-soaked, saffron-glazed cassata siciliana sponge cake with sweet ricotta and candied fruits from Sicily (boccadilupo.com). Norfolk chef Charlie Hodson has opened what he believes is the smallest restaurant in the country. Hodson and Co in Aylsham, which was originally a deli, has been open for four nights a week since November and is available to be booked for a single reservation of anywhere between two and 20 people, who will all be served an eight-course tasting menu (hodsonco.co.uk).

3906;3906;After their baby was killed by a car crash, parents aim to end road deaths;2023-01-12T14:19:56Z;['Libby Brooks'];['Road safety', 'UK news', 'World news', 'Children', 'Motoring', 'Society', 'Technology'];;"Louis Thorold was “just a perfect little baby, smiley and happy”, recalls his father, Chris. One of the five-month-old’s favourite toys was a plush elephant with crinkly ears. His mother, Rachael, remembers how relaxed Louis was, sleeping easily and even nodding off in her arms when she took him for weekly swimming lessons. “We were so happy, we thought we had a lifetime of days like this ahead.” Yet for eight weeks after her son was killed in a road accident that left her with catastrophic injuries, Rachael had no memory that she had even had a child. Rachael Thorold was walking Louis in his pram next to the A10 in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, on 22 January 2021, when a 75-year-old woman pulled into the path of a van, which mounted the pavement as a result of the ensuing collision. Chris buried his son while his partner of 19 years lay in a coma. It was uncertain whether she would survive.
Instead of celebrating baby milestones, Rachael spent her first Mother’s Day in a neuro-rehabilitation ward unable to walk, read or write. In August, Shelagh Robertson was found not guilty of causing Louis’s death through careless driving by reason of insanity, with jurors believing that her undiagnosed dementia had affected her capacity. Nearly two years on from the tragedy, as Rachael continues her “incredible” rehabilitation journey, Chris explains: “The only real way to gain justice was to try to make sure this never happens to anyone again.” Children, specifically, don’t have a voice in road safety, he says, though 50 a year die on the UK’s roads and thousands more are seriously injured. Worldwide, the biggest killer of children under 16 is road deaths. The Louis Thorold Foundation, set up in memory of their son, aims to reduce this to zero. “It’s a massive aspiration. But technologically, there is no reason why anyone should die on the roads anywhere in the world these days,” Chris says.
Our society tolerates pedestrian deaths, Chris says – the legacy of a car-is-king culture promoted since the 1960s by manufacturers, road designers and motorists’ organisations. But this is changing, not least as our awareness of the environmental damage done by cars has increased. “There’s almost a perfect storm of conditions now,” says Chris, pointing to Vision Zero, the multinational campaign to end traffic deaths, as well as the Twenty’s Plenty campaign in the UK, both of which the foundation promotes. Since Rachael left hospital, the couple have moved away from Waterbeach, but successfully campaigned to improve the road system where Louis died. “We wanted to start with something that we could actually achieve,” says Chris. “We reduced the speed limit from 50mph to 40mph and completely redesigned the junction, installing a crossing, and changed about two and a half miles of pavement.” Since then, Cambridgeshire council has also employed a behavioural psychologist in its team. It is understood to be the first local authority in the country to look at how people interact in roadside environments. And this coming spring, the foundation will push for the introduction of regular medical examinations for older drivers, to ensure fitness to get behind the wheel.
There is evident frustration and weariness from Chris at how the criminal justice system dealt with Robertson – who, the family say, has never expressed remorse or concern to them. “This was somebody who was clearly medically unfit to drive a car, but the system allowed her to drive it with no check. “I’m not saying we should target demographics but there needs to be a way, once we reach a certain age, that there should be a periodic medical examination to say you can drive.” Since Louis’s death, the family have heard from thousands of others who are concerned that elderly relatives have “nearly killed somebody, or themselves”. For Rachael, who still has no memory of the accident itself, the trial brought some understanding. “I realised I was a victim and there was nothing I could do. I had felt so guilty and asked, ‘Why couldn’t I have done something?’” she says. Nearly two years on, she continues to attend rehabilitation therapy sessions almost daily. She still struggles with word-finding and fatigue as a result of the brain injury she sustained. “I didn’t think she’d survive when this happened,” says Chris. “Her injuries were just horrific, and I didn’t ever think she’d come home. But she defied all that.” “She’s just an incredible person,” he adds. Her will to recover feeds into their determination to stop preventable tragedies happening to any other family. “It’s still extremely difficult, but it’s not going to be the end of either of it. For Louis, we’ve got to make him proud.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/12/baby-killed-car-parents-road-deaths-louis-thorold-foundation;guardian;entertainment & culture;3906
2568;2568;Canadian man captures rare wildlife footage: moose shedding its antlers;2023-01-19T10:30:06Z;['Leyland Cecco'];['Canada', 'Animals', 'Americas'];;"For most of his life, Derek Burgoyne has been a treasure hunter, scouring the marshes, woodland and open fields of eastern Canada for his prized trophy: fallen moose antlers. And in a stroke of luck last week, he hit the jackpot. Burgoyne was in a remote patch of New Brunswick, surveying maple and birch trees with a drone for his job when he spotted dark shapes against the white landscape: three moose, bedded down in a clearing.
The animals began stirring as the drone whirred overhead, and Burgoyne steered it to follow one of the bulls, still with a full set of antlers. Before darting away, the moose began wobbling its hulking body, shaking off the snow that clung to its hair. As its torso rippled, the force of the shaking cast off its massive antlers – an “extremely rare and exciting” moment that Burgoyne captured on camera. “I’ve seen moose shed and antler before, but this was just another level,” he told the Guardian. “This is like the lottery when it comes to wildlife photography. It doesn’t get any better than this.” A towering ungulate common throughout boreal regions of North America, moose undergo physical changes as winter sets in and food becomes scarce. To save energy, older males will naturally lose their antlers when temperatures drop, growing a fresh pair in the spring. Shed antlers scattered on the forest floor are commonly spotted when the snow recedes, but footage of shedding is rare. Last month, a moose in Alaska made international headlines after its shedding was captured by a doorbell camera. But Burgoyne’s footage is even more meaningful for the forester, who is a lifelong “shed hunter”, searching the woods for fallen antlers as part of an increasingly popular – and lucrative – pastime in both the United States and Canada. For some, the activity has become a frenzied search for antlers that can fetch lucky foragers thousands of dollars, but Burgoyne said he prefers the peace of the hunt.
“I enjoy being in the woods. It’s great exercise and it’s fun tracking the moose through the winter and looking for their sheds in the spring. Each one you find feels like the first one. It never gets old,” he said, admitting his collection is rapidly outpacing available space in his house. Until recently, Burgoyne’s best find had been from the region’s largest bull – a 33-point leviathan that remains the biggest moose Burgoyne has ever seen. But on that January day, after the moose he was watching darted off, Burgoyne scrambled as fast as he could through deep snow to recover the shed – and his first ever matching pair of antlers. The newest antlers are 17 points and measure 45 inches across. “Nice bull. Beautiful,” he says in the video as he examines his latest find. “They don’t get fresher than this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/canada-man-captures-rare-wildlife-footage-moose-shedding-antlers;guardian;entertainment & culture;2568
3568;3568;Moving on from machismo: is noxious masculinity finally receding from sport? | Hannah Jane Parkinson;2023-01-14T08:00:02Z;['Hannah Jane Parkinson'];['Sport', 'Roger Federer', 'Rafael Nadal', 'Tennis', 'Football'];;"If there was a defining sporting moment of 2022, aside from the obvious one of Lionel Messi lifting the World Cup (while wearing an incongruous bisht, giving off strong vibes of someone about to get their hair washed at the salon), it was surely the tears and hand-clasping of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the Laver Cup. After Federer had played his last competitive match – teaming up with Nadal in doubles – the two sat and watched as the screens of London’s O2 Arena flashed highlights of the Swiss’s iconic career. Ellie Goulding belted out a ballad. Lights strobed. Federer did one of those hiccup-cries kids do. His pinkie finger moved towards Nadal’s. The Spaniard’s eyes were red; Federer’s nose was giving Rudolph with a coke habit. Pretty soon their shoulders were heaving in sync.
Sport is obviously a pursuit of passion and emotion. It’s all of the feelings. Bitter disappointment at a penalty shootout loss. Euphoria at saving three match points. It’s the boiling anger towards a tyrannical referee. And Federer was already known as a sensitive guy, but it was nonetheless an extremely potent scene. Two of the greatest sportsmen of all time, overtly – not sheepishly, not ironically – showing a vulnerability most often still characterised as effeminate. When asked about the moment Federer described it as “beautiful” and “a secret thank you” to his great rival and friend. Follow enough sport and there’s a noticeable shift from the kind of boorish machismo that boys and men are insidiously socialised to adopt; the virulent hyper-aggression that leads to full prisons and societal breakdown outside of sports arenas, and red cards and smashed rackets within them. Undoubtedly a tedious “no homo” locker-room bro culture still exists (which would no doubt have perplexed the ancient Greek male athletes who came up with the Olympics and were not infrequently pro-homo), but there seems to be a definite turning of the tide. Along with technological advancement in sport, there’s been a huge cultural change in recent times. Back in 2008 when Fabio Capello banned ketchup from the England canteen, the tabloids responded as though the lads had been forcibly castrated, as though tomato sauce represented the manly blood of battle. Now, clubs have staff psychologists. Perhaps it was always the way that exaggerated manliness would fall by the wayside when footballers evolved from kicking a pig’s bladder to wearing GPS sports bras. There are certain standout turning points. Michael Jordan’s collapsing in grief over his late father; Maradona snogging his teammates. In the UK, one thinks of David Beckham in a sarong. Perhaps the photograph of him wearing his long hair swept up in an alice band, underneath which was the cut he acquired from Alex Ferguson kicking a boot at him, was a visual metonymic changing of the guard. A decade later and, though Fifa corruption resulted in the most recent World Cup taking place in a country where homosexuality is illegal, we had Louis van Gaal kissing Memphis Depay. We had Olivier Giroud holding Kylian Mbappé in his arms. Morocco’s players danced joyfully on the pitch with their mothers. (Think of that last one as the advancement of players showing their kids off at a season’s end, which, while wholesome, is always a controlled display rather than raw burst of emotion).
Opening up about mental health issues in men’s sport has also become normalised – it was no small thing when the most successful Olympian of all time, swimmer Michael Phelps, talked about his history of suicidal ideation. In tennis, Andy Murray – who famously wept at Wimbledon – was credited by Nick Kyrgios’s mother for his intervention when the Scot noticed self-harm scars on her son’s arms. One could argue that the rise of women’s sports has had an influence. Women’s football, in particular, has boomed in popularity – especially with the Lionesses’ Euros triumph. Crowds are friendlier, more welcoming, less pugilistic and more diverse. This global growth in women’s sport has provided a refreshing change and the opportunity of an alternative: high quality, highly competitive, often heated and combative sport – without an undercurrent of dickishness and shithousery. Noxious masculinity hasn’t been eradicated entirely – not in sport, not in society. Cristiano Ronaldo might market himself as a modern man, all threaded eyebrows and flashy veneers, but he has the demeanour of the dude in the gym who offers unsolicited advice to women. There’s been mass support for the coming out of, among others, football’s Jake Daniels and rugby union’s Nick McCarthy; but there are still homophobic chants aimed towards Chelsea fans, and in recent times the Danish tennis prodigy Holger Rune yelled “faggot” on the court. There are still the ultras, throwing beer and kicking the shit out of each other; but there is also a video in which an emotional Messi pleads with them to stop. Meanwhile, who would have thought that grown men would be repurposing the lyrics of an Atomic Kitten song to serenade Gareth Southgate about how he turns them on? At my club, Liverpool, there are free tampons in the bathrooms and a manager who flirts with a male translator, and though I’d quite like Darwin Núñez to stop shanking his shots somewhere west of the Sahara, I’m comforted by the thought that back in the dressing room, Andy Robertson’s there, stroking his hair, whispering consoling words in his ear. Big Virg tenderly lifting a chamomile tea to his lips. Thiago gently rubbing his back. And a text from Rodge and Rafa: “Hang in there bud, we got you x.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/14/moving-on-from-machismo-is-noxious-masculinity-finally-receding-from-sport;guardian;sports;3568

If 2022 showed the huge demand among Australian drivers for brands like the Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5, dealers next year are expected to start taking orders on 21 new models. From high-end luxury sedans, to modest hatchbacks, off-road vehicles and transit vans, here’s a sample of 10 electric vehicles expected to be hitting the Australian market in 2023. Fiat 500e The Fiat 500 was introduced in 1957, produced until 1975 and then revived in 2007. Now the popular hatchback is going electric. With a relatively limited range and a price yet to be determined, this small EV is aimed at inner-city drivers.
Subaru Solterra The Solterra is Subaru’s first run at a mass-market electric car that is similar in principle to Toyota’s bZ4X. Details on the mid-sized SUV have yet to be released but in Japan the car promises a driving range of 530km in an all-wheel drive. It is schedule to hit the market in mid 2023.
Toyota bZ4X Australia’s most popular car brand has been infamously slow to embrace all-electric vehicles, despite being a first mover in the realm of electric vehicles. Now it has announced it is bringing the bZ4X to Australia – though the details have not been revealed. It’s due for release in mid-2023.
Cupra Born Those looking for hatchbacks will also have the option to pick up the Cupra Born, which is not too far off the Volkswagen ID.3. Specifications have not been released, but in Europe the car offers a range of 550km.
Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Volkswagen ID.4/ID.5 These Volkswagen models are already available in Europe and are expected to arrive down under late this year. The main difference between the two cars is largely aesthetic, with the ID.4 expected to be priced in the mid-$60,000 range, featuring a 77kWh battery capable of driving 530km between charges. It’s due for delivery in late 2023.
Skoda Enyaq Europeans love the Skoda Enyaq – now the question is whether Australians will follow when the company starts taking orders in late 2023. The Czech brand’s all-electric family model offers a 77kWh battery and up to 529km of range – though the price has yet to be announced.
Hyundai Ioniq 6 If you’re looking for SUV specs in a sedan body type, the Ioniq 6 gives you the best of both worlds. The Ioniq 6 is a reskin of the Ioniq 5 and promises a range of 610km with quick acceleration. It also happens to be one of the most aero-efficient cars ever to be mass produced.
MG4 It’s possible the MG4 may end up one of the most affordable EV models on the Australian market, with a pricetag below $45,000. The small hatchback is being launched to compete with the Nissan Leaf, BYD Atto3 and the Cupra Born. It promises up to 600km of range from a smaller 64kWh battery.
Kia EV9 With its EV9, Kia is making a run for the territory traditionally occupied by the Toyota LandCruiser and Nissan Patrol – just without the petrol. The EV9 is a large SUV designed for off-roading, though the final production design, specs and price are yet to be confirmed. Word on the street is that it will sell for about $100,000.
Volvo EX90 The Australian government may be shy on the phasing out of petrol engines, but Volvo has plans to go all-electric by 2026 – and it hopes the EX90 will take them there. The flagship SUV will come with Twin Motor, which offers a total power output of 300kW or Twin Motor Performance, which offers 380kW. Both options offer a range of around 600km, though it is slightly lower for performance. The EX90 is vehicle-to-grid capable, meaning it can be used as a mobile battery to power a household or even other EVs.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/03/new-cars-charging-into-australias-electric-vehicle-market-in-2023;guardian;science & technology;5675
1316;1316;‘Unfinished business’: Ballarat abuse survivor to tie a ribbon at St Mary’s before George Pell funeral;2023-01-25T14:00:23Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['George Pell', 'Royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse', 'Catholicism', 'Australia news'];;"When the Ballarat abuse survivor Paul Auchettl flies to Sydney to tie ribbons to the fence outside St Mary’s Cathedral ahead of George Pell’s funeral, he’ll be thinking of a promise the late cardinal made to him last time they met. In 2016, Auchettl flew to Rome as part of a group of survivors who met with Pell during his evidence to the child abuse royal commission. Auchettl wanted to make Pell understand the profound damage the church’s failings had caused to their home town of Ballarat. In their private meeting, Auchettl says, Pell promised to do something to help.
Nothing changed. Ballarat, the epicentre of the nation’s clergy abuse crisis, still suffers an enduring trauma, one that imprints itself through suicide, shame and anger. “To me it’s unfinished business,” Auchettl says. “So I’m going to tie ribbons on the fence for the people who are too sick to be there, who have died and can’t be there, and for families who are too angry to be there. I’d like to tie ribbons for them.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the lead-up to Pell’s funeral at Sydney’s St Mary’s next week, survivors and their supporters have been visiting the cathedral to leave ribbons on its fence, emulating the approach taken at St Patrick’s in Ballarat. Church staff have been cutting them down. The response has prompted much criticism from survivors and their supporters, who have described the church’s actions as “petty” and another example of its decision to protect the Catholic brand at the expense of survivors. “In this sense, ribbons are sacred, they should not be cut down or taken,” Auchettl says. “If you go up to someone who’s tying a ribbon, they’ll tell you exactly why they’re doing it: the ribbons have become a powerful voice for people who were silenced for so long. “I don’t want to be disrespectful at George’s funeral, I want him to have a peaceful service. But I want to alert people that there is this unfinished business that he was still yet to do and that, in a sense, he has failed.” Auchettl attended St Alipius primary school and was molested by his year six teacher, the notorious paedophile Christian Brother Robert Best. Auchettl’s younger brother Peter was also abused and took his own life more than a decade ago. He wants the church to recognise that clergy abuse and related suicides have created secondary victims – usually family members. “We can’t even talk about this, it’s taboo, it’s too difficult, people are so angry. Yet this is what happens in this sorry story, we’re shut down,” he says. “The ribbons become a way of saying ‘we need to know about these stories’.”
Loud Fence, the group which first advocated placing ribbons at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Ballarat, says it is damaging for survivors to have ribbons removed. “We tend to say now that every ribbon has a voice, and I feel that,” the group’s founder, Maureen Hatcher, said last week. “Once you tie a ribbon to the fence, that’s what it becomes. It becomes a symbol of a survivor or a victim, and it’s their voice, whether they’ve been able to speak out or not, it’s there.” Simon Hunt, the satirist sometimes known as Pauline Pantsdown, has been tying ribbons to the St Mary’s fence for more than a week and has used his social media following to encourage others to do the same. Asked on Wednesday whether church staff were continuing to remove the ribbons, he said: “Every time. I’ve only been there once when there was still anything major left. It’s been 10 days and I’ve been there on eight of those days. Sometimes there’s a couple of scraps left and other times it’s just completely cleaned.” The Guardian contacted the archdiocese of Sydney and St Mary’s for comment. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

3987;3987;Rail and sail: a month-by-month guide to no-fly travel ideas in 2023;2023-01-12T07:00:05Z;['Kevin Rushby'];['United Kingdom holidays', 'Europe holidays', 'Short breaks', 'Travel', 'Public transport trips', 'Rail travel', 'Green travel', 'Ferry travel'];;"January A fine way to begin the new year would be to get out in the wilds for some voluntary work with wildlife trusts. Lots of projects need a hand: for example, this month at Heggs-Castle in Arkengarthdale, North Yorkshire, volunteers will be helping combat erosion by planting trees, and harvesting willow. Further tasks throughout the year are guaranteed. In the Lake District, Fix the Fells needs volunteers to help maintain footpaths. The National Trust also needs a hand in dozens of interesting locations.
The British seaside makes for an excellent wild winter break, with bargain prices to snap up. The new boutique Oyster House in Mumbles, Swansea Bay, has a two-night bed and breakfast January Getaway package, with a three-course meal and complimentary arrival drinks from £250 for two. There are lots of last minute offers on cottages too – check out sites like independentcottages.co.uk for latest savings. February
Art lovers have a real treat this month: the most comprehensive exhibition of Johannes Vermeer’s work opens at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Vermeer left 37 known paintings, of which 28 will be on display, including classics such as Girl With a Pearl Earring. A further treat is to go to the artist’s home town of Delft where there will be an exhibition about the artist’s life at Museum Prinsenhof Delft. Amsterdam is served by DFDS ferries from Newcastle. The main exhibition runs until 4 June. March
Spotting pairs of boxing hares is one of March’s great experiences. The Yorkshire Wolds have a healthy population. While there, check out Robert Fuller’s gallery in Thixendale, where the artist’s wildlife cameras have gathered many followers. Other leporine strongholds are Anglesey, Orford Ness and Rathlin Island off County Antrim, where the Irish hares are golden-haired and blue-eyed. For those who fancy hare-watching from the comfort of a bed organic farmers Rhodri and Sarah Lloyd-Williams have opened two inside a luxuriant treehouse on their farm in west Wales, a few miles outside Aberystwyth, where hares are super-abundant. Also in Wales, the new Museum of Speed at Pendine Sands is due to open on the 31 March, and a new hotel, Caban, is opening in spring, overlooking the sandy beach. In Scotland a range of 45 new wilderness cabins, the Bracken Hide, open on Skye this month. To mark the 20th anniversary of the setting up of Cairngorms national park, Wilderness Scotland is offering an eight-day trek from the coast up into the mountains (seven nights with B&B accommodation for £1,055). April
The great sequence of British flowers that started in February with snowdrops really hits its stride this month. The Japanese make headlines for their cherry blossom pilgrimages, but what about our equally marvellous wild garlic and bluebells? There’s a new field guide, British and Irish Wildflowers and Plants, due out this month. Another book to look forward to is Sarah Banks’ Wild Guide North East England, part of the hugely informative series that now covers all of Great Britain. Further afield, Inntravel is launching an interesting rail pilgrimage from Bilbao to Santiago de Campostela in northern Spain (nine nights B&B for £1,105) that looks like an innovative way to do this classic route. Also in Spain there is a spectacular new walking holiday through the gorges of southern Galicia from On Foot Holidays (nine nights for £975). If bikes are more your thing, starting out this month is Visit Good Place’s new gourmet touring route south from Trieste in Italy all the way to the tip of Croatian Istria. Elan Valley in mid-Wales also launches a new bike hub this month. May
May means Eurovision, which this year takes place in Liverpool where you would want to stay somewhere with the necessary panache. The former Lime Street railway hotel, a Victorian landmark, has been totally refurbished to become the latest Radisson RED. If that’s not your thing, Hay festival kicks off this month and there’s new accommodation in town with Under the Thatch. In Pembrokeshire, the puffins will be back from their winter vacation and Celtic Deep is planning a week-long celebration of swimming with the little charmers, plus free-diving lessons and coastal food foraging, all based at The Old Point House, a newly refurbished 16th-century pub in East Angle Bay (run by the folk who conjured up the marvellous Cafe Môr). If you miss the puffins, there’s a similar week dedicated to blue sharks in September. In Gloucestershire, Elmore Court opens its spectacular treehouse accommodation in 100 hectares (250 acres) of rewilded land. While railways in Britain squabble and decline, in Europe things are moving forward fast – a new sleeper train between Berlin, Amsterdam and Brussels starts this month. June
Also on the rails, this month the Austrian company Nightjet Sleeper trains will complete the overhaul of its carriages as part of a massive upgrade. With this come new routes connecting Amsterdam, Paris, Vienna, Genoa and many other major cities. For non-flying British travellers this is significant because you can hop off the Newcastle-Amsterdam ferry (one sailing a week, on Wedesdays), spend a day in town, then join the night sleeper to Vienna. How about catching that city’s Fesch’markt, a showcase for innovative design and art held from 2-4 June (Amsterdam-Vienna overnight from about £27, private cabin £88)? This month will also see the 400th anniversary celebrations of Sweden’s wonderful Gothenburg. On rail news, keep an eye on Rail Baltica, connecting the Polish border with all Baltic capital cities, a significant reorientation away from Russia, which will transform overland connectivity for those countries. July
For that real summer challenge, how about bagging a load of classic Spanish summits? This month Much Better Adventures is doing a five-night barnstorming Picos de Europa epic that will take in Cotalba (2,026 metres), Jario (1,913 metres) and more (five nights half-board for £730). Travel via Santander or Bilbao with Brittany Ferries. Spain is definitely the flavour of this month: the Tour de France kicks off in Bilbao on 1 July. Why not get serious with Saddle Skedaddle’s new 865-mile cycling epic from the Basque Country to Andalucía? (21 days for £4,395) August
Where better to get away from it all than the Hebrides in summer? Hopefully spot some wildlife before a yoga session and then dinner. Check out Hebrides Cruises’ latest trip around Mull and nearby islands (there’s a top chef on board). In Ludlow, Shropshire, watch out for the Magnalonga, a Salopian take on an Italian tradition where walkers ambulate gently through the local terroir, sampling food and drink en route. It’s very civilised and highly enjoyable. If you fancy a go at the original version, head for San Pietro near Verona (on 23 April this year) where you will get Valpolicella rather than cider. September
The season of missed opportunities to forage is here again. Instead of staring indecisively at that yummy-looking mushroom, find out if it’s actually edible at the Scottish wild food festival, held a few miles north of Glasgow, with lots of workshops, tastings and events. Naturetrek also does a range of day trips, including mushroom foraging for beginners. If, like me, you like a field guide to hand, there’s a new one, Edible Fungi of Britain and Northern Europe, by Jens Petersen. At Corris Railway in mid-Wales, heritage railway fans can hire the line for a day: driving steam locos and pulling signals. October
Salmon runs are not wholly predictable, but October is usually a good bet, especially after heavy rain has had time to wash down. The Severn at Shrewsbury in Shropshire is one of the best spots. Head down Sydney Avenue to the Weir cafe. Other good spots are near Stainforth on the River Ribble in North Yorkshire, and several in Scotland. Another great UK wildlife migration is also under way this month: Yorkshire Coast and Nature starts a series of Birding Discovery Days at East Yorkshire’s Spurn Head when, with luck, you might spot bee-eaters, golden orioles and other rarities. November
Winter walks are in full swing and hopefully the long-awaited England coast path will finally be reaching fruition. November also means that perennial gem, the Kendal mountain festival from 16 to 19 November. This month a new Euro 7 visa waiver charge starts for British travellers entering Schengen countries. It’s estimated it will cost British travellers £177m yearly. The centenary of Munich’s beer hall putsch, when Adolf Hitler first came to attention is marked on 8 November. Watch out for events at the city’s NS-Dokumentationszentrum, which focuses on the history of the Nazi party; it’s a chilling evocation of that period. Closer to home: maybe try the relaunched Mortimer Trail through Herefordshire’s cider country. December
This month marks 40 years since the death of abstract artist Joan Miró, and the museum Miró Mallorca is reopening its spectacular main building that houses much of the man’s work.

3159;3159;Loud quitting: the very high-risk way to negotiate a raise;2023-01-16T14:30:38Z;['N/A'];['Work & careers'];;Name: Loud quitting. Age: Relatively new. Appearance: The greatest spectacle in the modern working world. Oh God, I’ve only just got the hang of quiet quitting. Relax. They’re different things entirely. “Quiet quitting” wasn’t even quitting, really, was it? Wasn’t it? No, it just meant sticking to your minimum job requirements. Turning up on time, leaving on time, no emails at the weekend. It was basically what having a job used to be like before the world went to hell. So what is loud quitting? It is the latest employment buzzword and it means – get this – quitting loudly. “SCREW YOU GUYS, I’M OUTTA HERE!” Not quite. You see, you don’t loud quit because you want to leave your job. You loud quit because you want to keep your job. What? Think of it as a negotiation tactic. You express your displeasure for your situation by telling your bosses that you’re looking for another job. They respond by panicking and offering you all the riches in the world to stay. Really? Does that work? Sometimes. Sometimes?! So there’s a risk that your superiors will see you throw your toys out of the pram and then just let you go? Well, yes, obviously. Who wants a great big tantrummy toddler in their workforce? I’m so confused. That’s because loud quitting is an art. You don’t just strop into the office and scream that you’ve had enough. That’s what Larry David did at Saturday Night Live. Then, having had second thoughts, he had to worm back in the next day like nothing had happened. So you don’t actually apply to other jobs? No, that’s more like “rage-applying”, where you hate your job so much that you apply for everything going and then take the plunge when an offer comes in. Right. So how do you loud quit? You sow the seeds of your dissatisfaction, reminding your bosses of all your achievements and hinting that you could do the same job for better money elsewhere. Because, if you’re good, they’ll want to keep you. Absolutely. You’re the best employee they have. They’d be fools to lose you to a competitor. I can see one big flaw in this. What if you aren’t the best employee they have? Yeah. Then you’re screwed. Same if you push for too great a raise in your loud-quitting negotiations and your bosses can’t afford to pay you extra. Or if you just don’t get on with people very well. Wow, loud quitting sounds like an incredibly high-risk strategy. It is, especially during a cost of living crisis. But remember: only winners take risks. Winners and very stupid people. Do say: “Have you seen those vacancies at Credit Suisse? Wouldn’t mind doubling my salary …” Don’t say: “Not really, please don’t let me go, I need this.”;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/16/loud-quitting-the-very-high-risk-way-to-negotiate-a-raise;guardian;entertainment & culture;3159
3584;3584;Boris Johnson may be building his war chest, but he isn’t building bridges;2023-01-14T06:00:37Z;['Rowena Mason'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'Conservative leadership'];;It has proved fortunate for Boris Johnson that his government chose last year to drop plans to cap how much MPs could make from second jobs outside parliament. Nine months later, the former prime minister has benefited from more than £2.5m in earnings from speeches, hospitality, free accommodation, gifts and donations to his new company, The Office of Boris Johnson. His haul in just over four months means he is topping the leaderboard of MPs in terms of both donations and cash from work unrelated to his job in the House of Commons in the last year. Speculation is now rife that Johnson will use the money coming into his office to launch a political comeback – emphatically denied by his allies – especially with Rishi Sunak failing to make much headway in the polls. This has only intensified after it emerged this week that his office has taken £1m from Christopher Harborne, an investor in crypto and aviation fuel based in Thailand, who previously donated £6m to the Brexit party, now known as Reform UK. “Why would Boris need a £1m donation if he was not planning a political comeback?” asks Labour’s Diane Abbott. His allies say his company undertakes no commercial work and the money will be used to fund his work in public life. But the truth is that if Johnson does want to return to frontline politics then some of the largesse he has benefited from over the last few months may prove an obstacle. Sunak entered No 10 promising an ethical overhaul after the Owen Paterson scandal linked to the former MP’s second job, public anger over Partygate and the furore over Johnson initially using a Tory donor to fund the overhaul of the No 11 flat. If he was serious about returning, Johnson might have attempted to show he had learned from past mistakes and take extreme care to avoid any controversy over the sources of his funding. However, his lifestyle continues to be subsidised by a wealthy Tory donor, with Lord Bamford and his wife giving him use of a £20m London townhouse and a cottage in the Cotswolds. He has also taken more than £250,000 for a speech to a conference in Singapore about blockchain, the technology behind crypto currency, funded by a little-known Hong Kong based startup called ParallelChain Lab. Turning to Harborne, little is known publicly known about the technology investor, whose name features in the Panama Papers as an intermediary of companies linked to offshore accounts, and who also goes by the Thai name Chakrit Sakunkrit. But he is believed to have been a backer of a leading cryptocurrency and a crypto exchange, as well as owning AML Global, an aviation fuel business. His bankrolling of Nigel Farage’s Brexit party also places him firmly on the hard pro-Brexit right of the Conservative party. A narrative about the betrayal of Brexit is Johnson’s most likely source of support within the Conservative party for a comeback, especially if Sunak does a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol that angers the European Research Group wing of the party. Such argument has already been put forward by one of his former supporters, Peter Cruddas, who told the Observer last month that the Tories are under threat from a rightwing insurgency after a “drag to the left” under Sunak. But whether Johnson is the person to front that campaign is still unclear. Many Conservative MPs fear he would continue to dog the party with yet more financial or ethical controversies. He also has the privileges committee inquiry into whether he misled the Commons over Partygate to contend with, and the Covid inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic. He may have had the necessary 100 MPs – less than a third of the parliamentary party – to notionally have fought Rishi Sunak for the leadership back in the autumn but he did not have enough support to have governed effectively. His activities since leaving No 10 are not likely to have convinced the doubters that he has changed.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/boris-johnson-may-be-building-his-war-chest-but-he-isnt-building-bridges;guardian;politics;3584
3638;3638;Wada ‘concern’ as Rusada clears Valieva of wrongdoing over doping scandal;2023-01-13T17:47:15Z;['Sean Ingle'];['Kamila Valieva', 'Winter Olympics', 'Sport', 'Wada'];;"The brilliant 16-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, whose positive doping test dominated headlines at the 2022 Winter Olympics, has been cleared of any wrongdoing by a Russian Anti-Doping Agency tribunal. That is unlikely to be the end of the matter, however, with the World Anti-Doping Agency expressing its “concern” at the decision – before hinting that it could challenge the ruling at the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).
Valieva’s positive test for the banned heart drug Trimetazidine was reported a day after she inspired the Russians to team skating gold in Beijing last February. She was then allowed to continue competing by Cas but, under the most severe pressure, she fell twice in the individual figure skating and finished fourth. After an 11-month delay a Rusada tribunal has now ruled that while Valieva did commit an anti-doping rule violation, she bore “no fault or negligence” for it. As such, the tribunal imposed no sanction except for the disqualification of her results on the date of her failed test at the Russian championships on 25 December 2021. The news was revealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had wanted Valieva to be given a four-year ban. “Based on the elements of the case with which Wada is already familiar, the agency is concerned by the finding of “no fault or negligence” and will not hesitate to exercise its right of appeal to the court of arbitration for sport, as appropriate,” it said. Wada added that the ruling had been made public only after it had gone to Cas in November to protest at what it called an “unacceptable delay by Rusada in rendering a decision in this matter”. Valieva’s story was undoubtedly the biggest of the Games. On 25 December 2021 she had taken a drugs test at the Russian figure skating championships. Yet it was only on 8 February, a day after she inspired her country to gold in the team skating, that she learned she had tested positive. The delay had been caused by a Covid outbreak among workers at a doping laboratory in Sweden. But when the news was announced it led to a media storm which dominated the Winter Olympics. Meanwhile the head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, has urged Wada and the International Skating Union to appeal against Rusada’s decision, “for the sake of the credibility of the anti-doping system and the rights of all athletes”. “The world can’t possibly accept this self-serving decision by Rusada, which in the recent past has been a key instrument of Russia’s state sponsored doping fraud and is non-compliant,” he told the Guardian. “Justice demands a full, fair, public hearing outside of Russia.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/13/wada-concern-after-valieva-cleared-wrongdoing-over-doping-scandal;guardian;sports;3638
3838;3838;Ex-Dreamboys boss jailed for attempted axe murder of wife;2023-01-12T19:47:51Z;['Harry Taylor'];['Essex', 'UK news'];;A former manager of the Dreamboys stripper group has been jailed for 27 years for attempted murder after attacking his wife with an axe. David Richards, 42, attacked Alex Alam, 32, outside her home after their relationship broke down, fracturing her skull and cutting her face and scalp. He lay in wait for Alam on 3 April last year and attacked her in the dark when she stepped outside her house in Stock, Essex, with her dogs. In a victim impact statement read by William Carter, prosecuting, Alam said: “I’ve been utterly betrayed beyond belief by the person I chose to have children with, turning my life upside down. The scars are a constant reminder of what he did to me.” Carter told Chelmsford crown court that Richards, of no fixed address, had taken an axe, waterproof clothing and cable ties to the address. “The weapon was taken to the scene and used,” he said. “Plainly, there was planning – the buying of the axe, the dry suit, the cable ties.” He said it was only the fact that Alam “kept on thinking” that saved her life. Richards pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder charge but was found guilty by a jury after a trial. He was also convicted of breaching a non-molestation order. The judge, David Turner KC, said the attack was a “bloodbath” and praised Alam for “courageously” attending the hearing. She wept and was consoled by people who attended court with her as details were read out. Turner said Richards had stalked and monitored Alam and the home before the incident. He said he was “obsessive” and had a “jealous mindset”. He struck after a friend of Alam’s had left the house. The judge said: “You waited for hours on the night itself until she was alone and her friend had left. “You knew perfectly well she would come to the yard in darkness to house the dogs. You waited in the shadows, then confronted her.” Richards dragged Alam into the house and tied her up briefly, but she freed herself when Richards went outside to try to find her phone. Despite her injuries, she was able to lock the doors and call for help. After failing to break into the house with the axe, Richards tried to flee, leading to a police chase. Richards attended the hearing by video link from HMP Chelmsford. He was also made subject to a restraining order.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/12/former-dreamboys-manager-jailed-attempted-murder-wife;guardian;entertainment & culture;3838

3069;3069;Journalists angered by new Australian federal court restrictions on reporting of cases;2023-01-17T01:45:30Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['Australian media', 'Law (Australia)', 'Media', 'Australia news'];;"Senior journalists and editors from across the media industry have written to the federal court in “dismay” at its decision to restrict access to crucial documents, saying the shift “contradicts principle of open justice”. The federal court last month enacted new rules limiting access to documents for non-parties until a case’s first directions hearing, a rule that would considerably delay media access to key information about proceedings. The changes were made without any consultation and were only publicly revealed last week – a process the court justified by claiming the changes were “administrative or internal in nature”.
Fifty-eight journalists from the ABC, Guardian Australia, Nine, and News Corp wrote to the chief justice, James Allsop, on Monday, urging him to undo the changes. The letter said the restrictions would have an “extraordinary impact on our ability to do our work in providing the public with timely and accurate reports of the important work of your court”. “We are journalists who rely on timely access to Federal Court documents to produce accurate and relevant coverage of cases before your court,” the joint letter said. “We write to express our shock and dismay at your court’s unexpected decision to dramatically reduce public access to court documents, and to urge you to abandon this change, which represents a full-frontal assault on the principle of open justice.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week, a federal court spokesperson said the rules were designed to manage release of “potentially sensitive or confidential content” by allowing the respondent time to seek to have documents suppressed. But journalists have warned the restrictions fundamentally misunderstand the nature of news – and the importance of timely reporting – and will therefore invite inaccurate reporting of cases before the court. Without timely access to court documents, journalists will be forced to rely on the parties for information about cases. “Parties who wish to prosecute their cause in the public domain have an obvious incentive to provide us with information that is partial, inaccurate or incomplete, and because we are now unable to obtain the documents from your court in a timely fashion we will be unable to check what they are saying against the court record before publication,” the letter says. “It may also expose us to increased legal risk because parties may claim that our reports no longer qualify as fair and accurate reports of a court proceeding.” The Media Entertainment Arts Alliance media section president, Karen Percy, told Guardian Australia last week the changes were “utterly disgraceful”, while Kieran Pender, an honorary lecturer at the ANU college of law, said they were “extremely disappointing” and “out of step with open justice”. The Law Council of Australia said media reporting of cases was “central to open justice”. But president Luke Murphy said there was a “delicate balancing act” needed to avoid the “potential for sensitive information being disclosed prior to a hearing”. “The extent to which court documents are made available prior to hearings must balance the benefits of journalists having advanced awareness of the substance of a claim, with the potential for sensitive information being disclosed prior to a hearing,” Murphy said. “This is a delicate balancing act, and the Law Council is still giving consideration to the amendments.” In Monday’s letter, the 58 journalists reminded Allsop that he and many of his judges had previously stressed the importance of open justice. “At its core, the new rule contradicts principle of open justice – a principle previously recognised by you as ‘an overarching principle which guides the Court in its judicial and procedural operations’,” the letter said. Nine newspapers reported on Tuesday that a separate letter, penned by the editors of the The Australian Financial Review, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, Brisbane Times and WAtoday, has also been sent to Allsop in protest of the changes.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/17/media-organisations-angered-by-new-australian-federal-court-restrictions-on-reporting-of-cases;guardian;politics;3069
2270;2270;Flu and pneumonia deaths a quarter higher than usual in England and Wales;2023-01-20T14:43:17Z;['Carmen Aguilar García', 'Pamela Duncan'];['Health', 'Flu', 'Hospitals', 'England', 'Wales', 'UK news', 'Death and dying'];;"Almost 3,000 people died in England and Wales due to pneumonia and influenza in December, a quarter higher than in a typical year, in what is expected to be the worst flu season in a decade. Flu and pneumonia were the leading cause of “excess death” in England in December with 574 extra deaths, 26% above the average, while flu deaths in Wales were 11% higher and the fourth most common cause of death that month. Despite this, full-year figures for 2022 show the mortality rate fell below average for the first time since the Covid pandemic reached the UK in early 2020, with fewer people dying across the two countries last year when age and the size of the population was taken into account. Just 4% of deaths had Covid as the primary cause last year, compared with 11% in 2021. The data also shows that 14% more people died in households last year than is typical, indicating the increase in home deaths that took place during the Covid pandemic is continuing. There were 2% fewer deaths in hospitals and only 0.3% more deaths in care homes. More than 576,000 people died in 2022, an increase of 6% compared with the five-year-average – 2020 was excluded because of an atypically high number of deaths as a result of Covid – the latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows. But, when the size and the age structure of the population (the age-standardised mortality rate) is considered there were 0.7% fewer deaths in England and 1.1% fewer in Wales than the average, giving 2022 the third lowest rate since 2001.
Weekly surveillance reports published by the UK Health Security Agency show flu infections reached a three-year-high this winter. There are, however, signs that a spike in flu cases has now peaked: the latest NHS England figures showed a 35% drop in the number of beds required for flu patients in the second week of 2023 – the first significant drop in the winter to date. However, the number of 3,447 beds is still 84 times higher than in the same week in 2022. The number of critical care beds occupied by flu patients also fell slightly to an average of 221 beds in the week to 15 January. This was higher than the number required for Covid patients in the same week (191) as a combination of the prevalence of the Omicron variant of Covid and the success of the vaccine rollout has made contracting the virus generally less dangerous than it once was. Separate figures released by the ONS earlier in the week showed there were 1,383 deaths due to flu and pneumonia (as opposed to the virus/infection being a secondary cause of death) during the first week of January, the highest figure in three years. Friday’s figures show the number of excess deaths was above average in December using both metrics. There were almost 6,400 more people dying in the last month of the year than expected, up by 14% compared with the average of the last five years (5.8% up in England and 9.4% up in Wales using the age-standardised mortality rate). NHS figures show that about one in seven beds across England were occupied with Covid or flu patients at the beginning of January, with as many as one in five beds in some trusts. Bed occupancy rates were very high in most of the trusts, while a lack of social care beds meant about 14,000 beds were occupied with patients medically fit to be discharged. Some of England’s hospital trusts have more than two in five beds with a patient with Covid or influenza or someone who could be discharged to home or a care home. The figures are still small compared with the height of the pandemic, but it gives an indication of how sick some people are getting as a result of the viruses this winter.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/20/flu-and-pneumonia-deaths-a-quarter-higher-than-usual-in-england-and-wales;guardian;health;2270
2544;2544;What could my family love more than my braised ox cheeks? | Jay Rayner;2023-01-19T12:00:08Z;['Jay Rayner'];['Family', 'Food', 'Life and style'];;"To live in my house is to know gustatory joy. I wake each morning, thinking only of dinner. What shall I cook for them all today? What glorious dish shall I present to my lucky family tonight? Shall I head to the hot and numbing embrace of Sichuan or the darker flavours of northern Spain? Will salted anchovies be involved somewhere in the profound depths of a sauce with more power and oomph than a Porsche 911 Turbo? They often are. I have cupboards full of condiments and sauces. I am rich in ground cumin, dried chillies and sticky pots of tamarind. I have the kitchen skills, the determination and the monumental greed needed to execute brilliant food for every meal. Being part of my family is to win the culinary lottery of life. Or perhaps not. Recently, as I was serving up my latest creation – it may have been the long-braised ox cheeks in a spiced tomato sauce from a recipe by José Pizarro, or perhaps the teriyaki chicken – I asked my loved ones what they’d had for dinner on a previous night when I’d been out. It was a casual question, with a far less than casual intent. I wanted to know just how much they’d missed me. My wife, Pat, sat up and grinned. “Sausage sandwiches,” she said. “It was great.” My boys joined in. Oh yeah, doughy, cheap white bread, and the crap sausages, not those annoying ones with too much actual meat in them, and nowhere near enough nipple and nostril. The three of them fell to discussing the thrills of their sausage sandwich fest. I blinked. Sausage sandwiches? For dinner? Pat shrugged, and dug around at the lovingly crafted plate of utter wonderfulness in front of her. “We have to wait for you to go out to be able to do that sort of thing.” I thought we had a shared family culture. I thought the intricate food I served was an “us” thing, not a “me” thing. Now, all of a sudden, I discover that sometimes, like Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mrs Brown’s Boys, I am merely tolerated; that there are things they like to do together from which I must be protected. Did I even really know them any more? Let’s be clear. They do appreciate much of what I cook. Cooing noises are made. Plates are cleared. I wear the praise lightly, and wouldn’t ever crow about any of that in public, say, in a national newspaper column. By the same token, I am not all about roast swan with caviar chasers. I really do love a sausage sandwich. There’s even a place in my life for a cheap sausage sandwich, made with white bread you can return to its dough-like state if you squeeze the crumb between thumb and index finger.
But not for bloody dinner. That’s a moment to take things seriously. It’s an opportunity, a time to put your back into it. Or at least so I thought. I have read about high-flying Michelin starred chefs who, at the end of a long service tweezering perfectly cooked ingredients into place, want nothing more than a Pot Noodle or a bag of chips. But it didn’t occur to me that this food fatigue might extend unto the family of a committed, well-meaning, belly-obsessed restaurant critic. One night not long ago, it turned out I would be back for dinner when I had thought I’d be out. Pat was in charge that evening. What were we having? Jacket potatoes with grated cheese and baked beans. I’d never seen them all look so damn happy. Really. I don’t know why I bother.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/19/what-could-my-family-love-more-than-my-braised-ox-cheeks-plenty-jay-rayner;guardian;entertainment & culture;2544
450;450;‘Complete, unmitigated disaster’: inquest into Veronica Nelson’s death urges overhaul of ‘discriminatory’ Victorian bail laws;2023-01-30T04:04:17Z;['Adeshola Ore'];['Deaths in custody', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Indigenous incarceration', 'Prisons', 'Victoria', 'Australia news'];;"A Victorian coroner has declared the state’s controversial bail laws discriminatory and a “complete, unmitigated disaster”, using landmark findings into the 2020 death in custody of First Nations woman Veronica Nelson to recommend urgent reforms. Coroner Simon McGregor on Monday handed down the highly anticipated findings into the death of Nelson, a 37-year-old Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta woman who was in prison after being arrested for shoplifting and refused bail. McGregor found Nelson received “cruel and degrading treatment” by prison staff at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre – the state’s maximum-security women’s prison – and that her death was preventable. He concluded that the failures of Correct Care – the private prison healthcare contractor – and Corrections Victoria to define the role of the prison’s medical centre and establish proper procedures for information sharing between staff had contributed to her death. Correct Care was referred by the coroner to the state’s director of public prosecutions to consider whether it should be prosecuted for a breach of the health and safety act. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup McGregor said the state’s bail legislation – tightened after the 2017 Bourke Street massacre – has had a “discriminatory” impact on First Nations people with “grossly disproportionate rates” remanded in custody.
As well as recommending an overhaul of bail laws, the coroner also urged the Victorian government to implement all recommendations from the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. Nelson’s mother, Aunty Donna Nelson, called on the state government to urgently overhaul the bail laws, warning it could be “someone else’s daughter tomorrow” who might die in custody. “Veronica did not deserve to die in such a cruel, heartless and painful way... It’s time to save our daughters, it’s time to change the law,” she told reporters. Victoria’s attorney-general, Jaclyn Symes, acknowledged the state government needs to do “more” on bail reform. “Our bail laws need to protect the community without having a disproportionate or unintended impact on those accused of low-level offending who do not present a risk to community safety,” Symes said in a statement. The opposition’s attorney-general spokesman, Michael O’Brien, said it would work with the government on any legislative changes but warned that the catalyst of the the tightening of bail laws – the Bourke Street tragedy - should “not be forgotten”. The Victorian Greens urged the government to immediately put bail reform on the agenda when parliament resumes next week to prevent the risk of further deaths in custody. In wide-ranging findings, McGregor said the use of handcuffs in Nelson’s arrest was “unjustified” and a “disproportionate restriction” of her human rights. He found the police bail decision maker failed to properly consider discretion and Nelson’s vulnerability in custody as an Aboriginal woman. The legal services provided to Nelson were “inadequate”, the inquest heard. McGregor made several adverse findings regarding the healthcare Nelson received in prison said her treatment was influenced by “drug use stigma”. He said Nelson should have been transferred to hospital at the time she arrived at the prison, concluding the ongoing failure to do so causally contributed to her death. “The assumption that it is normal for patients withdrawing at Dame Phyllis to experience a level of suffering normalised such suffering and results in a desensitisation of both corrections and corrections care staff,” McGregor said. He said the “conditions under which Veronica lived out her final days are harrowing”. Nelson’s partner of 20 years, Percy Lovett, said the state government needed to overhaul prison healthcare, bail laws and “properly” investigate deaths in custody to ensure they were not “swept under the rug”. “I want everyone to remember what happened to Veronica – the premier, every government minister, every prison guard, every doctor and nurse in prison, every police officer, every lawyer and every magistrate,” Lovett said in a statement read by his lawyer outside the coroner’s court. Nelson was arrested in Melbourne at Southern Cross station on two outstanding warrants and suspicion of shoplifting on 30 December 2019. The 37-year-old was refused bail after she represented herself at a Melbourne magistrates court hearing.
Nelson was subsequently held on remand at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre. After a 13-minute medical examination, Nelson was held in the medical ward overnight. She was later moved to a mainstream cell. The court heard during the two nights she spent at the prison, Nelson asked staff for help on more on 49 occasions for worsening vomiting and cramps via the intercom during her 36 hours in prison. Nelson had been withdrawing from heroin and an autopsy later found she had a rare undiagnosed gastrointestinal condition called Wilkie’s syndrome at the time of her death. She was malnourished and an autopsy later found she weighed 33kg and had a grossly dilated and distended stomach. The Andrews government this month announced it would stop outsourcing healthcare in female prisons to for-profit companies.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/30/inquest-veronica-nelson-death-urges-overhaul-victoria-bail-laws;guardian;entertainment & culture;450
7552;7552;Peter Obi: The 'antidote to big man-ism' who could be Nigeria's next president;Tuesday 17 January 2023 21:23, UK;['dominic waghorn', '@dominicwaghorn'];['nigeria'];['say', 'manism', 'questions', 'sense', 'obi', 'nigeria', 'think', 'peter', 'president', 'supporters', 'big', 'country', 'antidote', 'nigerias'];"He was relatively unknown until a few months ago, and yet Peter Obi has been propelled to frontrunner status in Nigeria's upcoming election.

Young, by Nigerian political standards, at 61, and with a reputation for probity in a country rife with corruption, he is the man to watch.

His supporters say that if he wins the presidency in February, it will show Nigeria's democracy is in good shape in the world's first big election of 2023.

Sky News had rare access to the Labour Party candidate during a brief visit to London.

He is, he said, the change agent in this election.

""We're trying to say, and everybody can see, especially the youth, that something's wrong and everyone can see that the country cannot continue on this trajectory leading to nowhere,"" he said.

There is a buzz around Mr Obi. He had come to address a foreign policy crowd at Chatham House, the think tank, with an extraordinary 100,000 joining to watch online.

The Georgian square outside was thronged with people waiting for him afterwards, singing and chanting his name. Chatham House does not usually witness such scenes.

His supporters say he is the antidote to what they call ""big man-ism"" in Nigeria - the all-powerful former army general or rich man who takes power through money and influence.

There are questions, however, about undeclared offshore companies he's reported to own and his campaign manager was convicted of money laundering. He was dismissive of them.

His affairs are all transparent, he said, wrapped up in a trust, and as for the disgraced team official: ""Whatever happened with him, it's an issue that happened before he became my campaign manager.""

There are far bigger questions about the financial integrity of his opponents.

Mr Obi is taking on the big powerful interests of Nigerian politics, and comes from the Ibo minority, which has never had one of its own in the top job.

He admits to being daunted but says he is prepared for the role and believes Nigeria's problems need solving.

And he says British people should care about this election, too.

""We have 200 million people, which is a huge market for Britain. And it's critical for Britain - as they leave the European Union they need Commonwealth members,"" he said.

The country he wants to run faces enormous challenges: runaway inflation, soaring unemployment and endemic corruption.

It is threatened by separatist groups and jihadist insurgencies. He says he will sit down and talk with agitators and govern with compassion.

Paul Arkwright, the former British high commissioner in Nigeria, said the county needs a new sense of direction.

""I'm afraid it's in quite a mess and there's a sense of paralysis almost in Nigeria,"" he said.

""I do think that a fresh voice, someone coming in with new ideas, could make that difference and that matters to the UK.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117211720/http://news.sky.com/story/peter-obi-the-antidote-to-big-man-ism-who-could-be-nigerias-next-president-12788964;skynews;politics;1643
4852;4852;‘Self-healing’ Roman concrete could aid modern construction, study suggests;2023-01-06T19:00:07Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Science', 'Geology', 'Heritage', 'Culture', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'Architecture', 'World news'];;They have stood through the fall of an empire, the carnage of great wars and the foundation of a new country. But quite why structures made using Roman concrete are so durable has remained something of a mystery. Now researchers say they have discovered one possible explanation: the technique used to make the material may have helped to give it self-healing properties. “The Pantheon would not exist without the concrete as it was in the Roman time,” said Admir Masic, MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering and the lead author of the paper. But, he added, despite the Roman author and philosopher Pliny the Elder noting that concrete could become stronger with age, it is unlikely the Romans were aware of the chemistry involved – or just how long the material would endure. “They knew that was a great material, but they probably didn’t know that it would last thousands of years,” said Masic. Roman concrete was produced using lumps of volcanic rock and other aggregates held together with a mortar made with ingredients including a pozzolan (such as volcanic ash), a lime source (calcium oxide) and water. Among previous explanations for the strength of the material, researchers have revealed that concrete from Roman breakwaters and piers contain the minerals aluminous tobermorite and phillipsite that helped to reinforce to concrete. Now researchers say it appears techniques used to prepare Roman concrete might also help explain why it has stood the test of time. Writing in the journal Science Advances, Masic and colleagues note that samples of Roman concrete contain small lumps known as lime clasts that are not found in modern structures. While these have previously been explained as arising from poor mixing of the mortar or other errors, the team suspected there could be other reasons. They examined a sample of Roman concrete from a wall in the ancient city of Privernum near Rome, revealing that the lime clasts within it contain different forms of calcium carbonate, some of which tend to arise in conditions where water is not freely available. The team found the clasts were porous with cracks, which also suggested they were formed in a high temperature, low water environment. The researchers say this suggests the quicklime was not mixed with water before it was added to the other ingredients. Instead, it is likely it was added to the ash and aggregates first, before water was added. This approach is known as “hot mixing” because of the heat produced. The team add that these high temperatures would not only have helped the mortar to set, but would have reduced the water content in and around the lime clasts, explaining their results. The team propose the resulting lime clasts could have helped the concrete “self heal”, as water seeping into cracks in the material would dissolve calcium carbonate as it passed through the lime clasts. The fracture in the concrete could then self-heal either by this calcium-rich fluid reacting with volcanic material, or by recrystallisation of the calcium carbonate. Indeed, the team note calcium carbonate filled cracks have recently been found in Roman concrete. To test their theory, Masic and colleagues made Roman-inspired concrete, which they mechanically fractured. They then set the pieces 0.5mm apart and exposed them to flowing water over a 30-day period. Samples that contained lime clasts sealed with newly formed calcite but control samples made without lime clasts remained fractured. Masic said the Roman approach could prove useful in modern construction. “Roman-inspired approaches, based for example on hot mixing, might be a cost-effective way to make our infrastructure last longer through the self-healing mechanisms we illustrate in this study,” he said.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/06/self-healing-roman-concrete-could-aid-modern-construction-study-suggests;guardian;science & technology;4852
3750;3750;Football transfer rumours: Messi to join Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia?;2023-01-13T10:20:44Z;['Will Magee'];['Football', 'Lionel Messi', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Sport', 'Transfer window'];;"As January rolls on depressingly, so too does Saudi Arabia’s efforts to buy the concept of sport. Having lured Cristiano Ronaldo to Al Nassr with a massive amount of money the promise of “a new challenge”, the kingdom has now set its sights on Lionel Messi. Already a tourism ambassador for the country – and, as such, unlikely to be swayed by pesky moral objections over human rights and sportswashing – Messi is wanted by Al Nassr’s Riyadh rivals, Al Hilal. With Saudi Arabia expected to bid for the 2030 World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt, signing Messi would be a PR coup that, according to Mundo Deportivo, Al Hilal and their backers would value at around $300m a year. Al Hilal are keen to sign Messi this month, though whether his current employers, Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain, would be happy to let one of their superstars leave six months before the end of his contract is another question. PSG will play a friendly against a team made up of players from Al Nassr and Al Hilal next week, so they can always thrash out the details then. The French league leaders could lose another player before the month is out, with Wolves keen on Pablo Sarabia. He has worked with Julen Lopetegui before, most notably with Spain’s youth teams, and with 18 months left on his contract he should be relatively affordable.
Moving on to a former PSG player, Lucas Moura looks destined to leave Tottenham on a free transfer in the summer after the club declined to trigger an option to extend his contract by another year. They are interested in Leandro Trossard as a potential replacement, though Brighton would rather keep their squad together this month as they chase the dream of European football. Meandering down the south coast, Southampton are considering a move for James Bree, the Luton defender, after Tino Livramento suffered a setback in his return from an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Nathan Jones knows Bree well from their time together at Kenilworth Road, though he has also been credited with an interest in Celtic’s Josip Juranovic. Rounding off the Premier League’s south coast trifecta, Bournemouth may look to re-sign Arnaut Danjuma. While his first spell at Dean Court was a mixed bag, he has since gone on to impress for Villarreal in La Liga. He has previously expressed his willingness to return to England, which bodes well. Given his familiarity with the club, Bournemouth are confident of securing an initial loan until the end of the season with a view to a potential extension. The outlook is less positive for clubs interested in Youssoufa Moukoko, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle reportedly among them. According to Sky Germany, there has been a breakthrough in his contract talks with Borussia Dortmund and he could now stay at the Westfalenstadion. He is in line for a new four-year contract, which should dampen speculation over his future.

1050;1050;National Grid stands down coal power plants readied to help France;2023-01-26T17:17:35Z;['Jasper Jolly', 'Alex Lawson'];['Energy industry', 'National Grid', 'Business', 'Utilities', 'Drax', 'EDF Energy', 'Fossil fuels', 'UK news', 'Yorkshire'];;National Grid has stood down coal-fired power stations that had been instructed to warm up on Thursday after France’s network operator sounded the alarm over the impact of strike action. Two units at Drax in Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Nottinghamshire were asked to fire up just before midnight on Wednesday. The West Burton unit was stood down at 5.13am, and the Drax units were later also informed they would not be called into action. It was the third time in a week that the National Grid’s Electricity Supply Operator (ESO) had asked coal-fired stations to warm up in case they were necessary. The units have been placed on standby as a contingency plan amid fears over blackouts this winter. National Grid has been active in balancing the UK’s energy supplies in recent days as it copes with colder, less windy weather, which pushes up energy use and causes power generation from wind to drop. However, the ESO said the latest warm-up instruction was not a response to the recent UK cold snap. Instead it came after the French grid operator RTE said assistance may be required after it was informed of strike action affecting electricity generation on Thursday that “could place their network in an alert status”. It was later decided they were no longer needed “following analysis of network margins”. Britain’s electricity supplies are connected to France through subsea interconnector cables, which allow power to flow between the countries when there is demand. The ESO said the coal plants would have been available to help generate power for France only if they were not needed to prevent power cuts in Great Britain. National Grid has also been running its demand flexibility service for the first time this month outside trials. The service involves energy suppliers paying some households with smart meters for energy reductions, helping to reduce peak demand, which means it has less need to draw on more polluting energy sources when energy use rises in the evenings. Some businesses were already paid to reduce energy use. In total, National Grid is expected to pay just over £3m to suppliers for the service on two days this week, with about £850,000 on Monday and £2.1m for the longer session on Tuesday. In the future, the service is likely to be much more widespread and electric cars and home batteries will play an increasing role in balancing the grid. Drax, the owner of the Yorkshire units, and West Burton, which is owned by France’s EDF, agreed in the summer to extend the lives of their coal-fired generation units through the winter in exchange for fees as the UK government looked to shore up energy supplies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The two plants had been due to close their coal operations in the autumn to reduce use of the more polluting fuel, but Drax and EDF agreed to keep them open until at least March if needed by National Grid. An ESO spokesperson said: “In support of mutual co-operation between Great Britain and its neighbouring electricity networks the ESO answered France’s request for additional GB generation to be able to provide assistance today if required by warming the contingency coal units. “The ESO was able to take this action to support the French network in avoiding consumer disconnections, as the GB network is currently operating as normal and this action would not have placed GB consumers at risk. Following further assessment of network margins in both countries the ESO has now stood down these coal units.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/26/national-grid-coal-power-stations-standby-cold-edf;guardian;business & economy;1050
4043;4043;Legendary rock guitarist Jeff Beck dies aged 78;2023-01-11T22:01:22Z;"[""Shaad D'Souza""]";['Jeff Beck', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'UK news'];;"Jeff Beck, the celebrated guitarist who played with the Yardbirds and led the Jeff Beck Group, has died aged 78, his representative has confirmed. Beck died on Tuesday after “suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis”, the representative confirmed. “His family ask for privacy while they process this tremendous loss,” they added.
Often described as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Beck – whose fingers and thumbs were famously insured for £7m – was known as a keen innovator. He pioneered jazz-rock, experimented with fuzz and distortion effects and paved the way for heavier subgenres such as psych rock and heavy metal over the course of his career. He was an eight-time Grammy winner, recipient of the Ivor Novello for outstanding contribution to British music and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame both as a solo artist and as a member of the Yardbirds. Musicians and longtime friends began paying tribute minutes after the news broke. On Twitter, Jimmy Page wrote, “The six stringed Warrior is no longer here for us to admire the spell he could weave around our mortal emotions. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal. His technique unique. His imaginations apparently limitless. Jeff I will miss you along with your millions of fans.” “With the death of Jeff Beck we have lost a wonderful man and one of the greatest guitar players in the world,” Mick Jagger wrote. “We will all miss him so much.”
Rod Stewart, who toured with the Jeff Beck Group in the late 60s, called him “one of the few guitarists that when playing live would actually listen to me sing and respond ... you were the greatest, my man. Thank you for everything.”
Gene Simmons called it “heartbreaking news … no one played guitar like Jeff. Please get ahold of the first two Jeff Beck Group albums and behold greatness. RIP.” “Now Jeff has gone, I feel like one of my band of brothers has left this world, and I’m going to dearly miss him,” Ronnie Wood tweeted. Ozzy Osbourne tweeted, “I can’t express how saddened I am to hear of Jeff Beck’s passing. What a terrible loss for his family, friends & his many fans. It was such an honour to have known Jeff and an incredible honor to have had him play on my most recent album.”
Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour wrote, “I am devastated to hear the news of the death of my friend and hero Jeff Beck, whose music has thrilled and inspired me and countless others for so many years … He will be forever in our hearts.” Johnny Marr called him “a pioneer and one of the all time greats”, while Whitesnake’s David Coverdale wrote, “Oh, My Heart … RIP, Jeff … I miss you already”. The Kinks’ Dave Davies tweeted, “I’m heartbroken he looked in fine shape to me. Playing great he was in great shape. I’m shocked and bewildered … it don’t make sense I don’t get it. He was a good friend and a great guitar player.” Many famed guitarists paid tribute to Beck’s prowess and influence. ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons described Beck as a “wondrous soul” who “was able to show me how this guitar playing thing should be approached.” Living Colour’s Vernon Reid said there was “always space for him to grow,” while Aerosmith’s Joe Perry described him as “the Salvador Dali of guitar.” “Jeff Beck was punk rock before punk existed and one of the most inventive guitar players of all time,” wrote U2’s The Edge. “He set a very high bar for all of us who followed. His legend will live on.” Queen’s Brian May said he was “gutted” to hear the news: “He was the Guv’nor. He was inimitable, irreplaceable - the absolute pinnacle of guitar playing. And a damn fine human being.”
Beck was born Geoffrey Beck in 1944, in Wallington, south London. As a child, he sang in a church choir, and began playing guitar as a teenager, getting his first instrument after trying to dupe a music store in a hire-purchase scheme. “There was this guy, he wasn’t old enough to be my dad but he offered to be my guarantor. He said, ‘I’ll tell them I’m your stepfather’,” he told the New Statesman in 2016. “Within a month, they’d sussed out he was nothing to do with me whatsoever and they snatched the guitar back. My dad went along and explained that we couldn’t afford it – so they waived the rest of the payments and I got the guitar.” After briefly attending art school in London, Beck began playing with Screaming Lord Sutch until, after Eric Clapton left the Yardbirds, Jimmy Page recommended Beck as his replacement. Although already successful by that time, the Yardbirds had many of their biggest hits during Beck’s short tenure in the band, including the 1966 album Yardbirds and the No 3 single Shapes of Things. Beck was only in the Yardbirds for 20 months, leaving the group in 1966 due to inter-band tensions that had arisen during a US tour. (Later, he would say that “every day was a hurricane in the Yardbirds”.) In 1968, Beck released Truth, his debut solo album, which drew on blues and hard rock to form a prototypical version of heavy metal. One year later, he released an album with the Jeff Beck Group, Beck-Ola but had his solo career derailed after he suffered a head injury in a car accident. In 1970, after recovering from his skull fracture, Beck formed a new incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group, and released two records – 1971’s Rough and Ready and 1972’s Jeff Beck Group – which displayed his earliest forays into the jazz fusion sound he would become known for. In the mid-70s, Beck supported John McLaughlin’s jazz-rock group Mahavishnu Orchestra on tour, an experience that radically changed how he saw music. “Watching [McLaughlin] and the sax player trading solos, I thought, ‘This is me’,” he said in 2016. Inspired, Beck embraced jazz fusion fully on the George Martin-produced Blow By Blow. A platinum-selling hit in the US which peaked at No 4, it was Beck’s most commercially successful album ever, but he later expressed regret. “I shouldn’t have done Blow By Blow,” he told Guitar Player in 1990. “I wish I had stayed with earthy rock’n’roll. When you’re surrounded with very musical people like Max Middleton and Clive Chaman, you’re in a prison, and you have to play along with that.”
Despite his later feelings about Blow By Blow, Beck continued to experiment throughout the 70s, releasing another platinum-selling jazz fusion album, Wired, in 1976, and There and Back, in 1980. “He embraced project after project with limitless energy and enthusiasm,” Robert Plant said in a statement. “He cooked up magic through all the passing eras, always up for the next, unknown, unlikely collision.” Beck’s output slowed dramatically in the 80s, in part due to his suffering from tinnitus. His projects through the decade were sporadic but notable: in 1981, he performed with Clapton, Sting and Phil Collins at Amnesty International’s Secret Policeman’s Other Ball benefit concerts, and returned with his first solo album in five years, Flash, in 1985. Produced by Chic’s Nile Rodgers, it presented a dramatic shift for Beck in that it primarily featured vocal-led pop tracks, a change from his largely instrumental 70s output. People Get Ready, a collaboration with Rod Stewart, became one of Beck’s rare hit singles under his own name, charting in the US, New Zealand, Sweden, Belgium and Switzerland. The 1989 album Jeff Beck’s Guitar Shop was his last solo album for a decade, but he remained active through the 90s, collaborating with Jon Bon Jovi, Kate Bush and Roger Waters, among others; in 1999, he released Who Else, which incorporated techno and electronic elements. In the 2000s and 2010s, Beck only released a handful of albums, but began to settle into his role as an elder statesman and lauded influence, performing with artists such as Kelly Clarkson and Joss Stone. He lived on an East Sussex estate since 1976, and married his second wife, Sandra Cash, in 2005. Beck’s most recent project was last year’s 18, a collaborative album with Johnny Depp that featured original songs penned by Depp and covers of Marvin Gaye, the Velvet Underground and other classic artists. The album was widely panned; in a two-star review, the Guardian’s Michael Hann described it as a “peculiar and hugely uneven record,” while noting that “it’s to Beck’s credit that alone among the guitar heroes of the 1960s UK R&B boom, he has not retreated into coffee-table blues.” Other musicians to pay tribute to Beck included the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson, who wrote that he was a “genius guitar player.” Billy Idol described him as “sublime”, and said he was “glad I was alive to hear him play.” Stevie Van Zandt called Beck a “major influence” and “an infinite source of joy my entire lifetime.” Joe Satriani said that Beck was “a genius, a stunning original.” “He was an astounding guitar player with more ways to make you go, ‘WTF was that?’ than anybody else. He was profoundly talented, and never stopped innovating on the instrument.” • This article was amended on 12 January 2023. Sandra Cash was Beck’s second wife, not his sixth as an earlier version said; and Beck-Ola was released in 1969, not 1971.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/12/legendary-rock-guitarist-jeff-beck-dies-aged-78;guardian;entertainment & culture;4043
8992;8992;Why dogs attack: From TikTok trends to lockdown habits, what could be behind the rise in fatal dog bites;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:34, UK;[];['animals'];['habits', 'fatal', 'dog', 'death', 'lockdown', 'dr', 'stressed', 'tulloch', 'killed', 'videos', 'tiktok', 'dogs', 'bites', 'attack', 'bescoby', 'trends', 'rise', 'attacks'];"As January drew to a close, there had already been two fatal dog attacks in 2023.

Dog walker Natasha Johnston was mauled to death in Caterham and a four-year-old girl was killed in a back garden in Milton Keynes.

Before 2022, that would have been more than halfway to the average number of dog-related deaths, which sat at 3.3 from 2001 to 2021.

Then in 2022, the number shot up: 10 people were killed by dogs.

It’s too early to say whether the death rate is an anomaly or the start of a shocking trend - but experts say something has changed in the way humans and dogs interact.

What the numbers say

In the last 20 years, the number of adults needing hospital treatment after a dog bite has tripled.

The dog population has increased, but not enough to account for that huge jump - which means dogs are biting humans more than they used to. It's adults in particular where the change is seen.

Dr John Tulloch, a vet and epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool who researches dog-related injuries and deaths, said dog bite rates also vary widely by location.

Merseyside had the highest incidence of dog bites, along with Wakefield, Middlesbrough and the north east generally, while Greater London had the lowest.

""On the whole, the shared common feature is that they are areas with high levels of social deprivation,"" Dr Tulloch told Sky News.

Hospital data also shows most attacks happen at home: 80% when it comes to adults and 90% for children.

What the numbers don’t say

When people are bitten at home, it’s likely by their pet or another dog known to them. This can make people reluctant to report it for fear of the dog being put down or criminal charges being laid for owning a dangerously out-of-control dog, Dr Tulloch said.

Rosie Bescoby, a clinical animal behaviourist, told Sky News it could be difficult to pinpoint what spurred fatal attacks when dogs are often quickly euthanised afterwards.

“What that means is we then have nothing to assess, so we can't assess the dog to determine what might have caused it.

“And we can't ever learn, really, from these fatal attacks because the biggest clue in the whole scenario is dead.”

Dangerous TikTok trends

Advice from unqualified dog trainers on TikTok could be fueling aggression, Ms Bescoby said, “because they give a kind of DIY approach to potentially quite dangerous problems”.

Take videos recommending choke chains, for example. People might use them to control a dog’s defensive behaviour when actually the animal is anxious or stressed, without addressing the root cause.

Instead, the tactic creates a “ticking time bomb” where the animal can only suppress its reaction for so long before “we get the explosion”, she said.

Social media has changed our relationship with dogs, Dr Tulloch said. It’s hard to define exactly how that is linked to an increase in dog bites, but he frequently sees videos of dogs on TikTok where they look stressed.

“There was a recent trend, for example, of people staring into their dog's eyes for as long as they possibly could.

“And in all of those videos, the dogs were looking really, really uncomfortable. And it would not have surprised me if any of those videos had ended in someone being bitten.”

Photos of babies placed in dogs’ beds may look cute, Dr Tulloch warned, but parents risk upsetting the dog and putting their child in harm’s way if the dog is stressed by having its space invaded.

Pandemic puppies

It’s difficult to quantify the effect of the pandemic, but lockdown could have changed the relationship between dogs and their owners, Dr Tulloch said.

With people at home more - even after lockdown ended - a dog might have lost the safe space it retreated to when stressed, potentially leading to more frustration and anxiety. Opportunities for socialising dogs were also lost.

The demand for puppies in lockdown led to poor breeding, Ms Bescoby said.

Puppies who were not from “behaviorally solid dogs” may show behavioural problems, while unhealthy dogs “are much more likely to suffer and feel stressed and frustrated”.

Attack warning signs

When a dog bites, it’s the “last resort”, Dr Tulloch said. It’s likely the dog will have shown warning signs it’s anxious or uncomfortable.

“It could be smacking its lips or showing the whites of its eyes, or sort of further down the line would be showing its teeth.”

He stressed how important it is not to leave children alone with dogs as a child will not be able to read the warning signs a dog is uncomfortable as well as an adult.

Deed not breed

There’s a compulsion to fixate on the breed of dogs when attacks happen, Ms Bescoby said, but it is better to focus on “deed not breed”.

“The Dangerous Dogs Act and the prohibited breeds on it haven't reduced dog attacks. It's not the answer,” she said.

Dr Tulloch agreed: “One thing that I would say is that any breed is capable of biting.”

It’s difficult to draw conclusions about how and if breeds correlate to attack rates because dog population statistics are “very poor” overall and in the vast majority of attacks are not noted on medical or death records.

While larger, strong dogs may have the power to do more damage, Dr Tulloch noted that people have had “very significant injuries from very small dogs”.

How to reverse the trend

Dr Tulloch wants dog attacks to be seen as a public health crisis, but said because they don’t clearly fall under anyone’s remit nobody in government has taken it on.

“It can't just be just education or just legislation is going to have to be a combination of things and ensuring … consistent messaging and everyone's on the same page with it.”

There are some simple fixes, he said, such as banning letter boxes from ground height to prevent some of the 32 attacks on postal workers that happen each week.

Ms Bescoby said breeding and importing dogs needed attention, as well as how the dog training industry is regulated because at the moment anyone can call themselves a behaviourist and potentially give out harmful advice.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/why-dogs-attack-from-tiktok-trends-to-lockdown-habits-what-could-be-behind-the-rise-in-fatal-dog-bites-12800551;skynews;entertainment & culture;3083
881;881;‘Brazil was asleep’: as the rains come, hope reawakens for the Amazon ;2023-01-27T13:13:48Z;['Jonathan Watts'];['Brazil', 'Amazon rainforest', 'Deforestation', 'Americas', 'Conservation', 'Environment', 'Trees and forests', 'Indigenous peoples', 'World news', 'Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva'];;"Awe-inspiring storms roll in almost every night during the Amazon rainy season, replenishing the Xingu River and illuminating the night sky with jags of lightning. This is a period when the forest swells with life. Lustrous pale green shoots burst from every plant, bustling the canopy upwards and outwards. At night, the volume rises a few decibels as a new generation of insects and frogs join the chorus of the dark hours. Even the howler monkeys’ otherworldly audio undulations last longer and reverberate louder. This January, there is also reason to believe humans might participate in this annual revitalisation of life, rather than plotting to dig up the forest or burn it down as was the case 12 months ago. In fact, whisper it quietly, but some of those involved in forest conservation are daring to express a feeling that was until recently feared extinct: hope. Optimism may seem misplaced, just weeks after an insurrectionist mob rampaged through the centres of power in Brasília demanding that the army stage a coup to oust the new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The immediate response was shock, outrage and then relief that the attempted putsch by ultra-right Bolsonaristas in the capital, nearly 1,250 miles (2,000km) from my home here in Altamira, failed. And then, a feeling of renewal – a core principle of nature and democracy.
The positive changes have come thick and fast. A new cabinet was sworn in that – in terms of diversity of race, age, gender and colour – resembled a vivid forest instead of the grey suburb represented by the Bolsonaro-era lineup of old white men in suits and military uniforms. The country’s first Indigenous minister in 500 years, Sônia Guajajara, said she wanted to “Indigenise politics and reforest minds”. She took office wearing a headdress, joyfully rattling a maraca and promising to look beyond narrow business interests and human electoral cycles. “We are not the only ones who need to live here. We just cohabit Mother Earth along with millions of other species,” she said. For the first time, the head of the Funai Indigenous affairs agency is a woman and Indigenous. The respected lawyer Joênia Wapichana replaces a white man with a military background who oversaw the running down of protections and the invasions of Indigenous territories by illegal miners, loggers and fishers.
In congress, the newly elected Indigenous deputy Célia Xakriabá spoke of a turning point: “Reforestation is when we reawaken hope in people who were asleep. Brazil wasn’t dead, Brazil was asleep.” She expressed determination to change the culture of the legislature: “Congress will no longer be grey. It will be the same colour as us, the colour of genipap and annatto.” This honeymoon mood will, no doubt, run up against political reality. But the euphoria is not blind. Indigenous people in Brazil are more aware than anyone that territory and rights assumed one day can be stolen away the next. It is why Indigenous thinkers such as Ailton Krenak say first peoples are particularly well equipped to deal with the climate crisis because they have been living with apocalypse for centuries. But this time, Indigenous people are in a position of power. They have a public platform and Lula has promised to give them more territory, not just for reasons of historical justice but because he recognises they are the most effective stewards of nature. Lula and his environment minister, Marina Silva, have set a goal of zero deforestation and stated a willingness to use the power of the state to prevent further invasions of protected lands and biomes. Farmers have been told they must revitalise degraded land if they want to plant more crops. This is an astonishing break with the past. For hundreds of years, Brazil’s entire raison d’être in the global capitalist economy has been the exploitation of natural resources. It is hard to think of any government in any country with a more ambitious nature agenda.
The prospect is alarming for Amazonian frontier towns such as Altamira, where people voted overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro and some claimed – with no evidence – that Lula had stolen the election, demonstrating for months afterwards outside the army barracks. The protest tents are gone now, cleared by police after the insurrection. But fear, resentment and the threat of violent resistance will remain unless Lula can demonstrate there is a better alternative. This is where international money and support are crucial. Brazil must be recognised as a biodiversity superpower, home to more terrestrial species than any other country, and rewarded for the role it plays in maintaining ecosystems and keeping the climate stable. There are glimmers of hope. At the recent United Nations biodiversity conference in Montreal, rich nations promised $30bn (£24bn) a year by 2030 to help developing countries achieve their share of a new global commitment to protect 30% of nature. The scale of ambition and the sums of money are far more than anything that came before.
I was one of the few journalists at the previous goal-setting biodiversity conference in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010. Back then, the science denial movement was at its zenith, international cooperation looked fragile, and outside of a small group of experts there was little sense of crisis or urgency. Expectations were so low that when an agreement was finally cobbled together, the relief in the conference centre was palpable. The Brazilian delegation, which had helped bridge the gap between rich and poor nations, cheered and sang. But it proved a hollow deal. Indigenous communities had little say in the outcome. There was not enough funding, transparency, or penalties for shirkers. As a result, not one of the Aichi biodiversity targets agreed in Nagoya was ever achieved. Will the Montreal deal be any better? Compared with the past it is an improvement. Compared with what is needed, it is nowhere near enough. Eventually, the goal must be for Brazil and other ecosystem-rich countries to receive more revenue from maintaining their biomes than from clearing them. Farmers need to become stewards. Forests must be worth more alive than dead. This requires a transition to a “nature positive” economy – a challenge akin to the more familiar “net zero” shift from fossil fuels to clean energy, though it lags much further behind. For that to happen, there needs to be more understanding of the role nature, however distant, plays in all our lives. Looking out across the Xingu, the interplay between the forest and the sky is evident. The trees create their own weather. I am not sure if Amazonian storms are more intense but they are definitely more frequent than anywhere I have lived before. About 70% of the world’s 1.4bn lightning flashes a year occur over land in the tropics. Many are probably caused by the forest, according to Nasa scientists, who believe the growth of plants flicks the regional monsoon switch by creating storms at the start of the rainy season and changing the direction of winds. Other scientists see the Amazon as a giant pump. The Brazilian climatologist Antonio Nobre explains how the evapotranspiration of billions of trees creates “flying rivers” that channel enormous volumes of water across much of South America and influence the trade winds over the Caribbean and Atlantic. For him, the Amazon acts as one of the world’s vital organs. Not the lungs, as is often mistakenly claimed; much more like the heart.
That is surely worth maintaining. But this heart is now beating less strongly. The Amazon has lost 17% of its area and is generating less rain. If deforestation reaches 20%, there is a risk of system failure: the rainforest will dry up and become scrubland. One of Lula’s first acts as president was to propose Brazil host the United Nations climate summit Cop30 in the Amazonian city of Belém at the end of 2025. That will be three years into his four-year term – a good moment to judge hopes for a turning point in Brazil and the world. We cannot yet say whether it will inspire renewal or more conflict. At the very least, the storms will be spectacular.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/27/brazil-amazon-hope;guardian;environment;881
2061;2061;Nadhim Zahawi fights for his political life after admitting tax ‘error’;2023-01-21T19:17:15Z;['Michael Savage', 'Anna Isaac', 'Jon Ungoed-Thomas'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Tax and spending'];;"Nadhim Zahawi was battling to save his political career on Saturday night after he finally admitted reaching a tax settlement with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) following an “error” over a controversial multimillion-pound shareholding in the polling company YouGov. In a carefully worded statement, Zahawi appeared to confirm that HMRC had carried out an investigation into his financial affairs while he was serving as chancellor last summer. Zahawi, now the Tory party chairman, said that the tax authority had concluded that he had made a “careless but not deliberate” error.
“So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do,” he stated. Tax experts said the statement was a tacit acknowledgment that Zahawi had paid a penalty. The admission raises questions for Rishi Sunak over what he knew about the settlement and when. It comes with the prime minister already under pressure after being fined for not wearing a seatbelt, with MPs also unhappy over his rejection of tax cuts and the government’s allocation of levelling up funds. In an attempt to protect Sunak, Zahawi added: “When I was appointed by the prime minister, all my tax affairs were up to date.” Zahawi’s tax affairs were thrown into the spotlight last summer when he was appointed chancellor by Boris Johnson, the day before Johnson was forced to resign. The Observer reported that civil servants in the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team had alerted Johnson to an HMRC “flag” over Zahawi before his appointment, but it had been ignored. Zahawi faced scrutiny on a tranche of shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded, which were held by a Gibraltar company, Balshore Investments, and sold for about £27m between 2006 and 2018. It was estimated by the thinktank Tax Policy Associates he may have avoided £3.7m capital gains tax on the sale of these shares. Saturday’s statement immediately set off new demands for Britain’s most senior civil servant and parliament’s standards commissioner to launch separate investigations into the affair, after questions over whether Zahawi has made the correct declarations to officials and parliament concerning his financial interests. Zahawi has still not disclosed the size of the HMRC settlement or confirmed he paid a penalty. It follows a Guardian report that he paid about £5m in relation to the sale of shares in YouGov. Unlike his YouGov co-founder, Stephan Shakespeare, Zahawi took no shares in YouGov. However, a 42.5% shareholding was held by Balshore Investments, an offshore trust controlled by Zahawi’s parents. As YouGov grew in value, Balshore sold all the shares by 2018. Zahawi said his father took shares “in exchange for some capital and his invaluable guidance”. He added that while HMRC agreed that his father was entitled to shares, it “disagreed about the exact allocation. They concluded that this was a ‘careless and not deliberate’ error.” Zahawi said HMRC had agreed he had never set up an offshore structure, including Balshore Investments, and that “I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments”. When asked on Saturday night, his team would not comment on whether he had ever benefited from Balshore Investments in the past. Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer and founder of Tax Policy Associates, said: “When I first reported this, he denied it, threatened to sue me and said throughout his tax affairs were in order. It is a disgrace.” Opposition parties are now demanding the publication of all of Zahawi’s correspondence with HMRC. They are also calling for independent investigations into whether Zahawi made the necessary declarations to officials and parliament. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, is facing calls to oversee an investigation into whether Zahawi should have declared any links relating to YouGov or Balshore under the ministerial code. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, has written to Case, calling for his intervention. Cooper said: “Zahawi and his Conservative cabinet colleagues are arrogantly trying to brush this under the carpet. There are facts that still need to be established so there must be an independent investigation to get to the bottom of this. The British public has lost all faith in Conservative ministers to tell the truth after years of scandal.” Meanwhile, Labour has also written to Daniel Greenberg, the new parliamentary commissioner for standards, asking whether Zahawi should have declared Balshore Investments in the public register of members’ interests. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour chair, said Zahawi’s new remarks raised more questions. “This carefully worded statement blows a hole in Nadhim Zahawi’s previous accounts of this murky affair,” she said. “He must now publish all correspondence with HMRC so we can get the full picture. In the middle of the biggest cost of living crisis in a generation, the public will rightly be astonished that anyone could claim that failing to pay millions of pounds worth of tax is a simple matter of ‘carelessness’.” She added: “Nadhim Zahawi still needs to explain when he became aware of the investigation, and if he was chancellor and in charge of our tax system at the time.” Several senior ministers have defended Zahawi, including the prime minister. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Sunak said Zahawi had “already addressed this matter in full and there’s nothing more that I can add”.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/21/nadim-zahawi-fights-for-his-political-life-after-admitting-tax-error;guardian;politics;2061
6195;6195;Openly transgender woman set to be executed for the first time in US history;Tuesday 3 January 2023 07:29, UK;[];['transgender'];['history', 'set', 'missouri', 'killing', 'girlfriend', 'death', 'executed', 'transgender', 'court', 'woman', 'gender', 'issues', 'hicklin', 'mclaughlin', 'openly'];"An openly transgender woman is set to be executed for the first time in US history.

Unless Missouri governor Mike Parson grants clemency, Amber McLaughlin will die by lethal injection for killing a former girlfriend in 2003.

Before transitioning, the 49-year-old was in a relationship with girlfriend Beverly Guenther.

But when it turned sour, according to court records, McLaughlin began stalking Ms Guenther going to the office where she worked and sometimes hiding inside, killing her in November 2003.

She was convicted of first-degree murder in 2006 and sentenced to death.

A court in 2016 ordered a new sentencing hearing, but a federal appeals court panel reinstated the death penalty in 2021.

A clemency request on behalf of McLaughlin focuses on several issues, including her traumatic childhood and mental health issues, which the jury never heard in her trial.

A foster parent rubbed faeces in her face when she was a toddler and her adoptive father used a stun gun on her, according to the petition.

It says she suffers from depression and attempted suicide multiple times.

The petition also includes reports citing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a condition that causes anguish and other symptoms as a result of a disparity between a person's gender identity and their assigned sex at birth.

McLaughlin's lawyer Larry Komp said: ""We think Amber has demonstrated incredible courage because I can tell you there's a lot of hate when it comes to that issue.""

But, he added, McLaughlin's sexual identity was ""not the main focus"" of the clemency request.

There is no known case of a transgender inmate being executed in the US before, according to the anti-execution Death Penalty Information Center.

A friend in prison, Jessica Hicklin, says she saw McLaughlin's personality blossom during her gender transition.

Though imprisoned together for around a decade, she said McLaughlin was so shy they rarely interacted. But as McLaughlin began transitioning about three years ago, she turned to Hicklin for guidance on issues such as mental health counselling and getting help to ensure her safety inside the male-dominated maximum-security prison.

""Definitely a vulnerable person,"" Hicklin said. ""Definitely afraid of being assaulted or victimised, which is more common for trans folks in Department of Corrections.""

The only woman ever executed in Missouri was Bonnie Heady, put to death in 1953, for kidnapping and killing a six-year-old boy.

Heady was executed in a gas chamber, side by side with the other kidnapper and killer, Carl Austin Hall.

Nationally, 18 people were executed in 2022, including two in Missouri.

Kevin Johnson, 37, was put to death for the ambush killing of a Missouri police officer. Carman Deck was executed in May for killing James and Zelma Long during a robbery at their home in De Soto, Missouri.

Another Missouri inmate, Leonard Taylor, is scheduled to die in February for killing his girlfriend and her three young children.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230103083226/http://news.sky.com/story/openly-transgender-woman-set-to-be-executed-for-the-first-time-in-us-history-12778809;skynews;politics;286

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) met at Wembley to discuss the possibility of a trial after a request from world players' union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum to test the protocol in the Premier League, France's Ligue 1 and America's Major League Soccer.

However, Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham, who supported the idea of a trial, said the group could not reach a consensus, saying: ""There were very strong and very different views in the room.""

""We agreed that it would remain under active review,"" he added.

Focus would now be on improving the effective implementation of the permanent concussion substitute protocol, he said.

However, brain injury campaigners believe temporary concussion substitutions would give players the best protection.

Luke Griggs, chief executive of the charity Headway, said it was ""hard to fathom the flawed logic"" behind the latest decision.

""The argument for the continuation of the current system appears to be that permanent concussion substitutes prevent injured players from returning to the pitch and therefore is a safer system.

""But this completely misrepresents the benefits of temporary concussion substitutes.""

He added: ""Temporary subs would allow medics more time to assess a player in the quiet confines of a dressing room.

""As the symptoms of concussion can be delayed in their presentation, a 10-minute assessment will never be perfect, but it is better than giving medics the impossible job of having to make snap judgements within two or three minutes under the intense pressure and glare of tens of thousands of fans in the stadium and millions more watching at home, as is currently the case.""

He also said that if a player does display symptoms having returned to play after passing an off-pitch assessment, there is nothing to stop the temporary substitution being turned into a permanent one.

Bullingham said the concussion debate was the ""longest conversation"" in a meeting which overran by about 90 minutes.

But when asked whether a Premier League trial could still happen next season or had been pushed further away, he said: ""It's been pushed further away.""

The permanent concussion substitute trial will instead continue indefinitely.

The FA had been co-ordinating international efforts to get a temporary concussion trial approved and gathered the other three UK football associations for a meeting on Monday, where it is understood a majority were united in support of a protocol being trialled.

However, the fact that no consensus could be reached indicates FIFA - the other constituent of IFAB - remains convinced that the permanent concussion substitution trial is the best approach.

IFAB is comprised of the four British football associations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) with one vote each, and FIFA, covering the remaining 207 national associations, holding four votes.

FIFA conducted a survey of team doctors that had adopted the trial and found that 71% supported the permanent concussion substitute model.

Pascale Ferrier, 55, admitted to making the poison at her residence in Quebec in September 2020, the US Department of Justice announced. Ferrier placed the ricin in envelopes that included letters addressed to Trump at the White House and to eight Texas law enforcement officials associated with detention facilities where Ferrier had been held. Ricin, a deadly poison, can be made from waste material produced in the processing of castor beans. It can be produced as a powder, mist or liquid, or in pellet form.
In each letter, Ferrier wrote that she included a “special gift”, adding that if it “doesn’t work, I will find a better recipe for another poison”. She also wrote: “or I might use my gun when I will be able to come” and concluded: “Enjoy.” According to court documents, the letter to Trump also stated: “You ruin USA and lead them to disaster. I have US cousins, then I don’t want the next four years with you as president. Give up and remove your application for this election.” The nine envelopes were intercepted in Texas and Washington DC. The Secret Service informed the FBI about the letter to Trump. “Special weapons of mass destruction coordinators and hazardous material experts were required to deploy to various locations where the letters were received, due to the presence of the ricin toxin powder in the envelopes,” court documents said. The letters were sent to a facility in Maryland for further testing. Shortly after the letters were intercepted, Ferrier drove to a border crossing in Buffalo, New York, where she was arrested. According to court documents, asked by border officials if she was OK, Ferrier said she was wanted by the FBI over the ricin letters. Authorities found in her car a loaded firearm, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, two knives, a stun gun, pepper spray, a truncheon and a false ID document. Ferrier pleaded guilty to violating federal prohibitions with respect to biological weapons. As part of a plea deal, she is expected to serve 262 months in prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for 26 April. The case comes amid a concerning rise in political violence towards lawmakers which experts warn endangers the health of US democracy. “There is no place for political violence in our country, and no excuse for threatening public officials or endangering our public servants,” the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew M Graves, said in a statement. “We hope this resolution will serve as a warning that using our mail system to send a toxic substance and other threats of this type will cost you your freedom for many years.” Last November Joe Biden urged Americans to take a stand against political violence. “We are facing a defining moment,” the president said. “We must with one overwhelming, unified voice speak, as a country, and say there’s no place for voter intimidation or political violence in America.” This article was amended on 27 January 2023.

1718;1718;It's ‘something for nothing Britain’ shrieks the Mail. Talk about blaming the victim | Gaby Hinsliff;2023-01-23T16:51:21Z;['Gaby Hinsliff'];['UK news', 'Tax and spending', 'Politics', 'Poverty', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Society', 'Daily Mail', 'Media'];;"If there’s one thing wrong with Britain today, it’s that life is just too damn easy. Our real problem is that we’ve just been too spoiled, too mollycoddled, and now won’t pull our weight. Or so, anyway, parts of the Conservative party would dearly like you to think. A brief analysis by the rightwing thinktank Civitas, concluding that over half of Britons now live in households that receive more from the state in benefits and services than they contribute via taxes, was energetically hyped up by the Daily Mail today as proof of a “something for nothing” culture sweeping the nation, smothering entrepreneurship by some vaguely unexplained means and generally triggering moral decline. “Lockdown changed the psyche of the British people,” the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the paper mournfully. “For all those years we told them you can’t get something for nothing, and all of a sudden they did.” So who could they be, these pampered freeloaders who aren’t contributing their fair share? Surprisingly, the answer isn’t millionaires who make careless but not deliberate mistakes with their taxes which may or may not have needed resolving while they were chancellor. Lapses aside, Civitas points out that the top 10% of earners still contribute 53% of all income tax, a figure that seems to have prompted some outraged Tory MPs to demand tax cuts but is – spoiler alert – how a redistributive tax system works. (The idea that rich people pay more tax than poor people is a feature not a bug, possibly because the alternative – squeezing the poor until the pips squeak, while letting millionaires happily run free – has had an unfortunate tendency to end in revolutions where it has been tried.) But anyway, we must look elsewhere for these people who pay little tax yet consume tons of healthcare, cash benefits and assorted perks in kind. The obvious answer is retired people, perfectly naturally, and that if an ageing country like Britain chooses wilfully to shrink its dwindling labour force further by restricting immigration, it can’t then be shocked to find it has fewer people of working age paying taxes just as it’s facing mounting bills for healthcare and retirement benefits. Pensions are the single biggest item of welfare spending, and typically we use the NHS most heavily in the first and last years of life. Why, it’s almost as if the welfare state was invented to smooth costs across the life cycle, so that people who have either paid their dues all their lives (or will be paying them once they’re no longer actually children) can be carried through the non-earning years with dignity and compassion. But while that’s part of the story, it’s not the whole. Civitas finds that while the poorest working-age households have long been net beneficiaries of the system, now the middle quintile is too. Either they’ve somehow contrived even in the depths of austerity to be lavished with more generous public services than a generation that could still actually get a GP appointment, or else something has gone very wrong for middle earners. The obvious explanation is the pandemic: some workers would have earned less during lockdown and therefore paid less tax, potentially tipping them over from net contributors into net recipients. Theoretically, now that the worst is over, they could just bounce back to becoming net contributors again. But given the OECD predicts Britain will grow more slowly than any other G20 country bar Russia next year, that’s not necessarily a given. The long-term trend, it notes, is a rising dependency ratio: less money coming in, more spending going out. One answer to the perennial puzzle of how a rich country like Britain can sometimes feel broken is that actually we’re no longer that rich. Years of sluggish growth followed by the economic self-harm of Brexit has helped push Britain’s GDP per capita below that of neighbours we’ve always considered our peers, from France and Germany to Canada or Australia. Comparatively high inequality means that although high earners have broadly kept pace with their peers across Europe, on current trends the average British household’s standard of living will fall below that of average households in Slovenia by next year and perhaps below that of average Poles by the end of the decade. To look at those figures and conclude that life is just too cushy in Britain takes some chutzpah, to put it mildly. Our problem isn’t having it too good; it’s years of political infighting, economic sclerosis and perhaps also a stubborn clinging to an image of ourselves that’s now horribly out of date. The only good thing about being so badly governed for so long, mad as that phrase sounds, is that we should still have the capacity to bounce back reasonably strongly under better management. Britain isn’t in the kind of terminal decline that comes from having staked everything on some commodity the world no longer wants, like a goldrush town after the gold is exhausted. It isn’t existentially threatened by war or climate change or natural disasters. It’s a battered but still skilled and resourceful country whose position ought to be recoverable. But only, perhaps, if we can be honest about what that position actually is.

1931;1931;‘Red flags’ raised over scheme to allow families of Pacific Island workers to join them in Australia;2023-01-22T14:00:39Z;['Jordyn Beazley'];['Pacific islands', 'Migration', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Australian foreign policy', 'Australian immigration and asylum', 'South Pacific', 'Asia Pacific', 'Rural Australia'];;"Guest workers from Pacific Island countries will soon be able to relocate their families to Australia, but there are already concerns over “red flags” in the current design of the scheme that may make it unviable. The federal scheme will pilot bringing up to 200 families on one- to four-year contracts starting this year, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. This comes after years of the workers – who fill the gaps in Australia’s agriculture, meat-works and aged care workforces under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme – being separated from their families. However, families who do relocate to Australia would not have access to Medicare, relocation would be at the discretion of the worker’s employer, and the cost of travel and setting up a home would be at the worker’s expense. And while they would have access to the childcare subsidy and family tax benefit, it was still not yet clear whether schools would be free for families Australia-wide, or only in some states.
“There are certain parameters in the way it has been set up which raise a few red flags for me in terms of the likelihood that workers are actually able to bring their families across,” said Matt Withers, an expert on temporary labour migration at Australian National University. Without more government subsidies to help workers who want to bring their families over, Withers said it would undermine the point of the scheme. “It becomes a bit contradictory in that sense if we are loading all of these costs on to the workers themselves in a program that is basically designed to channel remittances back to Pacific Island countries,” says Withers. Kerry McCarthy, who employs about 50 Pasifika under the scheme on her farm in rural Queensland, said her workers had mixed emotions about relocating their families. They wanted to have the connection to their children, she said, but they were also concerned about having less money when their contract ends and they return home. A number of workers use the money earned in Australia to build homes, sometimes lost to natural disasters, or to start businesses. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup McCarthy, alongside Steve Burdette, the executive officer of Approved Employers of Australia, the group of businesses employing workers, is urging the government to give workers and their families access to Medicare to ease some financial burden. “These workers pay tax, they pay the Medicare levy. They are entitled to claim that levy back but many don’t,” McCarthy said. “So a number are paying for it, but aren’t getting any benefits.” Workers are currently required to pay for health insurance, but president of the Pacific Islands Council in Queensland, Emma Vueti, said a number had been out of pocket for pre-existing conditions because insurance didn’t cover that. This includes a number of parents working under the scheme that have had to pay thousands of dollars in hospital fees after giving birth in the first 12 months in Australia.
In advice to workers wanting to use the scheme, Dfat warned families that may fall pregnant while in Australia that they would need to consider if they have sufficient funds to travel home for the birth or pay out-of-pocket hospital costs of up to A$10,000. “It’s important they include pregnancy because we don’t want families to come here then find that it’s too expensive so they have to go and have the baby at home,” Vueti said. How viable it would be for workers to bring their families over also raises equity issues given workers don’t have a choice on where they work in Australia, Withers said. Robert Sivo, who is from Fiji and works in agriculture in a regional hub in New South Wales, is optimistic it will be easier to bring his six children and wife to Australia because he lives in a city. He hopes his wife, who will have the right to work in Australia, will be able to find employment to support the cost. “The reason I want to get them over here is for their safety, because I do worry about them when I’m not there,” he said. “We will try to make the cost OK.” But it will be a challenge for those living in rural areas, particularly accessing services such as childcare and whether or not there are vacant jobs for partners, and also housing. Many workers live in shared accommodation provided by the employer at an affordable cost, but families would probably need to find a private rental, McCarthy said. For the workers McCarthy employs, she said this will be a challenge given low rental vacancy rates in rural areas. “Without rental history, I think it will be difficult for workers to find the rentals without the employer stepping in and taking over some of that responsibility,” she said. •This story was amended on 23 January 2023 to clarify a quote";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/red-flags-raised-over-scheme-to-allow-families-of-pacific-island-workers-to-join-them-in-australia;guardian;politics;1931
4503;4503;The burning question about fungi: what happens to them in extreme heat?;2023-01-09T07:45:10Z;['N/A'];['Fungi', 'Environment', 'Drought', 'Biology', 'Science'];;"When Toby Kiers and a group of fungi experts hiked the Apennine mountains in northern Italy last July, the country was experiencing its worst drought for 70 years. But Kiers, an evolutionary biologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, saw the dried vegetation and burnt forests of the drought- and fire-stricken areas bordering Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna as a unique learning opportunity. Armed with rubber mallets, measuring tape and GPS devices, Kiers and her team were investigating a very particular life form: the bustling fungal life beneath their feet. “What we want to do is track how fungal communities are changing under climate change,” says Kiers. “It will allow us to predict what we need to protect and what we can conserve.” Kiers was not so interested in mushrooms – the fruiting bodies of fungi, which contain spores and take on myriad shapes and sizes. Instead, she wanted to learn more about the complex fungal systems that live below ground, known as mycorrhizal networks.
Mycorrhizal networks are made up of white, thread-like filaments that many scientists believe play countless ecological roles: they may exchange essential nutrients with trees through the roots, help with the absorption and retention of water, protect plants against pathogens, and hold the soil together by acting as a giant underground net. The thread-like system is so vastly multilayered and interconnected that it is sometimes referred to as the “wood-wide web”. It’s still unclear if and how these webs help trees flourish, but Kiers believes that studying these underground networks in such stark conditions could help scientists identify drought-resistant fungi that can help crops thrive and shield plants from the consequences of rapidly rising temperatures. “These fungi can act as ‘biofertilisers’ – they take in phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and give it to the plant,” says Paola Bonfante, former professor of plant biology at the University of Turin.
The research could also help scientists anticipate how fungal communities may adapt to climate change in regions susceptible to droughts and fires. Many European countries – including Spain, Greece and Portugal – as well as other parts of the world experienced devastatingly hot summers last year, with raging fires and unusually long droughts. The initiative is part of a broader project by the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (Spun) to collect more than 10,000 samples of fungi from across the globe. As executive director of Spun, Kiers is working with GlobalFungi and the Crowther Lab to use satellite and big-data analyses to identify biodiversity hotspots where they can sample these mycorrhizal networks. Mycorrhizal networks often develop unique relationships with specific species of trees and ecosystems, and in Italy the team took samples near various trees, including pine, beech, chestnut and hazelnut, and in different locations. Samples were also taken in a recently burnt area, and from a similar location nearby that had not been affected by fire, for comparison. An important question is whether mycorrhizal networks were able to withstand the fire and, if so, how that was possible, says Kiers. To take the samples, the team hammered cylindrical tubes into the soil-containing mycelium – the thin, white strands that constitute a mycorrhizal network – and poured the contents into plastic bags, mixing them thoroughly. Subsamples were then put into plastic tubes and labelled with the geographic coordinates. In the future, Kiers hopes to return to these sites and compare them with those in more temperate ecosystems. “We want to come back in a year, in two years, and resample and try to understand and look at the recovery process,” she says.
In the meantime, the samples have been sent to Matteo Chialva and Prof Luisa Lanfranco, plant biologists at Turin University. They will conduct genetic sequencing tests that will “allow us to know what organism was present underground”, says Chialva. Of the estimated 2.2-3.8m species of fungi on Earth, only about 600 have been evaluated for the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species. Of these, about half are considered threatened. “We’re definitely worried,” says Kiers. “The ultimate goal is to really focus on underground biodiversity and be able to say: this is valuable diversity as well.” Kiers hopes the findings will tell researchers which genes lend fungi their drought-resistant properties and which molecular mechanisms enable them to be resilient.
Scientists already know that some mycelium have flame-retardant properties and others become more efficient at storing water and nutrients when under stress. They also know that mycorrhizal fungi that tend to mingle with crops are probably more resistant to drought than ones that associate with the roots of large forest trees, says Bonfante. In Antarctica, one fungus, Cryomyces antarcticus, stores high quantities of melanin in its cell wall. Melanin, the same pigment that makes human skins more or less dark and protects against ultraviolet radiation, can protect fungi from drought and fire, says Dr Claudia Coleine, a microbiologist at the University of Tuscia, in Viterbo, near Rome, who studies organisms living in extreme environments and was not involved in the project. “We’re starting to understand different molecular mechanisms that allow fungi to survive in extreme conditions,” she says.
Bonfante emphasises that laboratory tests alone will not be enough. “We know a lot about fungi, but mostly what happens inside a petri dish,” she says. Mycorrhizal networks are so deeply interconnected with trees, plants, microbes and other organisms that studying them in isolation means our understanding is limited. Scientists will need to bridge the gap between these two realms by validating their findings in natural settings, she adds.
Kiers agrees. “If we don’t understand what is going on underground and how they’re influencing what we do care about, like chestnut trees and flowers and bees and honey, we’re just missing such a huge part of the picture.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/09/fungi-extreme-heat-aoe;guardian;environment;4503
8744;8744;Scotland's teachers 'won't back down' with strike action amid warning jobs could be lost as councils seek to 'balance their books';Monday 30 January 2023 11:50, UK;[];['scotland'];['scottish', 'lost', 'wont', 'local', 'books', 'union', 'warning', 'strike', 'action', 'eis', 'teachers', 'councils', 'seek', 'remain', 'scotlands', 'jobs'];"A union chief has insisted ""teachers are not going to back down"" as rolling strike action continues into its third week in a dispute over pay.

It comes amid a warning that jobs could be lost next year as councils seek to 'balance their books'.

Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) union began 16 days of industrial action on Monday 16 January.

The protests, which will be held in two of Scotland's 32 local authority areas each day until 6 February, continued in Aberdeenshire and the Borders on Monday.

'Scotland's teachers are not going to back down'

In an update ahead of the fresh week of strikes, EIS General Secretary Andrea Bradley accused the Scottish government and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) of ""inaction"" to settle the dispute.

She said: ""Scotland's teachers have responded magnificently in recent weeks, supporting ongoing strike action in their tens of thousands right across the country.

""On strike days, schools have closed and the streets have been ablaze with the bright green and pink EIS pay campaign colours, with teachers on the picket lines and attending demonstrations and rallies right across Scotland.

""Teachers do not want to be there, and would much rather be in class working to support young people's education - but, having been compelled to take strike action by the inaction of the Scottish government and COSLA on pay, Scotland's teachers are not going to back down.""

Unions have rejected a pay offer which would see most teachers receive a 5% wage rise, although the lowest earners would get an increase of 6.85%.

The Scottish government has previously insisted the 10% rise teachers are demanding is unaffordable.

The EIS has already planned further industrial action on 28 February and 1 March, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between 13 March and 21 April.

COSLA claimed both parties ""still remain a distance apart in terms of a settlement"" amid a warning that jobs could be lost next year as councils seek to 'balance their books'.

Nicola Sturgeon hits out at Tory 'hypocrisy' over teachers' strikes

Councillor Katie Hagmann, COSLA spokesperson for resources, said: ""We remain in discussions with our trade union and Scottish government partners as we endeavour to find areas for agreement.

""Strikes in education are in nobody's interest and all parties are eager to seek a resolution that not only protects the teaching and wider local government workforce, but also our children and young people's educational experience.

""COSLA leaders are clear that given the financial pressures being faced it remains the case that the 10% ask of the trade unions remains unaffordable and therefore we still remain a distance apart in terms of a settlement.

""Given the local government settlement for 23/24, what teachers are asking for, over and above the current offer, is simply not sustainable on a recurring basis.

""Already, councils are considering a range of options to balance the books next year and options will inevitably include a reduction in jobs across all service areas, including schools.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130120221/http://news.sky.com/story/scotlands-teachers-wont-back-down-with-strike-action-amid-warning-jobs-could-be-lost-as-councils-seek-to-balance-their-books-12799109;skynews;business & economy;2835
1430;1430;Australia’s annual inflation hits 7.8% driven partly by surging electricity prices;2023-01-25T02:35:19Z;['Paul Karp'];['Australian economy', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news'];;"Inflation in Australia reached 7.8% in the year to December, in what economists and the federal government hope will be the peak for runaway prices. The consumer price index rose by 1.9% in the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed on Wednesday, driven by surging electricity prices and the cost of holiday travel and accommodation. The 7.8% annual rise is up on the September figure of 7.3% inflation, but just shy of the Reserve Bank’s estimate that inflation would peak at 8%. It marks the highest inflation since 1990 despite hopes that a lower than expected figure in the month of October in part driven by easing shipping costs could mean inflation had peaked.
The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation is “unacceptably high” and “very high by historical standards”. Chalmers told reporters in Canberra this was “likely the peak in inflation but we won’t know that for sure until we get the numbers for this March quarter”. The ABS said the past year had seen “strong quarterly rises off the back of higher prices for food, automotive fuel and new dwelling construction”. The trimmed mean annual inflation, the measure of underlying inflation that excludes large price rises and falls, increased to 6.9%. Rising prices – especially energy and food prices – have prompted a series of eight consecutive interest rate rises from May 2022, as the RBA lifts the cash rate out of emergency levels to push inflation back towards its 2-3% target band. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Despite slowing inflation, economists at ANZ are tipping that the RBA will likely have three more 25 basis-point increases by May to bring the interest rate to 3.85% before the hikes end. In the year to December the most significant price rises were domestic and international holiday travel and accommodation, up 13.3% and 7.6% respectively; electricity, up 8.6%; services, up 5.5%, the highest rise since 2008; and new dwelling purchases by owner occupiers, up 1.7%. Chalmers noted the Australian Energy Market Operator had found that projected electricity prices “fell steeply” after the Albanese government’s $1.5bn energy price relief package temporarily capped gas and thermal coal prices. Chalmers said this “direct link” to Labor’s policy showed the market intervention would “take some of the sting out of energy price rises anticipated in 2023”. He said the direct benefit of the $1.5bn of consumer rebates will be passed on “not too much longer” after the May budget. The ABS also reported “strong” price rises in most food and non-food grocery products, although fruit and vegetable prices fell by 7.3% compared with the previous quarter. Rental price growth in Sydney and Melbourne continued to increase this quarter, with both cities recording their strongest annual rises since 2014 and 2015, the ABS said. Chalmers confirmed that rent assistance, along with jobseeker and single parent payments, remain under “constant review” ahead of the May budget. In a statement on Wednesday, Chalmers said the figures “demonstrate the pressure on the budgets of Australian families brought about by the war in Ukraine, lingering pressures on global supply chains, and other challenges ignored for too long”. “Our economic plan will continue to focus on the inflation challenge, as well as growing the economy the right way in 2023,” he said. “We understand Australians are doing it tough. That’s why we will keep working hard to provide responsible cost-of-living relief, deliver the essential services people rely on, and build a stronger and more resilient economy for the future.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/25/australias-annual-inflation-hits-78-partly-driven-by-surging-electricity-prices;guardian;business & economy;1430
3158;3158;New measures to silence climate activists? They’ll only spur us on | Indigo Rumbelow;2023-01-16T14:39:46Z;['Indigo Rumbelow'];['Just Stop Oil', 'Protest', 'Police', 'Climate crisis', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Law', 'Freedom of speech'];;"On a day when swans were seen swimming through Worcester town centre after the latest flooding, the government has announced new measures to silence those of us pushing for more climate action. The latest restriction on your freedoms involve the police in England and Wales having the power to shut down protests before disruption begins. The proposals will be part of an amendment to the public order bill, which already includes new stop and search powers and creates an offence of “locking on” to things. So far the government has gone out of its way to characterise nonviolent civil resistance and peaceful protest as dangerous and criminal. But we are teachers, nurses, students, parents and grandparents. We act out of care, love and compassion. Now the government is going even further. Alongside the proposed restrictions on workers’ rights to strike, this is a sinister and authoritarian move from cowardly leaders who would prefer to lock us up than grant us all the right to live. The supporters of Just Stop Oil are many different things but what they have in common is a deep concern for the future of humanity and a firm commitment to the principles of nonviolent civil resistance. Resistance is necessary because politics is broken. Our democracy is dead on its feet. All avenues for legitimate protest are being closed, one by one. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act has effectively banned noisy protests. The public order bill bans “slow marching”. How are we to express our dissent? With new electoral laws on the requirement of voter ID discriminating against young people, how can those who will face the brunt of climate breakdown have a voice? The police already have adequate powers to arrest people for obstructing the highway. Blocking roads is already illegal. The proposed powers will give them carte blanche whenever a political demonstration is happening nearby. Standing holding your D-lock about to lock up your bicycle, while being young or black? We know where that might end.
The recent reports about how the US oil company Exxon “privately ‘predicted global warming correctly and skilfully’ only to then spend decades publicly rubbishing such science” shows how, for decades, the cards have been stacked against those of us on humanity’s side. How can we expect justice and honesty from a government that is continuing to offer new oil licences? We can’t expect reason or sanity either. These new legal powers will simply speed up the slow collapse of the justice system. Fair Trials reports that the number of people being held in prison on remand in England and Wales is at its highest for more than 50 years, with 1,800 people being held without trial for at least a year. As I write, 10 Just Stop Oil supporters remain on remand. Just Stop Oil is not a fashionable cause or a protest movement. Our supporters are doing what the suffragettes did and what the civil rights movements did. It’s what everyone does when the inalienable right to life and a livelihood are violated: they engage in direct action. It is an act of self-respect, an act of solidarity, an act of necessity. It matters little what changes legislators make to the laws on peaceful protest or how strongly the police enforce those laws. Just Stop Oil supporters understand that this is irrelevant when set against the future that runaway climate breakdown entails. The government can arrest, fine or incarcerate ordinary people for making their voices heard, or it can take meaningful steps to protect the people of this country by stopping the development of new sources of oil and gas, insulating people’s homes and defending the NHS. This latest clampdown is not going to deter us: if anything, it’ll have the opposite effect. We call on everyone to step up and do whatever is nonviolently possible to resist new fossil fuel exploitation in the UK – and the government’s slide into authoritarianism.

8;8;Andrea Riseborough’s Oscar nomination upheld after academy review;2023-01-31T22:04:06Z;['Benjamin Lee'];['Andrea Riseborough', 'Oscars 2023', 'Film', 'US news', 'Oscars', 'Awards and prizes', 'Culture'];;"Andrea Riseborough’s controversial Oscar nomination will not be taken away after an Academy review. The British actor had been a surprise inclusion in this year’s best actress category for her performance in low-budget drama To Leslie after a last-minute campaign from celebrities including Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Accusations of unfair tactics were raised and the Academy announced an internal review of campaign procedures.
“Based on concerns that surfaced last week around the To Leslie awards campaign, the Academy began a review into the film’s campaigning tactics,” a statement read today. “The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film’s nomination should be rescinded. However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.” In a Los Angeles Times article, it was alleged that the director Michael Morris and his wife, actor Mary McCormack, contacted many celebrity friends to ask them for social media support with many resulting tweets containing similar wording to push the film. Neither of them are Academy members, however. The film’s official account also shared a post that quoted an excerpt from critic Richard Roeper’s best films of the year, which spoke about Cate Blanchett’s performance in Tár in comparison. An official Academy rule states that “any tactic that singles out ‘the competition’ by name or titles is expressly forbidden”. The statement from the Academy added: “The purpose of the Academy’s campaign regulations is to ensure a fair and ethical awards process – these are core values of the Academy. Given this review, it is apparent that components of the regulations must be clarified to help create a better framework for respectful, inclusive, and unbiased campaigning. These changes will be made after this awards cycle and will be shared with our membership. The academy strives to create an environment where votes are based solely on the artistic and technical merits of the eligible films and achievements.” Earlier this month, Riseborough received support from her co-star in the film Marc Maron and actor Christina Ricci who claimed the investigation was “elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me”. Riseborough is included in the category alongside Cate Blanchett, Ana de Armas, Michelle Williams and Michelle Yeoh. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw praised Riseborough in his review, singling out “a great performance”. The film is being re-released in cinemas after only making $27,000 (£21,936) upon release.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/31/andrea-riseborough-oscar-nomination-upheld;guardian;entertainment & culture;8

Food, and just before his nostrils were set on fire and unbearable heat swept through his throat and chest, Richman was asked by Evans what he felt the difference was between US and British football from a spectator point of view, having experienced both. “So the Jets-Dolphins is maybe like the Yankees-BoSox [Boston Red Sox], whereas Tottenham-Arsenal is more like Palestine-Israel,” Richman said. “It’s deeply tribal.” A somewhat over-the-top statement but Richman is right in his assessment that football fans on this side of the Atlantic take being football fans very seriously. Ties run deep, as do emotions, and, as such, you have to be very sure of the ground you’re on before questioning someone’s loyalty and dedication to their team, unless of course your name is Pep Guardiola and you’ve got something to get off your chest, which was much the case for the Manchester City manager after his team’s 4-2 victory over Tottenham on Thursday. City won but they did not play well and Guardiola was fuming afterwards, with his players but also with the supporters, many of whom booed the hosts after they found themselves 2-0 down at half-time. “They were silent for 45 minutes,” said Guardiola of those in attendance. “They booed because we were losing; maybe it’s the same as our team - they are so comfortable winning four Premier Leagues in five years.” As attacks go it was as devastating as those City unleashed on Spurs in the second half and, as discussed in Sky’s post-match analysis, was almost certainly Guardiola’s way of galvanising all concerned at the club as they seek to chase down Arsenal in this most unexpectedly gripping of title races. As was also discussed on Sky, Guardiola’s criticism of City’s supporters is hardly going to wreck his relationship with them given everything he has achieved since arriving almost seven years ago. Equally, there can be little denying it has chipped that relationship, striking as it does at the heart of what it means to be a fan, namely that your backing for your club is unquestioned and unquestionable, even when you’ve booed a brilliant team on the back of one bad half. Yes it was ridiculous but, seriously Pep, never blast the punters, especially when they’ve turned out on a freezing Thursday night.
City fans will be stoic and insist what Guardiola said is a non-story, but they will be kidding themselves as much as everyone else because being criticised by your manager hurts, whoever you support, and it is especially an issue for them given the stick they have taken from rival supporters over a perceived less-than-enthusiastic filling of the Etihad Stadium for even the most glamorous of games. “Emptyhad” has been the taunt and now those same pisstakers have something else to throw at those who follow the champions. And this sort of thing really does stick. For proof you only have to look at what happened after Sir Alex Ferguson criticised Manchester United fans for a lack of backing during the team’s 1-0 victory over Birmingham City at Old Trafford in January 2008. “That was the quietest I have heard the crowd,” said the then manager. “It was like a funeral out there.” Cue Liverpool supporters chanting “Fergie’s right, your fans are shite” the next time their team took on United, and it has continued to this day. You can put money on the jibe being updated to “Pep is right, your fans are shite” when Liverpool visit the Eithad Stadium in April and being sung by the away section at regular intervals of that contest. It should be remembered that Liverpool supporters had their loyalty and dedication questioned by their own manager not long ago. “I felt pretty alone at this moment,” said Jürgen Klopp after witnessing Anfield emptying as soon as Crystal Palace had scored an 82nd-minute winner there in November 2015. He had just taken over as manager and it was a gamble that quite easily could have backfired, but it didn’t because of how willing the fans were to get on board with the German’s attempts to breath fresh life into their ailing team, with attempts by opposition supporters to mock Kopites over what Klopp had said about them pretty much neutered by the fervour that gripped them as he went about his work. And it could be the case that what Guardiola said on Thursday sparks a surge of raucousness and commitment to the cause in City fans, starting with Wolves’ visit on Sunday. That would be exactly what he wanted. Nevertheless, it remains a risk for any manager to criticise the supporters – take Frank Lampard’s deteriorating relationship with the Goodison faithful as evidence of that – and, in general, is one of those things that lasts, that you can never take back, that cannot help but sting a seriously serious group of sport watchers.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/pep-guardiolas-criticism-of-manchester-city-fans-risky-as-it-was-calculated;guardian;sports;2155

Five firefighters were injured during the incident at the former department store on Monday.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said four have since been discharged from hospital after treatment, but one is still apparently fighting for their life.

Speaking on Tuesday morning, Edinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said the cause of the fire is still unknown, and that the SFRS along with a surveying team were investigating.

""Obviously there was construction work happening on the old Jenners building, so we'll find out in the next coming days,"" he said.

The alarm was raised in the city's Rose Street shortly before 11.30am.

On arrival, firefighters found the iconic building ""well alight"".

At its height, 22 appliances and other specialist resources were sent to tackle the flames.

In an update on Tuesday morning, SFRS said crews were still at the scene with a single appliance to monitor the building for any remaining ""hotspots"".

Ross Haggart, interim chief officer with SFRS, said: ""The fire at the Jenners building in Edinburgh is a very serious and complex incident and regrettably I can confirm that five of our colleagues were taken to hospital for treatment.

""Four have now been discharged however one remains in a critical condition.

""The families of all those affected have been made aware.""

The building, which Jenners moved into in 1895, is one of the best known in the Scottish capital.

The closure of the store, which was then controlled by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, was announced in 2021.

Renovations are ongoing to transform it into a hotel, supported by a firm owned by fashion billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124120238/http://news.sky.com/story/cause-of-jenners-fire-in-edinburgh-still-unknown-with-emergency-crews-remaining-at-scene-and-firefighter-in-critical-condition-12794096;skynews;entertainment & culture;2249
2010;2010;Business minister boasted Britishvolt was Brexit success story months before collapse;2023-01-22T07:30:30Z;['Michael Savage'];['Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Unemployment', 'Motoring', 'Poverty', 'Environment', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'UK news', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Conservatives'];;"Ministers were using the electric car battery maker Britishvolt as a prime example of the government’s record for “securing business investment in the UK” just months before the scheme collapsed without any public investment. The company, once heralded as Britain’s potential champion for battery making, fell into administration last week after the failure of last-ditch talks to find emergency funding to keep it afloat. Its demise has been criticised as showing the government’s lack of industrial strategy, the shortcomings of “levelling up” and Britain’s failure to grasp new manufacturing opportunities in the wake of Brexit. However, it has emerged that just last summer, ministers were still using Britishvolt as an example of the government’s ability to attract investment to the UK. In response to a request from a Tory MP for details of the government’s progress in securing investment, the then-business minister, Jane Hunt, claimed the government “has provided further support to attract significant investment in manufacturing, including delivering Britishvolt’s £1.7bn gigafactory in Blyth Valley, which will support 3,000 direct jobs and a further 5,000 across the supply chain.”
Senior Britishvolt executives are now to be quizzed as part of a parliamentary inquiry into the electric car battery industry. It had been trying to build a large facility near Blyth in Northumberland and had been promised government funds worth £100m, but the grant was dependent on finding private investors for the project. Government officials met with the company on several occasions, but both the business department and the Treasury concluded its financial and managerial performance meant providing emergency support would not be a good use of public money. There have since been claims of mismanagement and profligate spending by the company, which senior figures have denied. It is an embarrassment for the government, in a week in which it was attempting to show its commitment to supporting neglected areas with its levelling up funding. The Britishvolt collapse means there is now only one large-scale gigafactory planned in the UK, which will be Chinese-owned. Some Tories are hoping that a new buyer can still be found for the company, but the majority of its 300 staff were immediately made redundant after it collapsed into administration last Tuesday. It follows BMW’s decision in October to stop building the electric version of the Mini in the UK. Its Oxford plant will then only be making petrol models for the foreseeable future. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said Britishvolt had once been the government’s “answer to levelling up” poorer communities outside London, but had now become a symptom of a wider problem. “This government doesn’t have an industrial strategy, a plan to boost jobs in the industries of the future, or secure the investment Britain needs to grow. “Britain has to have battery factories if we are to continue making cars in this country. Labour has an industrial strategy, including a commitment to part-invest in eight gigafactories alongside industry. If we want to see investment in Britain we need a government willing to be the partner business needs.” A Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy spokesperson said the department had offered “significant support to Britishvolt through the Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) on the condition that key milestones – including private-sector investment commitments – were met”. “We remained hopeful that Britishvolt would find a suitable investor and are disappointed to hear that this has not been possible, and therefore no ATF grant has been paid out. Our thoughts are with the company’s employees and their families at this time, and we stand ready to support those affected. “The UK is one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we want to ensure the best outcome for the site. We will work closely with the local authority and potential investors to achieve this, as part of our commitment to boost homegrown electric car battery production, level up and advance towards a greener future.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/22/business-minister-boasted-britishvolt-brexit-success-months-before-collapse;guardian;politics;2010
4982;4982;Covid deaths in Australian aged care surpass 100 a week, the highest rate since August;2023-01-06T09:06:22Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['Australia news', 'Aged care', 'Health', 'Coronavirus'];;"The number of Covid deaths in residential aged care has again surpassed 100 a week, spiking to levels not seen in months. Health department data, published late on Friday, shows 738 outbreaks are now active in residential aged care facilities, down from 915 outbreaks in the week to 23 December. There are 3,949 cases among residents and 1,661 staff cases associated with the current 738 outbreaks. The total number of Covid-related deaths reported by aged care providers during the pandemic has now risen to 4,612. That’s an increase of 120 reported deaths in the past seven days, the data shows. Covid was the cause of 5.8% of all deaths in aged care facilities in the past week. But, promisingly, government data also shows that just 3.3% of Covid cases in aged care resulted in death in 2022, far below the rate of 33% in 2020.
An analysis of weekly data reports shows deaths have progressively increased from October when eight a week were recorded in aged care. The death rate is now the highest it has been since mid-August when 143 deaths were recorded in a single week. The federal aged care minister, Anika Wells, said the government had moved quickly to prepare for Covid waves before they hit, supplying personal protective equipment, rapid antigen tests, a surge workforce and additional supports. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The fourth dose vaccine rates are currently at more than 83% for the eligible aged care population and the government is continuing to prioritise anti-virals and vaccines for older Australians. “We must remain vigilant and work together to protect older Australians most at risk of developing serious illness,” Wells said. “We urge everyone to remember CovidSafe basics when visiting older people. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date, wash your hands, wear a mask, hold your visits outdoors and reschedule if you feel unwell.” The government delivered three-day PPE packs from the national medical stockpile to all aged care facilities ahead of summer and is providing outbreak PPE upon request. It is also providing in-reach Covid-19 pathology testing until 30 April for residential aged care homes experiencing an outbreak. Providers are being given rapid tests for surveillance screening and financial support for the costs associated with managing outbreaks. Antivirals are also being provided from the national medical stockpile if local pharmacies are out of stock. Other weekly Covid data, released by the states and territories on Friday, shows a similar increase in total death figures in both Victoria and New South Wales. In Victoria, deaths rose to 108 from 69 the week prior, while in NSW, the number of deaths rose from 32 to 77. South Australia’s death toll remained largely stable while Western Australia’s dropped. The worsening situation in aged care comes as the sector warns of fundamental problems with the financial viability of providers. A report on the sector published by StewartBrown shows seven of 10 residential aged care facilities are currently operating at a loss. The analysis, first reported by the Australian, shows facilities lost $21.29 a bed each day in the September quarter, on average, compared to $7.30 the year prior. The report suggests the annual loss for the sector totals about $1.4bn. Occupancy levels are also down, falling from 95% in 2018 to 91%.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/06/covid-deaths-in-aged-care-surpass-100-a-week-the-highest-rate-since-august;guardian;health;4982
1147;1147;NHS pay dispute could cause serious long-term harm, says health boss;2023-01-26T10:28:42Z;['Denis Campbell'];['NHS', 'Health policy', 'Public sector pay', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Industrial action'];;The NHS faces “serious and significant” long-term damage unless the increasingly bitter pay battle between staff and ministers is resolved soon, a senior health service boss has said. The growing wave of strikes will hamper the NHS’s efforts to tackle the growing chaos in A&E and the 7.2 million-strong backlog of people needing hospital treatment, Sir Julian Hartley said. His warning came as physiotherapists in England stage a walkout over pay for the first time. Hartley is the outgoing chief executive of the Leeds teaching hospitals NHS acute care trust, and next week will take over as chief executive of the hospitals lobby group NHS Providers. “The long-term implications for strike action as the NHS attempts to recover from Covid are serious and significant,” he said on Newcross Healthcare’s Voices of Care podcast. “We need to see a speedy resolution to the industrial action. The consequences for the NHS if it continues indefinitely are serious, particularly in terms of the challenges that we’re already facing in the urgent care pathway with the issues with ambulance attendances, handovers, crowded EDs [emergency departments] and also, of course, the concomitant social care challenge. “And then the second big issue is, of course, the recovery in terms of operations that will be cancelled when we’re trying to catch up with the backlog of patients that have been affected through the pandemic of not getting their care and treatment. Those are big issues that we need to see the NHS succeed on. The NHS will be seriously hampered if industrial action continues in the way that it is happening right now.” Health unions are frustrated at the government’s refusal to increase its below-inflation £1,400 pay award for 2022-23 or even to discuss doing so. They have announced plans to significantly expand their campaign of industrial action. For example, Unite members who work in ambulance services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are planning 10 more strikes in February and March. NHS leaders have made clear that they have “huge concern” over plans for nurses and ambulance staff to stage an unprecedented joint stoppage on 6 February. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said on Monday that 6 February would be “a very bad day for the NHS”. Hartley urged ministers to engage in meaningful talks with health unions to break the deadlock. He said: “We obviously need to have a process of negotiation. There has to be an endgame here. It can’t continue indefinitely. And if it does, there’d be serious consequences for the NHS and indeed more broadly for social care too.” Up to 4,200 members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) were on strike on Thursday at 30 health trusts in England. Claire Sullivan, the CSP’s director of employment relations, said: “Despite government claims to be open to dialogue, no new offer has been tabled and physiotherapy staff will now reluctantly take action. The government’s strategy during this dispute has been simply inexplicable and is entirely to blame for these strikes.” About 30 striking CSP members gathered outside Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham. Greg Stretton, a 41-year-old team leader for the respiratory medicine physiotherapist service at the Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust, which runs the QMC and Nottingham city hospital, carried a sign reading “Constant Staffing Problems”. The difficulty of recruiting physiotherapists due to the low wages they receive is a key reason behind the industrial action, the unions said. Stretton’s team should have 18 staff but usually has about 14, and at times it has dropped to as low as six despite workloads remaining high as physiotherapy services deal with the aftermath of Covid and a backlog of cancer patients. He said: “People are just genuinely burnt out, and my team has noticed the impact of that. We were having people in our office cry on a daily basis, just from being at work and the stresses of being work amid untenable pressures, patient demands and service demands. “It almost felt like a choice of who you let down. As team leader it was a choice of do you let down the patients by saying we need to focus on ourselves, or do we let down staff by saying our patients need us. We just don’t have the capacity to do everything.” Steve Barclay, the health secretary, said: “It is regrettable some union members are taking industrial action. I will continue meeting with unions, including the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, to discuss what is fair and affordable for the 2023-24 pay process.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/26/nhs-pay-dispute-could-cause-serious-long-term-harm-says-health-boss;guardian;health;1147

482;482;The Guardian view on English devolution: an idea whose time has come | Editorial;2023-01-29T18:30:02Z;['Editorial'];['Devolution', 'Transport policy', 'Transport', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Andy Burnham'];;Later this year, a fleet of distinctive yellow and black buses will begin to make their way through Wigan, Bolton and parts of Salford and Bury. Publicly owned, with fares initially capped at £2, the franchised Bee network will be operating throughout Greater Manchester by 2025. Fought for by the city region mayor, Andy Burnham, this will be the first bus service outside London to come under local control since Thatcherite deregulation in 1986. It is a sign of the times that Mr Burnham’s flagship policy has been given the green light by a Conservative government. As the next election looms, both of England’s major parties are embracing greater devolution as a means to address the regional inequalities that helped drive the leave vote in the Brexit referendum. The secretary of state for levelling up, Michael Gove, and his shadow, Lisa Nandy, made a point of speaking at last week’s Convention of the North in Manchester, in front of a phalanx of metro mayors. During the 1980s, successive Tory administrations used a legislative wrecking ball to demolish local government powers, privatise public services and centralise political control in Westminster. But Tory backing for another mayoral combined authority in the north-east means that three-quarters of the north of England will soon be included in some kind of devolution deal. Redistributing political power away from London and the south-east is a necessary part of any future growth strategy, and a much-needed response to a loss of faith in Westminster politics. But meaningful devolution requires fiscal as well as political firepower. In the absence of the former, the government’s anaemic levelling up programme has thus far offered only piecemeal and inadequate pots of Westminster funding, delivered on a shamelessly pork-barrel basis. There are indications that in “trailblazer” deals being negotiated with Mr Burnham and Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, the Sunak government may do more. A departmental-style single grant to local authorities would allow flexibility in determining priorities and strategic goals. But there is a strong case for going further and faster. Currently, around 95p in every £1 paid in tax goes to central government, compared with 69p in decentralised Germany. Granting greater revenue-raising and borrowing powers to local government would be good for democracy and ensure accountability. Comparative research by the OECD has found that decentralisation is positively linked to GDP growth and local investment. For Labour, which has a rich tradition of municipal radicalism to draw on, there are other compelling reasons to take ownership of a radical devolution agenda. The decision to put Greater Manchester’s buses back under public control followed an extensive consultation that found the policy to be overwhelmingly popular. In a similar vein, Labour-run city regions can become the vehicle for a belated reversal of the privatisation and hollowing out of the public realm, which began in the Thatcher era. In his new year speech, Keir Starmer astutely redeployed the Brexit slogan “take back control”, promising greater local powers over transport, employment support, energy, housing, culture and childcare. That message was reiterated last week in Manchester by Ms Nandy. An election commitment to end an era of destructive competition and outsourcing in the provision of public services would be both radical and popular. Combined with ambitious state investment in postindustrial regions to drive the green transition, it can become the cornerstone of a new political settlement for England. Labour should ensure that Greater Manchester’s impending bus revolution is only the start of its own devolution journey.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/the-guardian-view-on-english-devolution-an-idea-whose-time-has-come;guardian;politics;482
3470;3470;Eddie Howe’s gritty Newcastle won’t win hearts but silverware is in reach | Jonathan Wilson;2023-01-14T20:00:17Z;['Jonathan Wilson'];['Newcastle United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Remember the Eddie Howe of a decade ago? Remember how pleasant he seemed, with his ruddy cheeks and blond hair, how he looked less like a football manager than a minor character from Downton Abbey? Remember the compelling interviews, the articulacy and understated charisma that seemed to emphasise his fundamental niceness? And the poor love hated leaving Bournemouth. As a player, two games at Portsmouth were quite enough and he was soon back to his spiritual home. As a manager, well, Burnley, with its wild moors and dark energy, never seemed a natural fit. Best to stay amid the familiar beaches and boarding houses of Bournemouth, where Pep Guardiola could praise the quality of his football (which is to say the ease with which Manchester City could beat them) and nobody was too bothered by them conceding an average 66 goals per season – it was after all, a miracle they were in the Premier League at all. Bless him, good old Eddie, with his pretty, unthreatening football and his inability to organise a defence.
Since when the wheel turn has been dramatic. It’s not just that Howe is cheerily accepting employment from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, with all the moral compromises that entails – in truth, by the end at Bournemouth, when the club was owned by the Russian-born petrochemicals billionaire Maxim Demin, the romantically impoverished days of passing buckets around to survive were long in the past. It’s that Howe is now managing a team that can defend, both with their structure and organisation and also in less admirable ways. And it is probably worth saying, in this era of facile social-media argument, that it’s possible for two things to be true at once. Newcastle’s rise would not have happened without the Saudi money, which both allowed them to pay the necessary fees and wages and offered a credible dream: players could believe they were getting involved with a rising project that might end in Europe and title challenges, rather than just patching a hole to stave off relegation. And at the same time, Howe has done a very good job, both by incorporating the new signings and improving players who were already there.
Newcastle have the best defensive record in the Premier League. They have conceded only 11 times in 18 games. Only Neto has saved a higher proportion of shots than Nick Pope this season, but they lie fourth in the expected goals against chart. And they are getting better. They have let in only two goals in their last nine league games. Only Manchester City, Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday have scored more than one against them this season. Certain individuals stand out. Sven Botman may not have been the most eye-catching of their signings since the Saudi takeover, but the 22-year-old has been exceptional since arriving from Lille for £35m in the summer. His positional sense has made Fabian Schär look a far better player alongside him than he did last season or for Switzerland at the World Cup. In 18 appearances for the club, the FA Cup exit to Wednesday is his only defeat. Kieran Trippier has probably been the most consistent right-back in the Premier League this season, contributing four assists and a goal as well as being in the top 25 for interceptions per game. The implausibly proportioned Dan Burn, all elbows and sharp angles with an unexpectedly deft touch, looked a stopgap when he was signed, but he has come to embody the spirit of the modern Newcastle. But defending is never just about the defence and it has become increasingly apparent that Howe has come to see Bruno Guimarães flanked by Sean Longstaff and Joe Willock as his best midfield. That has meant Joelinton, having gone through his rebirth as a defensive midfielder, being restored to the forward line, but with a brief to keep on tackling; he is averaging a remarkable 4.1 regains per game. Although Willock has contributed 2.4 regains per game, his great asset is the sort of positional defending that is hard to reflect in stats. Against Arsenal, it was noticeable how often Martin Ødegaard, effectively the playmaker, would receive the ball only for Willock to block the angle for the most natural pass. Ødegaard’s pass completion rate as a result dropped to 66.7% against a season average of 81.8%. That is the positive side of things. Newcastle’s form does raise questions about Howe’s time at Bournemouth – were the players not good enough to defend like that? Has Howe only recently learned how to organise in that way? Is it the impact of his coaching staff or video analysts? Whatever the reason, Newcastle are defending exceptionally well. But there is a shadow. And again, this is a case of two things being true. Newcastle are extremely well-organised but they are also adept at breaking up the game and running down the clock. Whether Mikel Arteta’s fury during Newcastle’s 0-0 draw at Arsenal was justified or wise can be debated, but he is not the only coach to have been frustrated by Newcastle’s approach. In Newcastle games this season, the ball has been in play for just 51 minutes 36 seconds, against a league average of 54:53. Only with Leeds is the ball in play less.
When Newcastle drew 0-0 at home to Leeds last month, Howe was clearly irritated by how “they were time wasting and doing everything they could to take time out of the game” (that was the second lowest ball-in-play time in any Newcastle game this season; only the 0-0 draw at Brighton had less, while the Arsenal game is seventh in the list). Which is another sign of Howe’s development: most of the best managers are tremendous hypocrites. The cherubic figure of the peak Bournemouth years is gone and in its place is something much steelier, somebody far less concerned with the aesthetic of the game. Saudi Newcastle were unlikely ever to be as popular as the Kevin Keegan iteration and the gritty approach all but guarantees that. But while they are unlikely to win hearts, Howe’s game-smart battlers might just win silverware.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/14/eddie-howes-gritty-newcastle-wont-win-hearts-but-silverware-is-in-reach;guardian;sports;3470
1132;1132;Counterfeiting, contraband, cocaine: how Panama’s trade hub lost its lustre;2023-01-26T11:30:17Z;['Mat Youkee'];['Panama', 'World news', 'Americas'];;"In the Colón Free Trade Zone, near the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal, the dated Perspex and glass buildings are emblazoned with brand names for electronics, perfumes and textiles. Behind loom vast warehouses and dozens of port cranes, while on the street, shop owners unload merchandise from shipping containers. Established in 1948, the world’s second largest free-trade zone was envisioned as a wholesale redistribution centre for Latin America and the Caribbean, but it has become a global hub of counterfeiting, contraband and cocaine. In November Europol arrested 49 members of a super-cartel centred on Dubai and accounting for about a third of Europe’s cocaine supply. One of those arrested was Anthony Martínez Meza, son of a director of the Colón Free Trade Zone, and suspected of organizing the shipments from Colón. “Colón is one of the world’s great logistical hubs, but criminal organizations use this infrastructure to move drugs all over the world,” says Michael Chen, the president of Colón’s chamber of commerce. “Every day the situation seems to worsen … organized crime and gangs find more creative ways of getting through what’s left of my city.” In front of Chen’s office, construction is nearing completion on a cruise port and duty-free shopping mall he hopes will bring more tourist dollars to the city. Around the corner, however, the city’s morgue regularly runs out of space for the stream of cadavers, many bearing signs of torture, that has surged as rival gangs look to control the drugs trade. “The objective of the gangs is to gain control of the points where containers can be contaminated with drugs in the free zone and the ports” said Alejo Campos, the regional director of Crime Stoppers Latin America.
Cocaine arrives at the free trade zone either directly in container from Buenaventura, on Colombia’s Pacific coast, or through land routes, before being hidden in other containers bound for Europe and beyond. In the ports, trade unions have been co-opted by the gangs and turn a blind eye as workers stash packages and replace seals. Only 2% of cargo is passed through a container scanner designed to detect contraband. Meanwhile, underwater, divers weld “parasites” – long metal containers stuffed with cocaine – to the hulls of cargo ships. The majority of shipments intercepted by police in 2022 and 2023 were destined for Europe, according to Panamanian officials. With US help, Panamanian authorities have scored some modest victories against the traffickers. In 2021 they confiscated 126 tonnes of drugs, mainly cocaine, up from 82 tonnes the previous year. Stings have taken down several of Colón’s cocaine kingpins and uncovered $10m in bills behind the wooden walls of a Colón house. In December Panamanian police said they had arrested 27 members of the Clan de Gulfo, one of Colombia’s largest narco-trafficking organizations, who they accuse of recruiting agents and moles in the security forces, judiciary and civil service.
But the resulting power vacuums have only led to more violence. “There’s a huge territorial dispute right now,” said Campos. “The police actions have decapitated some of the gangs and new leaders have emerged looking to position themselves in their patch, and that’s when the killings begin.” The collapse in security has accelerated the decline of what was once one of the Caribbean’s great cities. “We had bars on every corner, we had restaurants and movie houses. Colón never slept,” said William Donadío, Colón’s renowned tailor, now 94. When he cut his first cloth in 1942, his clients included US servicemen and workers from the numerous multinationals with offices in the city. In the 1950s, he was among the crowds that lined the streets to witness the visit of the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and President Dwight Eisenhower. “But everything that inflates,” he says, “eventually explodes.”
In 1964, riots against US control of the Canal Zone left the city in ruins. The Americans left in 1979, but returned a decade later when President George HW Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to remove Manuel Noriega. Trash piles up on street corners and in the husks of the city’s art deco buildings. From the courtyard of the once grand but now deserted Hotel Washington, where Albert Einstein, Babe Ruth and David Lloyd George once laid their heads, the view over the Caribbean is blocked by the rusting hull of a sand-banked cargo ship. In the 2008 James Bond movie Quantum of Solace, Colón had the dubious honour of standing in for Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince.
Successive Panamanian governments have promised to drag Colón out of decline but have failed to make meaningful progress in reducing crime, providing basic services and improving quality of life for its citizens. Chen has proposed creating the Colón Security Committee, an alliance between the private sector, civil society and the government, to tackle crime. “If the government has monopoly of security then corruption infiltrates,” he says. But Chen is competing against bigger forces. Major new investments from China, the US and Taiwan in port facilities, energy projects and mines are flowing into Colón. That brings opportunities for jobs and development but also crime and corruption in a city that continues to be both blessed and cursed by its strategic geography. “Regardless of the fact that the old city has been decaying, Colón is a valuable piece of real estate,” says Donadío, who has lived through many boom-and-busts before. “The city will never again be the way it was, but it is still the link between two continents and two oceans. And right now, I feel there is something in the air. Colón is set to explode again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/26/colon-panama-counterfeiting-contraband-cocaine;guardian;politics;1132
4731;4731;Australia’s drowning crisis: why rescuers often perish trying to save family members;2023-01-07T19:00:28Z;['Cait Kelly'];['Australia news', 'Swimming'];;"At least two Australians and a New Zealander have drowned within a week this summer while trying to save a family member. Experts say it is an alarming number, compared with the normal annual tally of about six, and the causes of such incidents are tragically familiar. “Now is a really high-risk period,” says Amy Peden, a water safety expert and researcher at the University of New South Wales. She says that it is relatively common that the person attempting the rescue drowns while the person who initially got caught in the water survives. This was the case with off-duty police officer Sgt Peter Stone, 45, who drowned on Monday while trying to rescue his 14-year-old son at a beach south of Narooma, NSW.
Stone managed to push his son to safety but did not survive, despite the efforts of lifesavers who performed CPR. On Tuesday another man, 42, died after trying to rescue his teenage daughter from a rip at Black Head, 75km south of Port Macquarie. A nearby surfer took the girl to shore and returned to bring the man back to the beach. Bystanders performed CPR until paramedics arrived but he could not be revived. On Thursday a New Zealand woman, 52, drowned while trying to save her 11-year-old daughter from a strong lagoon current in the Cook Islands. And on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula on Friday evening, a 20-year-old man and his 16-year-old brother got into trouble swimming at the notorious Gunnamatta Beach. Seeing they were struggling in heavy surf and strong winds, the boys’ father swam out to assist them. Emergency services rescued the father and his younger son, but the older son has not been found, despite an extensive search into Saturday. Peden says bystander drownings often involve a parent trying to help a child. “It’s often a parent going in to rescue a child or rescuing someone they know, as opposed to a stranger,” she says. She says on average Australians will perform one rescue in their life – so it is vital to know how to handle the situation. Peden says “a few different things can go wrong” to put the rescuer into an unsafe situation, but typically they simply become exhausted. “The adrenaline wears off, the exhaustion kicks in, the effort it takes to get out to someone – to make sure they’re OK and keep them above water, the exertion of it, with people grabbing on to you – is too much.”
Peden says it’s natural for parents not to think twice before entering the water to try to rescue a child “in the heat of the moment” but having that second thought can make the difference between life and death. The first possibility is simply to call for help if others are around. Then, crucially, if you do go into the water alone, “taking something that floats – a boogie board, a pool noodle, an eski, they might have a two-litre bottle of drinking water – anything that can hold air”. “You’ll need that flotation when you perform the rescue.” Prof Rob Brander of UNSW – known as Dr Rip for his research using dyes in the surf to teach rip awareness – echoes that advice. “We’ve done surveys of people involved in bystander rescues and looking at the fatalities, the main theme that came out is that people didn’t bring a flotation device. If they did, it was a successful rescue.” Both researchers stress that precautions and some beach knowledge are an essential safeguard against bystander drownings. Both of last week’s cases were at unpatrolled beaches and involved rips, Peden says.
“Knowing how to spot a rip is important and choosing to swim at a patrolled location – it won’t be an untrained bystander going in to rescue if there are trained lifesavers.” Brander says spotting a rip can be difficult but is essential in saving lives. “They have different visual types of characteristics, but the more common rips are easier to spot,” Brander said. “They sit in deep channels, the water is deeper and darker and not as many waves break there. If you’re looking along the beach, they’ll appear like narrow green paths heading offshore between the white water.” He says if anyone gets caught in a rip, the best thing to do is to float: the rip will eventually end and they can swim back in. But with the added exhaustion of trying to help a second person, the instinct to fight the rip can be fatal. “When people get stuck in rips they lose their footing … most people’s initial recitation is to swim back but they get tired and panic,” he says. Over the past 10 years, an average of 26 people each year have died because they did not know what to do in a rip, but Brander says the number is likely to be a lot higher. “You’re probably looking at 30 people each year – that’s more than people who have been killed by floods or sharks, it’s a big hazard.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/08/australias-drowning-crisis-why-rescuers-often-perish-trying-to-save-family-members;guardian;entertainment & culture;4731
7645;7645;Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa cleared of 'bogus' tax evasion charges;Wednesday 18 January 2023 16:40, UK;[];['nobel prize', 'philippines'];['peace', 'freedom', 'charges', 'evasion', 'ms', 'tax', 'court', 'maria', 'ressas', 'philippines', 'nobel', 'rights', 'cleared', 'ressa', 'winner', 'prize', 'legal'];"Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa has been cleared of tax evasion charges that human rights charities said were ""bogus and politically motivated"".

The Court of Tax Appeals in the Philippines ruled that prosecutors failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Ressa and her news organisation Rappler Holdings Corp evaded tax payments in four instances after raising capital through partnerships with two foreign investors.

Ms Ressa said the charges were one of several legal cases used by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to silence critical investigative reporting.

Amal Clooney, a member of Ms Ressa's legal team, said: ""For four years my client has had a 30-year sentence hanging over her head while the Philippine courts considered the spurious charges filed against her. The charges were political - a straightforward attempt to silence a journalist.

""But today we see justice being done. We see judges drawing a line. We see freedom being upheld.

""May this be the beginning of a new chapter in the Philippines in which journalists are safe, speech is free, democracy is secured and the rule of law can prevail,"" Mrs Clooney said.

In its decision, the court said: ""The acquittal of the accused is based on the findings of the court ... that respondents did not commit the crime charge.""

After the verdict was announced, a tearful Ms Ressa said: ""Today, facts win, truth wins, justice wins.""

""This acquittal, even if took a long time, is not just for Rappler. It is for every Filipino who has ever been unjustly accused.""

Ms Ressa's news organisation Rappler welcomed the ruling as a ""triumph of facts over politics"".

Human Rights Watch said the charges were ""bogus and politically motivated"" and that Ms Ressa's acquittal is ""a victory for press freedom in the Philippines"".

Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov and Ms Ressa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 for fighting for their news organisations' survival and defying government efforts to shut them.

They were honoured for ""their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace"".

Ms Ressa faces three more legal cases - a separate tax case filed by prosecutors in another court, her Supreme Court appeal of an online libel conviction, and Rappler's appeal of the closure order issued by the Philippines' corporate watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Her legal team says the charges amount to an ""abusive campaign"" which has been condemned by several international organisations including the UN, the EU, the US Department of State and US Congress and the Media Freedom Coalition.

She faces up to six years in prison if she loses the libel conviction appeal, which was filed by a businessman who said a Rappler news report falsely linked him to a murder, drug dealing, human trafficking and other crimes.

Rappler, founded in 2012, was one of several Philippine and international news agencies that reported critically on Duterte's brutal crackdown on illegal drugs that left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead.

The news outlet also investigated his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, including prolonged police-enforced lockdowns that deepened poverty, caused one of the country's worst recessions and sparked corruption allegations in government medical purchases.

The massive drug killings are being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.

Duterte ended his turbulent six-year term last year and was succeeded by Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of a dictator who was overthrown in an army-backed ""people power"" uprising in 1986 following an era marked by widespread human rights violations and plunder.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118164742/http://news.sky.com/story/nobel-peace-prize-winner-maria-ressa-cleared-of-bogus-tax-evasion-charges-12789533;skynews;entertainment & culture;1736
466;466;Liverpool lost in transition but Jürgen Klopp could be their golden thread | Barney Ronay;2023-01-29T20:00:00Z;['Barney Ronay'];['FA Cup', 'Jürgen Klopp', 'Liverpool', 'Brighton & Hove Albion', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"With 11 minutes left in this FA Cup fourth-round tie and the score 1-1 Jürgen Klopp could be seen racing out to the touchline, yanking the snood from his face and performing a series of furious scything gestures with his right arm, as though trying to break free from some invisible set of manacles. Klopp shrieked. He threw his head back. Just as quickly he stopped, crouched, and mooched back towards his seat. Nothing was really happening. Klopp was reacting to the shapes in his head, seeing danger, slackness, loose stitching in Cody Gakpo’s off-the-ball positioning during a lull in play with the ball 40 yards away, out there urging his false-10 central attacker to stand 10 yards deeper, trying to plaster some kind of attacking plan across this oddly angsty Liverpool team in real time.
It is a measure of where Liverpool are that this was probably the most animated Klopp became all afternoon. Brighton would go on to win the game, deservedly, with a brilliant goal a minute and half into stoppage time. It was beautifully taken by Karou Mitoma, a footballer who is basically made of feathers, dandelion spurs and some kind of super-light high-tensile alien metal. In the tiniest of spaces, with the ball bouncing up like a balloon, Mitoma shifted his feet, leant inside, flicked the ball up off his right foot, delicately back-spun, hanging in the air like some divine orb, then propelled it with thrilling precision off the same foot into the far corner.
What skill, what command of gravity and space, what basic powers of concentration to be able to do this in the 92nd minute, a fitting winner in an excellent cup tie. At the final whistle Klopp hugged Roberto De Zerbi and hand-slapped the Brighton bench. There was applause for the travelling fans and a fond, rueful wave as Klopp turned to leave the pitch with the Brighton victory playlist kicking in. Freed from desire. Well that’s one way of putting it. Because this did feel like a full stop, a mid-season dead-heading. What is there left to win now? The Champions League? Ten points off fourth place is hardly insurmountable. On the other hand, this does not look like a team poised to mount an irresistible surge. Instead this is probably a moment for Liverpool’s supporters, who know this better than anyone, to take a breath and think about wider endings. The main feeling around this Liverpool team in recent weeks has been dislocation. The temptation is always there to look for simple reasons. There has been talk of tired players, of the shadows of last season’s ghost quadruple, of recruitment mistakes made, of Klopp losing his magic dust. But in reality this loss of torque comes from a much wider place. This entire entity is in turnaround. The club is for sale. Key people are leaving. This isn’t a team in transition, but a model, a set of structures, a culture, feelings, energy all running their course. The last years of success came from a shared source, a blend of brilliant coaching and shark-faced financial management. But that thing is now done. Something will have to replace it. In the meantime Klopp is left trying to build another team out of less while continuing to win. It took two years when he first turned up. It took three years at Dortmund. Will he get the time again? The Amex Stadium was a grey chilly place at kick off, with a low nautical drizzle creeping in under its swooping plastic eaves. Brighton were slick and forceful early on. Liverpool counter-pressed with energy, a team trying to remember itself. Their best moments came in the interplay between Harvey Elliott and Mohamed Salah, the combination that would make the opening goal. Elliott made a wonderful run through the centre as Salah scurried down the right. The first-time flick under Jason Steele was just enough.
The main positive here for Liverpool was the odd flicker of synergy between the front three. The main negative was a lack of any obvious understanding the rest of the time. Gakpo still looks like a footballer being asked to make up a way to play, out there blue-sky-thinking his own role. Behind him Stefan Bajcetic was assured and full of vim. For Brighton there were some alluring early glimpses of Mitoma, veering around Trent Alexander-Arnold like the skating rink pro skirting his way past some gawping rail-clutcher. Mitoma doesn’t really run. He glides, he skates, he dusts the ground. A little later he made Joe Gomez fall over just by shifting his hips between strides to make space for a shot. Brighton’s first-half equaliser was a product of a lack of pressure after a corner was cleared. Tariq Lamptey had time to steady himself and punt in a shot that was deflected into the goal off Lewis Dunk. Klopp will feel it was poor defending, poor cover, sleepiness in the centre. And that was pretty much that for Liverpool, who never really looked like winning this game in the second half. What the season brings from here is anyone’s guess, but Klopp remains the club’s most valuable asset, the strongest thread between the Liverpool just past and the one that needs to be built.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/29/liverpool-lost-in-transition-but-jurgen-klopp-could-be-their-golden-thread;guardian;sports;466
3726;3726;Exeter’s Christ Tshiunza: ‘Sport doesn’t have a language. It helped me connect with people’;2023-01-13T12:04:08Z;['Robert Kitson'];['Exeter', 'Wales rugby union team', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];;"Up on Christ Tshiunza’s bedroom wall, discreetly hidden away from prying eyes, is a list. One of the best prospects in world rugby has always written down his long-term goals but what separates him from his peers is how many he has already ticked off. “It brings me great joy that I’ve achieved everything I’ve wanted to achieve so far,” he murmurs. “Not a lot of people my age can say that.” A full cap for Wales while still in his teens, a professional contract with one of England’s premier clubs and – his final exams at Exeter University permitting – a degree in sports science would be an impressive haul on its own. None of it, though, is remotely as uplifting as his remarkable journey to this point, an odyssey to give soaring hope to anyone growing up beyond rugby’s traditional margins. It is a minor miracle the Kinshasa-born Tshiunza is even a rugby player, let alone a vital presence in an Exeter squad who flew into South Africa on Monday on his 21st birthday. A very different life beckoned when he was growing up in the Democratic Republic of Congo, until his French-speaking family fled the country’s civil war in 2010 and began a new chapter in Cardiff.
Initially they were wedged into a one-bedroom flat in Splott. The seven-year-old Christ, the youngest of five children, slept on a mattress he shared with two of his four sisters. “We were in and out of council houses and no one could speak English so that was tough. But then we met a nice Algerian family who spoke English and French and helped us out. People understood life at home wasn’t easy … everyone in Wales was so nice.” Life was similarly challenging when he started school. “You’re sat in class without a clue what’s going on. At playtime you can’t really speak and make friends. So you find the only thing that doesn’t have a language. I never had any brothers so sport was a way of connecting with other people. As soon as I started running around I knew I was going to do some form of sport. I was tall and moving faster than a lot of people. I knew I was different in a way.” Rugby, though, mostly remained a foreign concept even when he first attended Whitchurch high school, alma mater of Gareth Bale, Sam Warburton and the Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas. At 15, though, Tshiunza had a sizeable growth spurt. The school’s director of rugby, Steve Williams, urged him to give the sport a go and the coaches helped to raise sufficient funds to send him on a school tour to South Africa. There were three fixtures and the gangly Tshiunza was man of the match in two of them. “Doors just started opening after that. You get to a point where you think: ‘I’ve got something here. I could use it or I could be an idiot and not fulfil it.’”
Just four years later, in November 2021, he was making his debut for Wales against Fiji at the Principality Stadium. Afterwards, with his new cap still perched on his head, Tshiunza handed over his first Wales jersey to Williams to thank him for his encouragement and guidance. “When rugby started going well it would have been so easy to say: ‘I’ve found my sport now,’ and blow off school. Guys like Steve Williams really keep you grounded. I’m happy I met him when I did.” There was to be another formative moment on a 2019 trip to South Africa, this time with Wales Under-18s. While visiting a local township, Tshiunza was given a glimpse of the world he had left behind. “The way they lived and they way they treated us rugby players was a very humbling experience. Being around all those children … that could have been me realistically. Not having much, living a very different lifestyle.” Which is why Christ – pronounced as in “wrist” – is now so determined to make the most of his God-given talents. “I don’t go out much, if at all. The only thing I’ll really do is go out for food with my mates now and then. I literally go home from the club straight to my laptop … you can get lost in the uni lifestyle and the rugby culture.” His galloping late try to win a thrilling game against Harlequins in September was a striking reward for his dedication. “He’s one of those guys who’s going to keep getting better and better,” says Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, whose side are in Pretoria to face the Bulls in the Champions Cup. “The good stuff he does is great but there’s a bit more there.”
If the versatile 6ft 6in tall, 114kg forward can force his way into Warren Gatland’s Six Nations squad, it will also be partly down to the mental example of a former Royal Marines physio named Nick Cox, who supervised his recovery after a badly torn hamstring ruled him out for a large chunk of 2022. “Coming out of rehab I felt like a different person. Before I was kind of drifting but you flick a switch when you spend time with a man like Nick. Even now I’m reaping the benefits of it.” The year 2023 has long since been circled in red as well. “I set myself the goal of playing at this World Cup in an interview four years ago. There’s proof of it online. My parents were like: ‘C’mon Christ. Really?’ But look where we are now. I don’t know if it’s inner belief or God being in my favour but I’ve found that things have always just panned out right.” Should he ever falter he only has to think of his parents, Felix and Bernadette, and the alternative path they gave him and his sisters, who now work in healthcare and accountancy. “It keeps me level-headed because I know where I come from. I know the hardship my parents went through for me. They came here not knowing anyone. “They sacrificed their jobs, their friends and family back in Congo. I do a lot now with the end goal of being able to do the same for my parents one day. So they can finally relax. I want to be a successful person. That’s it. Not an athlete or a businessman. I want to be a successful person.” The story of Christ is already inspirational and he is not finished yet.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/13/christ-tshiunza-rugby-union-exeter-wales-interview;guardian;sports;3726
752;752;Crowdfunded DNA effort helps identify woman found murdered 50 years ago;2023-01-28T06:00:12Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['Arizona', 'US news', 'US policing', 'Genealogy'];;"A community-funded DNA project has helped detectives identify a murdered woman whose remains were stuffed in a canvas sack and dumped in the Arizona desert more than half a century ago. Authorities named the victim as Colleen Audrey Rice, who was born in 1931 in Ohio, and would have been about 39 years old at the time of her death, before her body’s discovery in November 1971.
The identification was made in partnership with a forensic genealogy company, Othram Inc, after a public appeal for $6,500 to fund the project. The Mohave county sheriff’s office put up an initial $1,000 and posted the case to the dnasolves.com website last year, which helped raise the money in only five days. A sheriff’s office Facebook post dated 24 January said its cold case investigators worked with Othram “to determine if advanced DNA testing and forensic-grade genome sequencing could help give insight into the identity of this woman and the circumstances surrounding her untimely death”. The appeal for funding came after the detectives enlisted an artist from the Museum of Northern Arizona to age a high school photograph of Rice, who was later determined to have been married and estranged from her family. “On January 23, 2023, the victim found her voice,” the sheriff’s office said in the post announcing the identification. “Through the use of forensic genetic genealogy, the victim has been identified as Colleen Audrey Rice. DNA testing of a relative confirmed this after countless hours of investigation into her family tree and contact with distant family relatives.” Advances in DNA technology enabled the identification after five decades of frustration, the dnasolves website said. “Early in the investigation, her fingerprints were sent to the FBI in Washington and a report of her expensive dental work was distributed in prominent dental magazines. Those records were checked against thousands of patient files,” the site said, but none of the inquiries led to anything. According to the sheriff’s office: “Little is known of her life or how she came to be in Arizona. It is unknown if she had children as no records could be found.” The investigation is ongoing into who was responsible for her death, the agency added. Law enforcement has become increasingly reliant on genetics to help identify victims and suspects in recent years. Earlier this month, police in Idaho used DNA on public genealogy databases to identify a man suspected in the murders of four university students.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/28/crowdfunded-dna-identifies-murdered-woman-sack-arizona-desert;guardian;entertainment & culture;752
5304;5304;Euan Blair’s edtech firm Multiverse reports sixth straight year of losses;2023-01-04T15:27:14Z;['Rupert Neate'];['Apprenticeships', 'Annual results', 'Business', 'Education', 'UK news', 'Tony Blair', 'Politics'];;"Euan Blair’s apprenticeship company, Multiverse, made a pre-tax loss of £14.2m last year – the sixth straight year of losses since the son of the former prime minister set it up in 2016. Despite the losses – including £10.9m in 2021 and just over £5m in 2020 – the company was awarded the coveted tech “unicorn” status when it was valued at £1.4bn in fundraising driven by US venture capital firms in June 2022. That investment valued Blair’s stake in the company at an estimated £420m, far more than his father Tony’s reported £60m fortune. Multiverse, which uses automated predictive software to match apprentices with companies based on their aptitude and attitude rather than grades, reported revenues of £27.3m for the year to 31 March 2022, in accounts filed with Companies House on Wednesday. That was up from £10m in the previous year, and means the company is valued at more than 50 times its sales.
The so-called “edtech” company said it expected to claim tax credits of £2.7m against 2022 losses to use against future profits. It also expected to claim £2m in the previous year. Multiverse matches school leavers with more than 300 employers including Google, Facebook, Morgan Stanley and Depop, and provides on-the-job training tailored to the needs of employees, as well as personal coaching and extracurricular activities and societies akin to those at university. It employed 312 people at the time of the accounts being filed. The training is funded by a 0.5% levy placed on companies with an annual payroll bill of more than £3m. This can be spent on their own training costs or transferred to other organisations, such as Multiverse. Blair claims that some young people have turned down places at Oxford to join his scheme. His business, co-founded with his friend Sophie Adelman, offers what he claims is “a genuine, credible alternative that can compete with university”. Tony Blair was elected prime minister in 1997 after promising that his three priorities would be “education, education, education”, and he later set a target of getting 50% of school leavers into university. The target was not hit until 2019. But Euan Blair argues that the nation’s “obsession with the academic as a marker of potential and talent” is holding back people from minority groups and failing to serve the needs of employers in a digital age. Euan Blair, who studied ancient history at the University of Bristol before going on to Yale, has said he “didn’t love studying”, but when he was growing up, going to university was seen as the only route to a top job. He says he hit upon the idea of setting up a training provider after his first job, at the investment bank Morgan Stanley. Last year he bought a five-storey townhouse in west London for a reported £22m. The seven-bedroom residence, which he shares with his wife, Suzanne Ashman, and their two children, features a two-storey “iceberg” basement with an indoor pool, gym and multi-car garage. A spokesperson for Multiverse said: “We’re at the forefront of growing the number of apprenticeship opportunities in both the UK and the US, doubling the number of apprentices we’re training, expanding our geographic reach, and increasing our team of world-class coaches. “We have made significant investments across all teams at Multiverse to set ourselves up for greater scale in the year ahead. We’re focusing our efforts on supporting a rapidly growing number of apprentices, raising awareness, and building an outstanding alternative to university through apprenticeships.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/04/euan-blair-edtech-firm-multiverse-reports-sixth-straight-year-of-losses;guardian;business & economy;5304

The diminutive, hopelessly dweeby lawman puts on his best Judge Dredd impression, proclaiming “I. Am. The. Law.” and vowing to go after anyone harboring classified documents, be they “Democrat, Republican, or whatever Trump is now”.
He turns the microphone over to a trio of FBI agents who provide details about searches conducted at the homes of former vice-president Mike Pence (“Right away, I knew: this man needs a friend”), Vice-President Kamala Harris (“Joe Biden won’t even give this woman a pen, you think she has classified documents?”), and former President Barack Obama (“Beyonce called him on his cell phone and he ignored it!”). It’s a weak cold open befitting what is, let’s face it, a weak scandal. The show even acknowledges this by seriously asking: “When we done playing with these little papers, we’re going to head down to Memphis and make sure justice is served there, right?”
Michael B Jordan hosts for the first time. Filming some of the videos for the show makes for “a full circle moment” for the actor, as the studio is the same place where he filmed one of his first acting roles on the soap All My Children. His trip down memory lane includes a clip from that series in which he “hit puberty” about halfway through. Jordan talks about a recent breakup and fends off the ferocious advances of several members of the cast, including Ego Nwodim in a full wedding gown and Punkie B Johnson, who may be gay, but is also “Punkie B Curious.”. SNL tends to go to this same well every time they have a male sex symbol host.
A cooking segment on Good Morning Today sees the return of host Francine (Sarah Sherman), who missed the previous day’s episode because she “got stuck on a runaway roller coaster going 150 miles an hour for 19 hours straight”. Cut to Sherman looking “nuts” with her hair blown all the way back and a rictus grin plastered over her face. A little later, Jordan shows up as the weatherman, who was also stuck on the same coaster. The initial sight gag is funny, but the wackiness wears thin fast.
A commercial for Southwest sees the airline apologize for stranding thousands of fliers over the holidays. They promise a better experience moving forward thanks to new system and policy changes, including upgrading their system to Dell computers, completely getting rid of check-in, and staffing their flights crews with former Waffle House employees (“Come at us if you want, but these big bitches don’t play”). The skit betrays a weird animosity towards Southwest customers throughout.
At a hotel in the Dominican Republic, two cabana boys (Marcello Hernández and Kenan Thompson) riff on movies and confuse vacationing guests for American TV personalities such as Ellen DeGeneres, Tony Soprano, and both “the old Little Mermaid and the new Little Mermaid.” As with almost every segment that’s centered Hernández so far, the humor revolves entirely around over-the-top Latino accents. Already dire, this one is done no favors by the fact that Jordan can’t pull his accent off.
Next, Jordan plays Jake from State Farm. After helping a young family out with their policy, he sticks around, worming his way into their lives much to the chagrin of the jealous husband. Things grow increasingly dark, and soon we’re watching a dangerous stranger erotic thriller of the kind we used to get in the 90s. Jordan is so convincing in the role he ought to make one of these movies for real.
On Weekend Update, Michael Che’s doorman Carl comes on to discuss rent hikes throughout New York, but all he does is rib Che over his drunken antics, as well as his love life and family problems (“Hey Che – you know that kid came looking for you”). Thompson is having silly fun, but it’s instantly forgettable.
He’s followed by Every Boxer’s Girlfriend from Every Boxing Movie About Boxing Ever (Heidi Gardner) who demands vengeance against Adonis Creed for savagely beating her husband Tommy’s brain to mush in their recent fight. Creed shows up and puts the moves on her after revealing they had a past romance. As a parody of Jordan’s blockbuster franchise, it leaves a lot to be desired.
A male confidence seminar sees Andrew Dismukes’ “alpha” life coach dispense bad wisdom to a bunch of shy nerds. After he’s rude to Jordan’s interrupting water delivery guy, the guy demolishes his confidence by making fun of his large forehead, before stealing his students away. The whole thing is over before it begins, which is fine since there isn’t anything to it. It’s felt odd that SNL has shied away from taking on the spate of men’s rights activist gurus (read: con artists) like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson given their prevalence over the last couple of years, but if this sketch is any indication, perhaps it’s better if they leave it to others.
As mentioned earlier, SNL can’t pass up the chance to ogle a hunky host, and it was a foregone conclusion that at some point in the night, we would see Jordan showing off the goods. That comes by way of the next sketch, which sees him play a male stripper at a bachelorette party. His striptease is interrupted by his very pregnant wife, who’s been sitting out in the car. She comes in to charge her phone, but soon gets in on the act, much to the extreme discomfort of the partygoers.
It’s followed by a commercial for King Brothers’ Toyota Overstock Sale-A-Thon. The namesake brothers (Dismukes, James Austin Johnson) give viewers very specific directions to their dealership, warning them to take a “hard, HARD left” immediately after the freeway exit, lest they find themselves stuck in “the massive overflow line for the new Raising Cane’s”. The ad spirals into a tirade against the “Brigham Chamber of Commerce and their villainous patron, Councilman Hugo Gallegos” for destroying their business and lives by renting out all the property around them to prohibitively popular fast-food chains. While not a new classic, it’s a good example of late-episode weirdness that’s been missing of late. The best sketch of the episode by a wide margin.
Things close out with a pre-filmed, backstage sketch in which a nervous Jordan keeps slipping and falling in front of Dismukes. Despite a few chuckle-worthy moments, it makes for a paltry end to the show. Jordan made for a mostly fine host, but not a particularly strong or memorable one. And although the episode was far from a disaster, there was a noticeable dip in quality after last week’s very strong return.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/29/saturday-night-live-michael-b-jordan-hosts;guardian;entertainment & culture;509
3824;3824;Meta alleges surveillance firm collected data on 600,000 users via fake accounts;2023-01-12T22:21:10Z;['Sam Levin', 'Johana Bhuiyan'];['Meta', 'Facebook', 'Technology', 'Social networking', 'Surveillance', 'Privacy'];;"Meta has sued to block a surveillance company from using Facebook and Instagram, alleging the firm, which has partnered with law enforcement, created tens of thousands of fake accounts to collect user data.
A complaint filed on Thursday asks a judge to permanently ban Voyager Labs from accessing Meta’s sites and comes after a Guardian investigation revealed the company had partnered with the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) in 2019 and claimed that it could use social media information to predict who may commit a future crime. Public records obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-profit organization, and shared with the Guardian in 2021, showed that Voyager’s services enabled police to surveil and investigate people by reconstructing their digital lives and making assumptions about their activity, including their network of friends. In one internal record, Voyager suggested that it considered using an Instagram name displaying Arab pride or tweeting about Islam to be signs of potential extremism. The lawsuit in federal court in California details activities that Meta says it uncovered in July 2022, alleging that Voyager used surveillance software that relied on fake accounts to scrape data from Facebook and Instagram, as well as Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Telegram. Voyager created and operated more than 38,000 fake Facebook accounts to collect information from more than 600,000 Facebook users, including posts, likes, friends lists, photos, comments and information from groups and pages, according to the complaint. The affected users included employees of non-profits, universities, media organizations, healthcare facilities, the US armed forces and local, state and federal government agencies, along with full-time parents, retirees and union members, Meta said in its filing. It is unclear who Voyager’s clients were at that time and what entities may have received the data. But Voyager, which has offices in the US, the United Kingdom, Israel, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, designed its software to hide its presence from Meta and sold and licensed for profit the data it obtained, the suit says. “Our hope is to amplify this message that this is not the right way to police people or the public,” Jessica Romero, Meta’s director of platform enforcement and litigation, said in an interview. “Some of the types of people that were impacted really don’t fit the kind of criminal profile that Voyager tries to sell as the focus of their data collection and analysis.” Voyager representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Some features that Voyager advertised in the records obtained by the Brennan Center posed significant ethical questions, including one the company called an “active persona” which appeared to facilitate police use of fake profiles to gain access to otherwise private information on Facebook. In November 2021, after the internal records were revealed, Facebook sent the LAPD a letter demanding that it cease all social media surveillance use of “dummy” accounts, saying fake accounts were a violation of the company’s policy requiring that people use their real names. The Meta-owned platform also said at the time that using data obtained from the platform for “surveillance, including the processing of platform data about people, groups, or events for law enforcement or national security purposes” was prohibited. While it is unclear whether the LAPD ultimately used the fake profile feature while working with Voyager, emails showed that officers said it was a “great function” and a “need-to-have” service.
Voyager is a part of a broader industry of better-known players like Palantir that purport to make crime predictions based on past behaviors and activity including those shared on social media. While the practice has been criticized by privacy and civil liberty advocates as pseudoscience that does little more than perpetuate bias and discrimination in policing, law enforcement continues to be eager to acquire solutions that purport to make their jobs more efficient and, in turn, validate their decisions. And tech firms working to offset the industry’s slowing growth have increasingly answered law enforcement’s call for new surveillance and policing products. “This is an industry that has a lot of technical capabilities, some of which are pretty sophisticated and yet there’s no oversight or accountability,” Romero said. “We view this as us doing our part to bring to light the kinds of information and conduct we’ve uncovered.” Rachel Levinson-Waldman, managing director of the Brennan Center’s liberty and national security program, said Meta’s lawsuit demonstrated how software tools like Voyager’s can enable mass scraping of data: “It’s a really wide range of people who have been affected by this, and the public should notice and be alarmed by the scope of this kind of collection.” She said the case could also have an impact beyond Voyager and should discourage police from pursuing these kinds of technologies: “It sends a pretty clear signal generally to the surveillance-for-hire industry that they could face legal action, and I hope it also sends a signal to police departments and other law enforcement agencies that are considering these tools.”";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/12/meta-voyager-labs-surveillance-fake-accounts;guardian;science & technology;3824
2536;2536;Labour calls for inquiry over Nadhim Zahawi tax affairs;2023-01-19T12:48:23Z;['Rowena Mason', 'Pippa Crerar'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;Labour has called for an inquiry into whether Nadhim Zahawi broke the ministerial code or misled the public over his tax affairs during his time as chancellor. Anneliese Dodds, the chair of the Labour party, wrote to Rishi Sunak on Wednesday saying there should be an inquiry if Zahawi, the Conservative party chair, does not fully explain why he paid millions of pounds in tax to HMRC. Sunak came under pressure about Zahawi’s tax affairs at prime minister’s questions, and told MPs that the Tory minister had “already addressed this matter in full”. The prime minister was asked by the Labour MP Alex Sobel whether he had been aware of any questions from HMRC when he appointed Zahawi to his cabinet and as Tory party chair. “Will the prime minister demand accountability from his cabinet members about their tax affairs?” Sobel asked. Sunak’s official spokesperson said Zahawi “has spoken and been transparent with HMRC”, despite his refusal to answer specific questions. She added: “I don’t know whether the prime minister has reviewed it in full, but I do know that he takes Nadhim Zahawi at his word.” Asked if Sunak was confident he knew everything he needed to know about the affair, she responded “yes” and said he had full confidence in Zahawi. Zahawi has not denied a report in the Sun on Sunday that he paid millions in tax related to his business interests to HMRC, after questions were raised about whether he should have paid capital gains tax on his founding share in YouGov. This was held and sold when it was worth about £20m in 2018 by a Gibraltar-based firm, Balshore Investments, ultimately owned by his parents. But a spokesperson for Zahawi said on Wednesday: “Mr Zahawi’s tax affairs were and are fully up to date and paid in the UK. Neither he nor his direct family are beneficiaries of Balshore Investments or any trust associated with it. “Mr Zahawi has always said that he will answer any questions from HMRC, which he has always done.” It is not clear whether Zahawi approached HMRC to declare an underpayment, or the tax authorities launched an investigation, and whether any penalties were applied. It is also unknown whether a formal investigation was launched by HMRC and whether Zahawi was in any discussions with the tax authorities when he was chancellor from July to September last year. Dodds said the allegations around Zahawi were “deeply concerning”, especially in light of his claim in July last year that he had paid his taxes in full. “If he has not been straight with the British people, or with HMRC, he should have no place in the government,” she said. “What is even more concerning is that Rishi Sunak, the man who promised honesty, integrity and accountability on the steps on No 10, was happy to appoint Nadhim Zahawi to his cabinet. Zahawi needs to come clean about his tax affairs. Sunak needs to come clean about what he knew about this investigation and when.” In her letter to Sunak, Dodds asked him to confirm publicly that a “red flag” was raised by the Cabinet Office on Zahawi’s appointment as chancellor in the summer over his tax affairs, and she asked what assurances the government received from Zahawi at that point. Dodds has also pressed Sunak to say whether Zahawi has provided answers to how much he has agreed to pay HMRC, why he claimed he had paid his taxes in full, and when he was made aware of HMRC’s interest in his tax affairs, among other questions. “If answers to these questions have not been provided, can you confirm that a full cabinet inquiry will take place to determine if Mr Zahawi has misled the British public and broken the ministerial code? And if that inquiry finds that he did, will you remove him from post immediately?” she wrote. Zahawi has been approached for comment. The Liberal Democrats demanded that the government’s ethics adviser investigate. The party’s deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said: “Rishi Sunak must order an investigation by his ethics adviser into any potential conflict of interest posed by this case during Zahawi’s time as chancellor. “There was a vacuum of accountability during the summer when there was no ethics adviser in post. It’s only right this is properly looked into. The public deserves full transparency, not another Conservative cover-up. Anything less would make a mockery of Sunak’s promise to govern with integrity.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/18/labour-calls-for-inquiry-over-nadhim-zahawi-tax-affairs;guardian;politics;2536
1253;1253;Trans woman guilty of raping two women remanded in female prison in Scotland;2023-01-25T18:49:00Z;['Libby Brooks'];['Scotland', 'UK news', 'Transgender', 'Society', 'Prisons and probation', 'UK criminal justice', 'Law', 'Gender', 'Scottish National party (SNP)'];;Politicians, campaigners and a UN special rapporteur have all expressed grave concerns that a transgender woman found guilty of raping two women before transitioning is being remanded in a female prison. Opponents of the Scottish government’s gender recognition reforms – which the UK government has blocked from going for royal assent because of “safety issues for women and children” – said that the case vindicated their concerns about lack of safeguards in the bill. Isla Bryson, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, was found guilty of two charges of rape on Tuesday after a six-day trial at the high court in Glasgow. After the conviction, Bryson was remanded in custody to the women’s prison Cornton Vale, where it is understood she is being kept in segregation, until sentencing at the end of February. Bryson first appeared in court in 2019 as Adam Graham and both victims knew their attacker by that name. The jury heard Bryson raped two women – one in Clydebank in 2016 and one in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019 – after meeting them online. Prosecutors described Bryson as “preying” on vulnerable women. As he raised an urgent question in the Holyrood chamber on Wednesday afternoon, the Scottish Conservative community safety spokesperson Russell Findlay, said it was “entirely inappropriate, unacceptable and wrong” for such an offender to be housed in a female prison “which is bound to contain women who have been victims of male violence, sexual violence and abuse”. Findlay demanded the immediate publication of the Scottish Prison Service’s (SPS) long-awaited review of policy as regards transgender prisoners, which the justice secretary Keith Brown confirmed would be released “in the coming months”. Brown also underlined that the gender recognition reform bill – which simplifies how transgender individuals change their legal gender – does not affect the SPS approach to trans prisoners, which is based on the detailed assessment of risk for the individual, other prisoners and prison staff. The Guardian understands that a case conference takes place within 24 hours of any prisoner’s arrival, involving SPS staff, with NHS and psychological input and an equality and diversity officer, in order to assess risk, and that segregation decisions must be reviewed at least monthly. Asked about the scenario on BBC Radio 4’s PM, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: “The fact of the matter is there is no automatic right for a trans woman convicted of an offence to go to a women’s prison.” “The Scottish Prison Service, which individually assesses all prisoners or potential prisoners, does detailed risk assessments that are about the safety of the individual prisoner [and] of those that will be around the individual prisoner.” A SPS spokesperson said: “Where there are any concerns about any risks posed by an individual, either to themselves or others, we retain the ability to keep them separate from the mainstream population until an agreed management plan is in place.” Findlay also said it was “traumatic and demeaning for any rape victim to hear their brutal attacker referred to as ‘she’ and ‘her’ in court proceedings”. In December he worked cross-party with Michelle Thomson, one of the SNP backbenchers who rebelled at the bill’s first vote, on an amendment to prevent anyone accused of a sexual offence changing legal sex until the end of their court proceedings. But the amendment was defeated by one vote. The Guardian understands that in advance of the Bryson case, all parties agreed that the defendant was previously known as Graham, and that witnesses had encountered the individual using that name. No guidance was issued to witnesses on addressing the defendant nor were they corrected when referring to the defendant as “Adam Graham” or “he”. Rhona Hotchkiss, a former governor of Cornton Vale and outspoken critic of the gender reforms, told the Guardian: “My fear was that under self-identification it would open the floodgates and open the prison service to legal challenge if [these individuals] weren’t moved to the women’s estate”. She suggested that the frequency of segregation reviews meant the SPS would “struggle” to keep Bryson from mixing with female prisoners. Responding to the news, Reem Asalem, the UN’s special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, said she was “Remembering the many times we were told that the idea that predatory and violent males may want to take advantage of the presence of loopholes in system and weak safeguards to enter spaces reserved for females was ludicrous!” Before the GRR bill was passed in December, Alsalem sent a highly critical letter to the UK government in which she raised concerns that the reforms would “open the door for violent males” to abuse the process. The court heard that Bryson was currently taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/25/trans-woman-isla-bryson-guilty-raping-two-women-remanded-in-female-prison-scotland;guardian;entertainment & culture;1253
153;153;Sickle cell disease patients in England feel neglected, report says;2023-01-31T11:00:01Z;['Tobi Thomas'];['Sickle cell disease', 'Health', 'NHS', 'Race', 'Health policy', 'Society', 'UK news'];;People in England with sickle cell disease are experiencing “neglect” and “poor hospital experiences that can cause avoidable harm”, according to a report. The study, commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory and undertaken by Public Digital, explored the experiences of people who had undergone acute emergency hospital admissions for sickle cell, as well as managing crisis episodes at home. The research found sickle cell care had a “limited amount of technology” or “dedicated health sites” to support patients in a crisis. Furthermore, people with sickle cell who took part in the study reported feeling that their crisis pain was undermined while expressing frustration at feeling deprioritised by the healthcare system. Sickle cell disease changes the shape of blood cells into crescents, hindering blood flow. Sufferers experience severe painful episodes, which can require hospital admission. Life expectancy can be 20 to 30 years shorter than in the general population. The condition is more prevalent in people with an African or Caribbean family background, according to the NHS. Part of the study’s conclusion was that the NHS should “redesign the operating model of sickle cell services”. Mary Adeturinmo, a 29-year-old student from London who participated in the study, said she often felt “at the mercy of healthcare professionals who are unaware of what is required to treat a person living with sickle cell”. She added: “My overall care experience in the NHS has varied from excellent to very questionable. Due to my long-term health condition, I have had multiple hospital admissions. I was ecstatic to find Public Digital’s research project. This research is significant as there needs to be a more diverse, in-depth analysis and understanding of the condition and the impact felt by the people living with this condition.” The report follows a watershed inquiry by the all-party parliamentary group on sickle cell and thalassaemia published in November 2021 that found there were “serious care failings” in acute services for sickle cell as well as evidence to suggest such attitudes are often underpinned by racism. Dr Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said: “Alongside the data, the voices of those with lived experience provide stark feedback on the often substandard care received whilst trying to cope with this chronic disease. Thanks to their input, we have now agreed a series of targeted actions and recommendations for healthcare providers to take forward across the NHS.” John James, the chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: “It is not acceptable that the NHS continues to provide substandard, variable care to those in pain during a sickle cell crisis. Patients are not receiving acceptable, reliable levels of care, with one too many reporting poor experiences in accessing timely medications to reduce their crisis episodes. “The Sickle Cell Society looks forward to progressing the recommendations from Public Digital and the Race and Health Observatory to solve these historic and debilitating health inequalities which continue to disrupt the lives of people living with sickle cell disorder and their families.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/31/sickle-cell-disease-patients-feel-neglected-nhs-england-eport;guardian;health;153
5563;5563;WA government declares emergency as record flood hits Kimberley;2023-01-03T08:40:17Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Western Australia', 'Australia news', 'Australia weather'];;"A record flood has hit Western Australia’s Kimberley region as ex-tropical Cyclone Ellie passes through the region. The Fitzroy River was above 15 metres on Tuesday morning and was projected to reach 15.6 metres on Tuesday night – 1.5 metres higher than the previous record. Homes and businesses were swamped, people were being evacuated and animals fled as Ellie moved slowly from Fitzroy Crossing to Broome. It is likely to be near Broome by Wednesday morning. The state government declared an emergency situation and told people in Fitzroy Crossing to evacuate if possible. Water pouring over the Fitzroy Crossing Bridge damaged its piers and surrounding roads were closed. “I don’t think anyone ever envisaged where we’d see the water running over the top of that bridge – it’s a terrible state of affairs,” the fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, said.
On Tuesday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of intense rainfall, damaging winds and flash flooding. Wind peaks of 100km/h were possible, the bureau said, adding that “the extended nature of this event and associated flooding is unusual and dangerous”. Derby, Cape Leveque, Cockatoo Island and Kuri Bay could also be affected. The bureau’s James Ashley said an “amazing amount of water” had fallen and Ellie had the potential to “reinvigorate” into a cyclone if it reached the open ocean.
The WA emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, said there had been 18 calls for assistance so far. “This is a dangerous and fast-changing situation and more rain is expected over the next few days,” he said. “Please take care of yourself and your family members and stay tuned to the emergency WA website and the local ABC station.” Anyone considering travelling to the region should reconsider, he said. Klemm said it was at least a one-in-100-year flood. Authorities were delivering supplies to Aboriginal communities and Fitzroy Crossing but deliveries were being complicated by the weather, he said. It was “incredibly sad” to see animals swept away in the water and it would to take a long time for the water to recede.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/03/wa-government-declares-emergency-as-record-flood-hits-kimberley;guardian;environment;5563
2407;2407;Michael Clarke and Karl Stefanovic clash proves tabloid gold as Daily Mail chastises Nine and ABC | The Weekly Beast;2023-01-20T00:58:39Z;['Amanda Meade'];['Australian media', 'Sky News Australia', 'Australia news', 'Media', 'News Corporation', 'Nine Entertainment', 'Michael Clarke', 'Nine newspapers', 'Australian Broadcasting Corporation', 'Jacinda Ardern'];;"The Daily Mail called it “the biggest story in Australia on Thursday” and the News Corp tabloids agreed, serving up salacious front pages that editors of a scandal sheet can be proud of. The cricket-themed headlines “Hit for Sex”, “Sex and Out” and “Slapped for Sex” led the Herald Sun, Daily Telegraph and Courier Mail papers in the morning and the websites throughout the day. What was the story the Daily Mail was so excited about that it even chastised the ABC and Channel Nine for not covering it? “The story has been lapped up by Channel Seven, almost all Australian news websites and even a handful of international outlets, including the New York Post – but there has been radio silence from Channel Nine and the ABC,” the Mail said. For the record, the Guardian ignored it as well, until now.
It was a shirtless Michael Clarke, captured on video in a public altercation with his girlfriend Jade Yarbrough. A distressed Yarbrough slapped the former Australian cricket captain and repeatedly accused him of cheating on her with an ex-girlfriend. The Tele got its hands on the grainy footage filmed earlier this month at night in a park in Noosa – but the audio was clear and very spicy. What made it tabloid gold was the presence of Karl Stefanovic, who is Jade’s brother-in-law, and a mate of Clarke’s. The Today co-host was holidaying with the couple and was drawn into the melee. As one Tele reporter told Weekly Beast: “It is the best tabloid story since James Packer and David Gyngell had a fistfight in Bondi.” The papers lapped it up, even carrying a QR code so readers could access the footage easily, and across four full pages inside they published transcripts of the audio and back stories on Clarke’s romantic history. Nine may have avoided the yarn but rival Seven breakfast show Sunrise was all over the story. Ever the professional, Stefanovic fronted Today as if nothing had happened with his new on-air partner, Sarah Abo, dodged paparazzi at the airport and flew to Melbourne for a media meet and greet before hosting Today from the Australian Open. He mingled with journalists at Rod Laver Arena but Channel Nine minders ensured any video discussion was off limits.
“It also hasn’t been mentioned on any of Nine’s websites, despite being a huge traffic opportunity,” the Mail thundered. “While Nine’s reason for ignoring the story is obvious – its golden boy Stefanovic is involved – news bosses at the ABC probably believed it was simply too low-brow for their viewers.” Nine Radio 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley was quoted in a Tele article, however, headed “Australia reacts to Michael Clarke and Karl Stefanovic’s wild public showdown”, saying “If I were to give advice to a 41-year-old male adult, who I don’t know ... it would be along the lines of keep it in your pants, son”; while entertainment reporter Peter Ford described the park scene as “like a scene from Housos”. While Channel Nine gave it a wide berth, Nine’s publishing arm carried a story in the morning without bylines. Later the chief sports reporter, Andrew Webster, defended Clarke, and admitted he had spoken to him the night after the incident and nothing seemed awry. “He isn’t a terrible guy, just terribly flawed like the rest of us, constantly looking for love in all the wrong places. Like all professional sportspeople, he seems to struggle with life in retirement.” The Tele reportedly bought the footage for $10,000 and Clarke was unaware someone had filmed him until a reporter contacted him for comment a week after the incident. The editor of the Telegraph, Ben English, did not respond to a request for comment. Jacinda mania Most media organisations reacted to Jacinda Ardern’s shock resignation by noting the New Zealand prime minister’s two historic terms during which she handled the nation’s worst terrorist attack and a pandemic while being the world’s youngest serving female leader and one of only two women to give birth while in office. Not the Australian, whose front-page headline on Friday read “Empty end for ‘saint’ of left”. Foreign editor Greg Sheridan said Ardern’s handling of Covid “made Dan Andrews look like a Milton Friedman/Ayn Rand libertarian”. She was “a flop” and “a dreadful prime minister” and “a perfect princess of woke”, he added. “All her economic instincts were bad, all her strategic instincts were bad. She had a great desire to undo productive economic reform and remove or shut down the engines of economic growth for what should be a nation of limitless opportunity.”
You wouldn’t think it could get any worse than Sheridan’s assessment. But Fox News’s Tucker Carlson managed to be even more insulting, referring to her as “the lady with the big teeth” and a “Chinese puppet”. “And some rare good news: The appalling prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern – that’s the lady with the big teeth who tormented her citizens – has just announced she is leaving office,” he said. “What are the chances she was a puppet of the Chinese government? We don’t have enough evidence to prove that, but we would rate that as about 100% likely.” ABC cleared over Deves story The media watchdog has cleared the ABC of misleading viewers in a story broadcast in April about the federal election campaign and the failed Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves. It was a welcome relief for Aunty, still smarting from a ruling that a Four Corners two-part documentary on Fox News and the 2020 US election breached the accuracy and fair dealing requirements.
In the 7pm bulletin the ABC reporter referred to Deves’ apology for a social media post about trans prisoners, reading out the tweet in part and showing it in full on screen: “Half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders, compared with less than 20% for the rest of the male estate. That should tell you something.” The complaint said not reading the tweet in full was likely to mislead ABC viewers to think that Deves was speaking about all trans-identified males, not just trans-identified male prisoners. The Australian Communications and Media Authority disagreed and dismissed the complaint. New Age The Age’s news editor, Patrick Elligett, has been named editor following the resignation last month of Gay Alcorn who stepped down to care for her husband as he battles a serious health problem. Elligett served as world editor for the Nine Entertainment title before becoming news editor in 2020 but has had a relatively short career at the Age, joining in 2019 from the New Daily, where he was editor-in-chief. The rest of his career was spent in regional journalism. The executive editor of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, Tory Maguire, said it was a competitive field of candidates. “Patrick laid out a highly strategic, clear-eyed and bold plan for growing the Age’s audience and subscriber base while also boosting the masthead’s role in leading the big conversations in Melbourne, Victoria and the nation,” Maguire said.

Bellis, who decried Pattis’s actions as “inexcusable” and an “abject failure”, wrote: “We cannot expect our system of justice or our attorneys to be perfect, but we can expect fundamental fairness and decency.” Pattis had sent out medical records pertaining to some of the families of those killed during the Sandy Hook attack, along with other information that was considered confidential, Bellis’s ruling showed. Despite Pattis’s claim that the release of the records was an “inadvertent mistake”, Bellis “flatly rejects” the claim. In her court order, she wrote that “there was no fairness or decency” in how Pattis handled “sensitive and personal information” at the center of a lawsuit in which the families of Sandy Hook victims accused Jones of using the shooting that killed 26 at the school to build his audience and make millions of dollars through his false claims that the tragedy was a hoax aimed at forcing the US to accept gun reform. “At a basic level, attorneys must competently and appropriately handle the discovery of sensitive materials in civil cases. Otherwise, our civil system, in which discovery of sensitive information is customary and routine, would simply collapse,” Bellis continued. An assistant of another attorney for Jones, in a related case in Texas, mistakenly sent their legal adversaries Jones’s text messages that contradicted sworn statements from Jones claiming he had nothing on his phone related to the deadly school shooting. Rulings in the lawsuits against Jones in Texas, where he resides, and Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook attack occurred, have resulted in Jones being ordered to pay more than $1bn in damages after he was found to have unduly inflicted anguish on victims’ families, among other harm. In a statement to the Associated Press, Pattis said he plans to challenge the order with a higher court, writing: “We’re looking forward to appellate review.” Pattis is currently representing a member of the rightwing extremist group Proud Boys in Washington DC who has been criminally charged with seditious conspiracy surrounding the violent January 6 riots that took place at the US Capitol exactly two years ago Friday.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/alex-jones-lawyer-license-suspended-sensitive-records-release;guardian;politics;4832

4186;4186;Soaring food and energy prices could persist ‘for next two years’;2023-01-11T09:30:13Z;['Richard Partington'];['Davos 2023', 'Davos', 'Global economy', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Energy industry', 'Food & drink industry', 'World news', 'Switzerland', 'Cost of living crisis', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Coronavirus', 'Russia', 'Ukraine'];;"Soaring prices for energy and food could persist for the next two years, hurting global efforts to combat poverty and the climate crisis, a report prepared for next week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has warned. The WEF’s annual global risks report found the international cost of living crisis unleashed by the Covid pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine topped the list of concerns in a survey of more than 1,200 global experts, policymakers and business leaders. Sounding the alarm in the run-up to the annual gathering of world leaders in the Swiss mountain resort, it said the energy and food supply crunch was likely to persist for the next two years as the biggest risk to the world economy. Highlighting how the pandemic and the war in Europe have triggered a series of deeply interconnected global risks, it said the fallout could undermine collaboration between countries to tackle longer-term problems including the climate crisis, protecting biodiversity, and efforts to reduce poverty.
“These create follow-on risks that will dominate the next two years: the risk of recession; growing debt distress; a continued cost of living crisis; polarised societies enabled by disinformation and misinformation; a hiatus on rapid climate action; and zero-sum geo-economic warfare,” the report said. The WEF report, produced in partnership with Marsh McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, argued that a “window for action” on the most serious long-term threats was closing rapidly. “Concerted, collective action is needed before risks reach a tipping point,” it said. “Unless the world starts to cooperate more effectively on climate mitigation and climate adaptation, over the next 10 years this will lead to continued global warming and ecological breakdown.” Inflation has soared in many countries around the world after the hit to the global economy from Covid was followed by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine driving up wholesale energy costs and disrupting food supply chains. A third of the world economy is expected to be in recession in 2023, reflecting the effects of the war, lingering high inflation and the rising cost of borrowing for households, businesses and governments as major central banks push up interest rates. Saadia Zahidi, a managing director at the World Economic Forum, said: “The short-term risk landscape is dominated by energy, food, debt and disasters. Those that are already the most vulnerable are suffering – and in the face of multiple crises, those who qualify as vulnerable are rapidly expanding, in rich and poor countries alike. “Climate and human development must be at the core of concerns of global leaders, even as they battle current crises. Cooperation is the only way forward.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/11/soaring-food-and-energy-prices-could-persist-for-next-two-years-davos;guardian;business & economy;4186
5322;5322;Victorian court allows abused altar boy’s children and wife to sue Catholic church;2023-01-04T14:00:05Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['Law (Australia)', 'Victoria', 'Australia news', 'Catholicism', 'Alcoholism', 'Domestic violence', 'Christianity'];;"A Victorian court has paved the way for the children and wife of an abused altar boy to sue the Catholic church, alleging the church’s failings caused their father and husband to become a violent alcoholic and drug addict who beat them later in life. The abuse victim, now dead, was an altar boy in north-west Victoria in the mid-1970s when he was allegedly raped by Father Bryan Coffey, a parish priest who allegedly used his role as the supervisor of the local school’s cross-country team to prey on children. Coffey, who died in 2013, is alleged to have abused nine children across four parishes between 1960 and 1975. The church allegedly moved Coffey between various parish appointments because of “knowledge or suspicion that he was capable of child abuse”.
In the years that followed his abuse, the altar boy began drinking heavily and later developed a serious substance abuse disorder. He was violent and abusive to his wife, whom he married roughly a decade later, and their two children, according to court documents. Now the wife and two children, who cannot be identified, have sued the Catholic church, alleging they are “secondary victims” of its failure to prevent Coffey from abusing children. They allege the church should have known that failing to protect the boy from abuse meant that, if he went on to have a family, his immediate relatives would be left “vulnerable to the risk of harm”. The case is unique in that it alleges the church had a duty of care to the victim’s immediate family members, despite the fact that the abuse happened more than a decade before he met his wife and before the two children were born. If the argument is accepted at any trial, the case could set a precedent that would potentially expose the church to claims from other immediate family members who have suffered intergenerational trauma caused by clergy abuse. Last month the church failed to have the claim struck out in the Victorian supreme court. In a judgment last week, Justice Andrew Keogh said the case was “novel” because it argued the church had a duty of care to the victim’s future wife and unborn children, who had no relationship to him at the time of the alleged abuse. He said the argument, made by law firm Ken Cush and Associates, was “not certain to fail” and should be determined at trial, after hearing all the evidence. “While the Diocese could not have known of the family plaintiffs at the time of the abuse, that does not mean they should not have had in contemplation members of [the abuse victim’s] immediate family as a class of persons who might suffer harm if negligence by the Diocese led to the abuse,” he said. Keogh said the plaintiffs would need to confront the “very substantial physical and temporal distance between the abuse and the harm that they suffered” and lead detailed evidence about the connection between the child abuse and their associated harm more than a decade later. He rejected the church’s argument that the case could “permit a wider scope of the types of family members pursuing secondary victim claims, such as grandchildren and great-grandchildren”. Keogh said the current claim related only to an abuse victim’s immediate family. The case is also attempting to establish that the church owed a “fiduciary duty” to all parishioners, which obliged them to “act with undivided loyalty in the interests of that parishioner, including by not promoting the interests of the Diocese (and/or of the Catholic Church) at the expense of the interests of the parishioner”. That fiduciary duty meant the church was obliged to protect the best interests of its child parishioners. “The plaintiffs plead that the Diocese breached the fiduciary duties by appointing Coffey parish priest and maintaining him in that appointment, thus enabling him to perpetrate the abuse,” Keogh wrote. The church also tried and failed to have this argument – a new concept in such cases – struck out.";https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jan/05/victorian-court-allows-abused-altar-boys-children-and-wife-to-sue-catholic-church;guardian;entertainment & culture;5322
1925;1925;‘Eating or breathing’: energy costs force stark choices on disabled people;2023-01-22T14:40:28Z;['Patrick Butler'];['UK cost of living crisis', 'Disability', 'Fuel poverty', 'Household bills', 'Poverty', 'Energy bills', 'Society', 'Money', 'Social exclusion', 'Inflation', 'UK news'];;"Soaring energy bills are forcing people with severe disabilities and chronic health conditions to choose in extreme cases between “eating or breathing” as they struggle to navigate the cost of living crisis, research shows. According to a survey by the charity Euan’s Guide, people are either opting to reduce their use of vital, energy-intensive electrical medical aids and equipment – putting their health in jeopardy – or where this is impossible, cutting back drastically on food, heating and travel. Respondents to the survey, many of whom have multiple and complex health conditions, variously report routinely skipping meals, cancelling trips to hospital appointments, switching the heating off and going for days without washing or showering, just so they can keep life-saving equipment turned on. One said: “Everything has gone up, every part of my life is affected. I use a powerchair, stairlift, bath lift and a Cpap machine [to ensure the user continues to breathe while sleeping]. At times I feel like I have to choose between eating and breathing, because my bill a year ago was £60 [a month] and it’s now nearly £150.” Another respondent, Karis Williamson, 24, of Inverness, who has a life-limiting form of muscular dystrophy and is permanently on a ventilation machine, told the Guardian she and her family turned the central heating off for long periods to ensure they could afford to use the medical equipment she relies on.
This includes ventilators and suction pumps to enable her to breathe, a feed pump, a powerchair, electric bed and hoist. “My home is full of equipment that keeps me alive and out of hospital, which also saves the NHS an absolute fortune … I wouldn’t be able to go without any of the everyday equipment and survive,” she said. John Mcclafferty-Brown, 44, of Leicester, who has multiple sclerosis, cancer and arthritis, said he used a Cpap machine at night when he was asleep, but would often risk not using it during the day, even when short of breath, because of the expense, and the need to set aside money for basics such as food and heating. Helen Bolland, 42, of Thirsk, an armed forces veteran who was medically discharged after being injured in Iraq, said she had cancelled hospital appointments because she could not afford the cost of travel. “The cost of living crisis means you make difficult decisions. I’m scared of running up a bill I can’t afford to pay,” she said. Others said they could no longer always power up electric wheelchairs that enabled them to leave their home, or afford aquatherapy and swimming sessions that helped them cope with chronic pain. Some said they now stayed at home all the time and had in effect abandoned their social life, causing depression and anxiety. The findings are from a cost of living questionnaire attached to the annual Euan’s Guide survey of disabled access to venues around the UK. Over 7,000 people responded to the survey, carried out last autumn. It found 68% of respondents had cut back on energy use and 55% said they were less active as a result. “Not only do disabled people face the increased costs of fuel, food, and travel like everyone else, they have the additional cost of simply staying alive, staying active and staying well,” said Paul J Ralph of Euan’s Guide. “It’s a crazy situation when people cannot afford to run essential equipment to stay alive,” he added. Earlier this month the Guardian reported on the plight of the Van Keoghs, who had been told by the NHS that it could no longer guarantee to send nurses to their home to treat their severely disabled son Marley because the family could not afford to keep the heat on overnight. Campaigners have called for a special social tariff to cap the energy bills of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions who are intensive energy users out of necessity, and whose life and wellbeing is at risk if they have to cut energy use. A government spokesperson said: “We understand this is a difficult time for families across the country, including those living with a disability, which is why we have put in place immediate support for this coming winter. This includes direct payments to vulnerable households worth £1,200, plus an additional £150 disability cost of living payment. On top of this, the government’s energy price guarantee will save the typical household around £900 this winter.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/22/energy-costs-disabled-people-cost-of-living-crisis;guardian;business & economy;1925
5839;5839;UK inflation will fall in 2023 but energy bills and taxes will rise as house prices drop. Happy new year | Larry Elliott;2023-01-01T11:16:54Z;['Larry Elliott'];['UK cost of living crisis', 'Inflation', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Bank of England', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Energy bills', 'Household bills', 'Tax', 'Tax and spending', 'Mortgages', 'Housing market', 'House prices', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak', 'UK news', 'Money'];;"War in Europe. Political turmoil. A stagnant economy. Soaring energy bills. The highest inflation rate in more than four decades. Higher interest rates. That was the story of 2022. Truly, the year just gone was – in the words of the late queen – an annus horribilis. So 2023 will have to go some to match its predecessor for drama. The bookies would, for example, give you relatively long odds on it being another year of three prime ministers and four chancellors of the exchequer. Less dramatic does not mean life is going to get any easier. On the contrary, interest rates and taxes are going up, and government support for energy bills is being scaled back. Price increases will still comfortably outstrip earnings growth. The economy will probably do a little better than some of the gloomier forecasters expect – but that’s not saying much. The likelihood is that 2023 will be a lot like 2022, at least for the first half of the year. Clearly, recent history means another black swan event – something major that should have been predictable but still catches people unawares – cannot be ruled out. It is also entirely possible that some of the risks that have been identified will materialise. Russia might resort to nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine. China might decide to invade Taiwan. If so, all the forecasts being made for the coming year would be hastily revised.
But on the (admittedly heroic) assumption that there will be no 2023 equivalent of 2020’s pandemic or 2021’s supply chain bottlenecks, here’s how the economy might pan out in 2023. First, though, a health warning: the tendency of big, unexpected stuff to happen makes economic forecasting a mug’s game. What follows is almost certain to be wrong. Prediction No 1: interest rates will peak at a lower level than financial markets currently expect. There’s not a great deal of good news currently but one hopeful sign is that inflation pressure is easing. The global factors pushing up the cost of living have gone into reverse in recent months. Wholesale gas prices are down more than 50% on last summer’s peak, while UK motorists are benefiting from a drop in the cost of crude oil. Inflation will fall further in early 2023 as last year’s sharp price increases are not repeated, and that will allow central banks to limit future rate rises. That’s just as well because the world’s three biggest economies are all going to struggle in the months ahead. There is no obvious candidate for a locomotive for the global economy in 2023, and further aggressive moves by the leading central banks will mean recessions will be longer and deeper. The Bank of England looks set to push UK official borrowing costs to 4% in February, making it 10 successive increases since December 2021. After that, though, it may decide to wait and see what happens. Prediction No 2: the UK will be in recession for most of the year but it will be relatively shallow.
Back in November, the Bank of England predicted that an already contracting economy would continue to weaken throughout 2023 and only resume growing in 2024. That forecast, however, was predicated on a much higher path of interest rates (a hangover from Liz Truss’s short-lived premiership) than currently looks likely. Given the pressures on household budgets from higher inflation, it is surprising the economy held up as well as it did in the second half of 2022, perhaps supported by people running down excess savings built up when spending opportunities were limited during the coronavirus pandemic. While there is obviously a risk that the economy will suddenly take a marked turn for the worse, the relative strength of the labour market means the peak-to-trough drop in output may be limited to 1.5-2%, a much less dramatic decline than the near 6% contraction in the global financial crisis. Prediction No 3: although the recession will be relatively mild by historic standards, it won’t feel like it. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has helpfully provided a list of the nasties that will face households in the months ahead. Average energy bills will rise by £900 a year as government support is reduced; the typical family will see taxes go up by £700 a year; about 2 million households will move on to more expensive mortgages costing the average fixed-rate homeowner £3,000 a year; and wages will again fail to keep pace with prices. Put all that together and living standards will fall by 3.8% in 2023, an even bigger drop than in 2022. Prediction No 4: there will be a sharp drop in house prices. Britain’s housing market is a key reason why Threadneedle Street is likely to be wary about raising interest rates too aggressively. Prices rose to absurd levels in 2020 and continued to increase until a combination of higher interest rates and unaffordability led to the start of an inevitable correction. The Nationwide building society reported on Friday that prices had fallen for four months in a row, the first time this has happened since the global financial crisis of 2008 – and this process is far from over. It is not a question of whether house prices will fall in 2023 but by how much. Prediction No 5: economic recovery will come too late to save the Conservatives from defeat in 2024. The economy is going to get worse before it gets better. Falling living standards and lower house prices mean little chance of a feelgood factor any time soon. Rishi Sunak has stabilised the markets after the Truss experiment but no more than that. A long period of Tory rule is coming to an end.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/01/uk-inflation-energy-bills-taxes-house-prices-happy-new-year;guardian;business & economy;5839
497;497;Fewer patients treated in England for mood disorders as ‘system creaks under strain’;2023-01-29T17:00:00Z;['Tobi Thomas'];['Mental health', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'NHS', 'Hospitals'];;"The number of patients who have received hospital treatment for mood disorders in England has decreased by a third in five years, as the NHS grapples with a chronic shortage of mental health beds. According to NHS Digital data, more than 23,000 people sought NHS hospital treatment for mood disorders in the country in 2017-18. But by 2021-22, this had dropped to 15,532. The highest fall was among black patients, with the number of hospital admissions almost halving from 1,209 in 2017-18 to 610 in 2021-22. Charities have warned the apparent decrease does not indicate a fall in the number of people experiencing mental health problems, but rather is indicative of the increasing difficulties in accessing hospital treatment.
The data refers to finished admission episodes where mood disorder was a primary diagnosis, with the NHS’s definition referring to a range of illnesses including bipolar disorder and depression. Lucy Schonegevel, associate director of policy and practice at Rethink Mental Illness, said the number of people being admitted to hospital for mood disorders should not be accepted as a “face value” sign that fewer people are becoming unwell. She said: “Instead, it is a potential warning that people may be struggling to access the treatment they need. “There are several explanations why hospital admissions may have fallen, including some positives, but it does speak more to the complex web of care and support people have to navigate – and a system creaking under strain – rather than a drop in demand. “First, positive explanations behind the decrease include the investment in community mental health services in recent years as part of the NHS long-term plan, which could in some areas be starting to reduce the number of hospitalisations. “However, we also know that wards often don’t have enough space to admit people presenting with mental health needs who need life-saving treatment, pushing the threshold for inpatient treatment dangerously high. “This lack of capacity is often due to delayed discharge, when people deemed well enough to leave hospital and restart their lives can’t be discharged due to a lack of social care or supported accommodation. “The answer to this complex equation is not simply to increase the number of beds, but to look at the broader offer of support which helps people to stay well and escape the revolving door of inpatient care. “Mental health services cannot recover from decades of historic underfunding without thorough reform and investment in our social care system.” Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “It is deeply troubling to see such a significant drop in the number of people seeking treatment for mood disorders. Research into why this decline occurred is needed so that we can better understand how to reverse it and provide targeted support to the groups who are worst affected. “People who seek help can often find that services are understaffed and under-resourced, which may discourage them from looking for more support in the future. “Early intervention is not only key to preventing mood disorders from becoming worse but also eases pressure on our mental health services. The government must invest more in these services so that we are able to provide the level of care that people need.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “It is important we do everything we can to support people’s mental health. We are investing at least £2.3bn additional funding a year by 2023-24 to expand and transform mental health services in England so that 2 million more people will be able to get the mental health support they need. “Under the NHS long-term plan, we are prioritising expanding community-based services for people who require them.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/29/fewer-patients-treated-in-england-for-mood-disorders-as-system-creaks-under-strain;guardian;health;497

Main Roads WA and structural engineers will assess the Fitzroy River Bridge on the Great Northern Highway, as photos and videos emerge showing that the bridge has collapsed after being hit with record floods. Detours for trucks delivering food and medical supplies to communities isolated in the floods add an extra 7,400km, resulting in a round trip of 12,000km – the equivalent of driving from Paris, France to Vladivostok, Russia.
Water is receding at Fitzroy Crossing, but Guardian Australia understands there are concerns it could take months or years to fix the bridge. Main Roads WA has suggested building a temporary bridge while the official one is rebuilt. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ex-tropical Cyclone Ellie caused intense rainfall in WA’s Kimberley region over the last couple of weeks. At one point, the amount of water flowing down Fitzroy River each day was the equivalent of Perth’s entire water use for 20 years. Towns have been cut off and communities isolated in the state’s “worst ever” floods.
The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who visited flood-stricken communities on Monday, said the road had just “dissipated”. “This is at least a one-in-100-year event,” he said. “They haven’t seen anything like this, certainly that anyone can ever recall. “We’ve seen major flooding along the Fitzroy River to Fitzroy Crossing. “I’ve seen photos of the bridge there into Fitzroy Crossing, and it’s just gone like that the road has just dissipated.”
Albanese said there would be “massive infrastructure investment required”. “It’s difficult doing infrastructure in some of these areas as well, they’re remote, they’re difficult to get into in some cases,” he said. “We know the Great Northern Highway has been cut as well and there’ll be substantial investment required there. That is the major artery heading north in the great state of WA, but also across to the NT.” Main Roads WA has warned people not to walk on to the bridge at Fitzroy Crossing, or anywhere else affected by flood waters. Des Snook, acting manager director of Main Roads WA, said the practice was reckless and highly dangerous. “Flood waters are moving at high velocity in many places and rising rapidly,” he said. “It would be very easy for someone to get into difficulty and possibly lose their life as a consequence.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/10/engineers-to-assess-flood-damaged-bridges-on-key-wa-route-amid-concerns-some-could-take-years-to-fix;guardian;environment;4436

2635;2635;Tories accused by own watchdog of failing to keep environment promises;2023-01-19T05:01:17Z;['Fiona Harvey'];['Conservation', 'Conservatives', 'Wildlife', 'Biodiversity', 'Pollution', 'Environment', 'UK news'];;The UK government is failing to keep its promises to improve England’s environment as wildlife declines at an “eye-watering” rate, according to its own watchdog. In 2018 ministers pledged a 25-year plan to protect the UK’s natural environment and leave it in a better state than when the government found it. They set out a range of priorities, including the abundance of wildlife species and habitats, air and water quality, access to the natural world, the treatment of waste, managing resource use and cutting pollution. Advances were pledged on all of these under a series of five-year environmental improvement plans. But in an assessment of their progress, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) – the watchdog set up to oversee the targets – has found: Species abundance is in “inexorable” decline, despite a pledge to halt the decline of wildlife by 2030. Of 23 environmental targets examined, the government was demonstrably on track on none of them. On 14 of the targets,it was judged to be clearly off-track. The government is failing even to collect data on many key areas. Only 38% of sites of special scientific interest are in “favourable condition”, with “negligible” progress on this over the past decade. Farming policy has failed to focus on the environment. No joined-up approach across government. Only limited progress in improving air quality, and moves to reduce emissions, partly in response to the Covid-19 lockdowns. Concerns over plans to scrap EU laws that could reduce environmental protections. Dame Glenys Stacey, the chair of the OEP, said wildlife in particular was suffering “eye-watering” declines. She said species abundance was of particular concern, as it was “pivotal” to any assessment of the UK’s environmental performance. “Species decline stands out – the rate of decline is inexorable,” she said. “This needs a lot of intervention, that is absolutely required.” Stacey said the government had not aligned its farming policies – the environmental land management schemes – with its biodiversity or clean air and water targets. “Farmers play a critical role, and we really have to build on that,” she added. Ruth Chambers, a senior fellow at Greener UK, a coalition of 10 large environmental organisations, said the government must act urgently. “The new green watchdog pulls no punches. Ministers need to make tackling the nature and climate crises a priority. That means more resources, greater focus and better coordination,” Chambers said. More funding was also needed, added Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the NGO Wildlife and Countryside Link. “To halt the decline of nature, the days of fluffy wishlists and back-of-the-settee funding for nature policy must end. The environmental improvement plan needs scientifically sound delivery plans to stop the decline in wildlife, backed by the funding to make it happen,” he said. Benwell said there was a lack of coordination across government, and warned about the impacts from scrapping EU law. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) could not make a success of restoring nature while the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities dallied on planning reform and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy pressed ahead with the “destructive deregulatory agenda of the retained EU law bill”, he said. “The prime minister should sponsor the environmental improvement plan and rally the whole of government to deliver it.” Paul de Zylva, a senior nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the public were losing out as a result of government inaction. “Enhancing our natural world isn’t just good for the environment, it also benefits our health and economy too,” he said. “Instead of focusing on the sustained actions needed to build a greener future, ministers seem obsessed with ditching existing standards despite promising tougher environmental protections.” The next five-year improvement plan will be published by the end of this month, the government said this week. It will include an environmental principle policy statement, which will require all relevant government policies to be assessed with regard to their environmental impact. A Defra spokesperson said: “Since the publication of the 25-year environment plan in 2018, we have funded new nature recovery projects spanning over 120,000 hectares [300,000 acres], increased our tree planting rates and started work on the restoration of our peatlands at a landscape scale. Our international efforts through our presidency of Cop26 and leadership at Cop15 also placed nature at the heart of tackling the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.” Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said: “That the government’s own eco watchdog has published such a damning assessment lays bare the extent of the environmental damage caused by 13 years of Tory government. The environment secretary, only three months into the role, has already moved the situation from dismal to downright dangerous, by breaching her own environmental targets and announcing a plan that inflicts more toxic air and sewage dumping, for longer. It’s clear that the Tory party has given up on governing.”;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/19/uk-watchdog-failing-to-keep-environment-promises-england-improvement-plan-wildlife-delcine;guardian;environment;2635
1667;1667;You Hurt My Feelings review – Nicole Holofcener delivers another winner;2023-01-23T22:15:48Z;['Benjamin Lee'];['Sundance 2023', 'Film', 'Julia Louis-Dreyfus', 'Comedy films', 'Drama films', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Sundance film festival', 'Festivals'];;"It tracks that writer-director Nicole Holofcener would devote an entire movie to the queasily uncomfortable limits of honesty in relationships, given how her work, from Walking and Talking to Friends with Money, has always traded on her ability to be unblinkingly frank about how we treat one another. How honest should we be to those we care about if we know our answers will hurt them? Is lying to protect feelings ultimately a sign of real love or is it the opposite, allowing someone to develop a false idea of who they are and what they can do? And what happens when they find out how you really feel?
In You Hurt My Feelings, Holofcener takes these gristly questions and uses them to poke holes in an otherwise annoyingly happy, borderline smug, marriage. Writer-professor Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and therapist Don (Tobias Menzies) are as copacetic as could be, still passionate, still sharing each other’s meals (much to the disgust of their son) and still supporting each other professionally. Beth is coming off the back of a well-reviewed yet under-read memoir detailing the emotional abuse she suffered at the hands of her father (she darkly wishes at times he had been worse so it could have sold more copies) and is trying to get her first novel published. Even after her agent finally confesses that she’s unsure of its commercial viability, Don continues to tell her how talented she is and, having read every draft, how fantastic her book will be. But one day, the unimaginable happens when Beth overhears Don tell her sister’s partner that he doesn’t rate the book at all and is fatigued by reading draft after draft. Beth is crushed (the scene is smartly played for heartbreak over humour) and has to find a way to live with this knowledge, causing an inevitable unravelling. It’s an ingenious way to light a fuse, a brief candid moment causing the kind of deep cuts that may never fully heal. Holofcener’s characters have that liberal “Well the world is falling apart so should we really be this distracted by the small stuff?” awareness but it’s trumped by the more realistic emotional gut response of “My feelings are hurt and that sucks.” Beth and Don are grappling with the toll of age, with Don considering cosmetic surgery and Beth worrying that she might have wasted time on something she’s just not good at, but they’re never too old to grow out of the desire to be liked or appreciated or taken seriously, and unvarnished truths sting no matter the age. Holofcener nimbly explores the differing limits and context of honesty throughout the film with Don’s patients finding a way to admit his failings as a therapist, Beth’s sister (a note-perfect Michaela Watkins) dealing with both her actor husband’s creative spiral and the whims of her interior decorating clients, and Beth and Don’s son reacting to what he perceives as supportive dishonesty, pretending he was good at things growing up when the opposite was true. As is almost always the case with Holofcener’s work (her 2018 Netflix adaptation The Land of Steady Habits acting as her only real fumble), this subtle thematic film is deceptively deft, sparking little trails of thought as we watch, wondering what we would do or how we would react or what we could tolerate. It’s always such a joy to spend time with Holofcener’s characters: smart, self-aware, blunt and casually bruising in ways that never feel comically heightened despite situations that could be adjacent to those used in a sitcom (a silly sequence here involving a gun is a solitary blip). Her writing can be confronting and tough but funny and, vitally, full of warmth. There’s such richness of detail in the tiny observations her characters make not just about each other and how we act but about life and life in New York (mourning uncool coffee shops, missing sticky diner menus and bemoaning the absurd cost of furniture). Reuniting after 2013’s exquisite Enough Said (a film that works well as many things but stands as truly one of the last great romantic comedies), Holofcener and Louis-Dreyfus again make for perfectly pitched partners. Louis-Dreyfus is such a specific and thoughtfully controlled comedic actor, and while there are a great deal of small amusing moments (pleading with her unreasonable mother – an excellent, flinty Jeannie Berlin – so she can take home leftover potato salad in Tupperware rather than foil is a stupidly funny argument) she’s also deeply affecting at showing the muted melancholy of someone wondering if they’ll ever be OK again. Despite the potentially explosive material, Holofcener avoids high-pitched scenes of conflict but when verbal sparring does begin, it’s all believably, uneasily spiky and returning to a similar if less broad brand of uncomfortable character-based comedy as his work with Sharon Horgan, Menzies is a more-than-adept match. For those who also have a magnetic pull to her work, Holofcener is a frustratingly un-prolific creator (she’s directed only two other movies in the last 10 years) but You Hurt My Feelings is more than enough reward for the wait. You Hurt My Feelings premieres at the Sundance film festival and will be released in cinemas later this year";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/23/you-hurt-my-feelings-review-nicole-holofcener-delivers-another-winner;guardian;entertainment & culture;1667
5197;5197;I’m horribly addicted to Twitter. Will Elon Musk save me from myself this year? | Joel Snape;2023-01-05T07:00:15Z;['Joel Snape'];['X', 'Internet', 'Media', 'Blogging', 'Digital media', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'Technology'];;Where are we all going when Twitter dies? Mastodon? Hive? Back to sitting in saggy armchairs reading chunky books? Personally, I’m hoping it’s the latter, but I’m not optimistic. Twitter, of course, has been designed by a lot of very clever people to be extremely addictive, and if everyone switches to something else, it will probably be because it’s more addictive again, prodding all our dopamine-spiking buttons in some as-yet-undiscovered sequence with which battered airport paperbacks will be even less able to compete. Which, come to think of it, means it definitely won’t be Mastodon. Obviously, I’m hopelessly addicted to Twitter, like so many journalists who pretend we are using it for our jobs. I’ve tried to tie myself to the mast like Odysseus, installing apps that block it at certain hours or force me to take a cooling off period before I refresh the page, but I always find a way around them. Even if you delete your account entirely, there’s a 30-day cooling-off period, during which I inevitably re-up, like Odysseus with a pocketknife inside his tunic. Elon Musk, then, may be my only hope. Soon after his acquisition of the platform, a few waggish types suggested he might be deliberately trying to tank it – to make the public discourse less toxic, maybe, or just for the lols. Recently, that opinion has become less fashionable, but I’m clinging to it like Odysseus to a fig tree – hoping that there is some galaxy-brain plan in motion in which Musk is prepared to sacrifice his fortune and reputation to let us get back to doing something useful. Author Clay Shirky talks about “cognitive surplus”, the free mental energy we have to collaborate on projects that can be useful to humanity – and now Twitter is just a great big machine for turning all that energy into hot takes and Thanos memes. If Musk kills it, maybe his next step will be to unite us all in using that leftover thinking-space for the collective good, such as designing Mars rockets just to spite him, or something. Which would make him … Poseidon? I don’t know – I haven’t actually read the Odyssey. Joel Snape is a writer and fitness expert Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

875;875;‘Without dignity’: how Veronica Nelson’s death exposed cruelty of Victoria’s bail laws;2023-01-27T14:00:52Z;['Benita Kolovos', 'Adeshola Ore'];['Indigenous Australians', 'Prisons', 'Victorian politics', 'Victoria', 'Australia news'];;"On the night she died, Veronica Nelson called for help nine times over the prison intercom system between the hours of 2am and 4am. The proud Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta woman can be heard crying in recordings. “I need help ... badly miss, badly,” she says. In another, she calls out to her late father. Nelson’s naked body was found cold and stiff on the floor the following morning, her hands clenched like claws. At the time of her death on 2 January 2020, Nelson, 37, had spent three days in Melbourne’s Dame Phyllis Frost Centre – Victoria’s maximum-security women’s prison – after being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting. She was in jail after appearing in court without a lawyer and being refused bail. It was unlikely she would have been sentenced to prison if she had been convicted of the offences for which she was arrested.
During the two nights she spent in the cells Nelson asked staff for help on more than 40 occasions for worsening vomiting and cramps, the inquest heard. She begged to see a doctor. She asked for cordial and socks, because her feet were cramping. A prison officer lied to her several times about calling for a nurse on her behalf. Veronica was told to “be quiet” and that the intercom was for “emergencies only”. “You need to try and stop because you’re keeping the other prisoners awake. I can’t give you anything else,” an officer says. On Monday, coroner Simon McGregor will hand down his findings into Nelson’s death, a case so shocking it has managed to cut through previous political ambivalence to force a conversation about reform of Victoria’s strict bail laws. Despite countless previous pleas to change laws tightened in the wake of the Bourke Street massacre in 2017, it was only this week that Victoria’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, pledged to make amendments this year, without providing further details. Symes conceded the 2017 changes, designed to keep repeat violent offenders out of the community, disproportionately affected First Nations people and women, who are being remanded in custody for minor offences that would not ordinarily carry a sentence of imprisonment. “What we do know is that once people are in the justice system, it can be very difficult to get out of that spiral,” she said. Nerita Waight, chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, says Veronica’s death is the reason the state government is now considering bail reform. “The cruelty and indifference that everyone in the criminal legal system showed to Veronica in her last days has exposed the destruction that bail laws are inflicting on individuals, their families, and their communities,” she tells Guardian Australia. “Many people warned the government that the punitive bail laws they created in 2017 would do this and we’ve been telling them about the damage the broken bail laws have been doing over the last five years. Until the inquest into Veronica’s death in custody they have refused to even acknowledge the pain that their laws have caused.” Amanda Porter, senior Indigenous fellow at the University of Melbourne’s law school, blames a lack of political will combined with a powerful police lobby for the slow reform on bail laws. Despite a range of bodies calling for change, including a parliamentary inquiry, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and Liberty Victoria, the police union has opposed the watering down of the laws.
The 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody also recommended governments revise any criteria which “inappropriately restrict” the granting of bail to Aboriginal people. “Governments don’t listen to Aboriginal experts and Aboriginal leaders on this. They don’t listen to their own reports,” Porter says. “Why it’s taken this tragedy for the Andrews government to move speaks to the power of the police union in Victoria and in Australia. This outweighs the overwhelming academic and policy evidence and their own royal commissions and official inquiries.” ‘Without dignity’ It’s not only bail laws that are being re-examined in the wake of Nelson’s death. Last week, the Andrews government announced it would stop outsourcing healthcare in female prisons to for-profit companies. The coroner heard Veronica was withdrawing from heroin but also suffering from a rare, undiagnosed gastrointestinal condition called Wilkie’s Syndrome when she died. She was malnourished and an autopsy later found she weighed 33kg and had a grossly dilated and distended stomach. Nelson’s partner of 20 years, Percy Lovett, told the court she looked unwell during her bail hearing on 31 December and on the way to Dame Phillip Frost Centre she had vomited. She arrived carrying a sick bag. Upon arrival, Nelson was held in the medical ward overnight, where she continued to vomit and complain of cramping. The following morning a doctor noted in Veronica’s health file that a nursing review should be performed later that afternoon. This review did not happen. They also made a request for blood tests to examine Veronica’s electrolytes, a liver test and a full blood count. Due to the public holiday the tests could not be conducted that day. She was then transferred to the Yarra unit, where she died. A medical panel who gave evidence to the inquest agreed that Veronica’s life could probably have been saved if she had been sent to hospital on 1 January. Gastroenterologist Sally Bell said the way she died was “without dignity” and “unnecessary”. The inquest heard from prisoners and corrections staff concerned about the standard of care offered by private company Correct Care Australasia (CCA).
McGregor has the option of referring CCA to the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether the firm should be prosecuted for breaching the state’s health and safety act. The Dame Phyllis Frost Centre general manager, Tracy Jones, told the court she didn’t believe its medical centre was “well equipped to look after some of more complex medical needs that our women are suffering when they come into our care.” “I think that most of the CCA staff are there because they want to look after the women and do right by the women,” she said. “They’re under-resourced and they’re busy and they don’t have a retention of good staff and the working conditions aren’t terrific … they probably get burnt out or become impatient or become frustrated.” CCA’s chief medical officer, Foti Blaher, defended the company’s overall health services at the inquest, saying they met the benchmarks agreed to in its state government contract. However, he conceded the prison wasn’t well equipped to offer substantial medical care. The medical unit of the prison “may have the word ‘ward’ written on the front of them”, he said, but they could not be considered as similar to a hospital treatment bed. ‘A daughter, sister, partner, cousin and friend’ Lovett told the court his partner was a very strong and private person, and that race unquestionably played a role in her death. “She wouldn’t have been crying out like that, especially to the officers, unless something was really wrong,” he said. “They just thought she was a heroin addict and another blackfella, just wanting a quick fix. There’s another black girl crying out for drugs, she wants a quick fix. I don’t think she would’ve been treated that way if she wasn’t a blackfella.” In the words of Sharon Lacy, the counsel assisting the coroner, during the opening of the inquest, Veronica was: “a daughter, sister, partner, cousin and friend.” “She was loved,” she said. “Veronica deserved to be treated with dignity in life and in passing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/without-dignity-how-veronica-nelsons-death-exposed-cruelty-of-victorias-bail-laws;guardian;politics;875
2821;2821;Now She Is Witch by Kirsty Logan review – a quest for freedom;2023-01-18T09:00:01Z;['N/A'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];;"Near the beginning of Kirsty Logan’s fine new novel, a travelling theatre company stages a nocturnal performance on a frozen lake. It’s winter and this play, which tracks a woman’s trajectory from maiden to mother to crone, is a small smudge of light in a grim surround of dark. It’s the perfect image – life atop icy precarity; festive warmth upon unforgiving cold – to set the stage for a tale whose protagonist will be confronted by many perilous contrasts. Her name is Lux, and when we first meet her she is standing in a garden of poisonous herbs above the remains of her recently buried mother, who has been unjustly executed for witchcraft. In the harsh world of Now She Is Witch, which would seem to be some version of medieval Europe, most girls and women are possessions for men either to harm or play with. Any who assume agency are swiftly denounced and brutally dealt with: those labelled witches are tied to poles in the sea and left to slowly drown; others guilty of lesser offences (talking too much, too loudly or indeed at all) are paraded around in scold’s bridles, torture devices deployed to humiliate.
Lux, recently ejected from a religious sanctuary meant to put her right with God, chafes at the fate that would seem to await her as just “a girl, and small, and nothing more” in this cauldron of misogynistic madness. The arrival of a mysterious stranger named Else, just as a group of locals look set to attack Lux in her garden, starts the novel off with a bang.
Else wants Lux’s help in getting some good old-fashioned revenge and Lux, who has her mind fixed on travelling north to a land where freedom reigns and witches thrive, teams up with her. Neither of their goals will be easy to achieve. For Lux and Else trail the weighty plumes of traumatic pasts, which Logan skilfully offers us in passages of backstory that sing, screech and skip through the novel in the way records are marked by jagged scratches. It’s little wonder that for a time Lux, who as the novel progresses becomes in turn an actor on a frozen stage, a servant in a hall of delicacies, a food-taster to a lord and companion to a fine lady, is tempted to turn her back on Else’s revenge and set her own dreams of finding freedom in the wild country aside. But things in Logan’s vision are almost always excruciatingly unlike how they seem, and Lux’s dreamy idyll is cut short when beauty reveals its awful underbelly. Logan builds Lux’s world with an eye for striking detail. The leader of the theatre company, which haunts Lux throughout the story, “was as thin as a skeleton: if he lay on his side during rain, a tiny puddle would form in the hollow of his cheek”. A very different sort of man is “the size of a bull, and his smell was so strong it felt like fingers forced into her nostrils”. Whether Logan is describing a dismembered bear whose lopped-off parts are handed out as favours at a banquet, or a gory flagellant’s parade, the images we are offered snap and sizzle with portent and possibility. At one crucial moment, in an observation that might serve as an apt comment on the novel as a whole, the lady Lux has been serving says of stories: “Each person is stuffed full to bursting with them, fat as pigs ready for a feast. The littlest prick and all those stories will simply explode out, shrieking like fat in a fire, and anyone nearby can hear it all.” In the many stories that fall shrieking from the pages of this brutal, bracing novel, we encounter maidens forced to become mothers and mothers, if they live long enough, punished as witches or scorned as crones. Lux’s fate, though, lies elsewhere, up north where “blue glaciers cast up glassy and gleaming on a shore of black sand”. There Lux takes stock and begins to grasp the power she has accrued over the course of her journey. It’s a moment of grace and vindication, one that Logan lets the long-suffering Lux experience utterly, triumphantly alone. • Laird Hunt’s novels include In the House in the Dark of the Woods (One). • Now She Is Witch by Kirsty Logan is published by Harvill Secker (£16.99).

7660;7660;Ireland launches €2.5bn scheme to repair fire safety defects in homes;Wednesday 18 January 2023 18:39, UK;['stephen murphy', '@smurphytv'];['ireland'];['launches', '25bn', 'repair', 'lot', 'apartments', 'debbie', 'homes', 'scheme', 'remediation', 'thousands', 'defects', 'ireland', 'safety', 'irish', 'told'];"The Irish government has approved a repair scheme costing up to €2.5bn (£2.2bn) to fix fire safety and other defects in 100,000 apartments and duplexes built during Ireland's Celtic Tiger boom era.

Lax construction oversight during the economic boom of the mid-1990s to late-2000s led to homeowners being handed huge repair bills in recent years, as inspections revealed inadequate fire-stopping and other defects in their homes.

The Irish cabinet finally approved the scheme at a meeting this morning, and the Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien told reporters: ""Today, I believe, is a really important step forward for the homeowners who for 10/15 years have been living with despair, distress and no hope of bringing their homes back to safe and secure environments for them and their families to live in.""

He added that remediation work already underway, or completed, will be included for redress.

The long-awaited scheme will come as a relief to Celtic Tiger-era home buyers, thousands of whom had faced repair bills that were simply unpayable, and an inability to sell their homes.

Retiree Debbie Horan remembers the moment she was hit with an €18,000 (£15,700) repair bill for fire defects that came to light after a blaze in a neighbouring property.

""We were all absolutely horrified"", she says, ""just horrified."" In 2001, Debbie had purchased a two-bed property at the Linden apartment development in Blackrock, Co Dublin, which was built in the late 1990s.

After an inspection, the owners were told they had to pay €15,000 (£13,100) each for remediation, which increased to €18,000.

""It was for something that was not our fault"", says Debbie. ""Something we didn't know about when we bought the apartments.

""And it put a lot of people under a lot of financial strain. We objected to it, we went to meetings, but we found we had no option but to pay it, because apartments could not be bought or sold until the fire-stopping issue was remediated.

""There was a lot of anger.""

She says the news comes as an ""absolute relief"", but ""we hope they stick to their promises, and fully compensate people like me, who have already paid the monies. Retrospection is vitally important.""

Pressure group Constructions Defects Alliance (CDA) said it ""strongly welcomed"" today's decision and described it as ""an important one for the tens of thousands of people living in apartments affected by fire safety defects.""

However, spokesperson Pat Montague warned that ""given the enormous scale of the defects issue, it will take a number of years for all of the defective apartments to be remediated.""

Legislation to give effect to the remediation plan now needs to be introduced in the Dail (the lower house of the Irish parliament), and the government admits the scheme won't be up and running until later this year at the earliest.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118184808/http://news.sky.com/story/ireland-launches-eur2-5bn-scheme-to-repair-fire-safety-defects-in-homes-12789487;skynews;entertainment & culture;1751
263;263;Keir Starmer and Labour left to face off over manifesto plans;2023-01-30T19:33:10Z;['Aletha Adu'];['Labour', 'Keir Starmer', 'Green politics', 'Green economy', 'Protest', 'World news', 'Politics', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Momentum', 'Jeremy Corbyn'];;"Keir Starmer is likely to battle the Labour left over protest laws, green issues and a wealth tax as the party kickstarts its manifesto development. Momentum, the grassroots campaign group, hopes to make a “loud” case for left-leaning policies in the lead-up to the next general election, and will collaborate with the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG). The first intervention is understood to be imminent, with rent controls, the abolition of tuition fees and a wealth tax said to be high on the group’s agenda. However, Momentum no longer has control of any of the policy commissions or a majority of delegates on the national policy forum (NPF), Labour’s decision-making body, so is unlikely to be able to push through its proposals. A Momentum source told the Guardian: “Keir knows that leftwing policies are what’s needed. That’s why policies like rail nationalisation and a windfall tax have resonated, while no one remembers the British recovery bond yawn-athon. The lesson from the 2017 election campaign is that people want bold, clear policies: like abolishing tuition fees or nationalising our failed energy system.” On Monday, the NPF published a draft consultation paper covering six important policy areas including the environment, the future of work, crime, public services and international development. Members and campaigners have until 17 March to submit submissions or contribute to online events, airing their views before the NPF redrafts those policy papers on the basis of those submissions. Momentum and the SCG hope to ensure proposals that were popular under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership – including nationalisation, wealth taxes and the abolition of tuition fees – will make it on to the manifesto. Insiders are also understood to be hopeful that groups including Labour for a Green New Deal, which has announced a new campaign for public ownership of energy, will also launch their own interventions.
In one of the few policy announcements already made, Starmer has promised a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power – called Great British Energy – in the first year of a Labour government. The new leftwing coalition will bring a fresh headache to Starmer, who had promised Labour members over the weekend that the party had changed since the disastrous 2019 election defeat under Corbyn, telling a London conference: “Never again will Labour be a party of protest not public service. Never again will Labour fail to grasp that economic stability is the foundation of all our ambitions. “Never again will Labour allow hate to spread unchallenged. We have changed our party and we’re ready to change Britain.” Starmer faced pressure at the last Labour party conference as delegates passed union-backed motions urging public ownership of Royal Mail and inflation-proof pay rises. Labour subsequently vowed to renationalise the railways. The party leader has since confirmed his plans to shift Labour back towards the centre to lure undecided swing voters. The NPF will meet from 21-23 July to decide what will be put to Labour conference to form the final party programme, from which the manifesto will be drawn. It marks the first time since the 2015 general election that the NPF has been able to convene and officially start its manifesto work. Last summer, the party drew up plans to govern in case of a snap election while Boris Johnson was struggling to thwart a mutiny, party insiders told the Guardian. A leftwing source told the Guardian: “A Labour government will be remembered by the change it makes. Being real, everyone thinks Keir will be the next PM – the question is whether he will end up hated like Blair, or feted like [Clement] Attlee. The path will be set by the manifesto.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/30/keir-starmer-labour-left-face-off-manifesto-plans;guardian;politics;263

317;317;Utah bans gender-affirming surgery for young trans people;2023-01-30T14:26:23Z;['N/A'];['Utah', 'US politics', 'US news', 'The far right', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'World news'];;Utah’s Republican governor on Saturday signed a bill that bans young people who are transgender from receiving gender-affirming healthcare as other states consider similar legislation. The governor, Spencer Cox, who had not taken a public position on the transgender care measure, signed it a day after the state legislature sent it to his desk. Utah’s measure prohibits transgender surgery for young people and disallows hormone treatments for minors who have not yet been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Republicans controlling Utah’s legislature made the ban a priority and weighed a first draft of the measure less than two days after the state’s lawmakers opened this year’s legislative session on 17 January. Cox’s signing of the bill comes as lawmakers in at least 18 states consider similar legislation taking aim at young transgender people’s healthcare. In a statement, Cox said that he based his decision to sign the bill on a belief that the safest thing to do was halt “these permanent and life-altering treatments for new patients until more and better research can help determine the long-term consequences”. He added: “While we understand our words will be of little comfort to those who disagree with us, we sincerely hope that we can treat our transgender families with more love and respect as we work to better understand the science and consequences behind these procedures.” Utah’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union stood among the organizations who had urged Cox to veto the bill, admonishing him in a letter about “the damaging and potentially catastrophic effects this law will have on people’s lives and medical care and the grave violations of people’s constitutional rights it will cause”. The ACLU’s letter continued: “By cutting off medical treatment supported by every major medical association in the United States, the bill compromises the health and wellbeing of adolescents with gender dysphoria. “It ties the hands of doctors and parents by restricting access to the only evidence-based treatment available for this serious medical condition and impedes their ability to fulfill their professional obligations.” Sponsoring the bill Cox signed was a Republican state senator named Mike Kennedy, who works as a family doctor and has argued that it is right for the government to oversee healthcare policies pertaining to gender and young people.

2370;2370;Biden, Trump – and two very different classified document scandals;2023-01-20T07:00:31Z;['Chris Michael', 'Andrew Witherspoon', 'Richard Luscombe'];['Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'Merrick Garland', 'US politics', 'US news'];;"The discovery of classified documents in offices used by Joe Biden’s thinktank and in a locked storage unit in a garage near where the president keeps his Corvette may not be a criminal matter, but it does appear to have taken a political toll.
With a new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Thursday finding that Biden’s approval rating, which had risen at the end of 2022, was back down to just 40% – near the lowest level of his presidency – many Democrats are smacking their foreheads, fearing Biden has done exactly what his expected 2024 opponent, Donald Trump, was under investigation for doing. So much for painting Trump as dangerous, volatile and a threat to national security. Right? But that’s not to say the two cases are the same. The scale of the scandals is hugely lopsided: thousands of documents in Trump’s possession, including many marked top secret, versus an estimated dozen in Biden’s. Crucially for justice department investigators, led by the special counsels appointed by the attorney general, Merrick Garland, the actions of the two presidents are also vastly different. Trump declared his intent to take documents, refused to hand them back, had to be raided by the FBI to secure the records, then fought authorities in court for months. Biden’s team handed the documents back voluntarily. Here is a breakdown of how the two cases are similar – and how, in major ways, they are different.
Biden, 80, is expected to launch another run for the White House, perhaps as soon as next month, after he delivers the State of the Union address on 7 February. Republicans in Congress have slammed the president regarding when the documents were discovered – before the midterms – claiming Biden was not forthcoming about such potentially politically sensitive discoveries. But the Reuters/Ipsos poll results suggest it isn’t just Biden whose ratings are down as a result of various scandals in Washington. Only 20% of respondents said they approved of the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, the top elected Republican, while just 35% said they had a favorable view of the House as a whole and 38% approved of the Senate. In that light, Biden’s head appears to be just above water. He must be hoping no more classified documents emerge to push him back below.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/classified-documents-biden-trump-explained;guardian;politics;2370
7615;7615;UK weather: Somerset flood risk 'concern' triggers Environment Agency 'major incident';Wednesday 18 January 2023 14:25, UK;[];['somerset', 'weather'];['incident', 'triggers', 'risk', 'water', 'environment', 'snow', 'levels', 'weather', 'major', 'northern', 'scotland', 'concern', 'somerset', 'ireland', 'reduce', 'flood', 'uk'];"A ""major incident"" has been declared in Somerset due to a risk of flooding across the county.

The Environment Agency says it is not expecting homes in the area to flood imminently.

However, it has made the decision to ""plan for the worst"" amid growing ""concern"" following this week's winter weather.

Declaring a ""major incident"" as a precaution also allows authorities to work together to reduce the risks, according to the agency.

Extra pumps have been brought in to reduce water levels on the Somerset Levels, which are expected to improve the situation.

Pumping began on Tuesday evening near the River Barle at Northmoor to reduce the amount of water stored there.

This is until river levels allow pumping to resume at Currymoor, around an hour away, which remains full.

Flooding risks are also being monitored in Dorset and the Avon area around Bristol.

The Environment Agency's Ian Withers said: ""The sight of water on the Somerset Levels and Moors is obviously a concern to those who have suffered from flooding before. Our staff continue to work to the best of their abilities to protect people and properties, install pumps and engage with communities.""

Somerset is prone to flooding as much of the area is below sea level, especially between the Mendips and the Quantocks.

The county has already been affected by winter weather this week. Emergency services declared another ""major incident"" when a double-decker bus overturned on Tuesday morning on the icy A39 Quantock Road near Bridgwater, with dozens of Hinkley Point C workers injured in the crash.

188;188;Justice for Animals by Martha C Nussbaum review – how we became the tyrants of the animal kingdom;2023-01-31T07:00:41Z;['Rohan Silva'];['Science and nature books', 'Books', 'Culture'];;"The physicist Stephen Hawking once hosted a party for time travellers, but only sent out the invitations after the date had already passed. No one came. If people from the future had turned up, what would most appal them about our society today, apart from Love Island and Suella Braverman? For the prominent American philosopher Martha C Nussbaum, the answer is our treatment of animals, which her sober and sobering new book argues is a moral crime on a monumental scale. To make her scholarly case, Nussbaum points to the “barbarous cruelties of the factory meat industry”, “habitat destruction” and “pollution of the air and seas” – but casts the ethical net even more widely to ensnare all of us who “dwell in areas in which elephants and bears once roamed” or “live in high-rise buildings that spell death for migratory birds”. We’re all complicit, she argues, no matter how right-on we think we are – and we have “a long overdue ethical debt” to work off. Over the years, there’s been no shortage of Cassandran prophets alerting us to the cosmic tragedy of species loss and biodiversity destruction. Elizabeth Kolbert, in The Sixth Extinction, attempted to bludgeon us into seeing sense with flinty facts and hard logic. Harvard biologist EO Wilson tried by showing us the wondrous complexity and interconnectedness of life on Earth.
Nussbaum is going a different way, taking aim at the entire system of moral thought that, consciously or not, has led us to treat living things as objects and trash the Eden of our natural world. For her, the original philosophical sin is the idea that animals are “dumb beasts… automata without a subjective view of the world”. As Justice for Animals rigorously argues, the latest scientific research reveals that the opposite is true: “all vertebrates feel pain subjectively”, many animals “experience emotions like compassion and grief” and display “complicated social learning”. For Nussbaum, the implications are “huge, clearly”. Once we recognise there’s no easy demarcation between human sentience and that of animals, “we can hardly be unchanged in our ethical thinking”. Make no mistake, this is a serious work of philosophy – and probably not most people’s idea of an ideal beach read, with its earnest interrogation of Kantian ethics and utilitarianism. That being said, the book does tell the sad stories of specific animals, such as Hal the humpback whale whose complex song constantly changed “apparently out of sheer fashion and interest in novelty”, but who starved to death with 88lbs of plastic trash in his guts. Some readers may view these tales as tacky emotional vibrato in what is otherwise a scholarly read. Nussbaum defends herself, making the point “extinction never takes place without the suffering of individual creatures”, whether that’s “the hunger of a polar bear, starving on an ice floe” or “the mass extinctions of songbird species as a result of unbreathable air, a horrible death”. Having forensically dismantled other philosophical arguments for protecting animals, such as the “So Like Us” school of thought that only bestows special treatment on species such as apes and dolphins that are closest to us in intelligence and behaviour, Nussbaum sketches out what a more all-encompassing morality may look like. Her vision is a global legislative framework that acknowledges and protects animal rights, but she understands full well this won’t happen overnight. “The world’s legal systems are in a primitive condition,” she writes, highlighting, among many examples, the way that the US Animal Welfare Act completely excludes cold-blooded creatures. She draws a parallel with how women were once treated under the law – as objects or property controlled and used by men. Fast-forward to today and women have rights and freedoms that would have been unthinkable two centuries ago. “The same thing can happen,” writes Nussbaum with a righteous optimism, “with the rights of animals.” It was John Maynard Keynes who, in his quaintly gendered way, observed that “practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist”. In other words, ideas matter. If we’re to have any hope of resetting our abusive relationship with the natural world, a foundational shift in our moral philosophy may be essential. Or as Nussbaum puts it: “The remedy really requires the evolving consciousness of humanity.” A daunting prospect, but Justice for Animals is a timely and weighty reminder that a positive future is possible and worth fighting for. • Justice for Animals: Our Collective Responsibility by Martha C Nussbaum is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

3160;3160;Stakes are high for Arsenal as Arteta decides whether to stick or twist;2023-01-16T14:23:27Z;['Nick Ames'];['Arsenal', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"A month rarely laden with certainties has one sure thing for Arsenal. When January ends they will be top of the Premier League, with a game in hand over their rivals and the likelihood of a significant points cushion. They are currently the best team in the division by some distance and, when everything is working this smoothly, momentum can feel entirely self-sustaining. The manner of their win at Spurs, which included a first-half showing as capable as anyone will produce all year, reinforced the view that Mikel Arteta is under little pressure to make changes for the campaign’s second half. Arsenal’s consistency of performance is remarkable; results are following and their squad depth is such that the medium-term absence of their star centre-forward, Gabriel Jesus, is barely felt.
The latter point is a far cry from May, when Arsenal lost their grip on a Champions League spot after capitulating at Spurs and Newcastle. Injuries had bitten, three inexperienced academy products making up their numbers on the bench at St James’ Park, and they could not cope. Arteta’s resources, particularly in defence and up front, look better set now but eyes will still turn to the remaining fortnight of the transfer window. What is required to turn an increasingly likely thing into a sure thing? The easiest answer is a clean bill of health. Should Bukayo Saka, Thomas Partey, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and perhaps the increasingly influential Oleksandr Zinchenko stay fit for the next four months it is hard to imagine Arsenal not purring home. But none of that is nailed on and, with as many as seven Europa League ties in prospect from early March, Arteta knows it would be best to enlist some help. Quality competition in wide areas would alleviate certain concerns and the same goes for central midfield. Emile Smith Rowe’s return from injury, and the hope his long-term complaints were solved during four months out, certainly helps the former but Arsenal remain in the market for reinforcements. They have been frustrated in this transfer window but the pill becomes easier to swallow when you are so far ahead of the competition.
Alternatives will be sought for Mykhaylo Mudryk, who Arsenal had been confident of landing from a stubborn Shakhtar Donetsk until Chelsea blew them away with terms the player and selling club could not resist. Arsenal had already shown this month that they were willing to walk away from a deal: they were in for João Félix at a late stage but bowed out when it became clear he would cost a loan fee of more than £9m from Atlético Madrid. Chelsea showed no such inhibition, although it may do them limited immediate good now that the forward is lumbered with a three-game suspension. Arsenal’s restraint, as much as anything can be described that way in the modern transfer market, speaks of the lessons learned institutionally since Arteta’s arrival. They do not intend to be burned again as they were in paying £72m for Nicolas Pépé. Planning and patience, particularly in sticking with Arteta when others might have knee-jerked, have borne spectacular fruit.
They had spent months working on a deal for Mudryk, which was always going to be pricey given the fee Manchester United paid for a player of similar age and position in Antony, and had priced in Shakhtar’s intransigence, so it was galling for them to see Chelsea steal in. Ultimately, Chelsea received enough assurances that Mudryk would put aside his publicly stated preference to join Arsenal and move to west London if they were the only show in town. It was another example of the clanging nuisance Todd Boehly and company have made of themselves in the market: they have shaken things up to their liking, in the short term at least, but Arsenal are among those who would rather avoid being dragged into the maelstrom. After all it is currently their modus operandi, not that of Chelsea’s new regime, bringing results. That is why it is unlikely they will react to missing out on Mudryk by splurging indiscriminately on the next available equivalent. Nonetheless Arteta is now left with something of a dilemma. Mudryk was an attractive option because of his age and exciting potential, but how hard should he pursue other possibilities that do not leap out as readily? Perhaps Raphinha, a former target who may be obtainable from Barcelona, would fit the bill. Arsenal would kick themselves if the ultimate prize escaped them because the drop down from Saka or Martinelli was too severe; they could also regret doing the wrong deals at a time when there is little standing between them and a near-perfect season’s work. At least Arsenal can ask themselves such questions. In the recent past “winning the transfer window” has become an obsession among some sections of fans but it takes second billing this time. They are winning the contest that matters. Beating Manchester United, who will become an unexpected title rival should they take three points at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, would strengthen an already imposing position significantly. Perhaps Arsenal, for all the nagging concerns about what may or may not lie in reserve, will be able to stay the distance as they are.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/16/stakes-are-high-for-arsenal-as-arteta-decides-whether-to-stick-or-twist;guardian;sports;3160
1877;1877;UK will be 15 years late in hitting £1tn annual export target, figures show;2023-01-22T20:13:48Z;['Kiran Stacey'];['International trade', 'Trade policy', 'Economics', 'European Union', 'Brexit', 'Business', 'Global economy', 'Politics', 'Boris Johnson', 'David Cameron', 'UK news', 'Joe Biden', 'India'];;"Ministers have been accused of leaving a “record of failure and broken promises” as internal forecasts show Britain will be 15 years late in achieving its £1tn annual export target after being hit by Brexit. Projections from the Department for International Trade (DIT) show the value of UK exports will not reach £1tn until 2035, based on current trends, with the total due to fall to £707bn next year. The deferral underlines how difficult British ministers have found it to meet the lofty predictions Brexiters made about international trade after leaving the EU. The pledge was first made by David Cameron in 2012, with the initial goal to hit the £1tn mark in 2020. But Boris Johnson later gave an end date of 2030 upon reviving the promise in 2021 as the centrepiece of a campaign called “Made in the UK, sold to the world”. However, new figures show Britain will not achieve £1tn until 2035. They emerged in a parliamentary answer by Andrew Bowie, the minister in charge of UK exports. The estimates are based on forecasts from the independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which show exports falling from £739bn last year to £707bn next year, before rising again to £725bn by 2027. Bowie said in his statement: “Extrapolations of the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast suggest £1tn exports could be achieved by around 2035 without additional intervention.” He also blamed external factors for the UK’s lagging performance. “We recognise the speed by which the UK reaches this milestone will be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as global demand and exchange rates,” he said. “This has proven to be the case over the past year where we have experienced external shocks and a spike in inflation,” he added.
Tina McKenzie, the policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: “Trade barriers, including red tape, sluggish economic performance domestically and globally and insufficient export support have led to the continued suppression of exports. Our research shows one in eight small exporters have temporarily or permanently stopped sales to the EU, with a further one in 10 considering doing so.” The FSB suggested changes to trade policy, such as a new fund to support small exporters and changes to UK-EU trading terms, could help ministers boost the numbers sufficiently to still hit the 2030 target. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour’s shadow international trade secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ record on exports is one of failure and broken promises. In 2012, they pledged to reach £1tn of exports by 2020. Six chancellors and four prime ministers later, the OBR predicts the target will be hit 15 years late.” He added: “This failure will mean the UK missing out on growth and job opportunities, risking us falling further down the world economic rankings.” Vote Leave said during the Brexit campaign: “If we vote leave and take back control, we will gain the power to strike our own trade deals, creating new business opportunities and creating more jobs.” But British exports slumped after the country left the EU, with companies suddenly hit by extra border checks and disruption at customs points. In January 2021, British trade recorded its biggest monthly drop for 20 years. In recent years, the government has found it hard to conclude negotiations with large and complex economies such as India and the US. Such bilateral agreements were something the UK was unable to do as a member of the EU, when it had to participate in Europe-wide deals. So far, ministers have signed deals with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore. They hope to make progress on the India and US trade deals tin 2023, with the US president, Joe Biden, planning a visit to the UK later this year to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. But that visit – and the entire trade deal – may depend on whether the British government can first reach an agreement with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. The OBR has previously said the impact of Britain leaving the EU will be to weaken the position of the country’s exporters. Ministers are maintaining their target, however, hopeful that new policies and trade deals can boost international trade sufficiently to hit it. Cameron originally promised to meet the £1tn target by 2020, but in 2019 the UK exported just £689bn. Boris Johnson relaunched the £1tn target in 2021 as the government looked for ways to reverse the decline and showcase Brexit benefits. At that time they unveiled “Made in the UK, sold to the world”, which involved providing businesses with loans for exports and access to trade experts. A UK official told the Financial Times in 2021: “This is the first time we have had an export strategy since leaving the EU.” The UK’s decision to choose a hard Brexit with the departure from the single market resulted in the loss of four freedoms to trade – in labour, capital, goods and services. Last year, a senior EU official said the UK’s trade with the EU declined by nearly 14% in 2021 compared with 2020. Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice-president and Brexit negotiator, said: “Brexit has increased red tape, not decreased it. It is no longer as frictionless and dynamic as before. This holds true for both goods and services,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said: “We’re promoting the UK’s world-class exporters to help them take advantage of global opportunities and sell more of their goods and services across the globe. “Our landmark 12-point export strategy will challenge government and the private sector to reach £1tn worth of exports a year sooner than predicted.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/22/uk-will-be-15-years-late-in-hitting-1tn-annual-export-target-figures-show;guardian;business & economy;1877
2144;2144;Nadhim Zahawi’s position as Tory chair ‘untenable’, says Labour;2023-01-21T10:44:44Z;['Tom Ambrose'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Labour', 'Angela Rayner', 'Dominic Raab', 'Tax'];;Nadhim Zahawi’s position as Conservative party chair is “untenable” after reports he paid a penalty as part of a seven-figure tax settlement, Labour has said. The former chancellor, who attends cabinet meetings, has faced pressure in parliament and the media after it emerged he agreed to pay millions to HMRC in December after a settlement with the tax agency. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, called for an explanation on Saturday after the Guardian reported that Zahawi paid a 30% penalty, taking the estimated total tax bill to more than £4.8m. She told BBC Breakfast: “The fact that Nadhim hasn’t been out on the airwaves explaining himself, to me, adds insult to injury, especially given that he called this smears at the time and sent legal letters to those that asked questions legitimately about it. “And when you’re the chancellor, who is in charge of the tax affairs of the UK, and you’ve got a wealth of that nature, you would be expected to know about your tax affairs or to seek that advice at the time, as opposed to not paying those taxes and having to pay a penalty notice. “I believe his position is untenable. If he’s lied and misled the public and HMRC regarding his tax affairs then I think his position is untenable.” Earlier this week, Labour called for an inquiry into whether Zahawi broke the ministerial code or misled the public over his tax affairs. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also called for Zahawi to go. Speaking at a Fabian Society conference on Saturday, she said: “A few months ago … he was chancellor of the exchequer and responsible for Britain’s tax affairs and tax collection, and we now find that he wasn’t so keen to pay himself. “So if the prime minister wants to stick by his commitment for integrity, honesty and professionalism, he should do the right thing and sack Nadhim Zahawi.” The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said: “Zahawi and his Conservative cabinet colleagues are arrogantly trying to brush this under the carpet. “There are facts that still need to be established so there must be an independent investigation to get to the bottom of this.” The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Zahawi had been “transparent about the fact all the tax has been paid”. “I don’t know the full details of Nadhim’s tax affairs because they are personal,” he said. “What I do know is that he’s made very clear that he’s paid all of his tax, that he’s got no outstanding tax liabilities or nothing further due, and he’s obviously engaged with HMRC to achieve that.” Asked if Zahawi should give a statement to the Commons, Raab added: “That’s a matter for him but what I’d emphasise is he has been transparent about the fact that all the tax has been paid and he doesn’t have any tax outstanding.” Penalties are applied if someone does not pay the correct tax at the right time. A source familiar with the payment said a penalty was triggered as a result of a non-payment of capital gains tax due after the sale of shares in YouGov, the polling company Zahawi co-founded. He could have been subject to larger penalties had he not reached a settlement towards the end of last year, they claimed. The YouGov shares were held through Balshore Investments, a Gibraltar-registered family trust, from which Zahawi has previously denied benefiting. YouGov has described Balshore Investments as “a family trust of Nadhim Zahawi”. The former chancellor has said “he does not have, and never has had, an interest in Balshore Investments and he is not a beneficiary”. Zahawi founded YouGov in 2000 and Balshore had sold its stake in the business by 2018. Last summer news reports emerged about Zahawi’s financial affairs, including that the HMRC was looking at his taxes. At the time, Zahawi described such reports as “smears”. It is understood that after those reports a representative for Zahawi approached HMRC to discuss his tax position.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/21/nadhim-zahawi-position-tory-chair-untenable-labour;guardian;politics;2144
4968;4968;England and Wales census counts trans and non-binary people for first time;2023-01-06T10:59:24Z;['Michael Goodier', 'Robert Booth'];['Census', 'UK news', 'Transgender', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Wales', 'Society', 'World news'];;"Transgender and non-binary people have been counted for the first time in the 220-year history of the census for England and Wales, which has revealed that 262,000 people identify as a gender different to their sex registered at birth. The number of people who said they were not the same gender as their birth sex amounted to 0.5% of the population that responded, lower than polling by Ipsos last summer in which 3.1% of people said they were trans, non-binary, gender queer or gender fluid, a gender or another gender that was not male or female. The tally is, however, similar to Canada, which in 2021 became the first country to apply a census to its transgender and non-binary population aged 15 and over, which found they made up 0.33% of the population. The England and Wales census also recorded sexuality for the first time, with 1.5 million people aged over 15 – or 3.2% – identifying as gay or lesbian, bisexual or other sexual orientation. The charity Stonewall, which has long called for the inclusion of gender and sexual identity questions, described the results as “a historic step”.
Sexual identity has previously been monitored by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in its extensive annual population survey, but not through the fine detail of a census covering millions of people. The 2021 census found 748,000 (1.5%) people who described themselves as gay or lesbian, which was a slightly lower proportion than in the 2020 population survey. Six hundred and twenty-four thousand (1.3%) said they were bisexual, in line with the survey. In the census, 89.4% of people said they were straight or heterosexual, which is lower than the 93.4% in the annual population survey, while 3.6 million people did not answer the census question on sexuality. One hundred and twelve thousand people described themselves as pansexual, 28,000 as asexual, and 15,000 as queer. Rochford in Essex was the straightest town in England and Wales. Brighton and Hove had the highest non-heterosexual population. Norwich is the bisexual capital of England and Wales.
The figures may also include undercounting as the questions were voluntary and for people aged over 15. Also, 2.9 million people did not answer on gender identity. Campaigners said the groundbreaking new measures should be used to improve support for LGBTQ+ people at work, in education and including medical help with gender transitioning for which there are NHS waiting lists running into several years. “For the past two centuries of data gathering through our national census, LGBTQ+ people have been invisible, with the stories of our communities, our diversity, and our lives missing from the national record,” said Nancy Kelley, the chief executive of Stonewall. She added that the figures “finally paint an accurate picture of the diverse ‘Rainbow Britain’ that we now live in, where more and more of us are proud to be who we are”. The ONS said the figures would “support anti-discrimination duties under the Equality Act 2010 and aid allocation for resources and policy development”. The age of people identifying as trans or non-binary will be released on 25 January, but if the Canada pattern and UK polling is replicated, generation Z and millennials are several times more likely to identify as such than generation X and baby boomers. There were 48,000 trans men and a similar number of trans women. Thirty thousand people identified as non-binary and 18,000 gave a different gender identity, while 117,775 said their gender identity was different to the sex registered at birth but gave no specific identity. After Brighton and Hove, Norwich and Cambridge were the places with local authorities where most people identified as non-binary. Ceredigion had the highest percentage in Wales. The pioneering census figures come after the UK slid down the latest Rainbow Europe Index, which ranks countries according to the legal and policy human rights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people, going from 10th to 14th place. The Europe region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) docked points because there was “widespread political and media anti-trans sentiment”, the government has resisted gender recognition reforms and has yet to ban highly controversial “conversion therapy”, which attempts to teach people not to be homosexual or transgender. Felix Fern, the co-founder of Trans Activism UK, described the census as “a great step forward” but said: “Trans people are statistically more likely to suffer with mental health issues (likely induced not by dysphoria but by the transphobic climate we live in). We also know that the trans community has an above average likelihood to suffer from poverty and homelessness. We also experience higher volumes of sexual abuse and assault.” Statisticians asked the public to answer the mandatory “what is your sex?” question based on what was recorded on the respondent’s birth certificate or gender recognition certificate. That followed a legal challenge to their original plan to allow people to also say how their sex was recorded on their passport, which can be changed without legal process. The high court case was brought by Fair Play for Women, which campaigns to ”protect the rights of women and girls”, which said this would allow gender “self-identification through the back door”. The subsequent voluntary yes/no question for people aged over 15 – “is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?” – included a space to write in a gender identity.

Get Me Out of Here! to two charities, he has revealed.

The former health secretary's earnings from his 18-day appearance on the ITV show last year were published in the MPs register of interests on Thursday.

On Friday, his spokesman told Sky News he has given £10,000 of his earnings from the show to the Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association.

""That's more than his MP's salary when he was in the jungle,"" the spokesman said.

It is not clear if the £10,000 was evenly split between the two charities.

The amount adds up to 3.13% of the total the West Suffolk MP earned from the programme.

Mr Hancock, who was kicked out of the Tory party for appearing on the show and is now an independent MP, earned the equivalent of £17,777 a day during his jungle stint.

It is not known if the MP will donate any more money to the two charities but the spokesman added: ""He'll definitely be doing more fundraising this year, like he did last year - raising more than £22,000 for the proposed Cambridge Children's Hospital""

Ahead of appearing on the show, Mr Hancock said he signed up to raise awareness of dyslexia, which he was diagnosed with while at Oxford University.

While he was in the jungle, viewers said he was shown speaking for the first time about the learning difficulty two weeks in and mentioned it up to four times after that.

When he announced his appearance, he wrote in The Sun: ""I want to raise the profile of my dyslexia campaign to help every dyslexic child unleash their potential - even if it means taking an unusual route to get there via the Australian jungle.

""I'm A Celebrity is watched by millions of Brits up and down the country.

""I want to use this incredible platform to raise awareness, so no child leaves primary school not knowing if they have dyslexia.""

Following his stint in the jungle, Mr Hancock spoke in parliament about dyslexia during the second reading of the dyslexia screening and teacher training bill, which he tabled to provide universal screening in primary schools and to improve teacher training on the issue.

However, the bill ran out of time to clear its second reading and it is unlikely to progress in its current form.

In early December, Mr Hancock announced he will not be standing at the next general election, due in 2025.

In his letter announcing his intention to the prime minister, he wrote: ""I look forward to championing issues that are dear to my heart, including better support for dyslexic children who get a raw deal from the education system.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127191140/http://news.sky.com/story/matt-hancock-donates-10-000-of-his-320-000-im-a-celeb-fee-to-two-charities-12796936;skynews;entertainment & culture;2648
2107;2107;Kirsty Hanson’s WSL leveller claims point for Aston Villa at Manchester City;2023-01-21T14:59:42Z;['Suzanne Wrack'];"[""Women's Super League"", 'Manchester City Women', 'Aston Villa Women', 'Football', ""Women's football"", 'Sport']";;"Manchester City missed the chance to move level on points with Manchester United and Arsenal, as the United loanee Kirsty Hanson cancelled out Deyna Castellanos’s first WSL goal to earn Aston Villa a point. “It’s not one of our best, we looked a bit flat from the start,” the City manager, Gareth Taylor. “We scored a good goal and then obviously the concentration was poor. “We couldn’t get the symmetry and combination right apart from the final 15-20 minutes. Villa had some attempts, too many for our liking, but it was important not to lose as much as a point isn’t what we wanted. Today’s performance is a point we appreciate.”
The 1-1 draw at the Academy Stadium means Villa has taken four points against City this season, denting the home team’s Champions League and title hopes – hopes Taylor had played up after the team’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United when he pointed out that if they won every game the title would be theirs. However, Carla Ward has been rewarded by her Aston Villa team’s rise this season with a contract extension that ties her to the Midlands club until the end of the 2023-24 season and she has improved the threat of her team, dipping into the January transfer window to take advantage of the desire for match minutes of the England World Cup squad outsiders Jordan Nobbs and Lucy Staniforth. Despite a relatively even first half in possessionterms, City had the edge, the team’s threat on the wings troubling the Villa back line. At the halfway mark City had nine shots to Villa’s four but only had three on target. The home team took the lead, though, and it was league’s top scorer, Khadija Shaw, turning provider that led to the breakthrough. Just before the half-hour mark the Jamaica forward dropped deep and collected, holding up the ball before feeding it through to the unmarked Castellanos, who slotted coolly past the Villa goalkeeper, Anna Leat. It was the highly rated Venezuelan’s first league goal for City since joining in the summer.
The lead was short-lived, with the Villa centre-forward Rachel Daly, who is level with Shaw on nine league goals, delivering a cross from the right that dropped down for Hanson. She swung at it and the ball hit the defender Esme Morgan’s arm before rebounding back for the United loanee to power beyond Ellie Roebuck at the second time of asking. Both teams pushed for the winner in the second half, with Hanson crashing an effort off the bottom of the post for Villa and City upping the ante late on with over 70% possession in the last 15 minutes but neither side could find a way through. “There are definitely a lot of positives. It is a big point,” said Ward. “City are a very, very good side. But there were definitely a few moments there where if we sharpened up in the final third we could have taken one or two of those chances. But it was a collective team performance. We will be going home happy tonight but there’s still things to improve and kick on.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/manchester-city-aston-villa-womens-super-league-match-report;guardian;sports;2107

And when she does speak, it’s in the voice of someone else – her emotionally abusive boyfriend, Simon (Charlie Carrick), is so controlling that he’s in her thoughts and pulling her strings even when they’re apart. But gradually, with the support of Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku), Alice comes to realise that her relationship is not a healthy one. What’s impressive about this psychological thriller, the debut feature film from director Mary Nighy, is how tuned in it is to the dynamics of female friendship. While there’s a certain slackness to the storytelling – the film sags a little in the middle – the relationship between the women is fully persuasive. This is a friendship that goes deeper than words and instead plays out in loaded glances and body language that builds a rampart to repel the truly horrible Simon.;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/22/alice-darling-review-mary-nighy-anna-kendrick-compelling-female-friendship-thriller;guardian;entertainment & culture;1950

Connor Chapman, 22, appeared at Liverpool crown court via video link from HMP Manchester on Monday. He is charged with nine offences related to the incident at the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral, on 24 December. Police do not believe Edwards, a 26-year-old beautician, was the intended target of the attack. Four men were also injured in the shooting. Chapman, wearing a black Nike padded jacket and with long hair, spoke to confirm his name and date of birth during the hearing, which lasted about 10 minutes. The honorary recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary KC, remanded him in custody to appear for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 17 April. He fixed a trial date for 7 June, with the case expected to last three to four weeks. As well as murder, Chapman is charged with the attempted murder of Jake Duffy and Kieran Salkeld and three counts of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm of Harry Loughran, Nicholas Speed and Liam Carr. He is also charged with possessing a converted Škorpion submachine gun and ammunition with intent to endanger life on Christmas Eve and handling stolen goods – a Mercedes A-Class vehicle – between 22 and 26 December.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/16/man-connor-chapman-charged-with-elle-edwards-to-go-on-trial-in-june;guardian;entertainment & culture;3146
2412;2412;‘People before profits’: Victoria to ditch private health providers in women’s prisons;2023-01-20T00:05:50Z;['Benita Kolovos'];['Victoria', 'Prisons', 'Health', 'Deaths in custody', 'Victorian politics', 'Australia news'];;"The Victorian government’s decision to take over health care across the state’s women’s prisons has been welcomed by the partner of an Aboriginal woman who died in custody after making repeated calls for medical assistance. The state’s corrections minister, Enver Erdogan, will on Friday confirm the contract for providing primary health services at Tarrengower Prison and the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre will transition from private firm Correct Care Australasia (CCA) to Dhelkaya (Castlemaine) Health and Western Health, respectively, on 1 July. He said the providers were chosen because of their close proximity to the prisons, comprehensive range of primary health services, skilled workforce and ability to provide specialist services that “meet the distinct needs of women in custody”.
“We want to avoid people coming into contact with the justice system in the first place – but for those who do, the system has a duty of care to look after them and help them get their lives back on track,” Erdogan said in a statement. “We recognise in the past, this hasn’t always been the case for women in custody. A more tailored and appropriate standard of healthcare is needed.” Dhelkaya (Castlemaine) Health and Western Health will be accountable to the minister for health, as opposed to the state’s justice department, a change which Indigenous advocates have long called for. It comes as CCA and the Victorian government are being sued by Uncle Percy Lovett, the partner of Veronica Nelson, who died in her cell at Dame Phyllis Frost in January 2020 after making more than a dozen calls for help over the intercom system. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta woman’s death was the subject of a coronial inquest last year, which is expected to hand down its findings soon. During the five-week inquest, the coroner heard from a panel of medical experts who said Nelson should have been taken to hospital after she was first examined. Lovett, who in his submission to the inquest called for an overhaul of prison healthcare in Victoria, welcomed the government’s announcement. “I hope this means that things will be better for the other women in prison, and that what happened to Veronica never happens again,” he said in a statement. Nerita Waight, the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said it was a “momentous first step towards bringing healthcare in prisons in line with healthcare in the broader community”. “Prison healthcare in Victoria is in a state of emergency. We speak to clients daily about poor quality healthcare in prisons,” Waight said. “This crisis is particularly acute for Aboriginal people in prison who are more likely to die in custody because they didn’t get the healthcare they needed. Four Aboriginal people have died in Victoria’s prisons since Veronica Nelson.” Jill Gallagher, the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, also followed the inquest closely and said it was clear that racism played a role in Nelson’s death. “Her case shows that systemic racism is at play in our justice system from arrest to death. She was arrested on suspected shoplifting and they refused her bail. What’s that, other than racism at its worst?” Gallagher said. “If she wasn’t incarcerated she would’ve been able to take herself to a doctor.” Gallagher, who has long been advocating for a return to public health in prisons, said the new model signalled a “prioritisation of people before profits, particularly for our community”. “Our community have endured the preventable tragedy of five Aboriginal deaths in custody in only the last few years,” she said. “A public health model of care in our prisons is a great first step in addressing this.” As part of the new public model, all First Nations women entering custody will also undergo an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health check and be given an integrated care plan tailored to them to support early detection and ongoing management of health needs. Local Aboriginal community controlled health organisations (ACCHOs) will also play a greater role in delivering in-reach services, as well as helping prepare women for their release back into the community. Dhelkaya Health and Western Health also have designated Aboriginal health roles.
Several other Australian states including New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania currently deliver healthcare in public prisons. In Victoria’s men’s public prisons and a residential treatment centre, a new five-year agreement with the US-owned contractor GEO Group Australia was signed last week. Both Gallagher and Waight said the next step was for the government to make the change in all prisons in Victoria.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/20/people-before-profits-victoria-to-ditch-private-health-providers-in-womens-prisons;guardian;health;2412
3942;3942;Dancers flashmob funeral with Another One Bites the Dust;2023-01-12T11:54:22Z;['Matthew Weaver'];['UK news', 'Bristol'];;"A dance troupe flashmobbed a funeral with a performance of Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust at the request of a woman who wanted her sendoff to be memorable but not sad. Video of the event showed some mourners looking confused when the dancers emerged from pews midway through the funeral of Sandie Wood, from Bristol, before they began clapping along to the rock anthem. Wood, who died in September, aged 65, was one of 30,000 victims of the contaminated blood scandal. She had requested the stunt as part of a funeral that also included her sparkly high-heeled shoes and handbags being displayed alongside her pink coffin. The words “Going out in style” were written on the coffin. Speaking to the BBC, her friend Sam Ryalls, said: “She wanted everyone to remember her funeral but not for sad reasons. She left the world as she lived it and that was being herself.”
Ryalls told the Sun it was difficult to find dancers willing to perform at a funeral. “They all said they weren’t comfortable doing it,” she said. But the cabaret dance group Flaming Feathers, who provide dance classes in Bristol and Bath, accepted the challenge. Claire Phipps one of the groups dancers, told the BBC that “flashmobbing a funeral was a bit daunting”. But she added: “It was also really exciting because it was different to what we normally do. We had to sit through half the service along with everyone else with our coats on – so that was quite nerve-racking. “And then when the music came on, nobody had a clue what’s going to happen and then obviously we had to jump up and do our routine. So it was scary, but a memory that we’ll never forget. And it was a lot of fun.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/12/dancers-flashmob-funeral-with-another-one-bites-the-dust;guardian;politics;3942
2330;2330;Yunchan Lim review – piano prodigy puts his brilliance on full display;2023-01-20T11:22:00Z;['Andrew Clements'];['Classical music', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Wigmore Hall'];;"Last year, at the age of 18, the Korean Yunchan Lim became the youngest ever winner of the Van Cliburn piano competition in Fort Worth, Texas. Since it was established in 1962, and named after the US pianist who had won the first Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow at the height of the cold war in 1958, the Van Cliburn has had a patchy record of rewarding pianists who have gone on to enjoy really significant international careers. But the word was that this time the winner was the real deal, and on Wednesday night the Wigmore Hall was packed to the rafters for Lim’s London debut.
In the competition it had been performances of Liszt’s Transcendental Studies and Rachmaninov’s Third Piano Concerto that had made the deepest impression, but Lim’s programme for his Wigmore recital steered well clear of that high romantic repertoire,; Liszt only made an appearance for his second encore, the third of the Liebesträum. The selection seemed intended to demonstrate that he was a pianist who could offer much more than outstanding technique. A first half of Dowland – William Byrd’s richly ornamented keyboard arrangement of Pavana Lachrymae – and JS Bach’s 15 Sinfonias, the first versions of what are better known as the Three-Part Inventions, was certainly not conventional debut fare. But the performances were unaffected models of clarity and articulation, even if at times in the Bach they seemed to strive just a bit too hard to make expressive points. But the Beethoven after the interval suggested that even if Lim’s talent is shiningly obvious, there is still plenty of scope for his performances to deepen and mature. In the seven Bagatelles Op 33 it seemed to be Beethoven’s quirkiness that was constantly emphasised, with explosive sforzandos and violent dynamic contrasts rather than any of the music’s more sly subtleties, while in the Eroica Variations Op 35, it was always the virtuosity of the piano writing that came first, so that one longed at times for a bit less brilliance and a bit more poetry.

2714;2714;Can women in Britain ever trust the police again? Here’s what must happen first | Harriet Wistrich;2023-01-18T16:30:02Z;['Harriet Wistrich'];['Police', 'Metropolitan police', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'Crime', 'Women', 'UK news'];;The stories of police-perpetrated abuse of women that have emerged since the murder of Sarah Everard have been relentless and shocking – they show without doubt that there is something very rotten going on within the Metropolitan police force. In the wake of the case of David Carrick – a police officer who this week pleaded guilty to an astonishing 49 offences, including 24 rapes – public figures are queueing up to call out the Met’s culture. But where were they when these crimes – many of which could have been prevented – were being committed? In 2021 Priti Patel, then home secretary, announced that there would be an inquiry into Everard’s murder at the hands of a serving Met officer. In response to Carrick’s conviction, she stood up in parliament and called for that inquiry to be put on a statutory footing, so that it could examine the wider issues of violence against women within the Met police. This seemed a little odd, given that she resisted the call we made at the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) in October 2021 to do precisely that, based on a number of other reports of serious offenders within the Met police – including Carrick himself, who had just been charged with rape. The early reports of rape and domestic abuse by Carrick, where no further action was taken, illustrate the woeful inadequacies of policing of serial sexual offending by the Met, and the lack of safeguards to prevent police officers from using their powers to abuse women. It is notable that his career in the Met started in the early 2000s, when serial rapists John Worboys and Kirk Reid were offending with impunity while the police failed to investigate repeated reports against them. We now know that several women reported Carrick for extremely serious crimes, but no further action was taken against him. In fact he was repeatedly reported to the Met, but no red flags were raised, there was no attempt to investigate a pattern of offending and there was no suspension from duty. Instead he sailed through vetting and was even licensed to use firearms. That Carrick could have not only become a police officer, but remained a serving officer for so long while he perpetrated these horrific crimes against women is terrifying. The failure to suspend Carrick from duty or investigate him for misconduct despite multiple reports made by women matches a pattern we identified back in March 2020 in a police super-complaint on police-perpetrated domestic abuse. At that time we were looking at a sample of 19 cases from police forces across the country. Since then, we have been contacted by nearly 200 women who were victims of domestic abuse or sexual offences by police officers. In most cases those women have told us of their fears of reporting the officer, the often inadequate investigations, their victimisation by the abuser’s colleagues and the revenge exacted on them though criminalisation or through the family courts, with those they accuse misusing their police powers. In at least one case it drove a women to take her own life. We now know that these police rapists were not rogue officers. The revelations of misogyny and serious criminality against women by police officers have become frighteningly commonplace. We have known for some time that there has been a culture of impunity for such offending by police officers, with recent reports showing a woefully deficient vetting and misconduct system, and a largely unchallenged culture of misogyny in some sections of the Met. Some have argued that these cases show we should defund the police, but such a proposal could only ever lead to an escalation of crimes against women. What we require is radical reform, and meaningful accountability for those responsible for making these changes. CWJ has made a series of recommendations to tackle the problem of an alleged suspect being investigated by his colleagues. In particular there needs to be an independent reporting and investigation system so that victims of police perpetrators can come forward with greater confidence, and there needs to be effective protection for whistleblowers within the police, who too often experience victimisation when they report colleagues. Colleagues and particularly managers who joined in with or turned a blind eye to misogynistic “banter”, or assist with acts of victimisation, should also be held accountable and there must be zero tolerance of sexism and misogyny within policing. External experts need to be brought in to ensure recruitment, vetting, investigation and misconduct are free from bias. The recent end-to-end review of rape has led to the establishment of Operation Soteria Bluestone, which aims to improve the investigation and prosecution of rape, which has been at an all-time low. One of its primary purposes is to ensure that the focus of such investigations is on the suspect, not the victim. Suspect-focused investigations should be a no-brainer – as should ensuring that historical reports of previous, similar offences are central to any such investigation. The fact that such investigations have been the exception rather than the rule provides a partial explanation for Carrick’s enduring offending. Once the focus is firmly on suspects, not victims, then we can begin changing the culture of policing violence against women in this country.

3842;3842;Boris Johnson plans to visit Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Ukraine;2023-01-12T19:25:57Z;['Pippa Crerar', 'Dan Sabbagh'];['Boris Johnson', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Europe', 'Politics', 'World news', 'UK news'];;"Boris Johnson is planning a trip to Ukraine to visit President Volodymyr Zelenskiy despite concern among senior Conservatives that the trip could undermine the authority of Rishi Sunak. The former prime minster has told friends he intends to travel to Kyiv in the coming months to show his public support for the country against its Russian aggressors. Ukrainian sources also said Johnson “had an intention” to travel to Kyiv but they had “no concrete information” yet on dates. They said Zelenskiy and the former prime minister regarded each other as “friends”. Johnson had pitched himself as a strong supporter of Zelenskiy during his time in office, pushing international allies to provide more support in the early days of the war. The UK has provided substantial economic, humanitarian and defensive military assistance to Ukraine, committing to spend at least £2.3bn in 2023. A popular figure in Ukraine, Johnson called his counterpart in Kviv frequently while at No 10, although as his premiership unravelled he was accused of using the calls as a distraction whenever he faced another crisis. It is understood Downing Street was not aware of the planned trip, although government insiders said they were relaxed about Sunak’s predecessor-but-one representing the UK in this way. A spokesperson for Johnson declined to comment. Johnson, as a former premier, will receive taxpayer-funded security protection on foreign trips based on an assessment of the potential threat. The Ukrainians are also expected to provide security, as they would with all visiting foreign dignitaries. However, Johnson’s plan to burnish his post-Downing Street credentials on the world stage has been met with some consternation at Westminster, where Sunak’s allies accused his predecessor of undermining the prime minister’s authority. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence select committee and a former army officer, warned Johnson should “not interfere” with the official relationship between the two countries. He said: “Any senior visitor from the west will of course be welcomed by Kyiv, not least a former premier who pioneered UK’s military assistance to Ukraine from the start. “But Russia’s ability to endure hardship is greater than the west. Putin is retooling his industries to help the war effort and mobilising further thousands for a major spring offensive. “This conflict is far from over. Boris should leave no doubt that he fully supports No 10 and his visit should not interfere with the messaging or the official lines of communication between London and Kyiv.” One minister, an ally of Sunak, suggested Johnson was trying to have his “Churchill moment”. They added: “This is as much about how Boris views his role on the world stage as it is about backing Ukraine. The situation there remains extremely fragile so he needs to be careful not to compromise Rishi’s relationship with Zelenskiy.” Another Tory MP suggested Johnson’s trip to Kyiv would make him a more attractive proposition on the international speaking circuit. Over the course of his first four months out of office, he made more than £1m delivering four speeches. They said: “It’s all about brand Boris. It’s a marketing ploy to make him more relevant and get him more speaking gigs in the US. He’ll be a bigger draw if he’s just been to Ukraine.” Only a handful of British politicians have travelled to Ukraine since the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered troops to invade last February, including Johnson, Sunak and defence secretary Ben Wallace. The trip will be the fourth time the former prime minister has travelled to Kyiv – having first visited in April soon after Russian troops abandoned their attempt to seize the capital. He went to Ukraine for a second surprise visit in June and returned again in August for the country’s independence day.
Sunak, whose first international call after taking office was to Zelenskiy, made a surprise visit to Kyiv in November, where he pledged UK support for Ukraine in the fight against Russia would remain steadfast. Days before Johnson pulled out of the Tory leadership contest against Sunak in October, the Ukrainian government’s official Twitter page posted a meme based on the Netflix show Better Call Saul, with a picture of the former prime minister’s face and the words “Better Call Boris”.

3735;3735;Ant-Man and the Wasp: can Marvel’s tiniest heroes carry the whole franchise?;2023-01-13T11:24:25Z;['Ben Child'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Paul Rudd', 'Marvel', 'Superhero movies', 'Science fiction and fantasy films'];;"It was pretty obvious to every superhero fan that Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man, until his sad demise, sat at the centre of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Who brought Ultron into existence? Yes, the billionaire philanthropist with the zippy one-liners. Who invented time travel in order to defeat Thanos? That guy who loved shawarma, weapons of mass destruction and casual sexism (at least in his early outings). Since Tony Stark’s death in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU has been crying out for a focal point. Doctor Strange looked like he might step up, but soon lost his position as sorcerer supreme to Wong and almost destroyed the entire universe while trying to help out Peter Parker. Thor still isn’t quite his old self after gaining a beer gut and attempting a journey of self-discovery, while Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel has been largely awol since Endgame. So why not Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne? The new trailer for the forthcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania suggests that the size-shifting superheroes are about to find themselves at the centre of a new Marvel chapter in which Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) emerges as the – possibly ultimate – big bad.
There’s a pattern to Marvel’s films these days, usually involving one of our heroes making an error that ends up causing chaos in the universe / multiverse / miniaturised plane of unreality (delete as applicable). We know from previous trailers that Lang’s daughter Cassie decided to send a signal into the quantum realm, which seems to have resulted in Scott, Hope, Cassie, Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet van Dyne and Michael Douglas’s Hank Pym being sucked into that freaky netherworld. In the new trailer, released this week, it looks as if Lang has been lured into a trap by Kang. Unless there is sleight of hand going on here – and you never can tell these days with trailers – the story seems to revolve around Ant-Man foolishly signing up to a deal that would restore the lost years he never got to spend with Cassie due to the events of Avengers: Infinity War.
It’s hardly out of character for Lang to make bad life decisions – he is an ex-con – but it’s difficult to think how the film will convince us that anyone would sign up to a deal with some dodgy bloke they met in the quantum realm. Surely one of the gang – and it looks like Pfeiffer is trying – can talk Lang out of becoming the latest in a long line of Marvel superheroes doing really braindead things on a whim that could end up destroying the whole of existence. Anyway, wasn’t the whole point of the Disney+ show Loki that Kang was back, primed and ready to wreak havoc in the multiverse after being accidentally freed in the final episode of season one? If so, what’s he doing stuck in the quantum realm? Are there multiple layers to Kang’s imprisonment? Might each member of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes end up freeing him by increment, with the final hurdle cleared just in time for 2025’s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty? Or perhaps this is just one of Kang’s variants – though that seems like something of a cop-out. Either way, Lang has come a long way since we first met him as a common-or-garden burglar with a cheeky smile. Let’s hope he won’t go down in Marvel history as the guy who let Kang loose and failed to make it out alive. But if the saga’s billionaire geniuses, deities and mighty wizards can be destroyed by hubris, perhaps the saga’s ultimate nice guy will mess up in a big way sooner or later.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/13/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-mcu-tiniest-heroes;guardian;entertainment & culture;3735
801;801;All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt review – experimental film pulls on the senses;2023-01-27T18:36:24Z;['Adrian Horton'];['Sundance 2023', 'Sundance film festival', 'Festivals', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Drama films'];;"There will be a moment in All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt, the gorgeous, unconventional debut from Raven Jackson, when the film’s spell works. It may be in the first 15 minutes, lulled by Mississippi’s lush soundscape and meditative shots of a southern summer, or an extended take in a hospital delivery room. It could wait until the final scene, an ode to memories already recorded and yet to come.
The pull of this sparsely worded, deeply sensitive film will probably depend on what triggers one’s personal sentimentality and, more pertinently, how much you know about it going in. The plot is so loosely outlined, and the camera so frequently turned to hands over faces, that it could be difficult, sans context, to pick up on its ambitious logic: a series of non-chronological memories in the life of one Black woman, connected by the senses of touch and sound and particularly attuned to the lingering feel of one’s skin on another. The spell worked for me about a third of the way through, during an audaciously long sequence in which the adult Mack (Charleen McClure) embraces a past returned lover (Reginald Helms Jr). (There is just enough dialogue, tucked in around too-pregnant pauses, to infer that he left town and married someone else.) The narrative arc and the couple’s painful past is rendered almost entirely wordless – hands caressing into tearful hug, an arm stroking a back in the way that imprints on the mind, release. The nearly 10-minute scene left me hungry – for more words, for characters – yet struck by the depth of feeling one can evoke from pure, thoughtfully rendered physicality. Most of Jackson’s scenes in this 96-minute film play out this way: sumptuously constructed vignettes, pulling on the eyes and the wistfulness of memory to feel another’s life. We see Mack’s life in nonlinear snippets spanning decades, from her 70s childhood onward, linked by the feel of her world – silt, sand, dirt; the hands of her late mother (Sheila Atim), father (Chris Chalk), sister (Moses Ingram), grandmother, lover, child. (Mack is played as a child by Kaylee Nicole Johnson.) The shots are alternatively lived in and heightened, as if staged for a gallery. Throughout, cinematographer Jomo Fray’s camera gravitates the fingertips, which is at first almost frustrating, then effective in orienting viewers to the connective tissue of Mack’s memory. Once you notice the indications of character – Mack’s two braids, her sister’s birthmark on her eyelid – the time shifts become less blurred, though never entirely clear. The film is often achingly beautiful, but lacks for details on Mack’s personality, how she feels about anything in this collage, or why a crucial decision regarding her child is made. The vagueness can drag. Still, by the second half, as the timeline of her life begins to coalesce and one adjusts to the film’s unhurried rhythm, Jackson’s bold artistic vision – to visually render the intensity and specialness of sense memories – feels more clear, and thus more potent. Ever attuned to the non-visual senses, the film’s power owes in part to its fantastic soundscape by Miguel “Maiki” Calvo with melancholic music from Sasha Gordon and Victor Magro. From the very first frame, All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt is alive with the music of Mack’s world, from old records to the rustle of grass underfoot. Crickets, mosquitoes, bird calls, the squish of mud in hand, the various shades of rainfall – Jackson is hyperaware of the ways certain sounds embody nostalgia, which has the effect of layering the viewer’s associations on to Mack’s vague longing. The film’s sound is so all-encompassing and dimensional as to nearly impart the weight of humidity; it triggered my own memories of a brimming, freighted summer night. Lavish in its visual appreciation and withholding in the details, All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt does convey, in the end, the sense of a full life. It may not always land and gets lost in itself on the way there, but Jackson has crafted a beautiful experiment indicative of ambitious vision, one whose magic outweighs its weaknesses. All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/all-dirt-roads-taste-of-salt-movie-review-sundance-film-festival-raven-jackson;guardian;entertainment & culture;801

There had been suggestions that events on the three-day weekend in May should be scaled back to acknowledge the current economic difficulties many are facing.

But Alastair Bruce, a former officer of arms of the Royal Household, told Sky News that ""the big help out"", planned for Monday 8 May, is central to what ""the King wants to emphasise"" in his reign as the cost of living crisis continues.

""The nation has a tradition of recognising that no matter what may come, good or bad, we have a story that is part of our nation that continues,"" he said.

""[The coronation] can be used to act as a cohesive opportunity to galvanise people to support those who are having a tough time.

""The great help out is there in order to encourage people who have celebrated over the previous two days to come out and do something for their community, to engage with the action.

""I think in doing that, more people will become aware of the incredible amount of effort that is being made on behalf of those who really need it.

""One of the great strengths of any nation is that it has a community and people who engage and support whatever the challenges are.

""During the Second World War, everyone came to play their part during the difficulties of the Blitz and everything else but we're in a sort of economic war at the moment and I think that the King is very aware of that.

""It would be a wonderful legacy if people continue in that work after the big help out.""

Buckingham Palace has announced details of the planned events, which will feature the coronation ceremony, grand procession and Charles's first balcony appearance as King on Saturday 6 May, a concert featuring global stars on Sunday 7 May and the day of volunteering on Monday 8 May.

Mr Bruce said that while the ceremony ""will have its reflections"" in the 1953 coronation, he expects the celebrations to be modernised.

He also said that the visual choreography of the three-day weekend will highlight the importance of working members of the Royal family to the King.

5595;5595;‘Burned the hill down’: billionaire’s runaway fireworks spark New Zealand furore;2023-01-03T05:04:05Z;['N/A'];['New Zealand', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];;"Residents of a New Zealand town are calling for a ban on private fireworks after a display by a New York billionaire set off a blaze on New Year’s Eve. Ten minutes into the new year, firefighters were called to fight multiple grass fires at the property of Tony Malkin – chief executive of the entity that owns the Empire State Building – after an extravagant private fireworks display went awry near Queenstown in Central Otago. By morning the fire was extinguished, after coming within metres of one of two dwellings on the Malkin estate, known as Redemption Song, pictures including satellite images show. It burned around 0.5ha in total. The display had gone ahead despite a petition by local people concerned about the impact on animals. People are now calling for a wider ban on private fireworks displays. Johnny Quinn, a neighbour who started the petition to prevent the display, says the Malkins’ decision to proceed despite the community’s objections was not “the Kiwi way”. “It’s just a joke that an out-of-towner can come in and set off a 14-minute commercial firework display and then burn the hill down,” Quinn says.
After being told “carte blanche” that the display would be going ahead despite his concerns, Quinn and his family left the area with their four horses for New Year’s Eve. “It basically upset the entire neighbourhood. Everyone within the area had to make plans. People changed their holiday plans. And you’ve got all the FENZ [Fire Emergency New Zealand] people who are inconvenienced. They’ve all got families. “There’s one neighbour with a dog and the dog is still not OK. It’s still cowering in the corner. You’re talking about long term psychological damage to animals.” Malkin was yet to apologise for the blaze, Quinn said. A spokesperson for the Malkins said the family would not be making any comment other than that they were “deeply grateful for the expert work” of FENZ and the police. In comments reported before the display, the property owners said: “As a courtesy beyond any requirement, mindful of house pets and livestock, we have reached out to neighbours to ensure they are apprised of our plans. We will happily consider any reasonable request from our immediate neighbors for financial assistance to move their livestock. We are sorry for any inconvenience” Quinn and other Queenstown residents have formed a working group and plan to lobby their local MP for a ban on all fireworks other than professionally organised fireworks displays. “It’s a rural country, and it’s really not the way to go about things – setting off explosives. Some people say animals don’t just sort of hear these things, they feel them as well,” Quinn said. “I don’t want to stop people having fun. I want people to enjoy themselves, but at the end of the day, it has to be done in an inclusive way and in a safe way.” It was one of a spate of fires related to fireworks across New Zealand over New Year’s Eve. One display near Auckland resulted in the death of a seven-year-old dog named Lilly, Stuff reported. • This article was amended on 3 January 2023. The original subheading said the fireworks display was on Christmas Eve.

2527;2527;Will All Quiet on the Western Front really conquer all at the Baftas?;2023-01-19T13:22:09Z;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Baftas 2023', 'Baftas', 'Film adaptations', 'Netflix', 'The Banshees of Inisherin', 'Martin McDonagh', 'Everything Everywhere All At Once', 'Cate Blanchett', 'Bill Nighy', 'Awards and prizes', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Film', 'Media'];;"The Baftas have delivered a very unusual outlier to what we all thought was the accepted general drift of this year’s award season. It’s certainly a departure from English-speaking Hollywood, though perhaps a tribute to a very shrewd marketing campaign from a certain streaming service. At all events, the Golden Globes may have saluted Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans, but not the voters of the British Academy who have largely overlooked that film in favour of a resoundingly announced love for the new version of the German anti-war classic All Quiet on the Western Front, based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, way ahead of all the other films with a whopping 14 nominations. What a triumph for everyone, including it must be acknowledged its distributor Netflix which kept doggedly putting its prestige product under Bafta voters’ noses. They are proud of this film. Rightly so. It is the first German-language adaptation of the book and is very good: excellently acted and staged, with severity and moral seriousness, though without any great original interpretative slant. Some might be surprised at quite how this film seemed to have leapfrogged everyone else. It could well be because we are now all so grimly aware of the unquiet eastern front; the brutal and continuing war in Ukraine may have directed Bafta’s collective unconscious to this brutal subject. Martin McDonagh’s The Banshees of Inisherin, the bizarre story of how a man rejects his best friend, continues its triumphal march through, with 10 nominations – although perhaps Brendan Gleeson might be pondering quite why he is nominated for best supporting actor and his equally billed co-star Colin Farrell gets to be nominated as best actor. Well, this way they each get a bite of the apple and they are wonderful performances. Good also to see Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan nominated for their supporting turns. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film whose supremely fashionable status (about which I am agnostic) has been underscored by awards-season success and the Baftas have rewarded it with a handsome 10 nominations, including best actress for Michelle Yeoh as a laundromat owner assailed by an infinity of alternative life-possibilities. And Ke Huy Quan may well repeat his Globes success as the film’s best supporting actor nominee. Elsewhere, observers might worry about a tiny loss of momentum for Todd Field’s superb drama Tár, about the autocratic orchestra conductor incomparably played by Cate Blanchett, which lags with five nominations – but surely Blanchett is a shoo-in for best actress. Her fellow nominees might have to resign themselves to clapping good-naturedly as Blanchett beamingly weaves her way up to the stage. I wanted to see more Bafta love for the wonderful film Living (for which Bill Nighy has a best actor nod), while Charlotte Wells’s demanding and brilliant Aftersun probably deserved to have a best film and director nomination and Paul Mescal up for best actor. Aftersun also gets a nomination in Bafta’s outstanding British debut list, which is really where the soul of the Bafta ceremony is to be found. The wonderful Irish film The Quiet Girl also might have achieved more recognition, though it might well win in the foreign language category and the adapted screenplay category. So Bafta would seem to be all for All Quiet on the Western Front – that great European tragedy – but my guess is that on the night the actual awards will turn towards Tár, Banshees and Elvis.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/19/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-netflix-baftas-nominations;guardian;entertainment & culture;2527
1014;1014;Nadhim Zahawi allows HMRC to share his tax information with inquiry;2023-01-26T19:33:46Z;['Peter Walker', 'Kalyeena Makortoff'];['Nadhim Zahawi', 'HMRC', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'Rishi Sunak'];;"Nadhim Zahawi has offered to share his tax information with an inquiry into his financial affairs, as the head of HMRC added further pressure on the Tory chair by saying there were “no penalties for innocent errors” . Zahawi wrote to Jim Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, on Wednesday night authorising him to pass on any relevant information from his records to Laurie Magnus, Rishi Sunak’s ethics adviser, a source said. The letter was sent before Harra appeared before a parliamentary committee on Thursday morning, but was seemingly not seen in advance by the HMRC chief, who told MPs that it would require consent from a taxpayer to divulge any of their details. While Harra stressed he could only talk about general rules and not specific cases, some of his comments to the public accounts committee will have been notably uncomfortable for Zahawi and Sunak.
“There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs,” Harra said. “If you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax, and for interest … you would not be liable for a penalty. “But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances.” Zahawi, who effectively confirmed he paid a penalty to HMRC in a statement at the weekend, joined Sunak and other cabinet ministers for an awayday on Thursday at the prime ministerial retreat of Chequers, although he was said to have played minimal part in discussions. A brief TV interview given by Sunak at Chequers saw the prime minister once again face repeated questions about Zahawi, who attends cabinet as minister without portfolio as well as being Tory chair. Asked about Harra’s comments, Sunak said he could not “pre-judge the outcome of the investigation” into Zahawi’s tax payments by Magnus. Sunak himself faces pressure to explain why he appointed Zahawi to the cabinet despite media reports chronicling his tax woes, and given Zahawi had paid a tax penalty while he briefly served as chancellor under Boris Johnson. The PM has insisted he first learned about the penalty when the Guardian reported it on Friday, despite other government sources disputing this version of events. “When I appointed Nadhim Zahawi to his current job, no issues were raised with me about that appointment,” Sunak said on Thursday, adding that he had only commissioned Magnus’s inquiry when “new information came to light over the past week”. According to Guardian sources, Zahawi is understood to have paid an estimated total of £5m, which included interest, about £3.7m in tax owed and a penalty of 30%. The tax demand was connected to the sale of a Gibraltar-based share in YouGov, the polling company Zahawi co-founded. Zahawi said last week that the error was “careless and not deliberate”, but has not provided further details. When asked about how the term “careless” should be interpreted by the public, Harra told MPs: “Carelessness is a concept in tax law. It can be relevant to how many back-years that we can assess, can be relevant to whether someone is liable to a penalty and, if so, what penalty they will be liable to for an error in their tax affairs.” While Harra made clear he was not at liberty to speak directly about an individual’s tax affairs because of confidentiality rules, he said he would most likely be able to do so if he had permission from Zahawi himself. HMRC would assist with any relevant ethics inquiries “in any way we possibly can”, Harra told MPs, but added that it did not have a duty to correct any false statements that may be made to the public or media by the individual in question. Questioned about whether Zahawi would be expected to hand over details of his tax affairs before it emerged he had given HMRC permission to do this, Sunak’s deputy spokesperson said: “It’s an independent investigation, so I can’t comment on the process. More broadly, the prime minister expects participation with it.” While the HMRC has agreed to flag potential tax issues in regards to individuals being considered for honours or peerages, Harra said there were no similar memorandums of understanding in place with the Cabinet Office regarding ministerial appointments. “The process for appointing ministers is handled in Cabinet Office. They have got their own processes … there’s no part of that that involves routine engaging with HMRC or routine disclosure of information,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/26/nadhim-zahawi-allows-hmrc-to-share-his-tax-information-with-inquiry;guardian;politics;1014
1666;1666;Harry Kane equals Spurs’ all-time scoring record in win at Fulham;2023-01-23T22:26:37Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Premier League', 'Fulham', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Touch, turn, shoot. This was Harry Kane making the art of goal-scoring look like the easiest thing in the world. Fulham did not know what had hit them. One minute they had the biggest threat on the pitch under control; the next Kane was swivelling into space and pulling back his right foot before wheeling away to celebrate the goal that finally drew him level with the late Jimmy Greaves as Tottenham’s record scorer. It was the 266th strike of the forward’s Spurs career and, as the ball nestled in the back of the Fulham net, it was tempting to wonder where this team would be without him. As ever, it was not exactly a flowing performance from Antonio Conte’s team. They were outplayed by Fulham at times and, although they were professional enough to see out a win that lifts them three points below fourth-placed Manchester United, their overall display hardly suggested that they are about to shake off the inconsistency blunting their hopes of Champions League qualification.
Yet if anything gives this plodding side a chance it is Kane. Much like Greaves, he does not hang around when there is a chance to shoot. The technique is usually perfect and it is no wonder that United hope to convince Kane to leave Spurs this summer. It is a fascinating situation, the biggest decision of Kane’s career, and one that will surely have a bearing on whether Conte decides to extend his stay in north London. The mood away from the pitch remains uncertain at Spurs. The snippy tone begins with Conte, who continues to give no indication that he wants to extend his deal when it runs out at the end of the season, but a sulky manager is not the only problem. There is also a sense of drift in the boardroom, with pressure growing on Daniel Levy. Nothing heightened that impression more than one of the subplots around this game being the alleged false accounting at Juventus somehow impacting Spurs, who do not know if their director of football, Fabio Paratici, will be banned from operating on transfers because of the situation at his former club. This is not a happy ship at the moment and it was not a surprise to see Conte’s team make the usual slow start. It was all too passive from the visitors. All the early enterprise came from Fulham. They snapped into Spurs, Aleksandar Mitrovic pressuring Eric Dier into conceding an early corner, and they almost led when a cross reached Harrison Reed, who volleyed straight at Hugo Lloris. Spurs, who had angered Conte by conceding 21 goals in their previous 10 league games, needed to wake up. They had already seen Lloris save from Kenny Tete after sloppy distribution from Cristian Romero, but signs of an improvement took a while to materialise. Fulham were pressing and did not merely want to play pretty football. The style was accompanied by occasional snarl – take the moment when João Palhinha took out Pierre-Emile Højbjerg – and the hunger was epitomised by Willian’s industry on the left wing. Slowly but surely, though, Spurs found some control. The back three began to handle Mitrovic and chances arrived at the other end. There was a warning from Kane, who whistled a shot over from 20 yards, then a drive from Emerson Royal that forced Bernd Leno to react smartly at his near post.
Fulham’s passing grew ragged and Spurs punished them. There was a long spell of pressure just before half-time, with Dejan Kulusevski causing problems, and the opener arrived when Højbjerg found Son Heung-min, who dribbled forward and slipped a pass to Kane. It was over to the England captain at that stage. So what if Kane had his back to goal and was surrounded by white shirts? It all happened in a flash: Kane spinning away from a bewildered Tim Ream and then, before anyone could close him down, using the inside of his right foot to shape a beautiful effort round the bodies, leaving Leno rooted to the spot as the ball whizzed beyond him. Here was the master goalscorer at work, the depth of Kane’s imagination, the versatility of his forward play, and the speed and efficiency of his finishing lifting him above everyone else on the pitch. But Fulham had to respond. They made a strong start to the second half, Bobby Decordova-Reid full of eager running on the right, and only brave defending from Dier denied Palhinha an equaliser. Yet Fulham needed more conviction. Spurs looked comfortable and could have extended their lead when Ben Davies sent a header into the six-yard box for Kane. Only stunning reflexes from Leno prevented Spurs from going 2-0 up. It did not matter. Fulham, who could have gone above Spurs with a win, were limited to one tame header from Mitrovic. Kane’s ruthlessness made the difference.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/23/fulham-tottenham-premier-league-match-report;guardian;sports;1666

He should be excited but instead he senses that something isn’t right. When he ventures outside to feed his pet rabbits, he finds they are afraid of him; meanwhile, rooks shriek and dive-bomb overhead. On his way to collect milk from a neighbouring farm, Will sees a shadowy tramp-like figure watching him from the edge of the woods. When he tells the farmer, Mr Dawson, and the farrier, Old George, what he has seen, Dawson replies: “The Walker is abroad. This night will be bad, and tomorrow will be beyond imagining.” This new audio version of Susan Cooper’s 1973 fantasy novel – the second in The Dark Is Rising Sequence – is adapted by the writer Robert Macfarlane and the actor and director Simon McBurney, who also narrates. Along with Will, we meet the sage-like Merriman (Paul Rhys), who first appears in Cooper’s 1965 book, Over Sea, Under Stone, plus The Lady (Harriet Walter), Hawkin (Toby Jones) and Herne the Hunter (Miles Yekinni). All tutor Will in the ways of the Old Ones, a group of ancient guardians of “the Light” who have magical powers and do battle against the forces of darkness.

5217;5217;Number of US children who accidentally ate cannabis rose by 1,375% in last five years;2023-01-05T06:00:12Z;['Maya Yang'];['Cannabis', 'Children', 'US news'];;"The number of young children accidentally ingesting marijuana in the US has rocketed by 1,375% in the last five years, a new report reveals. The report, released on Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, examined findings from the National Poison Data System on pediatric exposure to edible cannabis products in children younger than six years old from 2017 to 2021.
The report found 7,043 exposures, signifying a “consistent increase” with the “potential for significant toxicity”. In 2017, 207 cases of accidental marijuana ingestion were reported. In 2021, there were 3,054, an increase by more than 1,000%. The majority of the reports, 97.7%, occurred in residential settings. Among such cases, 90.7% were at the child’s own residence and 6.4% were reported at other residences. According to the report, 22.7% of cases resulted in admittance to hospital. Among those, 8.1% were admitted to critical care and 14.6% to non-critical care. “There was a significant increase in both ICU [intensive care unit] and non-ICU admissions, whereas the number of patients treated and released decreased when comparing the pre-Covid years (2017–2019) to the Covid years (2020–2021),” the report said. “Major and moderate effects also significantly increased during the pre-pandemic years compared with the two years during the pandemic.” Children who consume marijuana may experience problems including difficulty walking or sitting up, as well as a hard time breathing, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns. According to the study, 70% of cases followed a known outcome, with some degree of central nervous system depression. Other recorded clinical effects included ataxia or poor muscle control, agitation, confusion, tremor and seizures. Children younger than one year old made up 1.9% of reported cases. Children between one and two made up 14.9% of the cases. Children between two and three and those between three and four years old comprised 27.7% and 24.6% of the cases respectively. Children who were four or five years old made up 18% and those between five and six 12.7%. The study’s lead author, Marit Tweet, an emergency medicine doctor at SIU Medicine in Springfield, Illinois, said she was most concerned about accidental ingestion in children aged five and younger. “This age group accounts for about 40% of all calls to poison centers nationally,” Tweet told NPR. “They can get into things, and you can’t really rationalize with them” about the dangers of accidental ingestion, she added. “They think it looks like candy, and maybe, they just want to eat it,” Tweet said, referring to marijuana edibles created to resemble sweets. The increase in accidental pediatric marijuana consumption comes as cannabis products become more widely available with more states legalizing medical and recreational marijuana use. According to state and nationwide census data cited in the Pediatrics report, the number of Americans with access to legal recreational cannabis rose from 68.9 million in 2017 to 134.4 million in 2021 – a 95% increase.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/05/children-edible-marijuana-cannabis-use;guardian;entertainment & culture;5217
7641;7641;What is 'lucky girl syndrome'? The newest TikTok manifestation trend explained;Wednesday 18 January 2023 16:09, UK;[];['tiktok'];['newest', 'young', 'luck', 'explained', 'things', 'tiktok', 'trend', 'manifestation', 'syndrome', 'affirmations', 'work', 'way', 'works', 'girl', 'lucky'];"""Lucky girl syndrome"" is the latest trend taking over TikTok, and its devotees believe affirmations are the key to a successful - and lucky - life.

Wondering what it's all about - and whether it's time you started manifesting? Read on.

What is the lucky girl syndrome trend?

Lucky girl syndrome is a form of manifestation - or thinking your dreams into reality.

It involves people reciting daily affirmations in the belief they will bring good fortune into their lives.

It's blown up on TikTok, where the #LuckyGirlSyndrome hashtag has racked up more than 130 million views.

People post videos of their affirmations along the lines of ""I am so lucky"", ""everything just works out for me"" and ""I always get want I want"", and describe how lucky girl syndrome has changed their lives.

What does being a lucky girl actually mean?

Lucky girls get their own way - traffic lights go green, job opportunities open up, the fully booked restaurant has a miraculous opening.

TikTok is brimming with videos of young women sharing the luck they've had after adopting the affirmations - with many claiming they were originally sceptical it would work.

In one video, a woman describes getting an iPhone and Apple Watch for $18 after a spontaneous decision to join a gym led her to a deal that was about to expire.

In another, someone says their husband won a $900 sports bet after they had been saying the manifestations for a day.

Is there a rational explanation for this?

Dr Carolyne Keenan, a psychologist, told the BBC that lucky girl syndrome ties in with confirmation bias - the tendency to process information by identifying things that are consistent with your existing beliefs. You remember the times things did work out in your favour, and overlook the times they didn't.

She voiced concern about the downsides of the assumption that you can make your own luck.

""There are going to be, unfortunately, some situations in life that we are not able to manifest and think our way out of,"" she said.

""I would be concerned about people being in situations where maybe that's not going to be an effective strategy.""

She also pointed out that putting things down to luck can overlook the hard work that goes into them.

What are the criticisms of lucky girl syndrome?

As well as overlooking hard work, lucky girl syndrome does not account for privilege.

Most of the accounts posting their lucky girl success stories are from young, white, able-bodied women.

The trend has come under fire from people who say it is inherently racist and ableist as it works on the assumption that anyone can get what they want - when that might not be true for people with systemic oppression in their way.

The other flipside of lucky girl syndrome is the idea that bad luck is your fault, too, which can create anxiety and feelings of shame and defeatism when things don't go your way.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118163217/http://news.sky.com/story/what-is-lucky-girl-syndrome-the-newest-tiktok-manifestation-trend-explained-12789379;skynews;entertainment & culture;1732
6471;6471;The devout, the curious and the professional observers attend Pope Benedict's funeral;Thursday 5 January 2023 18:47, UK;[];['pope benedict', 'vatican city'];['vatican', 'benedict', 'professional', 'francis', 'devout', 'observers', 'peters', 'funeral', 'man', 'square', 'benedicts', 'attend', 'pope', 'coffin', 'day', 'curious'];"It was an occasion attended by a mixture of people, the devout, curious bystanders and professional observers all brought together by the death of a man who retired nearly a decade ago.

Monks, priests, nuns, cardinals, bishops - every stratum of the Catholic community was represented within St Peter's Square for Pope Benedict's funeral.

And then there were thousands of worshippers who came here to pay their own private respects.

Among them were nuns from Nigeria, who both described Benedict as ""courageous"" for his decision to retire at the age of 85, with one of them saying he should be considered a saint.

A missionary from the Philippines said she thought of the former Pope as ""faithful and humble"" - an example to everyone in the church.

Cardinal Vincent Nicholls, Archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Catholic Church across Britain, was also present, with people patiently waiting around him to ask for his blessing.

""I knew Pope Benedict reasonably well so I do feel a real sadness and a sense of loss,"" he said, '""but I think that warmth was also a reflection of his personality.

""The thing that remains with people was that he was gentle - he was a gentleman - and he had great insight and sensitivity.

""Anybody who met him came away with that sense of a man who was warm and who was courteous, to whom you could relate, no matter the difficulties that were being tackled.

No dissent despite critics in his life

Around him, there was no dissent. Pope Benedict had many critics in his life, notably those who said that he did not do enough to confront sexual abuse scandals within his church, but today was not a forum for those debates.

It was, at heart, the funeral of a venerable man, with most, if not quite all, the trappings of a full papal event.

And that's what brought the curious too, for this was a day of public spectacle and there were people who came simply to say they had been there, or to post a photo from among the throng.

Then there were the professionals - politicians, royals and representatives as well as police, medics, and support staff.

Alongside them were the Swiss guard, who protect the Vatican, journalists from dozens of countries and diligent street cleaners who cleaned up before and after the ceremony.

St Peter's Square was nowhere near full - but this was still special

The service had barely ended when the barriers were being taken down - the Vatican is very good at managing crowds.

This was not like the funeral of the previous Pope, John Paul II, whose death brought millions to Italy and created an outpouring of grief from around the world.

Benedict did not spend as long in the job, did not engender such love, and did not die in office. St Peter's Square, which can hold hundreds of thousands, was nowhere near full.

But this was still a special occasion. There were moments when applause rang around the whole congregation, when the music seemed to seep through the mist; when the crowd of people held their breath as they watched Pope Francis kiss the coffin holding the body of his predecessor.

It was the day when normal order was restored in the Catholic Church - when the split affection ended and when the focus returned to the one person left in the world who has been proclaimed as Pope.

The question now, for the devout, the curious and the professional observers, is this: was Benedict's decision to retire a one-off curiosity or a precedent that Francis might follow?

On a day when the Vatican marked the past, there are many wondering about the future.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230105204755/http://news.sky.com/story/the-devout-the-curious-and-the-professional-observers-attend-pope-benedicts-funeral-12780692;skynews;politics;562

4308;4308;Government avoids questions on whether it will ditch Windrush reforms;2023-01-10T15:59:07Z;['Rajeev Syal', 'Amelia Gentleman'];['Windrush scandal', 'UK news', 'Commonwealth immigration', 'Immigration and asylum', 'Politics', 'Suella Braverman', 'Conservatives'];;"Ministers have come under increasing pressure to say whether they will drop promises to implement major reforms made after the Windrush scandal. Stepping in for the home secretary, Suella Braverman, the junior Home Office minister Sarah Dines faced pressure from MPs across the house after telling the Commons she would not comment “on speculation in the Guardian”. It follows a report last week that said the home secretary had dropped a pledge to create the post of a migrants’ commissioner, and a promise to increase the powers of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICIBI). The recommendations were accepted three years ago by the government after a formal inquiry by Wendy Williams examined the scandal under which the Home Office erroneously classified legal residents, many of whom arrived from Caribbean countries as children in the 1950s and 1960s, as immigrants living in the UK illegally. At an urgent question submitted by Labour, the former Conservative Home Office minister Kevin Foster demanded to know whether the government would keep the promise made by the former home secretary Priti Patel and implement all of Williams’ recommendations. “It was very clear certainly from the right honourable member for Witham [Patel] the government was absolutely committed to putting all [the recommendations] in place to rebuild confidence of the Windrush generation. Could she reassure me that that commitment still exists and will be taken forward?” he said. Dines replied: “I suggest the commitment is there for many to see. But clearly there is still much work to be done.” Those affected by the scandal expressed dismay at reports of plans to drop some of the reform measures. Michael Braithwaite, who lost his job as a special needs assistant at the primary school where he had worked for more than 15 years after being classified in 2017 as an “illegal immigrant”, said: “It hit my heart in a bad way. There were a lot of very positive recommendations in that report, but they seem to be watering and watering them down. We feel like we have been put on the backburner, as the government drags its heels on this.” Braithwaite arrived with his family from Barbados in 1961, aged eight, and was wrongly accused of being an immigration offender after 50 years in the UK. “It makes me sad to think of the Windrush generation people who have died before getting justice. There are at least 21 of them. Some people feel really beaten by this,” he said. Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said it was “very worrying” that the government was reportedly planning not to take forward the recommendations around the migrants commissioner or the recommendations about the extension of the powers of the independent inspector of borders and immigration. She pointed out that David Neal, the immigration inspector, was the only inspector in government who could not publish his reports without the permission of the Home Office. Johnson asked: “Can the minister just confirm today that the particular recommendations around the independent inspector of borders and immigration will be taken forward quickly by the government?” Dines shook her head and replied: “Let’s wait a modest amount of time to see what the government actually does. We must judge the government’s record on delivery. Not on speculation in the Guardian.” The SNP MP Stuart McDonald asked the minister to confirm that there would be a migrants’ commissioner and when that would be. Dines said: “That’s an issue which I’ll have to write back to you in relation to the timings. But … I can reassure you there is a huge commitment here.” A source later confirmed that she was referring to a “huge commitment” to the Windrush generation. The shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock described the government’s treatment of the Windrush generation as “surely one of the most shameful episodes in our postwar political history”. “Will the minister tell me today, given that Wendy Williams is saying that only eight of the recommendations have been implemented, how many of the Williams recommendations have been implemented?” he said. Dines replied: “He knows that the government does not comment in relation to leaks, but what I can say is that we have matched the scale of Wendy’s challenge with the scale of our ambition and delivery.” In a further development, Floella Benjamin, the chair of the Windrush commemoration committee, has written to Rishi Sunak saying that any move to drop promises made in the aftermath of the scandal would be “wicked, vindictive and heartless”. Referring to the Guardian report, she said the government had a responsibility to honour and commemorate the role of the Windrush generation, 75 years after the arrival of the ship bearing the same name. “If what I am hearing is true, that the now home secretary has decided to renege on those promises, it will be seen as disrespectful to the Windrush community, especially in this important year, as well as being wicked, vindictive and heartless. “I was pleased to hear you say in your address when you were elected prime minister, a day of historic relevance, that you wanted to govern with trust and integrity. If this is the case, I hope you and your ministers will review any decision to abandon any ideas of not fulfilling the Wendy Williams’ recommendations,” she said. The Express also reported on Saturday that Braverman was planning to scrap a promise by Theresa May to create a commissioner for migrants who would act as a champion for migrants coming to the UK.
The Conservative MP for Bassetlaw, Brendan Clarke-Smith, told the newspaper Braverman was right to distance herself from some of Williams’ recommendations. “Windrush stuff and general policy on migration shouldn’t be confused and she’s right to distance herself from it,” he reportedly said.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/government-avoids-questions-on-whether-it-will-ditch-windrush-reforms;guardian;politics;4308
3829;3829;Godfrey Bradman obituary;2023-01-12T21:07:27Z;['Martin Adeney'];['Construction industry', 'London', 'UK news', 'Cities', 'Business'];;"Among the property developers who transformed the City of London in the 1970s and 80s, Godfrey Bradman, who has died aged 86, was regarded with such reverence by his contemporaries that they even abbreviated his first name to “God”. One of the reasons he was held in such high esteem was his pioneering development of the old Broad Street station, which he masterminded with Sir Stuart Lipton, his partner in the business Rosehaugh Stanhope. The project broke new ground in the UK property market, and was of a standard and size that persuaded banks to remain in the City, stemming their migration to Canary Wharf and providing them with the large dealing rooms they required. To the fertile mind of Bradman, who started his career in the arcane world of tax accountancy, the complex work to assemble the site and navigate the legal and commercial complexities of introducing into Britain the American system of shell and core construction, whereby the developer provided the shell and the tenant specified how it should be fitted out, were meat and drink. Among the London schemes in which he had at some time an interest were King’s Cross, Battersea power station, Paddington Basin and Elephant and Castle.
Shortly before it collapsed under huge debts, Bradman resigned from his Rosehaugh company in 1992, and never hit the heights again. Nonetheless, his property interests were estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be about £120m in 2008. Born in London, Godfrey was the son of Anne (nee Goldsweig) and William Bradman. His father kept a shop in Willesden, but they moved to Long Melford in Suffolk during the second world war. At the age of 15 he left Sudbury secondary modern school and took a correspondence course in chartered accountancy. He became a highly successful adviser to companies such as Wimpey, for whom he reputedly saved £18m on their tax bill, and had the Inland Revenue scrambling to block loopholes he had identified. In 1978, after continual conflict with the Inland Revenue, which, he said, agreed not to prosecute him if he ceased to practise, he decided to develop property. He bought a tea company, Rosehaugh, as a shell, and set off to buy buildings in London. His first acquisition, a Tottenham Court Road office block, quickly established his reputation.
Short of the cash to buy it, he spotted an offer of a £1m sweetener for anyone who rented another building, used that money to secure his purchase, and eventually sold at a profit. At one point in talks about marketing the newly acquired building, he became so tired of a long-drawn-out discussion about a sales brochure that he ostentatiously took out a wad of £10 notes and dropped them one by one into the wastepaper basket to illustrate that time was money. Not long afterwards, Bradman turned his attention to the retail chain Woolworths, which, by his calculation, owned UK properties worth four times the value of the actual company. Lacking resources for his own bid, he received share options worth £20m for bringing that information to Charterhouse Bank and helping it in a successful takeover. Further lucrative deals led to the Broadgate scheme with Lipton’s Stanhope company, Lipton acting as developer and Bradman as finance arranger. Apart from making both men a great deal of money, it also generated £500m for British Rail from the sale of its land. There were, however, disagreements between Bradman and Lipton. Bradman was obsessive and idiosyncratic: a visionary but, as one partner put it, just too clever by half. He seemed to thrive on complication, and the many schemes he took on, often inadequately supervised, eventually brought Rosehaugh down when the market collapsed in the early 90s. A workaholic, Bradman had a team of five secretaries, including one who worked through the night. He scrutinised the smallest detail, even checking the size of paperclips on important paperwork. Electrical equipment in his office was labelled with details of replacement or battery expiry dates. He acquired his own taxi in order to use bus lanes to save time.
He also loved the expansive gesture: at great expense he spent £10,000 on a special edition of the Superman comic, Superman Bradman, for his son’s barmitzvah, and in 1974 he persuaded fellow businessmen to offer £2.4m in a bizarre attempt to persuade the striking miners to return to work. He met his wife, Susan Bennett, when she was standing at a bus stop with a heavy suitcase and he offered her a lift in his Bentley. He was known to pick up homeless men and take them home for a wash and change of clothes, on one occasion to Claridge’s. Close colleagues spoke of his personal kindness and sense of humour, but as one put it, “he could be difficult if he didn’t agree. He would debate for hours and days. He didn’t compromise.” A 1988 contract with British Rail for the major prize of King’s Cross, for which two skyscrapers by Norman Foster were proposed, was ended over disagreements about the use of the site. A determined political campaigner, he backed the successful 1982 campaign to phase out leaded petrol, founded Parents Against Tobacco, and chaired and funded the Friends of the Earth Trust. He pledged £2m to the campaign to compensate UK victims of the Opren drug, and his presidency of the Campaign for Freedom of Information arose out of concerns about the lack of public information on health and environmental issues; he was a vegetarian, non-smoking teetotaller. As president of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, he arranged for plastic models of foetuses to be sent to MPs when abortion laws were debated in parliament. Although he never delivered a project of Broadgate’s scale again, Bradman’s sharp brain continued to identify opportunities that led to successful developments by others, including Bluewater in Kent and Paddington Basin and White City in London. But he was not an easy man to work with. In 2002, two years after becoming the London borough of Southwark’s partner for the redevelopment of Elephant and Castle, he walked away from the project. He is survived by Susan, whom he married in 1975, by their twin daughters, Kate and Camilla, a son, Daniel, and two children, Christian and Sophie, from Susan’s previous marriage. • Godfrey Michael Bradman, property developer, born 9 September 1936; died 25 December 2022 • This article was amended on 9 February 2023.

2019;2019;Long NHS waiting lists cutting chances of pregnancy, fertility chief warns;2023-01-22T07:00:29Z;['Rosie Taylor'];['NHS', 'Fertility problems', 'IVF', 'Hospitals', 'Health', 'Pregnancy'];;Prospective parents’ chances of having a baby are being affected by long NHS waiting lists for women’s health treatments, the UK’s fertility chief has warned. Julia Chain, chair of UK fertility regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said delays to women getting diagnoses and treatments for gynaecological issues were preventing them from starting IVF quickly, which meant it was less likely to work. Research shows success rates reduce the later in life a woman starts fertility treatment. Around a third of IVF cycles in women under 35 lead to the birth of a baby, compared with a quarter in women aged 35 to 37, and a fifth in women aged 38 to 39, HFEA figures show. “We know that, post-pandemic, with NHS waiting lists growing ever longer, many patients who might require interventions before they can start [fertility] treatment might be hugely disadvantaged if they have a long wait,” Chain said. “It means they’re older when they start fertility treatment. The chance of a successful birth decreases with a woman’s age, so time really is of the essence.” Gynaecology waiting times in England have trebled in the last decade and are growing at a faster rate than most other areas of healthcare, with women now waiting an average of four months for a first hospital appointment. Chain, speaking at the Progress Educational Trust (PET) annual conference, said healthcare services often put treatments women needed before starting IVF – such as the removal of fibroids (non-cancerous growths in the womb) – on the “back burner” because they were not life-threatening. She warned of a “hidden cost” to failing to deal with such problems swiftly because delays to starting IVF often mean couples need more cycles, which ultimately cost the NHS more. Antonia Harrison, 32, a doctor from Leeds, was referred in March last year for diagnostic tests to find out why she and her husband Chris, 35, were struggling to conceive. In June, she called the hospital and was told the waiting time was 52 weeks – with more than 950 patients in the queue ahead of her. “Every month counts when you are trying for a baby. I was expecting to have to wait but I never imagined it would be so long,” Harrison said. Feeling they had no other choice, she called back on a private healthcare number, and the same receptionist booked her in to see the same consultant two weeks later. The couple paid £1,100 for appointments and tests, which took around four months to complete, and were able to start NHS-funded fertility treatment two months after that. “Once we had the tests, there was no problem – but there is such a blockage to getting those initial investigations that it feels like you can’t even get on the waiting list,” Harrison said. “We were in a fortunate position to be able to pay, but it’s sad and frustrating that it’s only an option for those who can afford it.” The delays can also prove costly to couples because NHS funding for IVF is dependent on a woman’s age. Although national guidelines say eligible patients under 43 should be funded, some areas do not offer NHS IVF to women over 35. Without NHS support, many couples cannot afford fertility treatment and are unable to start a family, Chain said. Sarah Norcross, director of PET, said: “Fertility treatments may not be ‘urgent’ in the official language of the health service but, as far as patients are concerned, such treatments are a matter of considerable urgency.” An NHS spokesperson said: “NHS staff are working flat out to bring down Covid backlogs while also contending with record levels of pressure. The latest data shows the waiting list went down for the first time since the start of the pandemic, so it’s vital women continue to come forward for care when they need it.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/22/long-nhs-waiting-lists-cutting-chances-of-pregnancy-fertility-chief-warns;guardian;health;2019
878;878;British Steel and Tata told to protect jobs until 2033 to unlock £600m funding;2023-01-27T13:45:42Z;['Alex Lawson'];['Steel industry', 'British Steel', 'Tata', 'Grant Shapps', 'Business', 'UK news'];;The two largest steelmakers in Britain will have to protect thousands of jobs for a decade to unlock a promised £600m in state funding for their plans to decarbonise, it has emerged. The business secretary, Grant Shapps, has told British Steel and Tata Steel that they must guarantee a certain number of UK jobs until 2033 as part of an agreement to land £300m each in government aid. British Steel employs about 4,000 people across its operations, which include its steelmaking plant in Scunthorpe, and India’s Tata employs 3,500 people at its vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Sources told Sky News, which first reported the job protection demand, that the number of roles that would need to be guaranteed has not been agreed and are subject to further discussions with officials. A six-month moratorium on redundancies may also be stipulated in return for the taxpayer funding. Ministers are in talks with the two steel firms over their plans to replace huge blastfurnaces with electric arc furnaces to cut their carbon footprint. It emerged a week ago that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was ready to approve a £300m financial support package for British Steel designed to cut its carbon footprint and avoid thousands of jobs being lost. A few days later it was confirmed that Tata was negotiating over a similar offer. British Steel was bought out of liquidation in March 2020 by the Chinese group Jingye. It is understood government funding is contingent on Jingye committing to retaining jobs and investing at least £1bn in British Steel by 2030, with Tata expected to be required to make an equivalent commitment. Talks between the steelmakers and ministers have dragged on for months, with negotiations between the government and British Steel starting in October, led by the then business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg. In a letter to Hunt sent last month laying out the requirements of any aid package for British Steel, Shapps and the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, estimated that closing both blastfurnaces at Scunthorpe could cost the region £360m to £640m, as well as up to £1bn in extra costs to the government in decommissioning and other liabilities. Tata made a £1.5bn demand for government subsidies last summer. Tata Steel UK (TSUK) reported its first annual profit since 2009 last financial year and employs about 8,000 people in total across the country. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Tata Steel have been contacted for comment.

5749;5749;Third of world economy to hit recession in 2023, IMF head warns;2023-01-02T04:22:14Z;['N/A'];['International Monetary Fund (IMF)', 'Global economy', 'World news', 'Economics', 'China', 'US economy', 'Business'];;"For much of the global economy, 2023 is going to be a tough year as the main engines of global growth – the US, Europe and China – all experience weakening activity, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. The new year is going to be “tougher than the year we leave behind,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on the CBS Sunday morning news program Face the Nation on Sunday. “Why? Because the three big economies – the US, EU and China – are all slowing down simultaneously,” she said. “We expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession. Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,” she added.
In October, the IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023, reflecting the continuing drag from the war in Ukraine as well as inflation pressures and the high interest rates engineered by central banks like the US Federal Reserve aimed at bringing those price pressures to heel. Georgieva said that China, the world’s second-largest economy, is likely to grow at or below global growth for the first time in 40 years as Covid-19 cases surge following the dismantling of its ultra-strict zero-Covid policy. “For the first time in 40 years, China’s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,” Georgieva said.
Moreover, a “bushfire” of expected Covid infections there in the months ahead are likely to further hit its economy and drag on both regional and global growth, said Georgieva, who traveled to China on IMF business late last month. “For the next couple of months, it would be tough for China, and the impact on Chinese growth would be negative, the impact on the region will be negative, the impact on global growth will be negative,” she said.
Meanwhile, Georgieva said, the US economy is standing apart and may avoid the outright contraction that is likely to afflict as much as a third of the world’s economies. The “US is most resilient,” she said, and it “may avoid recession. We see the labour market remaining quite strong.” “This is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,” Georgieva said. The US job market will be a central focus for Federal Reserve officials who would like to see demand for labour slacken to help undercut price pressures. The first week of the new year brings a raft of key data on the employment front, including Friday’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the US economy minted another 200,000 jobs in December and the jobless rate remained at 3.7% – near the lowest since the 1960s.

If Ukraine is to mount a spring offensive they will ""desperately need tanks"", retired Air Vice-Marshal Sean Bell has said.

Following the announcement that the UK was set to provide Ukraine with the Challenger 2 tank, Bell told Sky News that if Ukraine was to prevail in this war it would ""need to get onto the offense"".

He said: ""There's been much talk about a spring offensive but if that is to work they desperately need tanks.

""They have a lot of tanks but they are all former Soviet Union tanks which are relatively vulnerable particularly if they are going to go on the attack against Russia.""

Bell went on to say: ""The challenger is a German tank and the Germans therefore hold the licensing. They will only agree to people exporting it.

""So by the UK taking initiative, it means Germany potentially will follow suit.""

However the military expert also said that challenge with the tanks would be that it would take a ""long time"" to train people on them.

""If they want to mount this spring offensive they need to get moving with these deployments,"" he added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230115043159/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-death-roll-rises-and-dozens-still-missing-after-russian-missile-attack-on-dnipro-flats-12541713;skynews;politics;1388

315;315;‘Doppelganger murder’: German prosecutors claim woman killed lookalike to fake death;2023-01-30T14:39:20Z;['Philip Oltermann'];['Germany', 'Europe', 'World news'];;A 23-year-old German-Iraqi woman sought out a lookalike on Instagram and murdered her with a friend in order to fake her own death, prosecutors in Bavaria believe. When the blood-covered body of a young woman was found last August in a parked Mercedes in Ingolstadt, southern Germany, reports initially identified the victim as Sharaban K, a Munich-based 23-year-old beautician with Iraqi roots. Even though some members of Sharaban K’s family had identified the body, an autopsy report the next day raised questions over its identity. The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger from Heilbronn in the neighbouring state of Baden-Württemberg, also 23. With long black straight hair, a similar complexion and heavy makeup, the two women looked “strikingly alike”, police said, leading the German press to refer to the case as the “doppelganger murder”. Along with a 23-year-old Kosovan, named as Sheqir K, Sharaban K was detained on remand by Bavarian police on 19 August 2022, though authorities did not publicly speculate about a motive until this week. The victims and accused have been referred to by their first names and an initial as is customary in the German legal system. “Investigations have led us to assume that the accused wanted to go into hiding because of a family dispute and fake her own death to that effect,” Veronika Grieser of the Ingolstadt state prosecutor’s office said on Monday morning. Police say several women bearing her resemblance had been contacted by Sharaban K, operating on social media sites under numerous aliases, in the week before the murder. “By making various promises she tried to bring about meetings, which was initially unsuccessful,” Grieser said. But Khadidja O had agreed to meet, lured by what Süddeutsche Zeitung reported to be a cosmetics offer. By car, Sheqir K and Sharaban K allegedly picked her up from her apartment on the day of the murder. In a stretch of woodland between Heilbronn and Ingolstadt the accused pair are alleged to have made up a pretext for the Algerian woman to step outside the vehicle and stabbed her to death. “The crime weapon has not been found, but the evidence is overwhelming,” a police spokesperson, Andreas Aichele, told the tabloid Bild. “The victim was killed with over 50 thrusts of the knife, the face completely disfigured.” Prosecutors allege the pair then lifted the victim on the backseat of their Mercedes and drove to Ingolstadt, parking the car in a quiet residential area by the banks of the Danube, where it was discovered by Sharaban K’s parents shortly before midnight on 16 August 2022. Though investigations were ongoing and further witnesses were still to be interviewed, arrest warrants against Sheqir K and Sharaban K were issued on 26 and 27 January, the spokesperson for the Ingolstadt prosecutor said. The pair face life sentences if convicted. “You don’t get a case like this every day, especially with such a spectacular twist,” Aichele told Bild. “On the day we found the body there was nothing to prepare us for this development.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/30/doppelganger-murder-ingolstadt-german-prosecutors-allege-woman-killed-lookalike-to-fake-death;guardian;entertainment & culture;315
559;559;M Degas Steps Out: An Essay by Philip Hoy review – an artistic encounter across a century;2023-01-29T11:00:48Z;['Matthew Reisz'];['Essays', 'Edgar Degas', 'Paris', 'France', 'Books', 'Culture'];;"Bianca Stigter’s recent documentary Three Minutes: A Lengthening is based on a short home movie taken by an American tourist in the Polish town of Nasielsk in 1938. The same section of film appears again and again, accompanied by commentary and testimonies, slowed down, zoomed in on and freeze-framed. Yet these everyday images of Jewish life acquire an extraordinary poignancy because we know that almost everyone on screen will soon be caught up and killed in the Holocaust. Something of the same spirit pervades Philip Hoy’s striking essay-length book M Degas Steps Out. When he went to an exhibition about Edgar Degas in 2011, he became “totally mesmerised” by a nine-second film clip of the ageing painter walking down a Paris street. So he downloaded it on to his computer, slowed it down and broke it up into 250 stills, 42 of which are included here. Just before the screen fades to black, we witness what he describes as a “beatific” moment as a passing young woman turns towards us, “we register how beautiful she is” and she “positively beams at [the camera], and in so doing beams at us as well” – and “the more than one hundred years which separate us are wholly annulled”. By subjecting this tiny sequence to intense analysis, Hoy shows how it reflects a tragic turning point in French life. Early in the first world war, the actor and playwright Sacha Guitry put together a short propaganda film showcasing leading figures in French culture. Friends such as Sarah Bernhardt and Claude Monet were happy to perform for the camera, but when Degas grumpily spurned his approaches Guitry was obliged to film him surreptitiously.
When we realise we are looking at wartime Paris, Hoy suggests, we start to notice the absences. The city has been “feminised”, with more women than men out and about. Only a soldier and one other man appear to be of military age. And the once busy streets are now empty of traffic, since most vehicles were requisitioned by the army. But what about the unknown figures glimpsed momentarily and then lost for ever? Could the soldier be one of the tiny minority stationed in Paris or granted a short period of leave – and was he among the 1.4 million French people who perished in the war? Could the four women in ankle-length outfits be entertainers, Hoy wonders, or perhaps some of the city’s 6,000 registered sex workers coming home from “Leave Land”, near the Gare du Nord, which, according to one historian, would shortly witness “an explosion in open-air sex”? Why is the gawping young man on a triporteur or delivery tricycle not away at the front? And what, if anything, can we read into an ephemeral glance? Although he has clearly read widely on the social history of Paris, Hoy admits that much of his essay amounts to “idle speculation” but he has certainly woven a beguiling tapestry around it. • M Degas Steps Out: An Essay by Philip Hoy is published by Waywiser (£14.99).

Gary Lineker, the host, later said in a tweet that the moaning noises came from a hidden mobile phone which had been “taped to the back of the set” in the studio looking out over the pitch at Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Molineux stadium. The embarrassing incident occurred before kick-off in the third round replay fixture between Wolves and Liverpool on Tuesday night. As Lineker previewed the tie with pundits Paul Ince and Danny Murphy, the audible noises broke out in the background.
The presenter looked momentarily startled by the prank and struggled to keep a straight face as he cut to colleague and fellow former England striker Alan Shearer in the commentary gantry. Lineker tried to laugh off the incident as the noise continued to blare out and said to Shearer: “Somebody’s sending something on someone’s phone, I think. I don’t know whether you heard it at home.”
Minutes into the first half of the match, Lineker tweeted a photograph of the phone, commenting: “Well, we found this taped to the back of the set. As sabotage goes it was quite amusing.” A BBC spokesperson tweeted: “We apologise to any viewers offended during the live coverage of the football this evening. We are investigating how this happened.” Liverpool won 1-0, having scored the only goal of the game in the first half. During the half-time analysis, Lineker said to Ince and Murphy: “Harvey Elliott’s goal was a screamer … which was not the only one we’ve had tonight.” The stunt was picked up on by viewers as the incident was clipped and widely shared on social media. Daniel Jarvis, a self-styled YouTube prankster, claimed he was behind the stunt, posting a video on Twitter that seemed to show him at the TV studio at Molineux.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/17/bbc-apologises-for-porn-prank-during-gary-linekers-fa-cup-football-coverage;guardian;sports;2891
7899;7899;Ukraine war: Russian train collected weapons from North Korea for Wagner mercenaries, US says;Friday 20 January 2023 23:12, UK;[];['north korea', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['train', 'house', 'collected', 'group', 'weapons', 'kirby', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'wagner', 'korea', 'white', 'north', 'russian', 'war', 'mercenaries'];"The US says North Korea will continue supplying weapons to Wagner Group mercenaries in Ukraine - as it released an image it said showed a shipment of rockets and missiles being collected.

North Korea has previously denied the claims as has Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin, who last month called it ""gossip and speculation"".

The White House said the satellite image was taken on 18 November and showed a Russian train travelling to North Korea to collect the arms.

Ukraine war latest: West fails to make decision on sending tanks to Ukraine

""On November 19, North Korea loaded the railcars with shipping containers, and the train returned to Russia,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.

""While we assess that the amount of material delivered to Wagner has not changed battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, we expect that it will continue to receive North Korean weapons systems,"" he said.

Tougher sanctions will also be imposed against the Wagner Group and its global support network next week when the US declares it an Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO), Mr Kirby added.

This will freeze any assets it has in the US and ban Americans from providing funds, goods, or services.

Mr Kirby said: ""With these actions, and more to come, our message to any company that is considering providing support to Wagner is this - Wagner is a criminal organisation that is committing widespread atrocities and human rights abuses, and we will work relentlessly to identify, disrupt, expose, and target those assisting Wagner.""

He estimated that the private security company has about 50,000 personnel fighting alongside Russia troops in Ukraine - 40,000 of them convicts signed up from Russian prisons.

It has been particularly active in the fighting in Bakhmut and Soledar in eastern Ukraine and the White House is growing increasingly concerned about its involvement.

Russia's defence ministry also has reservations about Wagner's recruitment strategy but the US believes it will continue to recruit prisoners, Mr Kirby added.

7179;7179;Royal Mail cyber attack carried out by Russian-linked ransomware gang;Friday 13 January 2023 14:11, UK;[];['royal mail'];['lockbit', 'postal', 'carried', 'ransomware', 'royal', 'russia', 'ransom', 'gang', 'attack', 'mail', 'parcels', 'russianlinked', 'cyber'];"A ransomware gang linked to Russia carried out the Royal Mail cyber attack that suspended international postal deliveries.

It is understood that Royal Mail's investigation found the gang, named Lockbit, infected machines that print customs labels for parcels being sent overseas. The attack has left more than half a million parcels and letters stuck in limbo.

Lockbit's signature ransomware, known as Lockbit Black, scrambles computer files and demands payment in cryptocurrencies that are hard to trace in exchange for unscrambling them.

The ransom note, seen by The Telegraph, says: ""Lockbit Black Ransomware. Your data are [sic] stolen and encrypted.

""You can contact us and decrypt one file for free.""

The gang also threatened to publish stolen data on the dark web.

Printers at a Northern Irish Royal Mail distribution centre reportedly began ""spurting"" out copies of the ransom note - a signature tactic of the gang.

Staff at the centre in Mallusk, Country Antrim, reported the incident on Tuesday, according to the Belfast Telegraph.

Royal Mail declined to comment, but said on Wednesday: ""We have asked customers temporarily to stop submitting any export items into the network while we work hard to resolve the issue.""

The National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of GCHQ, is helping the postal service remove the malicious software.

The National Crime Agency has also started an investigation.

Lockbit is believed to have extorted an estimated £82m from previous victims, which have included children's hospitals and UK car dealership chain Pendragon.

The gang is also understood to have close links with Russia. A member of the cyber gang wrote in a blog post last year: ""We benefit from the hostile attitude of the West (towards Russia). It allows us to conduct such an aggressive business and operate freely within the borders of the former Soviet (CIS) countries.""

Russian authorities have been slow to act against ransomware suspects wanted internationally.

Just one alleged Lockbit member has been charged with taking part in cyber attacks - separate to the Royal Mail attack - by US authorities.

Mikhail Vasiliev, 33, from Ontario, Canada is alleged to have conspired to intentionally damage protected computers and send ransom demands, according to prosecutors.

The charges carry a maximum five-year prison sentence. Mr Vasiliev, a dual Russian-Canadian citizen, is currently awaiting extradition from Canada.

2882;2882;Legal experts call for new UK offence of inducing sexual activity by deception;2023-01-18T00:01:30Z;['Haroon Siddique'];['Crime', 'Law', 'UK news', 'Rape and sexual assault'];;A new criminal offence of intentionally deceiving a person into engaging in sexual activity should be created to address confusion in the law around consent, legal experts and lawyers have said. The new offence of inducing sexual activity by deception would cover both making of false representations as well as failing to disclose information. As such, it would potentially apply in future to cases such as those involving “spy cops”, in which undercover police officers adopted fake personas and conducted sexual affairs with female activists. In another example cited in the report by the Criminal Law Reform Now Network, based at Birmingham University, a man who lied to his sexual partner that he had had a vasectomy had his rape conviction overturned on appeal after judges ruled that she was not deceived as to the “sexual intercourse itself” but only as to the “broad circumstances’” surrounding it. They determined this did not undermine consent. Members of the CRLN Network say courts struggle to say which deceptions have the effect of nullifying the supposed consent of the victim and which do not, meaning there is an urgent need for reform. Its “straightforward” solution is for a bespoke offence. John Child, co-director at the CLRN Network and professor of criminal law at the University of Birmingham, said: “It would have to be something where you’re deceiving somebody and the intention is to induce a sexual activity by that deception. But not only that, you have to know as the defendant that what you’re saying is important to that other party. “So if it’s just part of your sort of chat-up lines, that’s one thing but if you know, for example, the person is wearing, let’s say, religious dress and so it becomes obvious that your religion will will be very important to them, then acts of deception as to that aspect is much more likely of course to then lead to the offence being committed.” The CRLN Network has fully drafted the new offence, which it proposes should be added to the existing Sexual Offences Act 2003 and carry a maximum jail term of 10 years. Child said the team of experts decided against drawing up a list of exemptions for certain kinds of deception they struggled to see who had the right to make such a list and on what basis. However, the report, published on Wednesday, states that “we should not assume that all deceptions would lead inexorably to liability”, citing the example of “exaggeration or flattery which might be common in flirtatious interaction”. Additionally, as well as the requirement for the accused to know that the deception would be important to the other party, it also provides them with a “reasonable excuse” exemption. Child said: “This is a lesson we’re trying to get across to young men in particular, of different ages and I think a sort of headline new offence, which really focuses on this idea there are there are unacceptable limits of deception when trying to induce someone to have sex, is a sensible conversation to be having.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Courts already consider all relevant factors which could affect whether consent was given but we keep sexual offence legislation under constant review to ensure the public is protected.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/18/legal-experts-call-for-new-uk-offence-of-inducing-sexual-activity-by-deception;guardian;politics;2882

2096;2096;Upsize, downsize? Why the Covid property race for space went sour for homebuyers;2023-01-21T16:00:11Z;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Housing market', 'Property', 'Mortgage rates', 'Business', 'Money', 'Mortgages', 'Real estate', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'UK news'];;"In the summer of 2020, when British society emerged from months of Covid lockdown, the UK housing market reopened and began booming, amid fierce demand for larger homes as buyers sought more space, better home working environments or a garden. Fuelled by ultra-low interest rates and then-chancellor Rishi Sunak’s stamp duty holiday, the numbers of homeowners moving to new properties began to rise sharply from June 2020, and by August mortgage approvals had jumped to their highest level since October 2007. In March 2021, the number of completed loans for house purchases formovers was 142% higher than a year earlier, according to UK Finance, and by May the average UK house price had risen 10.2% in 12 months. Fast forward to today and the situation has changed dramatically: in December the average UK house price fell for the fourth month in a row, with experts expecting a further slowdown in a struggling economy. Bank of England policymakers have raised interest rates nine times in the past year and are forecast to do so again when they next meet. Borrowers re-fixing their mortgages are among those hit hardest in the cost of living crisis.
A number of homeowners who moved to a bigger property during the pandemic have spoken to the Observer about how their larger homes have turned into financial burdens. Claire and her husband James, who did not want to give their full names, upsized from their three-bedroom mid-terrace former council house in central Hertfordshire to a £600,000 five-bed in a Cambridgeshire town in spring 2021, in the belief that mortgage rates would remain low. “We stretched our budget to move to our dream house. Monthly payments have just increased by £370, after we rushed to re-fix for five years at just under 4% in November,” Claire says. The couple, who have two children, have a household income of just over £60,000, and do not qualify for any government help apart from the £400 energy grant. They hope that meticulous budgeting will enable them to keep the house, but worry they may not succeed. Downsizing right now would, the couple is acutely aware, come with enormous penalties and costs, such as stamp duty, but every time they talk about it “it becomes a bit less of a joke”, says James, a middle manager in a tech company who currently works mostly from home. He also fears being asked to return full-time to the office. “If I would have to do the 80-minute one-way commute to work in Hertfordshire again, just the fuel costs would blow us financially out of the water. “When we bought, it was inconceivable to me that interest rates would be going up this much. I’m not sure we’d be able to weather another big financial change. Retrospectively, I feel it was quite irresponsible for the bank to lend us this much, and I know they would have lent us more.”
After having a second child in 2020 and spending a lot of time together working from home and home schooling during Covid lockdowns, Barbara and her husband, John, decided that their three-bedroom house was becoming “claustrophobic”, and upsized to a period property twice the size in central Plymouth. “It was a step up the ladder, we weren’t overstretching ourselves with our new mortgage and we had some money put aside to renovate the house,” Barbara says. “Then came the cost of living crisis, higher energy bills and our nursery fees rose to over £900 a month. We cut back on everything, but when Trussonomics tanked the pound, we knew what it meant for our mortgage renewal. “We came to the awful conclusion that the only way to avoid financially struggling in future was to sell our home before we got into trouble. “We both have well-paid academic jobs – 10 years ago we had a far more modest income but could still afford to travel, save money, eat out and so on. Our income is higher than ever before but our standard of living has dropped substantially. We watch every penny.” During the Covid buying frenzy, housing price growth reached its highest rate in more than a decade, while prices of houses grew more quickly than prices of flats across all UK regions. A Bank of England report suggests homebuyers’ preference for houses over flats was associated with about 38% of the housing price increase between 2020 and 2021, and probably the most important factor in the boom. Halifax now predicts house prices will fall by about 8% this year. The number of inquiries from potential homebuyers fell for a fifth month in a row in September, while sales dropped to the lowest level since May 2020. Barbara and John put their home on the market last month, and have already had to reduce the price. “We are likely now to make a loss upon sale. We are so angry and upset with the government that we have ended up here.” For others, upsizing was motivated not primarily by a quest for more space but by the idea that buying a house would be a good investment. Amy, 35, an analyst from London who lives on her own, traded her one-bedroom flat for a £475,000 three-bedroom house in January 2021.
Feeling that the high service charges in her previous flat were a waste of money, she made more than 20 offers on houses, but kept getting outbid by £50,000 to £75,000. “I had to go over budget to get this house, by a lot,” Amy says. “But mortgage rates were really good when I bought, I was able to borrow £285,000 at 1.2%.” When she had to re-fix her mortgage in December last year, however, her monthly payments rose by £397, from £844 to £1,241, thanks to a new rate of 4.74%. “I’m considering moving to a smaller property somewhere cheaper,” Amy says. “I looked at a couple of flats in Stratford [in east London], but their service charges were even higher than in my previous flat, £5,000 to £6,000 annually. “I’m also apprehensive, as house prices have not risen as much as they could have. But if I could downsize to a property in a cost-effective way, I’d do that. I’d have to.” Adam Fahey, an architect and father of four from Surrey, is one of a several homeowners who told the Observer their finances would not stretch far enough to comfortably absorb significantly higher mortgage rates coupled with the higher cost of living. The family is now downsizing to a property worth just over half the value of their current home. “We have just accepted an offer on our home for £1.4m and had our offer on a new home in West Sussex accepted, for £750,000. The house we’re moving to is much smaller: we’ll have about 650 sq feet less than in our current house, which is a six-bed with four reception rooms. “We have a £290,000 mortgage we are keen to remove, to reduce financial stress.

8240;8240;Politics news - latest: Tax penalty, law-breaking, conflicts of interest - Rishi Sunak preparing for tough PMQs;;[];['live'];['week', 'mr', 'levelling', 'tough', 'tax', 'ongoing', 'sunak', 'pmqs', 'preparing', 'politics', 'lawbreaking', 'latest', 'wearing', 'zahawi', 'penalty', 'sunaks', 'rishi'];"Tax penalty, law-breaking, conflicts of interest - What Rishi Sunak might be asked at PMQs

A lot has happened since last Wednesday, and the last session of PMQs.

Rishi Sunak's visit to the North of England to show off £2bn of levelling up funding was overshadowed by a video posted to his social media showing him not wearing a seatbelt in a moving vehicle.

This saw him fined by the police for a second time as a senior government minister for breaking the law, following his lockdown penalty.

Then there is the ongoing storm around Nadhim Zahawi and his tax affairs, after it was revealed the Tory Party chair had paid a penalty to HMRC over the matter while chancellor.

Mr Sunak has launched a probe, and is facing questions on whether he believes Mr Zahawi told him the truth.

And there is the issue of BBC chairman Richard Sharp, whose appointment to the role is being questioned after he helped to find a guarantor for a sizeable loan to then-PM Boris Johnson before getting appointed.

Any one of these could provide a soft target for Sir Keir Starmer or the backbenchers who will be asking questions.

There are also the ongoing strikes and the dysfunction of the NHS for Mr Sunak's opponents to pick him apart over.

In response, the PM will likely try and use the aforementioned levelling up funds, and the slight fall in inflation rates reported last week, to defend himself.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125080217/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-tax-penalty-law-breaking-conflicts-of-interest-rishi-sunak-preparing-for-tough-pmqs-12593360;skynews;politics;2331
7107;7107;Boris Johnson is most donated to MP of this parliament after single donation of £1m;Thursday 12 January 2023 22:42, UK;[];['boris johnson', 'westminster accounts'];['prime', 'speeches', 'mps', 'donated', 'boris', 'single', 'johnson', '1m', 'minister', 'mp', 'starmer', 'register', 'second', 'donations', 'parliament', 'donation', 'jobs'];"Boris Johnson has become the number one most donated to MP this parliament after receiving a single donation of one million pounds.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had previously been the most donated to MP with £740,000 in multiple donations, Sky News' Westminster Accounts tool showed.

But the money from Brexiteer and crypto investor Christopher Harborne beat that in a single donation, and suggests the former prime minister has no intention of stepping down from politics any time soon.

Mr Harborne is a former Tory donor who in 2019 was the bankroller of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.

Money from political donations is used to fund things like campaigning, staff, and office costs.

Mr Johnson's 7,210 majority in his west London constituency means he is vulnerable to being unseated by Labour, and allies have claimed he could strike a deal with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak not to challenge his leadership in exchange for a safe seat at the next election.

The register of members' financial interests is where all MPs must declare any donations, wages or gifts.

Mr Johnson also earned £303,880 in speeches in December, according to updates to the register published on Thursday night.

He earned over a quarter of a million - £253,880,90 - from software company ParallelChain Lab for a nine-hour event in Singapore, and £50,000 from property development company the Ballymore Group for a seven-hour speaking engagement in London.

This comes on top of the £1m Mr Johnson has already declared in outside earnings for a handful of speeches since officially stepping down as prime minister in September.

Since then, the former PM has also lived rent free in the home of JCB chairman and Conservative donor Lord Bamford, the register of interest shows.

The new database brings together MPs' second jobs and donations - the first time they have all been collated in one place.

According to our latest analysis of the donations, Boris Johnson now tops the leader board of the most donated to MP, followed by Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Johnson's short-lived successor Liz Truss.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak comes fourth, followed by Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Housing Secretary Michael Gove.

Outside earnings

The database has led to calls for greater transparency of where MPs get their political donations from, after our initial investigation struggled to uncover basic details about who is behind major donations.

It has also thrust the issue of MPs second jobs back into the spotlight.

There have been calls for the rules to be tightened on outside earnings since the Owen Patterson lobbying scandal, which saw Tory MPs attempt to save a colleague who broke lobbing rules from punishment.

All MPs are paid a base salary of £84,144, while prime ministers get an additional £79,936 for a total of £164,080.

However, MPs are allowed to earn extra money through second jobs.

While the vast majority of top earners are Tory MPs, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has also made over £200,000 from outside earnings this parliament.

The updated register reveals income from speeches since November 16 of £32,300 and nearly £5,000 for six radio shows on LBC.

Sir Keir Starmer - who has backed a ban on second jobs with some exceptions - has defended Mr Lammy, suggesting media work is ""part of the political process"".

Some changes into what second jobs MPs can have are due to come into effect later this year, with MPs to be banned from taking on work as political or parliamentary consultants from March.

One source involved in drafting the new rules suggested this could impact the second jobs of around 30 MPs.

But they will not prevent others from earning significant amounts for speeches, TV appearances and legal work.

1703;1703;Poland ups pressure to send German-made tanks to Ukraine;2023-01-23T17:56:13Z;['Jennifer Rankin', 'Philip Oltermann'];['Ukraine', 'Poland', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'World news'];;"Poland has reiterated that it is ready to send tanks to Ukraine without Germany’s consent, as pressure builds on Berlin to supply the heavy weapons that Kyiv has been calling for. The Polish prime minister said his government would seek permission from Berlin to send its German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine, but described that consent as of “secondary importance”. Mateusz Morawiecki said: “Even if we did not get this approval … we would still transfer our tanks together with others to Ukraine.” He added that “the condition for us at the moment is to build at least a small coalition of countries”. Berlin is coming under heavy pressure to release the military hardware after failing to take a decision at a keenly anticipated international defence summit at the US military base of Ramstein in south-west Germany on Friday. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock’s comment on Sunday that her country would not “stand in the way” of Poland sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine has caused some confusion in Berlin. For now, it remains unclear whether her remarks are indicative of a shift in the government’s position or merely a Green party attempt to correct the chancellor Olaf Scholz’s bungled communication strategy. Baerbock did not repeat her comment when pressed on the matter on Monday morning. “It’s important that we as an international community do everything to defend Ukraine, so that Ukraine wins. Because if it loses, Ukraine will cease to exist,” she told the press at a meeting of the EU’s foreign affairs council in Brussels.
Baerbock’s party colleague Robert Habeck, the German minister for economic affairs, had already signalled 10 days ago that his ministry would not block the re-export of Leopard 2 tanks from other European countries to Ukraine. “There’s a difference between making a decision of your own accord and hindering the decision of others,” Habeck said at the time. While the re-export of tanks manufactured in Germany has to be approved by the economic ministry, Habeck’s carte blanche for such decisions has in effect shifted the decision-making process to Scholz’s office. That Scholz really would block Poland’s formal request to supply Kyiv with Leopard 2 tanks from its reserves, made explicit on Monday, is hard to imagine, not least because it would blow up the chancellor’s line that the allies’ position on such matters is more united than media reports have made it sound. On Sunday evening, Germany’s new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, rejected reports of an open disagreement between Washington and Berlin on the battle tank question. “Germany was not isolated,” Pistorius said of last Friday’s meeting at the Ramstein airbase. Poland has said it is ready to send 14 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. In earlier comments, Morawiecki described Germany’s attitude as unacceptable. “I try to weigh my words but I’ll say it bluntly: Ukraine and Europe will win this war – with or without Germany,” he said. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels discussed the question on Monday, but with no immediate breakthrough. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country could supply Ukraine with a couple of Leopard tanks and spare parts, and/or train soldiers in driving and servicing the tanks, but suggested that decision rested on Germany. “We are still in the process of what kind of package will be formed. We hope it’s a position where countries like Germany could participate,” he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s staunchest allies in the Baltic states made clear they wanted Germany to act quickly. “Let me be clear that Germany is an engine of Europe and it creates also a particular responsibility,” said Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu. He said Estonia was spending 1% of national income on military aid for Ukraine and urged others to do the same. “We need to give the Ukrainian people a shield but also a sword to liberate the territory.” His Lithuanian counterpart, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said a “very vibrant debate” was under way in Germany. “I hope that it will be fruitful as it has been in the past, that Germany will send the tanks. Unfortunately, we as the ones who are waiting for them to be sent have to wait one more day.” Recalling Lithuania’s oppression under the Soviet Union, Landsbergis said “we have to defeat fear of defeating Russia”, without naming specific countries. “If we don’t prepare for Russia losing the war then we are not serious about helping Ukraine win,” he said. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said he thought such arms should be provided to the Ukrainian army, but described it as a decision for EU member states. The EU on Monday also ratified a new military aid package to Ukraine worth €500m, as the foreign ministers met in Brussels. The package was approved along with a further €45m for “non-lethal equipment” for the EU’s military training mission for Ukraine, sources told Reuters. Earlier, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said his country would not block the EU move.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/poland-ready-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine-without-german-consent;guardian;politics;1703

After years of painstaking work, they see Monday's decision as a painful step back for a group of people who already face a barrage of societal, emotional and bureaucratic hurdles to live their lives.

Ministers in Westminster, however, believe they had little choice but to block the law.

Politics live: Education secretary speaks to Sky News after thousands of teachers vote to strike

One senior UK government source told me the Holyrood legislation was a ""phenomenal mess"" which could cause problems across the country regarding pensions, benefits, schools and prisons.

A second senior source described it as a ""constitutional nightmare"".

Those involved are keen to point out they followed legal advice and the decision was not ideological but administrative.

UK government officials are confident a majority of Scots are on their side. Private government polling suggests 52% of 2019 SNP voters back the move - and that figure is significantly higher when considering the whole electorate.

Last night's carefully-worded statement from the Scottish secretary is evidence that he realises the sensitivity of this issue.

Alister Jack said that transgender people ""deserve our respect, support and understanding"", that he has ""not taken this decision lightly"" and that he will be ""constructive"" if the Scottish government put forward an amended bill.

Nonetheless, the move is unprecedented: a 'section 35 order' (which will prevent the legislation getting royal assent) has never before been issued in the 25-year history of devolution.

The wider concern in Whitehall is that Nicola Sturgeon's government will use this decision as evidence that Scottish democracy is broken and as a powerful argument to bolster the case for independence.

For Rishi Sunak, a prime minister keen to de-escalate and de-dramatise Scotland's constitutional debate, this move is likely to do the opposite.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230117093223/http://news.sky.com/story/scotland-gender-recognition-reform-bill-uk-move-to-block-legislation-likely-to-escalate-tensions-with-holyrood-12788507;skynews;politics;1554
4120;4120;How have I changed in 2023? I have become an avid pothole activist | Adrian Chiles;2023-01-11T14:34:49Z;['Adrian Chiles'];['Life and style', 'Transport', 'UK news', 'Local government'];;"A member of parliament once told me there wasn’t a friend or foe in the House of Commons who hadn’t at some stage been pictured in a local newspaper looking anxiously at a pothole. I thought about curating a montage of all 650 such photographs and entering this work of art for the Turner prize. But I couldn’t be bothered with doing the legwork to find them all. A quick search now yields a bizarre example of the genre, featuring a happy-looking Theresa May – wearing Converse! – on the Berkshire Live website three years ago. The headline reads: “Former PM Theresa May pictured smiling and relaxed on pothole duty in her Maidenhead constituency”. Well, thanks for taking an interest, Ms May, but may I respectfully suggest that a look of concern rather than happiness might be more appropriate here? I know this is pothole season, what with all the entirely predictable cold and rain and whatnot, but it seems to me there are more of the things than ever before. I accept this might be because of my age. Potholes – like poor grammar, the youthfulness of police officers and lights left on – are, after all, the kind of thing you notice more as you get older. It might also be because I ride a motorbike and hitting one of these things at any speed could result in, you know, death. While I’m anxious not to be an old fart who parps on about the country going to the dogs, I feel very keenly that a country that can’t keep its roads in a half-decent condition has gone to the dogs.
My new year’s resolution is never to moan unless the moan is accompanied by some positive action. But with potholes this is difficult to achieve. Over the holidays, I clocked up hundreds of miles driving between London, Birmingham, Manchester, Yorkshire and South Wales. I did so much tutting at potholes that my tongue hurt. I couldn’t report each and every one – or even, to be honest, one. By the time you’ve passed the hole – or gone over it – if it hasn’t brought your journey to a halt, the moment and precise location have gone. And who’d be interested, anyway? Finally, driving my car on the A4118 on the Gower peninsula, I went over a real beauty and my patience snapped. It measured 70cm by 50cm and was around 6cm deep. It was big enough to accommodate a copy of that day’s Guardian. I know this because, having found a safe place to stop a couple of hundred yards further on, I got my dog out of the back – he needed a wee anyway – and stomped back to the scene of the crime with him. He looked on with solemn bafflement as I stooped, harrumphed, measured and recorded its location, using the What3words geocode system. Is it just me, or are the three words used to identify each spot often tangentially but unsettlingly apt? Here they were fight, skip and frail.
I worked myself up into a lather of virtuous indignation in anticipation of Swansea council’s lack of interest in the information I had gleaned. But I am pleased to report that its website was ready for me, with a nice form that even suggested the submission of the What3words location. I completed it with some relish, sparing the highways department no detail.
My pleasure. There was even a promise to get it sorted within 48 hours. Oh yeah. A likely story. But within 24 hours it was dealt with. Fair play. The bad news for them is that I found half a dozen more on the B4295 between Llanrhidian and Crofty. The dog and I are heading out to log them now. Steve Fowler, editor in chief of Auto Express, tells me that the last time they checked, potholes were causing more than £700m worth of damage every year, and that getting compensation out of anyone is a devil of a business. And, as a peculiar addendum to this, Fowler also suggests that the Converse our former prime minister is sporting in the photograph might not be real ones. All to do with the number of eyelets, or something.

8683;8683;'It saved my life': Rollout of overdose drug urged by campaigners;Sunday 29 January 2023 14:27, UK;['dan whitehead', '@danwnews'];['drugs'];['officers', 'rollout', 'naloxone', 'drugs', 'including', 'campaigners', 'saved', 'services', 'overdose', 'urged', 'medication', 'life', 'health', 'drug', 'social'];"A leading drugs charity is urging the government to speed up the rollout of a ""life-saving"" overdose medication.

The social care organisation Turning Point says access to naloxone must be expanded by allowing all public service workers to carry it to reduce drug-related deaths.

The drug can be administered via nasal spray or syringe to someone who has overdosed on opioids, including heroin, and restores normal breathing.

It is routinely carried by police officers in Scotland, but only trialled by forces in England.

It is more widely available through drug abuse hubs and health services.

A consultation of widening access to naloxone concluded in September 2021 and the Department of Health and Social Care is still considering its findings.

In Somerset, Trevor Watts has been clean of drugs for 10 years and now works as a peer mentor for Turning Point.

He has used naloxone himself, and the charity's hub in Taunton hands out the medication to those who may need it.

He said: ""It saved my life before and I know a lot of people who've died in the past from opioid overdose when it hasn't been available.

""The more of it that gets to the hands of the public - or the right people, the easier it's going to be, the more lives it's going to save.""

Image: Mentor Trevor Watts says naloxone saved his life when he took drugs

Turning Point medical director, Dr David Bremner, told Sky News the drug has the ability to save lives:

He said: ""Every opiate death is a preventable death.

""These are people who have died from a toxic amount of a substance that we can reverse.

""What we need to do is flood the market to get greater rates of carriage and use of naloxone... to ensure police, ambulance staff are carrying naloxone so that if they encounter an overdose they are able to reverse that.

""We've had great success with people carrying it in the community, the police, the ambulance services - but there are far more people that could be carrying naloxone and places that it could be stored.

""Ultimately, I want everyone who is prescribed an opiate to also be given naloxone to take home with them.""

Controversy over drug

The consultation found more than 90% agreed that prison officers, paramedics and others should be able to issue the medication without prescription.

But expanding who carries naloxone is controversial - with some bodies questioning whether such medication should be left to paramedics to administer.

Officers at Durham Constabulary have been able to carry naloxone for two years.

Chief Inspector Jason Meecham told Sky News there is no doubt it saves lives.

He said: ""It is unfamiliar territory for a lot of police forces, and that's totally understandable.

""It gives opportunities to officers who are first at the scene of a potential death to prevent that death from happening.

""It's a simple, safe, effective method of saving life.

""It's not a replacement for ambulance services, it's not a replacement for professional medical attention, it's something to hold onto while we're waiting for those professionals to arrive at the scene.""

The government says it will publish a full response to the consultation later this year.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Naloxone is already widely available from drug services without prescription, including many community pharmacies.

""Every year thousands of takeaway naloxone medication kits are provided to people at risk, their families and friends, and staff working with them in hostels and other locations.

""As part of our 10-year drugs strategy, this year we provided local authorities with an additional £2.2m for making naloxone more available, including through peer networks and the police, helping to save lives from drug overdose.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129143905/https://news.sky.com/story/it-saved-my-life-rollout-of-overdose-drug-urged-by-campaigners-12798101;skynews;entertainment & culture;2774

The fear was expressed in a message sent by Trump’s former communications director to Julie Radford, chief of staff to his daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, on the afternoon of the deadly Capitol riot.
It is part of revelatory exchange between the pair released as supporting evidence by the January 6 House committee that investigated Trump’s efforts to remain in office following his defeat by Joe Biden. The panel published its final report last month accusing the single-term president of a “multi-part conspiracy” to thwart the will of the people and subvert democracy.
According to reporting on Monday by the Hill, Hicks and Radford engaged in an increasingly resigned conversation as the Trump-incited mob overwhelmed security and invaded the Capitol, while Trump himself chose to watch on television and ignore pleas from aides, including Hicks, to call an end to the violence. “In one day he ended every future opportunity that doesn’t include speaking engagements at the local proud boys chapter,” Hicks texted to Radford, in an apparent reference to Trump and the violent rightwing group the Proud Boys. “Yup,” Radford replied. In a further message, Hicks wrote: “And all of us that didn’t have jobs lined up will be perpetually unemployed,” adding that “I’m so mad and upset.” “We all look like domestic terrorists now,” she wrote. “Oh yes I’ve been crying for an hour,” Radford responded. The exchange went on to discuss Alyssa Farah Griffin, Trump’s director of strategic communications who resigned several weeks before the riot after the November 2020 election. Griffin, now a political commentator for CNN and co-host of ABC’s The View, later told reporters she stood down because she “saw where this was heading”. Hicks wrote to Radford: “Not being dramatic, but we are all fucked. Alyssa looks like a genius.” Radford was less complimentary about Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary who became chief of staff to then first lady Melania Trump before resigning abruptly on the day of the riot. Grisham’s resignation was “self-serving”, Radford opined, according to the Hill.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/02/hope-hicks-january-6-domestic-terrorists;guardian;politics;5620

Sky News joined West Midlands Ambulance Service paramedic Danny Thompson and ambulance technician Dan Fiedler for a 12-hour shift.

7am: Elderly couple 'too scared' to call 999

Freezing fog hangs over Coventry as Danny and Dan make sure their radios are charged and vehicle fully stocked before heading out.

It is unusually quiet to begin with, but just before 8am they get their first call.

The patient is an elderly man who has fallen and injured his arm. They switch on the sirens and the blue lights flash as they speed through the fog.

Arriving at the house, they find the patient, 86-year-old Edward, in bed. Norma, his wife, is sitting next to him.

Edward's arm is swollen and purple. It turns out he fell two days ago.

""It said on the television only call if it's a matter of life and death,"" Norma tells Danny.

He tells her to call straight away in future. They're worried patients who need help have been put off calling by the advice given on strike days.

""People are a bit scared to call ambulances because they think they're going to be stuck in corridors or in the back of an ambulance,"" Dan says.

As they prepare to take Edward, who has advanced Parkinson's, to A&E; - they chat.

Dan asks Edward how long he and Norma have been married. ""62 years,"" he says. ""How did you meet?"" Dan asks. ""In the pictures,"" Edward replies.

""He thinks I'm superwoman,"" Norma tells Danny, as she details how they manage without any carers.

But she's relieved to see the paramedics.

""When I rang my heart sank because they stop halfway through and say use www... we're not on world wide web,"" she says. ""I'm not moaning really, it's just that we haven't kept up to date with our technology"".

10am: Woman refuses to 'freeze' in A&E; despite blood clot fear

""Straight in... very unusual,"" Danny remarks as they wheel Edward into the A&E; department in Coventry where he'll have an X-ray to check if his arm is broken.

Back outside in the ambulance, their radio beeps to let them know it's been 12 minutes since they handed Edward over.

That means they're expected to be ready for the next call.

The next stop is an elderly patient whose district nurse fears could have a blood clot in her leg.

When they get to her house, Rosemary is sitting upstairs.

Her daughter explains they went to A&E; a couple of weeks ago and spent hours waiting in a freezing corridor. They don't want to go back.

After doing some tests Danny and Dan believe it's fluid and not a blood clot causing the swelling.

They agree to take her to a same-day emergency care unit at the hospital in Nuneaton.

But on their way a category one call comes in. They're the closest ambulance, so they apologise to Rosemary, switch on blue lights and head in the direction of the call.

A couple of minutes later though, they're told to stand down.

They continue on their way with Rosemary and apologise for the diversion as they leave her at the hospital.

1pm: Seizure and slow heartbeat dealt with in five minutes

They don't even get the chance to finish their lunch before another category one call comes in.

The details indicate that an elderly woman is having a seizure.

Inside the house they quickly establish there's a problem with her heart and it's serious. She's already lost consciousness once.

They wheel her into the ambulance and carry out ECG tests. Her heart rate is dropping, there's a risk it could stop.

Danny calls the hospital in Coventry to tell them to have a team ready.

Machines beep and the patient tells them she's scared.

Danny and Dan work quickly to stabilise her heart rate. Their reassuring tone as they tell her not to worry contrasts with the urgency of the situation.

They get her to A&E; within five minutes. Her heart is still beating, but very slowly.

They're both just relieved that this wasn't one of the days they've been stuck queuing outside hospital.

""The cardiac condition she had can often result in death if it's not caught in time,"" Danny says.

4pm: Good news but it was close

After completing all their paperwork, they finally get a lunch break at about 4.30pm. They can take half an hour, unless a category one call comes in. They head back to base where Dan joins a small group of colleagues.

After 30 minutes, Danny comes to get him. There's another call.

Sirens on, they make their way to a house nearby. They can't be sure the patient doesn't have a blood clot, so they take her to A&E.;

While there they find out the heart patient has had emergency surgery to fit a pacemaker. She's doing well.

It's good news to end the day. But they know it was close.

""Things can't go on as they are,"" Danny says. ""Because we're going to see patients suffering as a result of that.""

Police officers were called by the ambulance service shortly after 5pm on Tuesday after a report that a dog had attacked a child in the back garden of a property in Broadlands, Netherfield.

The child died at the scene shortly after.

Officers remain at the site, where the dog has since been put down.

No one else was hurt in the incident, and the child's family are being supported by specially-trained officers.

No arrests have been made in connection with the investigation.

'Absolutely tragic incident'

Superintendent Matt Bullivant said: ""This is an absolutely tragic incident, in which we believe that a child has been killed after being attacked by a dog.

""Clearly, we are in the very early stages of an investigation, and it would be wrong and unhelpful to speculate as to the exact circumstances of this incident at this point.""

He added: ""I understand how much of an impact this will have on the community and on the wider public, and people can expect to see a large police presence in the area this evening and beyond while our investigation continues.

2983;2983;On our family holidays, we like to dress up as ghouls and scare the life out of each other | Patrick Marlborough;2023-01-17T14:00:18Z;['Patrick Marlborough'];['Family', 'Life and style', 'Family holidays', 'Australian lifestyle'];;"The most important question a newcomer to my family can be asked is not “which footy team do you root for?” or “milk and sugar?” or “beer?” but: “Are you rabbit hunting tonight?” Uninitiated partners, friends and park rangers alike tend not to know how to answer this question, and their confusion is only compounded further when it’s followed up with: “Are you scaring, or are you in the van?” To make my life easier by eliminating what is always a somewhat awkward conversation, I have decided to write this explainer, so that future in-laws can read up on the wild and wacky ways of my family. As mum says at the start of every rabbit hunt: buckle up.
I come from a large family, not unlike rabbits themselves when it comes to reproducing. I have 115 cousins, and we like to hang out and eat and talk shit together. A lot. Our most sacred hangout spot is a former quarantine station turned nature reserve known as Woodman Point Recreation Camp, or “Woodies” for short. For almost 50 years, my family has rented out the brick cottages in this beautiful yet eerie place south of Fremantle, with anywhere between 10 and 20 of us living there over the course of a couple of weeks, and dozens more popping in daily for the seemingly endless cycle of lunch, dinner and ocean dips. The thing about having such a large family is there are always a lot of kids, and kids demand entertainment. That’s why, some time in the early 90s, we began “rabbit hunting”. After dinner, once it grew dark, us kids would pack into my mum’s Mitsubishi van and zip around the camp, down its various dark roads, patchy lawns and abandoned medical facilities, spotting rabbits, which were at that time as plentiful as we were (bonus points if you spotted the owl). In 1996 or so, all but a few of the rabbits died of myxomatosis, which meant our rabbit hunts were suddenly rather barren. Even the owl seemed bored. The whole thing felt pointless. So we came up with a solution. I believe it was my aunties Gwen and Jan who first began what we call “scaring”. Gwenny popped on a witch’s hat and Jan threw a sheet over her head, and both stood on the edge of the bush on the roadside to spook us kids as the van drove by.
Scaring was an immediate hit. Soon, the older cousins were going all out with their costumes (Phil’s toilet paper mummy is the stuff of legend) and coming up with new and innovative ways to terrify the rabbit hunters in the van. Cousin Pete was the first to think to hide in boot and pop up and grab those in the back seat, a move that slotted in perfectly with my mum’s trick of pretending the van had broken down at the mouth of the darkest stretch of road, where she would slyly turn the engine off then tell the youngest that they’d have to get out and push. Mine was the first generation to be scared, and so we were the second generation to take up scaring (something you want in on from around the age of 10 or so). Having been raised, as it were, on a diet of familial mummies, ghosts and witches, while also consuming the postmodern horror films and video games of the late 90s and early 2000s, our brand of scaring was less Wicked Witch of the West and more The Blair Witch Project. In short: us millennials didn’t so much desire to scare our little cousins, but haunt their waking dreams. In the midst of this, of course, is Crazy Clarke.
He is a demonic entity who lives down the creepy side road at the camp’s entrance, wearing a cape made from his victim’s faces. He has stalked the nightmares of every child in my family since I invented him as a means of teasing my younger cousins when I was a nine-year-old boy. Since then, Crazy Clarke has taken on his own folk mythology, with successive decades of sleep deprived children adding to his lore. Tragically, for me, their mothers’ insistence that “Patrick made him up” became “Patrick is Crazy Clarke” somewhere along the line, and I am now burdened with the responsibility of regularly pretending I am possessed by this nefarious tulpa to make sure the children stay on their toes (usually at their mothers’ insistence). We sometimes share the camp with Scouts or church groups, and one time the ranger (who is in on all this by the way) may have been called when a few kids on their pentecostal summer camp saw me lurking like a goblin in the moonlight outside their dorm room. Those in the van often complain of temporary hearing loss from the high-pitched screams, and there has (naturally) been a few bouts of incontinence from minors and elders alike over the years.
Every scarer knows that there’s nothing quite as scary as being the scarer. A certain chill creeps up your spine when you find yourself standing alone in the dark woods waiting an excruciatingly long time for the van to drive by, trying to ignore the fact that you were raised to believe that Crazy Clarke is out there in his cape of faces. Relationships are made or broken by rabbit hunting. You know if your new fling is going to be long term if they “get” what is, as I’ve been told by some, a deeply off-putting ritual. My family is still in awe of my ex, a contemporary dancer, who did a shaking fit into a bend-back crab crawl towards the van, thus cementing their place in rabbit hunting legend forever. Now, I’ve learned from years of explaining this to friends and strangers alike that it can come off as unforgivably deranged and possibly cruel. Is this OK? Is this moral? Who am I to say, and who are you to judge? I’m not here to answer your questions, honestly. I’m just here to ask you: Are you scaring tonight? Or are you in the van? Crazy Clarke awaits your answer … • Patrick Marlborough is a writer and comedian from Fremantle, Western Australia";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/on-our-family-holidays-we-like-to-dress-up-as-ghouls-and-scare-the-life-out-of-each-other;guardian;entertainment & culture;2983
3480;3480;Queensland prisoners stuck on a ‘merry-go-round’ of hepatitis C transmission;2023-01-14T19:00:17Z;['Eden Gillespie'];['Queensland', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Prisons'];;"Queensland prisoners are stuck on a “merry-go-round” of hepatitis C transmission because the government is failing to deliver harm reduction programs needed to eliminate the virus, advocates say. Queensland, along with other Australian states and territories, has committed to the elimination of hepatitis C by 2030, in line with global targets set by the World Health Organization. But community support worker Tegan Nuckey says a lack of funding and delays in programs means organisations are currently chasing their tails trying to stamp out the virus. “We can treat and test for hepatitis C until the cows come home, but we still need to be able to provide … harm reduction education [and] syringe programs,” she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Otherwise, we’re just continuously treating people for hepatitis C who are being reinfected in the prison system.” Hep C is a blood-borne virus that mostly spreads through the use of unsterile or shared needles during intravenous drug use. If left untreated, it can result in liver damage, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Advocates say prisons are a hotbed for hep C transmission, with data showing 20% of inmates in Australia are chronically infected with the virus. In 2021, about 73% of people who were treated for hepatitis C in Queensland were in the state’s prisons. This figure represented 47% of the national total for people who received hepatitis C treatments in a correctional facility. Nuckey said one of her clients was treated for the virus three times in the community after contracting it in prison while sharing syringes.
She said another man was unable to access the state’s opioid substitution treatment program for several months, despite disclosing that he was using illicit substances while incarcerated. “That person put in continuous forms to try and get on the program saying this is part of my parole conditions and I need to be stable on this program before release,” she said. “They were released without being started on the program [about a week ago] and there was not anything to follow up.” The founder of not-for-profit Kombi Clinic, Dr Jonathan O’Loan, said his organisation was finding 17% of those tested in Queensland prisons were coming back positive for the virus. He said “it’s a reality” that drugs and injecting equipment were being used in Queensland prisons and so access to healthcare needed to be equal to what’s provided in the community. “We did a great job early on in terms of … eliminating hepatitis C pockets, but we’re not doing enough if we’re going to reach 2030 targets,” he said. “I think there are many aspects of Queensland Health that need improved funding and improved services.” The chief executive of Micah Projects, Karyn Walsh, said her organisation also tests homeless and marginalised communities for hepatitis C. She said drug use needed to be seen as a health issue rather than one of law and order. “Marginalised populations like homeless people coming out of prison, people in prison, they all need access to proper testing and treatment for hep C,” Walsh said. “There needs to be a look at why aren’t people getting the [opioid] substitute programs because … they’re entitled to healthcare while they’re in there.” To date, no Australian jurisdictions provide a needle syringe program in correctional centres. Queensland state Greens MP Michael Berkman said there had been “political resistance” to such programs. “Shielding our eyes and pretending there are no needles or drugs in prison won’t save anyone,” Berkman said. “In fact, it’s created a hep C crisis in Queensland prisons.” Berkman said prisoners have no access to Medicare, meaning they are wholly reliant on the state government for their healthcare. “The state government needs to properly fund harm reduction programs in Queensland prisons, with access to clean injecting equipment, condoms and opioid substitution therapy,” he said. A Queensland Health spokesperson said the department “continues to educate, screen, test and treat people for the hepatitis C virus and other blood-borne viruses in all of the state’s correctional facilities.” The spokesperson said they work in partnership with Queensland Corrective Services to “disinfect equipment that might puncture skin such as needles, tattooing equipment, shaving implements such as Fincol or powdered bleach.” They said opioid substitution treatment programs were made available across Queensland’s correctional facilities from mid-2022 and were supported by hospital and health services. Guardian Australia understands that not all facilities have access to the program and the rollout is ongoing. “We will continue to monitor and evaluate the program to ensure its future success in minimising harm to people who have been users of opioids,” the spokesperson said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/15/queensland-prisoners-stuck-on-a-merry-go-round-of-hepatitis-c-transmission;guardian;health;3480
1544;1544;Australia’s softening inflation unlikely to spell an end to interest rate hikes;2023-01-24T14:00:02Z;['Peter Hannam'];['Australia cost of living crisis', 'Australia news', 'Interest rates', 'Inflation', 'Business', 'Australian economy'];;"When normally well-to-do shoppers of inner-west Sydney start trimming spending on fruit and vegetables, it’s a hint that households everywhere are feeling the pinch. “Now people are really conserving what they are spending on,” said Yousef Lakda, owner of the Nature Spot greengrocer in Rozelle. “They walk in, they check your prices and they walk out and go and compare the prices … it wasn’t [like that] before.” Food inflation at Australia’s biggest supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths quickened to an annual pace of 9.2% in the December quarter from 8.2% in the September quarter, UBS said this week. Prices have come down at Nature Spot compared with their peaks last year, and Lakda hopes that without a repeat of flooding or other extreme weather in key farming areas, the worst of the rises might be behind us. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Economists also predict the peak of the inflation threat may have passed. They forecast the December quarter consumer price index, due out on Wednesday from the Bureau of Statistics, will reveal an annual increase of about 7.5%. While the highest since 1990, such a number would only be marginally higher than the 7.3% pace recorded in the September quarter, and shy of the 8% figure the Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia tipped as the top of the current cycle.
However, inflation figures were typically higher than expected in 2022, particularly the March quarter’s 5.1%. The RBA responded by lifting its cash rate from a record low 0.1% in early May, and repeated the action each of the next seven months. The RBA looks more closely at the trimmed mean measure of CPI – which strips out the more volatile price movement – rather than the headline one. Economists predict the trimmed mean will come in at 6.4% for the December quarter, up from 6.1% in the previous quarter, and a new high for a series that started in 2003. The ANZ has among the highest forecasts for December-quarter inflation, tipping 7.7% for CPI and 6.7% for the trimmed mean. Either gauge is well above the RBA’s inflation target band of 2%-3%, which is why the RBA will likely have three more 25 basis-point increases by May to bring the interest rate to 3.85% before the hikes end, ANZ says. “Whether it’s petrol, whether it’s food, they really come up quite strongly and increase that part of the [CPI],” Adelaide Timbrell, a senior ANZ economist, said. “And they can come down quite quickly as well.” However, “the part of inflation that the Reserve Bank cares about will still be way above the [target] band at the end of 2023”, Timbrell said.
The bowser has lately been one area households and businesses could find some modest pricing relief. Petrol prices are roughly back to where they were before the Albanese government restored the full fuel excise of 46 cents a litre at the end of September. Fuel prices probably clocked a 2% increase during the December quarter alone, reflecting that full excise return, Timbrell said. Still, that’s a 2 percentage points slower pace of rises than during the mid-2022 peak. “It’s more likely than not that we will see fuel inflation a lot lower in 2023 compared to what we saw in 2022,” she said.
Energy costs, particularly for electricity, may be the main propellant for higher prices in the December quarter, and for a while yet. ANZ expects that electricity prices jumped 13% in the final three months of the year alone, which would be the largest quarterly increase since the introduction of carbon pricing in 2012.
As there are more increases to come – notwithstanding the federal government’s cap on gas and coal prices – electricity prices are “likely to put some pressure on household discretionary spending through this year as well,” Timbrell said. December-quarter inflation for so-called “non-discretionary” goods and services that consumers can’t easily avoid – mostly food, fuel, utilities, health and housing – will probably come in at just above the record 8.4% annual rate set in the July-September period, said Catherine Birch, a fellow senior ANZ economist. That, too, “should be the peak”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/25/australias-softening-inflation-unlikely-to-spell-an-end-to-interest-rate-hikes;guardian;business & economy;1544
4663;4663;Revealed: US allowing long-tailed macaque imports despite risk of disease;2023-01-08T08:00:43Z;['N/A'];['US news', 'Animals', 'Animal welfare', 'Cambodia', 'World news'];;US authorities are continuing to allow imports of long-tailed macaques from Cambodia, despite revelations that deadly pathogenic agents, including one deemed to be a bioterrorism risk, are entering the country with primates and recent charges of illegal trafficking of wild macaques falsely labeled as captive-bred into the US biomedical industry from Cambodia. Animal rights campaigners are urging the US government to stop the “cruel trade”, saying it’s impossible to prove provenance and that the risk of disease is significant. “The monkey trafficking trade is a substantive threat to public health, it’s only a matter of time before a recognized or novel pathogen sparks a new pandemic. The CDC is meant to be protecting the public, not bringing diseases into the country, jeopardizing public health,” said primatologist Dr Lisa Jones-Engel. Sources confirm that 720 long-tailed macaques were transported on a Maleth-Aero flight leaving Cambodia on 28 December and arriving in Dulles, Washington, a day later. About 360 primates were then transported by road to Charles River Laboratories in Houston, a large US importer and user of primates. It’s unclear where the remaining 360 macaques were transported to. Charles River has previously stated that they may import animals “carrying infectious agents capable of causing disease in humans”. Charles River did not respond to requests for comment. Documents obtained by Peta and revealed by the Guardian showed highly pathogenic agents entered the US with monkeys imported from Asia between 2018 and 2021, including at least six cases of Burkholderia pseudomallei in macaques from Cambodia. B Pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a rare but fatal disease in humans and is a tier 1 select agent with potential as a bioterrorism weapon. B Pseudomallei was, for the first time ever, detected in soil and water in Mississippi in 2022. In November, the US Department of Justice charged two Cambodian officials, including Cambodia’s second-highest-ranking wildlife official, Masphal Kry, and the owner of Vanny Bio-Research, a Cambodian macaque supplier, with illegal trafficking of wild macaques into the US research industry. The justice department alleged that more than 14,000 wild macaques were trapped, falsely labeled as captive bred at Cambodian monkey farms and 3,000 were exported to the US. The indictment includes two unnamed US co-conspirators in Alice, Texas, and southern Florida. Cambodia is the world’s largest exporter of macaques, and the main supplier to US laboratories, exporting 19,269 in 2021 to the US. Sarah Kite of Action for Primates said: “No one can guarantee any of the monkeys imported from Cambodia are not wild-caught, especially when the allegations are of corruption at a government level and involve the wildlife department responsible for issuing export permits for the macaques to be sent to the US.” Dr Cindy Buckmaster, who has worked in animal research for over 25 years, said: “I don’t know what we can do – the animal research community can’t tell if they’re fudging the paperwork, and it’s the animals who pay the price.” The US Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to requests for comment. The primate shipment from Cambodia took at least 48 hours. During transportation, monkeys are kept in small crates that prevent normal posture, enduring loud noises, inadequate ventilation and temperature fluctuations. The Maleth-Aero flight had a five-hour stopover in Georgia, and a dramatic drop in temperature from 87F (30.5C) in Phnom Penh to 40F in Tbilisi. Kite said: “It’s not possible to confine primates and transport them on long journeys across the world without causing considerable suffering. Some may become ill or die in transit. For others, stress may lead to disease which can remain latent until the animals reach their destination or become ill during quarantine.” There is concern that an increase in diseases found in primates at US quarantine facilities may be due to an increase in illegally caught wild monkeys being mixed in with farmed primates in Cambodia. Documents obtained by Peta reveal that primates who died in quarantine rose from 29 in 2017 to 125 in 2021 and those that were ill in quarantine but recovered increased from five in 2017 to 119 in 2021. Jones-Engel, Peta senior science adviser, said: “Since 2019, the CDC has overseen the importation of nearly 100,000 long-tailed macaques and the agency’s own documents make it clear that many monkeys arrived and were moved throughout the US with pathogens in their bodies. Melioidosis can be introduced and persist in the soil and water, posing a serious danger.” Primates imported to the US are held in CDC-mandated quarantine facilities for 31 days during which time they are tested for infectious diseases. A CDC spokesperson said: “CDC requires NHPs [non-human primates] having suspected or confirmed infectious disease of public health concern during quarantine to be appropriately treated and clinically healthy (as attested to in writing by the importer’s veterinarian) before the CDC will authorize release from quarantine.” The CDC spokesperson continued: “If something like melioidosis is identified in an NHP following the CDC-mandated quarantine, state and federal partners collaborate in investigations to protect public health.” Long-tailed macaques have suffered intensive capture for research for over fifty years, and are now an endangered species. Malene Friis Hansen, director of the Long-Tailed Macaque Project, said: “The demand coming from the US research industry seems to be driving the trade to an unsustainable level.” Charles River warned investors of disruption to primate imports from Cambodia further to the smuggling scandal, and the biomedical community said delays could slow down vaccine and medical progress. However, studies show that primates are poor predictors of results in humans, and long-tailed macaques are rarely used in vaccine development, but are instead the “go-to primate” for toxicology testing. In response to failing animal models, in December, US Congress passed the FDA Modernisation Act 2.0, which removes the mandate for pre-clinical tests in animals before human trials, paving the way for routine use of “human relevant” technologies including organ-on-a-chip and computer models that are more predictive of human response to drugs than animal tests.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/us-long-tailed-macaque-imports-disease-risks;guardian;politics;4663
5134;5134;Covid temporarily reduced Australia’s average life expectancy and lifted death rates to historic highs;2023-01-05T14:00:23Z;['Amy Remeikis'];['Australia news', 'Jim Chalmers (Australian politician)', 'Health', 'Australian politics', 'Population', 'Coronavirus'];;"The pandemic temporarily cut Australia’s average life expectancy and raised death rates to historic high levels, new population data shows. According to the Centre for Population report, released in full on Friday, nearly 79% of all Australian Covid deaths occurred in the first eight months of 2022, as governments lifted restrictions and eased mask rules. About 129,000 people died in Australia between January and August 2022, 13.2% more than died in the same period in 2021 and 17% more than the historical average.
Of those 129,000, some 7,700 died of Covid. That is six times more than died of Covid in all of 2021. The first week of August was the deadliest, with a total of 4,200 people dying – of all causes, not just Covid. That’s a death rate more than 20% above the historical average. The high number of deaths led to a temporary statistical decrease in average life expectancy, reducing by 0.4 years in 2021-2022, down from 85.3 years for girls born from 2018-2020 and 81.2 years for boys born from 2018-2020.It is not expected to correct until 2023-2024. In the next decade, the life expectancy of Australian men is predicted to hit 83.5 years, while for women it will reach 87 years. Dr Liz Allen, a demographer at the Australian National University, said the CFP report showed the direct and indirect impact of Covid on Australians. But she said the change in average life expectancy “doesn’t mean your life prospects have shrunk”. “It is a population change which reflects the lives lost from Covid – in particular, older people,” she said. Allen said it also reflected the changes Covid has made to long-term population predictions. The report predicts Australia’s population will reach 29.9 million in June 2033, with the rate of growth declining from 1.4% to 1.2%. That’s about or 1.2 million fewer people than previously predicted. The median age of the population is also forecast to rise from 38.4 to 40.1 over the next 10 years. “It shows that Australia is going to be older, bigger, with a shrinking workforce,” she said. “More reliant on migration, cities reign supreme and we risk the young having to shoulder the economic burdens of tomorrow. “Young people are already facing uncertainty, with climate change, unaffordable housing, insecure work and gender inequality pressures. So the main question is: what are we going to do with this information, so young people don’t carry the weight of this future?” The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has spent the week making the case for migration as one of the solutions to Australia’s encroaching “demographic challenge”.
Allen said Australia was most likely in for a few more years of pain when it came to population growth. She said she was heartened by the shift in language from the federal government in response to the report, but questioned whether the migration policies would be put in place to support population growth. “In the not too distant future, deaths are predicted to increase and births will decrease, which will see us more reliant on migration as an economic requirement, to ensure our workforce is sufficient,” she said. “Overall, this is not new in the grand scheme of things. We have had this information for some time. The question is, how will this government use this information to make change in policy?” A review on Australia’s migration system is due in the first quarter of this year. The findings from the Centre for Population report will also inform the employment white paper and the next intergenerational report, the government has said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/06/covid-reduced-australias-average-life-expectancy-and-lifted-death-rates-to-historic-highs;guardian;health;5134

French workers are carrying out nationwide strikes today in an attempt to derail the government's plans to raise the retirement age by two years to 64.

The strikes and protests will prove to be a major test for President Emmanuel Macron, who says his flagship reform, which opinion polls show is very unpopular, is vital to ensure the pension system does not go bust.

Unions argue the pension overhaul threatens hard-fought rights and propose a tax on the wealthy or more payroll contributions from employers to finance the pension system.

More than 200 rallies are expected around France today, including a large one in Paris involving all France's unions.

Police unions opposed to the retirement reform are also taking part; those who are not protesting are bracing for potential violence if extremist groups join the demonstrations.

A majority of trains around France have also been cancelled, including some international connections, according to the SNCF national state-owned railway company.

About 20% of flights out of the Paris Orly Airport are cancelled and airlines are warning of delays.

1968;1968;"The week in theatre: A Streetcar Named Desire; Watch on the Rhine";2023-01-22T10:30:33Z;['Susannah Clapp'];['Theatre', 'Tennessee Williams', 'Paul Mescal', 'Culture', 'Stage', 'Almeida theatre', 'Donmar Warehouse', 'Lillian Hellman'];;"This Streetcar is transporting. The casting of Rebecca Frecknall’s production guaranteed a sellout, and has produced three bewitching performances: Paul Mescal in the part that Brando and his T-shirt played in the 1951 movie, alongside Patsy Ferran, stepping in late for an injured Lydia Wilson, as Blanche, and Anjana Vasan as sister Stella. Yet the central triumph is Frecknall’s ability to find the pulse of Tennessee Williams’s 1947 play. Confusion and desire are not embodied in a single performance: they sweep the stage, pushing the action along. Frecknall has been most acclaimed for her massive production of Cabaret (still running at the Playhouse). Yet her real breakthrough was her 2018 reimagining of Williams’s little-known Summer and Smoke, also featuring Ferran and Vasan: Frecknall weirded the play, making it look both internal and like Streetcar’s twin. This production has a similar, though more far-reaching effect. Familiar gestures and setting are banished: there is no languorous fanning, less muscular swelter, no tangle of iron stairways. Madeleine Girling’s design, coming and going under Lee Curran’s lighting, is bare but delivers a vital point by being in the round: the action is seen from more than one point of view. Vasan’s Stella, often sunk into herself, her voice low-pitched, is an arresting presence, in part a warning of where love can take you. Mescal, straight-shouldered but rapid-moving, is a terrific blend of tinderbox and damage. He is on guard as soon as he meets his wife’s sister – the bond between the women is put across with exceptional force, as the key to all their relationships. He howls with righteous rage and pain at being called a Polack; yet you see him gathering horrible strength from his male drinking companions: Blanche’s rape is fuelled by a mob.
Meanwhile the marvellous Ferran, younger than usual for the woman depending on the kindness of strangers, brings a particular wit to Blanche: she fuses innocence and snobbery, and raises an uneasy laugh with her fastidious reference to Edgar Allan Poe as she rolls her eyes at her sister’s arrangements. She seems propelled by the velocity of her words, her own laughter so forced and hard that you can almost see it hanging in the air. Frecknall’s training as a dancer infuses her production. Not only in balletic episodes (she sometimes overdoes the bending of limbs) but in the choreographing that groups and scatters the cast to a distinctive rhythm. Music and sound – from a band and singer above the action – are essential here: crooning, humming, whistling, the clash of cymbals, the thump of drums, an inchoate clamour; a mix of inner and outer chaos. It is noise that finally overcomes Blanche: in a wonderful touch, the people who take her off to the asylum are the musicians: chords, not cords, will bind her. In 1941, eight months before Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the second world war, Watch on the Rhine – a demand that America take action against fascism – was produced. It is shrewd of the Donmar (wake up, Arts Council, which took the theatre’s grant away, while diminishing the Almeida’s funding) to revive Lillian Hellman’s play now. Ellen McDougall’s handsome, convinced production speaks to today’s fear of the rise of dictatorship and new fissures between east and west. It is, though, a play strangely at odds with itself. Hellman was both wit and political visionary – not necessarily exclusive categories, but in her case uncomfortably manacled to each other. Her call to arms is unassailable, its execution sometimes stiff. An American grande dame is visited by her daughter, who has married and had a family with a German resistance fighter; the plot turns on betrayal, escape and violence; its point is the awakening of the new world to the old. Hellman’s play contains historical events and figures (characters based on Romanian diplomat Prince Antoine Bibesco and the anti-fascist activist Muriel Gardiner) but the action is invented and its realism lessened by the dramatist’s reluctance to make her hero Jewish: she was wary of provoking American antisemitism. McDougall’s production ingeniously shades the characterisation with musical director Josh Middleton’s score, replacing classical fragments with a Jewish socialist anthem. An early nod to the interweaving of fiction and real political horror is given here by displaying credits from the 1943 Bette Davis film. The dialogue is often set-piece, and John Light and Carlyss Peer are more rigid than even the rigidity of their characters require. Yet memorable phrases are scattered throughout: I would put up with a lot of duff lines for the comment of the matriarch in her drawing room as she recognises the truth of Nazi brutality: “We’ve been shaken out of the magnolias.”
Memorable performances too. Patricia Hodge authoritatively embodies the grand grandmother – indulged, once adored, bristling and barking as an elderly widow. Her haughty certainty is finally cracked, but she does not crumble: she remains herself, though her golden roll of hair is slightly bowed. There is an outstanding performance from Bertie Caplan as her spookily eloquent young grandson; hyper-alert but with his childhood withered by the threat of persecution. Uneven but fascinating, this delivers history when it was news.

1202;1202;Bangkok air pollution prompts advice to work from home;2023-01-26T05:20:37Z;['Rebecca Ratcliffe'];['Thailand', 'Air pollution', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Environment'];;"People in Bangkok have been advised to work from home and wear face masks due to air pollution that has worsened to unhealthy levels. Officials urged people to use public transport rather than private cars for commuting, and said the authorities would seek to reduce sources of pollution such as outdoor burning and construction activities. Face masks would be distributed to vulnerable people, Bangkok authorities said. The Bangkok governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said pollution was expected to rise on Thursday but it did not require schools to be closed. “I would like to ask people to be prepared by checking the pollution level before planning a trip. The BMA [Bangkok Metropolitan Administration] and pollution department will control the sources of the dust and ask for cooperation from activities that generates dust such as construction sites or truck transportation,” he said.
If the situation worsened, he added, limitations on transport would be considered. Agricultural burning and forest fires are a major cause of air pollution in Thailand between December and April, especially in the north-west. Pollution from these fires also affects Bangkok, which already struggles with bad air due to its factories, construction and traffic. On Thursday morning, PM2.5 levels reached 63.2µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic metre), according to the Swiss air quality company IQAir – far higher than the WHO annual air quality guideline of 5µg/m³. Areas of Samut Songkhram, south-west of Bangkok, and Lampang, in the north, ranked worst in Thailand. Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, the permanent secretary in the health ministry, said this week that all provincial public health services would monitor the situation and that emergency centres would be opened in provinces experiencing high levels of pollution for more than three consecutive days.
The number of patients experiencing pollution-related health problems more than doubled to nearly 213,000 this week, from about 96,000 last week, Opas said. Most were experiencing respiratory tract problems as well as symptoms such as dermatitis or eye inflammation. Chadchart said the situation would be monitored closely throughout February and was expected to be better in March.

3900;3900;Is Harry the next James Corden? The prince’s TV appearances, in order of greatness;2023-01-12T14:46:33Z;['Mark Lawson'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Talk shows', 'Prince Harry'];;"King Charles, as the Prince of Wales, gave one TV interview (on ITV in 1994). Diana, Princess of Wales (on BBC One, 1995) and HRH Prince Andrew (on BBC One, 2019) also did the same – and only Diana seems likely to have considered the primetime conversation successful. But Harry, Duke of Sussex has now made 11 high-profile TV appearances: from Oprah With Meghan and Harry (CBS and ITV, 2021) through the six parts of the documentary series Harry & Meghan (Netflix) to the four British and US interviews this week to promote his memoir Spare. So how well did Harry use the medium, and how well did it use him? Harry: The Interview (ITV, 8 Jan)
Production Any interview pegged to a painfully revelatory memoir faces the technical hitch of how a person can be expected to ad-lib their tragedies for viewers’ convenience. ITV’s elegant solution was to use extracts from Harry’s audiobook recording to set up discussions. Harry Beyond those who have objected to Harry from monarchist (disrespect to the crown) or classist (self-pitying super-rich brat) perspectives, those who tuned in open-minded may have been pleasantly surprised to find an articulate, thoughtful, engaging and amusing man. Harry has inherited his mother’s media poise. Only the hardest heart could not feel sympathy for his clearly deep scars – unable to forget his mother’s death or forgive the media for what he sees as their role in it. Interviewer Under usual media conflict-of-interest rules, Tom Bradby, a longtime friend of both Diana’s sons, should have been exactly the wrong choice. In practice, familiarity allowed him to eschew the sycophancy of US interviewers from Oprah onwards, while Harry was usefully aware that Bradby has his own knowledge of some of the events and people mentioned. Cannily, though, the host also maintained his journalistic rigour, often using a resting sceptical expression. And in the moment interviewers dread – when Harry challenged the host to answer one of his own “complicated” questions – the ITV man calmly delineated, without notes, the intricacies of the prince’s three legal battles in the UK. Against the odds, an already formidable broadcaster emerged with reputation enhanced. Revelations In this first interview – screened before the book was published – Harry’s disclosure that he has no memories of the period after his mum’s death was startling and poignant. The explanation of some of his interactions with the media will have made some British media uncomfortable, as their coverage of the show possibly reflected. TV crowns 👑 👑 👑 👑 👑 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert (CBS, 10 Jan)
Production Harry’s 11th and latest TV interview in American exile was as radical a departure from royal protocol as the first with Oprah. The previous 10 all fell within news/documentary formats. This was the first appearance by a blood royal on a studio talkshow and, moreover, one with a satirical spin. No Buckingham Palace press teams would ever risk a prince doing this, and even commoner spin doctors would judge it high jeopardy. Harry Either the prince or his handlers had gambled that host Stephen Colbert tends, when faced with a high-ranking newsy guest (the Obamas, Clintons), to drop the satire. Apart from a couple of “comedy bits” – a skit with royal heralds and Tom Hanks, and drinking tequila shots with Colbert – that felt ill-judged, Harry was able to be deeply serious about favoured themes such as mental health, the British media, while also cannily flattering his new home (“America is a great place to live”) and, as the most successful guests on US talkshows do, engaging directly with the studio audience. It has been increasingly hard this week to see any reconciliation with the royals, but this appearance teased a possible future for Harry. There’s a long tradition of hit chatshow guests – Oprah Winfrey, James Corden, Terry Wogan, John Bishop – moving into the main chair. A sharp producer might sign up Harry to host a series of chats for which everyone, from Sir Elton John to President Biden, would surely agree. Interviewer Mainly eschewing comedy – except for an exchange about a “cock sock” (the C-word bleeped) to prevent frostbite – Colbert was empathic (his father and two brothers died in an accident when he was 10), intelligent and forensic. His solution to the issue of how to transmit the content of the book was to read and internalise it to the extent that he could describe and quote content without notes. Revelations Even those sympathetic to Harry were thrown by reports that the book “boasted” of his number of Taliban kills in Afghanistan. Prompted and endorsed by Colbert, the prince was able to present those paragraphs in a different light: a reflection on military veterans’ difficulty in living with the knowledge of killings and a plea for more understanding of this haunting to “prevent more suicides”. Harry’s receipt of a round of applause for that line represented a stunningly effective reversal of a media narrative and again showed how, as a smooth media performer, he is completely his mother’s son. TV crowns 👑👑👑👑 60 Minutes: Prince Harry (CBS, 8 Jan)
Production Clunkily, host Anderson Cooper read out chunks from a copy of Spare, then asked the prince to parse them, like a college tutorial. The bigger vibe, though, was shrink and client: Cooper, smiling benignly behind expensive spectacles, sometimes seemed at risk of handing Harry a bill and fixing the next session. Harry Pronouncing “route” in the American way to rhyme with “shout”, the prince will have to watch where his accent ends up, with signs of it splashing into mid-Atlantic like David Frost’s. Interviewer Cooper’s solemnity blocked off the cheeky side of the prince’s personality that showed in other chats. When Harry mentioned his “aunt” taking him to see HM the Queen’s body, a British presenter would have gathered that he was talking about HRH Princess Anne, fleshing out the anecdote. Revelations For UK viewers who had seen the Bradby, the content was largely familiar; for US viewers, it would have had the impact of the ITV show. Cooper got more on the depth of royal enmities: Harry hasn’t “for a while” had any contact with his dad or brother. The freshest information was an explanation of why the royals are so obsessed with the press. All the papers are laid out at breakfast, so it’s hard not to know what’s being said about you. TV crowns 👑 👑 Good Morning America (ABC, 9 Jan)
Production The closest in format to Diana’s 1995 Panorama interview – a special segment of a news programme – although, unlike his mum, Harry clearly wasn’t blackmailed into doing this. Interviewer Michael Strahan followed the journalistic tradition of taking the content of the book as read and asking more general questions (“Did [HM The Queen] ever express that she was upset with you?”) designed to prise out news stories. Harry Few politicians – and certainly not the last four UK prime ministers or the two most recent US presidents – could get through such a varied sequence of interviews without significant stumbling or discomfort. After this week, even Harry haters and doubters might have to accept that he is a fluent media performer. Transcripts of the four interviews are remarkably free of the word “um”. To Strahan’s Elizabeth II question, for instance, he denied it (to his gran “nothing came as a surprise”) without giving the direct quotes from the monarch for which the questioner was fishing. Interviewer Strahan was prepped and sharp but Harry benefited from the tendency of citizens of the republic to become slightly awed in the presence of a British royal. Revelations Strahan’s direct questioning required the prince to be less euphemistic than elsewhere about family rifts, but there was no scoop.

3015;3015;Ex-victims’ commissioner hits out at ‘evil’ in Met amid David Carrick fallout;2023-01-17T10:14:42Z;['Jamie Grierson'];['Metropolitan police', 'Police', 'London', 'UK news', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Sarah Everard', 'Society'];;"The former victims’ commissioner Vera Baird has said Scotland Yard seems incapable of not employing “some quite evil people” as she questioned its commitment to culture change after the case of the serial rapist and serving officer David Carrick. Carrick, an elite Metropolitan police officer, waged a campaign of terror and humiliation against women for two decades, committing 48 rapes to become one of the worst sex offenders in modern history. The process of sacking him from the force starts on Tuesday. The Met has admitted errors in failing to spot Carrick’s escalating danger during his 20 years of service. Britain’s biggest police force was told about nine incidents from 2000 to 2021, including eight alleged attacks or clashes Carrick had with women before the arrest that led to his convictions.
Baird, who resigned as victims’ commissioner in September after three years in the role, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Metropolitan police seem incapable of not employing – and furthermore retaining – some quite evil people. “He appears to have been reassessed since the murder of Sarah Everard, since the Charing Cross misogyny scandal came out. “Where exactly is the change in culture that we have all been told would occur after that catastrophic death now a couple of years ago?” She added that it was not the Met that exposed Carrick but one of the victims who “had the courage” to go to another police force. Meanwhile, the head of the Metropolitan police has said some serving officers needed to be identified and removed. As details of Carrick’s convictions were revealed on Monday, it emerged a total of 1,633 cases of alleged sexual offences or domestic violence involving 1,071 officers and other staff were being reviewed from the last 10 years to make sure the appropriate decisions were made. The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, who assumed office in September, on Tuesday admitted the force has not dealt with its own integrity with “the ruthlessness and clarity” that it deals with criminals. Rowley told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “It’s not a good situation, that’s why we’re reviewing it. I came back to policing four months ago because I’m passionate about policing. Most of our men and women are great people but we have not been tough enough at guarding our own integrity.
“We haven’t dealt with these issues, day in and day out for years, with the ruthlessness and clarity that we deal with criminals. And that’s what we’re getting on top of.” There were some officers serving in the Met who needed to be identified and removed from the force, he admitted. Rowley was asked if he could guarantee that a woman visiting a police station to report a sexual offence would not meet a police officer whose past behaviour was now under review, or who was tolerating similar behaviour in their department. “I can’t, I’m not going to make a promise that I can’t stick to,” he said. “I’m going to put in place ruthless systems to squeeze out those who shouldn’t be with us. “Most of our officers are fantastic, the people who specialised in this area are great and they have the skills. But do I have some officers who shouldn’t be in the Met that I’ve got to identify and get rid of? Yes I do, and I’m completely frank about that.” Appearing on broadcast media for the UK government on Tuesday, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, said the police had “some work to do” in restoring trust. Asked on Times Radio if the government could say that women could trust the police, she said: “It’s very important that we do trust the police. There’s no place in our police force for officers who fall seriously short of the standards required. It’s clear that action needs to be taken because it’s fundamental that we can trust our police.” On Monday, Carrick pleaded guilty to the remaining charges against him at Southwark crown court in London, bringing a total of 49 charges covering 85 serious offences. No action was taken, with the women either refusing to formally complain or withdrawing their cooperation from the police investigation. Alarm bells also failed to ring within the force, which promoted Carrick in 2009 from patrolling the streets to being a member of an elite armed unit, the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, guarding embassies, Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/17/met-police-chief-officers-removed-david-carrick;guardian;entertainment & culture;3015
7281;7281;Alireza Akbari: Nephew speaks of anguish at execution of British-Iranian national - 'I do believe it is a political game';Saturday 14 January 2023 20:32, UK;[];['iran'];['nephew', 'execution', 'political', 'anguish', 'national', 'alireza', 'game', 'try', 'britishiranian', 'iranian', 'regime', 'believe', 'family', 'country', 'uncle', 'akbari', 'speaks', 'forghani'];"The nephew of a British-Iranian national who was put to death by hanging in Iran has spoken of his shock, describing the execution as a ""political game"".

Official Iranian news sources reported on Saturday that Alireza Akbari, the country's former deputy defence minister, had been executed on charges of spying for Britain, but did not say when the death sentence had been carried out.

Ramin Forghani, a researcher in political science at the University of Luxembourg, told Sky News that he only had good, kind memories of his uncle, and that the execution was a political game which had caused terrible mental anguish to his family.

Mr Forghani said he could not imagine how awful his uncle's immediate family would be feeling, and remembered how his relatives would meet each other during the Iranian New Year period.

""He was always smiling,"" he said, paying tribute. ""He would always try to help anybody as much as he could, family or friends, and that's the memory that I will continue to have of him.""

Mr Forghani said it had been an ""absolutely terrible"" time for the family. ""I can only imagine that it has been a horrific time for my uncle's immediate family, his wife and children,"" he added.

Mr Akbari, 61, had served as a minister in the reformist government of Mohammad Khatami between 1997 and 2005, and left the country for Britain in 2008 after being briefly detained and bailed by the Iranians. He was later arrested again in 2019 and accused of espionage for MI6.

Mr Forghani said the charges made no sense as his uncle had been involved with the Iranian regime since its foundation, having held senior positions in the government, and that we was dedicated to the country and would not do anything to jeopardise its security.

""I do believe it is a political game,"" he said. ""It would be [unthinkable] for him to try to do anything in any shape or form to jeopardise the country, nor the regime. I can't think of his character being somebody that would try to do anything against the country. That's just not digestible.""

The only plausible explanation, Mr Forghani said, was that his uncle had political enemies who had used the system against him. He said the execution was a violation of human rights and urged that pressure on Iran be kept up, saying no one should forget about other dual nationals imprisoned and awaiting sentencing.

'A barbaric act'

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""appalled"" by the execution, describing it as ""a callous and cowardly act, carried out by a barbaric regime with no respect for the human rights of their own people"".

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described it as a ""barbaric act"" that ""deserves condemnation in the strongest possible terms... and will not stand unchallenged"". He has sanctioned Iran's prosecutor general, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri.

He subsequently tweeted that the UK would be temporarily recalling its ambassador to Tehran for consultation.

'Drugged and tortured'

The Iranian judiciary claimed Mr Akbari was a ""key spy"" for the British government, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

It said Iranian intelligence unmasked him by feeding him false information, and described him as ""one of the most important infiltrators of the country's sensitive and strategic centres"".

Mr Akbari had claimed he was tortured and given mind-altering drugs and forced to confess to crimes he did not commit.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230114221745/http://news.sky.com/story/alireza-akbari-nephew-speaks-of-anguish-at-execution-of-british-iranian-national-i-do-believe-it-is-a-political-game-12786633;skynews;politics;1372
4424;4424;Alan Sugar on making The Apprentice: ‘If I was a candidate, I’d win every time’;2023-01-09T15:38:26Z;['Rich Pelley'];['The Apprentice', 'BBC', 'Culture', 'Reality TV', 'Television', 'Alan Sugar', 'Karren Brady'];;"Alan Sugar, host I was contacted by the BBC in 2003 to consider doing The Apprentice. I’d heard Donald Trump had been very successful in the American version, so I was up for it. They asked me to find a couple of advisers: Margaret Mountford, my lawyer for many years, and Nick Hewer, my publicity man. It was really an excuse to get across my business acumen, as well as to become a TV personality. It was very exciting. It’s quite theatrical, me entering the boardroom from the back, but that’s poetic licence. I mean, I’ve got to come into the room somehow. One of the things I’ve got used to is needing patience. There’s a lot of hanging around between board meetings. The boardroom sessions go on for three-and-a-half hours but you only see 25 minutes. The monkeys at the production company pick the moments where I’m banging my hands on the table. In reality I’m polite and sensitive towards the candidates, but that doesn’t make good telly. Winning a job was something we inherited from the American format. But it wasn’t very practical, because you can’t just invent a job, plus the high £100,000 salary alienated a lot of my staff. Since we changed the prize to going into business with me for £250,000, it’s been very successful. Not 100% successful, but I can name at least five winners who are now millionaires.
If I was a candidate, I’d win every time – simple as that. I’ll continue doing it for as long as I enjoy it. I don’t think anything needs to change. That’s the demise of so many television programmes: some brain surgeon somewhere decides “Let’s jazz it up” and it ends up being gimmicky, ridiculous and sometimes pathetic. Maybe I need to polish up my boardroom, paint it up a bit, but what changes every year is the candidates, who are what people want to see. I suppose I’ve got to take a bit of credit myself. I have a way of interrogating that the public seem to like. It’s the combination of me interrogating and a bunch of new characters that make the show. Would I ever do another reality show? I’ve been asked to do them all, but no. Karren Brady, aide since series six I’d known Alan for a long time. When I started working in football in 1993 [as managing director of Birmingham FC], he was the chairman of Tottenham. Our paths crossed and we got on well. He asked me to do the first Comic Relief Does the Apprentice in 2007, with Jo Brand, Cheryl Cole, Maureen Lipman and Trinny Woodall. I remember him saying in the boardroom: “Karren, you’ve got the most to lose because you’re the business person.” I thought: “Christ, I really have to up my game.” The girls made me project manager, we wiped the floor with the boys and raised more than £750,000. I did the guest interviews for a series. Then Alan phoned and said: “Margaret is leaving. There’s no one I’d like more to replace her, but I have to warn you: it’s very long and arduous, think carefully, you’ll spend a long time away from home.” My kids were young, I was still just in my 30s, so I talked it over and they said: “We want you to do it, mum.” Then Alan said, “Margaret’s changed her mind.” I thought: “That’s the first time I’ve been fired before I’ve been hired!”
But the following year, Margaret did leave, and I started with Junior Apprentice that rolled into the main series. Margaret phoned and said: “Karren, I’m going to give you a bit of advice. You’re on your feet all day. Wear comfortable shoes.” When The Apprentice says it’s 4am, it really is 4am, and the days are 12 hours. I spent my first day filming in a market in high heels. That night, I was in the bath, my feet were throbbing. I texted Margaret: “You’re quite right.” I never made that mistake again. Normally in reality TV, you win and that’s it. Winning the Apprentice is life-changing. The day after the final, £250,000 is sent from Alan’s account and they can do whatever they want with it. The authenticity is important, but it’s such a simple format. Alan tells the candidates what the task is, they complete that and someone on the losing team gets fired. But it’s the characters and the interaction that make the show. People love shouting at the television: “Why are you doing this? You should be doing that.” I think it’s that kind of programme we’d all like to have a go at to show how good we are. And, of course, if I were a candidate against Lord Sugar, I’d beat him hands down. • The Apprentice is on Thursdays at 9pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/09/alan-sugar-the-apprentice-candidate-milliionaires;guardian;entertainment & culture;4424
4011;4011;Prostate cancer detection variations show ‘postcode lottery’ - charity;2023-01-12T06:00:01Z;['Andrew Gregory'];['Prostate cancer', 'Health', 'Society', 'Scotland', 'UK news', 'Cancer'];;"Prostate cancer patients across the UK face a “postcode lottery” of care, a charity has warned, with men in Scotland almost three times more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage compared with men in London. Prostate Cancer UK said the proportion diagnosed when the disease may be too advanced to treat varied hugely depending on where patients lived. Health leaders called the findings “shocking”. In Scotland, more than a third (35%) of men are only diagnosed when the disease is classed as stage 4, meaning the cancer has spread to another part of the body – known as metastatic cancer. In London, the figure is 12.5%. Prostate Cancer UK analysed various datasets to find out the proportion of patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer – which in most cases is too advanced to cure. There is a significant north-south divide. After Scotland, the next highest proportion of men diagnosed only at stage 4 was in north-east England and Yorkshire (20.1%), followed by Northern Ireland (20%), and Wales (19%). In the Midlands, 17.8% of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed late and 17.1% in the north-west. The areas with the fewest men diagnosed at a late stage are all in the south or east of England. In the south-west, 16.8% of men are diagnosed at stage 4, 15.6% in the east, and 14.7% in the south-east, followed by London at 12.5%. The analysis uses figures largely gathered before the pandemic, between 2014 and 2020. But the charity suggested outcomes for men were unlikely to have improved since then as health services across England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have all been under significant pressure. One in eight men will get prostate cancer. Every year, almost 10,000 men across the UK are diagnosed with the disease at stage 4.
Laura Kerby, the chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, said: “This postcode lottery for cancer diagnosis simply isn’t fair, and the picture in Scotland is particularly shocking. Every man should get an equal chance of a cure, which is only possible if his cancer is caught early. “Unfortunately, early prostate cancer usually doesn’t have any symptoms, which is why men need to be aware of their risk and should take our online risk checker to find out more. If you’re at higher risk – which includes all men over 50 – you’re entitled to a free PSA blood test from your GP. Because of their higher risk, we strongly recommend that black men and men with a family history of prostate cancer should speak to their GP from the age of 45.” Kerby raised concerns about fewer men being diagnosed since the arrival of Covid, saying there was “a long way to go to fully reverse the impact of the pandemic”. The analysis also suggests men from deprived areas are at higher risk of being diagnosed at a later stage of the disease. Chiara De Biase, director of support and influencing at Prostate Cancer UK, said the reasons for the huge geographical variation in late diagnoses were uncertain. “We can’t say for sure what’s behind this gap in diagnosis, but it’s clear that men are more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage in areas with higher rates of PSA blood testing. That means the key way to tackle this is by raising awareness – especially in places like Scotland which are worst-affected. “While we need to do more to raise awareness among men, we’d also strongly encourage GPs to take more of a proactive stance on PSA blood tests for men at highest risk. “To this end, we’re supporting pilot schemes with GPs in areas of high deprivation to send targeted messages to encourage these men to come forward, and we’d like to see this rolled out more widely if successful.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/12/prostate-cancer-diagnosis-lottery-sees-regions-lagging-far-behind-london;guardian;health;4011
4101;4101;Rishi Sunak says he is registered with an NHS GP but has used private healthcare;2023-01-11T16:09:08Z;['Peter Walker'];['Rishi Sunak', 'PMQs', 'NHS', 'Health', 'Private healthcare', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;"Rishi Sunak has said he is now registered with an NHS GP, having previously used private healthcare, during a prime minister’s questions dominated by the state of the NHS and the strikes by health and ambulance staff. “I am registered with an NHS GP. I have used independent healthcare in the past,” Sunak told the Commons in response to a question from the Labour MP Cat Smith about NHS dentistry. He also praised a hospital in his Yorkshire constituency “for the fantastic care they’ve given my family over the years”. The prime minister and his officials had previously refused to say whether Sunak or his family used the NHS after the Guardian revealed he was registered with a private clinic in west London clinic that charges £250 for a consultation. Answering Smith’s question, Sunak did not say when he registered with the NHS GP, or whether his family used private healthcare. But speaking after PMQs Sunak’s press secretary said he had always been registered with an NHS GP, even while he used private care. “The PM has set out his details in the house. In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private,” she said. “But given the level of interest, and in the interests of transparency, he has set out that he is registered with an NHS GP, and has always been. He has used private healthcare in the past.” She confirmed that Sunak was no longer registered with a private GP, but refused to say when this had happened, or whether it had been since he became prime minister in October, adding: “As far as I’m aware, he is only registered with an NHS GP.” His exchanges with Keir Starmer focused entirely on health issues, with the Labour leader castigating Sunak over the scale of waiting lists, while the PM largely responded by talking about the government’s bill to limit public sector strikes, announced on Tuesday. “The prime minister is saying he’s now registered with an NHS doctor, so he’ll soon enjoy the experience of waiting on hold every morning at 8am to get a GP appointment,” Starmer said, also criticising Sunak over the strikes.
“In the 13 years of the last Labour government, there were no national NHS strikes,” Starmer said. “If the prime minister had negotiated with the nurses before Christmas, they wouldn’t be on strike. If it negotiated with the ambulance workers, they wouldn’t be on strike either. So why is he choosing to prolong the misery rather than end the strike?” Sunak replied that he was seeking “constructive dialogue with the unions”, and accused Starmer of being “on the side of his union paymasters, not patients” for opposing the bill to impose minimum strike service levels on the NHS and other public services. The government was trying to “legislate your way out of 13 years of failure”, Starmer replied, telling Sunak: “They’ve gone from clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses. It’s that simple.” During a series of questions from Starmer on waiting lists, Sunak tried to change the subject or say this was because of Covid. The eventual aim, the PM said, was to stop anyone waiting more than a year for an NHS procedure. Starmer replied: “So he can’t tell us how much he will reduce waiting lists by, or when. So much for the accountability he wants. As ever with this prime minister, you scratch the surface and you find there is nothing there. “He’s promising that one day, although he can’t say when, their record-high waiting lists will stop going up. After 13 years in government, what does it say that the best they can offer is that, at some point, they might stop making things worse?”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/11/rishi-sunak-says-he-is-registered-with-an-nhs-gp-but-has-used-private-healthcare;guardian;politics;4101
3458;3458;Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 326 of the invasion;2023-01-15T01:36:22Z;['N/A'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news'];;Russia carried out two mass rocket attacks on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in Dnipro and leaving at least 14 people dead and 64 injured, at least a dozen of them children. Rescue efforts were ongoing in the south-central city on Sunday. At least one person was also killed in a separate strike on a residential area in the nearby city of Kryvyi Rih. Ukrainian authorities said the targets were the country’s energy infrastructure. The UK prime minister has confirmed the country will provide tanks to Ukraine to help Kyiv’s forces “push Russian troops back”. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Sunak offered Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict. Emergency power outages were enacted across 11 regions of Ukraine after Russian strikes on energy infrastructure. In a post on Telegram, grid operator Ukrenegro said the consumption limits in force across the country were exceeded in 11 regions, as a result of which “emergency shutdowns have been applied”. Four explosions were heard in central Kyiv on Saturday morning. For the first time since Russia began regular missile and drone attacks on the capital in autumn, the air raid sirens sounded after the attack. Until now, the sirens have sounded 10-90 minutes before an attack, giving residents time to seek shelter. Air raid alerts were also issued across the country, including in the major cities of Kherson and Lviv. Alerts were also issued for the regions of Kharkiv, Donestk, Dnipropetrovsk and about a dozen others. Ukraine has called on its allies to give it more support after its troops suffered heavy losses in fighting at Soledar and Bakhmut in recent months. Russia said on Friday its forces had taken control of Soledar in east Ukraine, its first claim of victory in months of battlefield setbacks, while Kyiv said fierce fighting was continuing in the town. “To win this war, we need more military equipment, heavy equipment,” said Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Agence France-Presse reported. Moldovan authorities said debris from a missile had been found in its territory near the border with Ukraine. They said on Saturday the find came “after Russia’s massive bombardment of Ukraine” and that it was the third time missiles from the conflict had fallen on to Moldova’s territory. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, of shameful subservience to the US and suggested he should ritually disembowel himself. His remarks on Saturday were the latest in a long line of shocking and provocative statements from arch-hawk Medvedev, Reuters reported. Speaking later on Saturday, a day after a summit with the US president, Joe Biden, Kishida made no mention of Medvedev’s comment;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-326-of-the-invasion;guardian;politics;3458
6155;6155;FIFA to ask every country to name a stadium in honour of football great Pele, Gianni Infantino says;Monday 2 January 2023 17:51, UK;['lucia binding', '@luciabinding'];['pele'];['fifa', 'stadium', 'ask', 'belmiro', 'santos', 'star', 'football', 'world', 'country', 'pele', 'honour', 'great', 'vila', 'gianni', 'peles', 'infantino'];"FIFA plans to ask every country in the world to name a stadium in honour of the late football legend Pele, its president Gianni Infantino has said.

The former Santos FC star, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, died on 29 December aged 82 after a battle with colon cancer since September 2021.

Mr Infantino, who is in Sao Paulo in Brazil for Pele's funeral, told local reporters: ""We're going to ask every country in the world to name one of their football stadiums with the name of Pele.""

Rio de Janeiro scrapped plans to name the famous Maracana Stadium after Pele after it was vetoed by the state governor in April 2021.

The football legend's coffin was placed inside the Vila Belmiro stadium in his hometown of Santos on Monday, the home ground of the club where he scored some of the best goals of his career.

Mr Infantino released a statement on the day Pele died which read: ""For everyone who loves the beautiful game, this is the day we never wanted to come. The day we lost Pele.""

He described Pele, whose real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento, as an ""exemplary sportsman"" and added: ""Pele had a magnetic presence and, when you were with him, the rest of the world stopped.

""His life is about more than football. He changed perceptions for the better in Brazil, in South America and across the world. His legacy is impossible to summarise in words.""

He also told journalists on Monday: ""I am here with a lot of emotion, sadness, but also with a smile because he gave us so many smiles. As FIFA, we will pay a tribute to the 'King' and we ask the whole world to observe a minute of silence.""

Meanwhile, mourners began paying their respects to Pele in a solemn procession past his coffin at Vila Belmiro, which was decorated with Brazilian flags and number 10 shirts that Pele made popular when he played for Santos and Brazil.

Bouquets of flowers filled up the stands after being placed by mourners and sent by clubs and star players - including Neymar and Ronaldo - from around the world.

Loudspeakers also played a song named Eu Sou Pele (I Am Pele) that was recorded by the football star himself.

His funeral took place at 10am local time, and the burial will take place on Tuesday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230102190222/http://news.sky.com/story/fifa-to-ask-every-country-to-name-a-stadium-in-honour-of-football-great-pele-gianni-infantino-says-12778523;skynews;sports;246
5491;5491;A four-day week? Pick your pay? The bosses fighting to lure workers with the perfect job;2023-01-03T17:05:46Z;['N/A'];['Work-life balance', 'Work & careers'];;Name: The perfect job. Age: As a dream, as old as paid work. Appearance: Like regular employment, but perfect. Hammock tester. Sorry? That’s my perfect job. I’m not sure there’s such a thing as a hammock tester. I was talking more in terms of a personalised working schedule and a tailored salary package. Listen, as long as I can lie in a hammock all day, they can pay me in packing peanuts. I’m not sure you understand the concept of the perfect job. I was about to say the same thing about you. Wouldn’t you like to choose how much remuneration you take in salary, how much in benefits and how much in company equity? Is that a trick question? No, it’s called customised compensation and it’s big in the US. Employers including Netflix have been doing it for a long time and now it’s trickling down to smaller companies. I decide how I get paid? Exactly. Some firms even let you convert unused holiday into money towards a retirement plan or student loan repayments. I don’t understand why they’re offering me a choice, unless they’re trying to rip me off. To stay competitive. Besides, different employees have different needs. Which is better, cash or equity? That depends on the company, the economy and you. “A year ago you’d see employees coming in, especially those from the coasts, wanting more equity,” one CEO told the Wall Street Journal. “Now they want more financial security and are choosing cash.” What else can I get? Hybrid working – choose when and how often you come into the office. I already have that, but I don’t choose. It just depends on when the rail strikes are. What about a four-day week? In Australia, several corporations are making plans to reduce the working week by 20% this year. If it amounts to less work for the same money, then yes please. Well, Kickstarter, which is trialling a four-day week, says its employees have been more productive since the pilot began. Sounds awfully like they’re actually doing more work. Another rip-off! Even if they are, that’s not the point – the workers are less stressed, more energised and more engaged. Why does this sort of thing seem to be happening only outside the UK? Perhaps it’s because we’re too busy sliding into a giant recession. Oh yeah. I’m sorry that none of this applies to you. Do say: “Fridays off? I guess I’ll have to start calling in sick on Thursdays.” Don’t say: “How would you like to receive your real-terms pay cut?”;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/03/four-day-week-pick-your-pay-bosses-perfect-job;guardian;entertainment & culture;5491

3774;3774;Chess: Carlsen takes on young guns at Wijk as world champion eyes record;2023-01-13T08:00:10Z;['Leonard Barden'];['Magnus Carlsen', 'Chess', 'Sport'];;"Magnus Carlsen versus the young guns at Wijk starts on Saturday, when the opening round (of 13) of the “chess Wimbledon” at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee gets under way at the windswept Dutch village. Carlsen, 32, the triple world champion at classical, rapid and blitz, takes on a grandmaster field which includes five teenagers – three from India, one each from Germany and Uzbekistan – all with dreams of dethroning the Norwegian. Carlsen’s own top priorities are to win Wijk for a record ninth time, see off the challenge from Generation Z, and hopefully to kickstart another attempt to scale his own elusive chess Everest of a 2900 rating, a target which he has twice missed by fewer than 20 points. A clear victory would confirm his current fine form in speed and online events, and justify his decision to renounce his classical crown along with its associated burden of months of pre-match work. The youngest of the challenging teenage quintet is Dommaraju Gukesh, 16, who at 12 narrowly missed becoming the youngest ever GM, and in 2022 won the Olympiad top board gold medal, and has beaten Carlsen online.
Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 17, was a prodigy who was headlined in this column at age 11. The Indian defeated Carlsen five times in internet tournaments during 2022, the only teen with multiple victories against the champion. Arjun Erigaisi, 19, began 2022 by winning the Wijk Challengers with 10.5/13, so qualifying for this year’s top group. He is the reigning Indian champion and has advanced consistently with hardly a setback. The most eye-catching fact about Erigaisi is that he recently landed what is probably the largest ever sponsorship deal for an individual player. He is being backed for $1.5m, spread over five years, by Singapore-based analytical trading company Quantbox, whose founder believes that the Indian will become world champion. Vincent Keymer, 18, was tipped for greatness by Garry Kasparov when the German was just 10. Keymer’s progress has accelerated in 2022, culminating in his silver medal behind Carlsen at last month’s World Rapid. Nodirbek Abdusattorov, 18, the 2021 World Rapid champion, is a dedicated player who led Uzbekistan to gold at the 2022 Olympiad and whose success has sparked state support for chess. Tashkent is likely to host the 2026 Olympiad. Two more teens are absent from Wijk, for very different reasons. The US’s Hans Niemann, 19, defeated Carlsen at the Sinquefield Cup in St Louis, sparking an ongoing saga of withdrawals, accusations and lawsuits which remain unresolved.
Alireza Firouzja, 19, seemed the heir apparent to Carlsen’s throne, but in 2021 the Iran-born Frenchman had a spat with the Wijk organisers over a final-round incident. Negotiations for the two following years have broken down due to his demands for compensation plus an elevated appearance fee. Firouzja missed many of the major chess occasions in 2022, leading to some outlandish rumours including one that he seeks a career away from chess in fashion design and a contradictory one where he is preparing to meet Carlsen in a breakaway world title match. Carlsen also has several rivals this weekend from his own generation. Following the Norwegian’s statement renouncing his crown, Ding Liren, China’s world No 2, will meet Ian Nepomniachtchi for the official championship, probably in Mexico City in April. The 2018 world title challenger and current US champion, Fabiano Caruana, has recently got back to near his best following some uneven results, while Wesley So triumphed in the Chess.com Global Classic, a premier online event. The Dutch pair of Jorden van Foreest, who won Wijk in 2021, and Anish Giri, a perennial contender, cannot be discounted, the oldest player Levon Aronian, 40, will be eager to do well after a disappointing 2022, while Richard Rapport, newly transferred from Hungary to Romania, has had several high placed finishes. The 14th player is Iran’s Parham Maghsoodloo, a late substitute for Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda. Round one pairings: Van Foreest (Neth) v So (US), Rapport (Rom) v Abdusattorov (Uzb), Caruana (US) v Giri (Neth), Gukesh (Ind) v Ding (Chn), Maghsoodloo (Irn) v Keymer (Ger), Carlsen (Nor) v Aronian (US), Praggnanandhaa (Ind) v Erigaisi (Ind). Tata Steel Wijk is sure to attract thousands of online spectators. Games start at 1pm, with rest days on 18, 23 and 26 January. Chess24 is a recommended viewing site, with free and live grandmaster and computer running commentaries on all the games.

29;29;Liz Truss’s growth agenda still haunting the corridors of Westminster;2023-01-31T20:08:01Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Liz Truss', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Economics', 'Business'];;Political rehabilitation is a gruelling exercise: no more so than for Liz Truss, who was consigned to the history books as Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister having shattered the Conservatives’ mantel for careful stewardship of the economy. But she is persisting, once again stalking the corridors of Westminster and keen to ensure her fiery campaign to “go for growth” does not tank like the markets did in response to the mini-budget last September. Out of the ashes of her ill-fated premiership has been born the Conservative Growth Group (CGG). On the surface, it is a caucus that will try to cajole Rishi Sunak to keep the flame of tax cuts and deregulation alive in the run up to the next general election. It is also undeniably a bid by former frontline politicians associated with the Truss administration who have little immediate prospect of being promoted into Sunak’s government of rebuilding their political careers. And given fears among Conservative MPs of a drubbing at the next general election, the group may act as an incubator of unashamedly pro-growth candidates that could replace Sunak in an ensuing leadership contest. So far, the CGG has proved a relatively tame thorn in the government’s side. A few dozen MPs have expressed interest in being members, but Truss was one of less than 20 who were said to have turned up to the last meeting. “The parliamentary party is not in a happy place,” said one member who was there. “This government has shown staggeringly little ambition for growth and some of us need to show [the chancellor] Jeremy Hunt he can’t just talk about it as an ambition – he’s got to deliver it.” Many of Truss’s former team of advisors have gone back to jobs they held before their brief stint in Downing Street, or secured new roles at consultancy and public affairs firms. One, sources said, is preparing to go to business school. Truss herself is keeping a low profile. “She’s using this caucus to show there is still political appetite for her agenda among a sector of the Conservative Party,” said one source. “But obviously her being too front and centre is toxic.” The figures fronting the CGG are Simon Clark, the young former levelling up secretary and Teeside MP, and Ranil Jayawardena, a former environment secretary in one of the safest Tory seats in the country – North East Hampshire. Those with knowledge of the group’s plans say specific policy interventions are being mulled on tax relief for childcare, liberalising planning restrictions and changes to the IR35 tax system. Pressure for more pro-growth initiatives are likely to build ahead of the spring budget. Though Hunt has signalled he is strictly focused on doing everything to bring down inflation, that has not stopped senior Tories – including the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith – pushing for a swifter pivot to using tax cuts to boost growth. To broaden out the CCG’s support, meetings have been held with several free-market thinktanks. Truss is said to have rekindled connections with her old associates at the Institute for Economic Affairs, which was one of the most vocal supporters of her project. “The Tufton Street project is dead but not necessarily buried,” said one Tory source. Another insider told the Guardian she was considering writing an inquest piece reflecting on her downfall but advocating for the emphasis on growth to remain – something her spokesperson did not deny. Though some Sunak supporters believe Truss’s programme has been so publicly discredited there will be little pressure for him to take the CGG seriously over the next 12 months, the group may have a more influential role in a future leadership contest. Some believe the CGG could build up a substantial bastion of support and become a breeding ground for contenders focused relentlessly on the growth, tax cutting and deregulation agenda. But sceptics say it is only likely to produce the equivalent candidate of John Redwood in the 1997 Tory leadership, who mustered a core group of supporters from the right of the party but ultimately failed to broaden his appeal to colleagues.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/31/liz-truss-conservative-growth-group-westminster;guardian;politics;29
3783;3783;Chocolate coats tongue to give melt-in-mouth sensation, study finds;2023-01-13T07:00:09Z;['Hannah Devlin'];['Science', 'Chocolate', 'Food', 'UK news', 'World news'];;The irresistible melt-in-the-mouth sensation of chocolate comes down to the way it lubricates the tongue, according to scientists. A study investigated the physical process by which a solid square of chocolate morphs into a smooth emulsion. It found that chocolate released a fatty film that coats the tongue, giving a smooth sensation for the entire time it is in the mouth. Dr Siavash Soltanahmadi, the study’s lead researcher at the University of Leeds, said the findings could be used to design low-fat chocolate that mimicked the sensation of a high-fat product. “We believe that a next generation of chocolate can be developed that offers the feel and sensation of high-fat chocolate yet is a healthier choice,” she said. Soltanahmadi and colleagues set out to investigate texture sensation using a luxury brand of dark chocolate and an artificial tongue. The device has a 3D-printed tongue-like texture, is kept at 37C (98.6F) and powered to move like a human tongue. They found that soon after the chocolate is placed in the mouth, the tongue becomes coated in a fatty layer, which depends on the fat content of the chocolate. After that, solid cocoa particles are released and they become important in terms of the tactile sensation, the researchers found. “We are showing that the fat layer needs to be on the outer layer of the chocolate, this matters the most, followed by effective coating of the cocoa particles by fat, these help to make chocolate feel so good,” she said. This implies that the fat deeper inside the chocolate plays a limited role in contributing to sensation and could be reduced without having an impact on how the chocolate feels in the mouth. The researchers suggested chocolate bars with a fat content gradient or a low-fat bar, coated in high-fat chocolate, might work well as a healthier alternative. Soltanahmadi said creating healthier chocolate was a challenge for the food industry because low-fat versions were not always as appetising. “Our research opens the possibility that manufacturers can intelligently design dark chocolate to reduce the overall fat content,” she said. “We believe dark chocolate can be produced in a gradient-layered architecture with fat covering the surface of chocolates and particles to offer the sought after self-indulging experience without adding too much fat inside the body of the chocolate.” The researchers suggested similar techniques could be applied to help design healthier versions of other foods that transform from a solid to a liquid in the mouth, such as ice-cream or cheese. The findings are published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/13/chocolate-coats-tongue-melt-imouth-sensation-study;guardian;science & technology;3783
863;863;Australian residents stuck overseas during Covid denied citizenship by government;2023-01-27T14:00:55Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['Australian immigration and asylum', 'Australia news', 'India', 'Australian politics'];;"The government is denying Australian citizenship to some residents who were trapped overseas by Covid travel restrictions through no fault of their own, an approach criticised as “harsh”. The administrative appeals tribunal recently ruled on an appeal by Farida Natalwala, an Indian citizen who has lived in Australia for roughly a decade. In January 2020, just before the pandemic hit, Natalwala travelled abroad to Saudi Arabia to see her son on a two-month trip, but was trapped by the sudden deployment of border restrictions. She was trapped out of Australia for 361 days. To achieve Australian citizenship, an applicant must not be out of the country for more than 90 days in the 12 months immediately prior to their application. The law gives the government no room for discretion, despite Natalwa doing nothing wrong. Natalwa applied for citizenship in January 2022 upon returning to Australia but her application was denied. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The AAT affirmed the decision. But it noted that nothing in its decision should “be taken to reflect on the applicant”. “A supervening event over which she had no control, being the global pandemic and the resultant travel restrictions imposed by the Australian government and many other national governments, made it very hard for her to depart Saudi Arabia and return to Australia as she had planned,” the tribunal said. “Unfortunately, there is no leeway in the general residence requirement for a person in Mrs Natalwala’s circumstances.
“This requirement must be met before her other eligibility for Australian citizenship can be assessed. The fact that it was not met was fatal to her application for citizenship proceeding.” The former immigration department deputy secretary, Abul Rizvi, described the approach as “harsh”. “It is harsh as the citizenship act does not anticipate closure of international borders,” he said. Rizvi said the government could consider changing the residency rules to make exceptions for such cases. It is unlikely the government would consider such reforms, given it is currently grappling with other major issues facing the immigration system, including delays in visa processing, its failure to address skills shortages, and widespread visa rorting. “I suspect [the government] has many more pressing immigration issues on its plate,” Rizvi said. “Unfortunately Mrs Natawala will need to stay in Australia for the requisite period as a permanent resident before she re-applies for citizenship.” The home affairs department said it could not comment on individual cases. But in a statement, a spokesperson said citizenship applications must meet the residency requirements. “Under the Act, a person satisfies the general residence requirement if they were lawfully present in Australia for four years immediately before the day they made the application with 12 months as a permanent resident, and was absent from Australia for no more than 12 months over this four year period and 90 days within the 12 months immediately before application,” the department said. “The Act also provides for Ministerial discretion to be applied to assist an applicant to meet the general residence requirement in certain circumstances, including where the person is the spouse, de facto partner or surviving spouse or de facto partner of an Australian citizen at the time their application is made.” The processing of citizenship applications is also suffering from delays, though wait times appear to be improving. About 90% of applicants for Australian citizenship by conferral are currently waiting 15 months to have their applications processed, About 90% of approved applicants will then wait another seven months for a citizenship ceremony. This time last year, 90% of applications were processed within 24 months.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/australian-residents-stuck-overseas-during-covid-denied-citizenship-by-government;guardian;politics;863

Constance Marten, Mark Gordon and their child have been missing for 12 days, prompting a police search. Gordon was jailed in the late 1980s in Florida after raping and assaulting a woman when he was 14. After serving a 20-year sentence he was deported back to the UK in 2010. Napier Marten, an aristocratic film and music producer with links to the royal family, said in a message to his daughter that she was “much loved” and should find safety. Police have been searching for the couple since their car broke down and caught fire on the M61 near Farnworth, Bolton, on 5 January. Police believe the baby may have been born in the car, and was less than two days old.
Sending a message to his daughter in an interview with the Independent, Napier Marten, 63, said: “I want you to understand that you are much much loved whatever the circumstances. We are deeply concerned for your and your baby’s welfare.” Constance Marten was a drama student when she met Gordon in 2016 and led an increasingly isolated life with him, cutting ties with family and friends. Her father, who said he had known about Gordon’s criminal conviction for some time, said: “The past eight years have been beyond painful for all the family as well as your friends, as they must have been for you. And to see you so vulnerable again is testing in the extreme.” Police said neither she nor her baby had received medical attention since the birth. The couple are understood to have a substantial amount cash with them, which would allow them to evade the authorities. They have been seen in Essex, Kent and London. In an appeal to her, Napier Marten said: “Darling Constance, even though we remain estranged at the moment, I stand by, as I have always done and as the family has always done, to do whatever is necessary for your safe return to us. “I beseech you to find a way to turn yourself and your wee one in to the police as soon as possible, so you and he or she can be protected. Only then can a process of healing and recovery begin, however long it may take, however difficult it may be. “I would like you to understand that the family will do all that is needed for your wellbeing.” Constance Marten grew up in the Dorset estate of Crichel House. Her grandmother was a playmate to Princess Margaret and her father was once a page to Queen Elizabeth II. Napier Marten added: “I would like to extend my gratitude to the police for all their endeavours in bringing this tragic episode to a swift and safe conclusion and appeal to you, please Constance, find the courage to present yourself to the police as soon as possible.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/19/constance-marten-estranged-father-missing-woman-mark-gordon;guardian;entertainment & culture;2586

PH Film choices Crimes of the Future (David Cronenberg, 2022), 10.10pm, Sky Cinema Premiere
David Cronenberg returns to the body horror that made his name, and it’s every bit as twisted as you’d hope. In a dilapidated near future, Saul Tenser – Cronenberg regular Viggo Mortensen – makes performance art from the mysterious new organs his body keeps producing. In perversely erotic shows, they are surgically removed by his partner Caprice (Léa Seydoux). Lurking around are Kristen Stewart’s sly organ registry official and Scott Speedman’s plastic-eating radical. It’s a netherworld of accelerated evolution, where extreme body modification has become the hot new thing. Disturbing and graphic, but thoughtful – just the way Cronenberg likes it. Simon Wardell Bohemian Rhapsody (Bryan Singer, Dexter Fletcher 2018), 9pm, Channel 4 “Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?” The biopic of Queen singer Freddie Mercury stays reasonably true to the facts, which contain enough drama not to need embellishing. Bookended by the band’s triumphant Live Aid concert in 1985, it follows Mercury as he joins the group and makes them all stars – while coming to terms with his sexuality and, ultimately, the hollowness of fame. Rami Malek won an Oscar for his sympathetic, tortured Freddie, and the film wisely keeps the focus on him rather than his beige bandmates.

Felix Sohounde Peperipé – a Beninese journalist who has been working as one of the confederation’s media officers on a freelance basis during the tournament for African players playing in their national leagues – was sent home this week after a hearing of the Caf disciplinary committee in Algiers. According to the disciplinary committee’s decision, made public by Caf, the alleged victim said that he “attacked” her last weekend, “trying to kiss her” after she went to his hotel room to collect accreditation documents. “She pushed him and ran out of the bedroom,” reads the decision.
The alleged incident was reported to Caf and Peperipé was provisionally suspended for “indecent conduct until he provides the disciplinary jury with a response to the said allegations”. It has emerged that another alleged victim has come forward claiming that she experienced “indecent behaviour” from Peperipé in Cameroon two years ago. “Victim ‘Y’ detailed that Mr Felix Sohounde Peperipé offered her to come to his room and that he will pay her the necessary amount for such an act,” the statement said. Caf’s disciplinary jury heard from both alleged victims before deciding to suspend Peperipé. A complaint has been lodged with Algerian police alleging sexual assault but it is not known whether Peperipé will face charges. Peperipé has denied the accusations, saying they are a plot to “sully his reputation”.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/26/banned-confederation-of-african-football-media-officer-accused-of-more-indecent-behaviour;guardian;sports;1113
2053;2053;Ron DeSantis moves to permanently ban Covid mandates in Florida;2023-01-21T20:25:56Z;['Maya Yang'];['Florida', 'US news', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];;Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis has announced a proposal to permanently ban Covid mandates in the state. In a press release issued earlier this week, DeSantis said that he has proposed legislation to “make permanent Covid freedoms in Florida”, adding that the “strong pro-freedom, anti-mandate action will permanently protect Floridians from losing their jobs due to Covid vaccine mandates, protects parents’ rights, and institutes additional protections that prevent discrimination based on Covid vaccine status”. The proposal includes permanently banning mask requirements throughout the state, prohibiting vaccine and mask requirements in schools, prohibiting Covid passports in the state, and prohibiting employers from hiring or firing based on Covid vaccines, all in attempts to protect Floridians from the “biomedical security state”. The proposal also claims to protect “medical freedom of speech” by promising to protect medical professionals’ freedom of speech, the right to disagree with the “preferred narrative of the medical community,” as well as the religious views of medical professionals. “When the world lost its mind, Florida was a refuge of sanity, serving strongly as freedom’s lynchpin,” DeSantis said in the announcement of his proposal. “These measures will ensure Florida remains this way and will provide landmark protections for free speech for medical practitioners.” The recent proposal follows DeSantis’s repeated criticisms of Covid mandates. In 2021, DeSantis signed a series of measures that sought to protect Floridians from pandemic mandates set forth by local governments, which he called “unscientific, unnecessary directives”. Florida’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, supported DeSantis’s proposal, saying: “As a health sciences researcher and physician, I have personally witnessed accomplished scientists receive threats due to their unorthodox positions.” “However, many of these positions have proven to be correct, as we’ve all seen over the past few years. All medical professionals should be encouraged to engage in scientific discourse without fearing for their livelihoods or their careers,” he added. Last year, Ladapo announced that Florida will formally recommend against Covid vaccinations for healthy children. “We’re kind of scraping at the bottom of the barrel, particularly with healthy kids, in terms of actually being able to quantify with any accuracy and any confidence the even potential of benefit,” he said. The announcement contradicted guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Last December, DeSantis petitioned the Florida supreme court to have a grand jury investigate whether Floridians were misled by Covid vaccine manufacturers over the shots’ potential side effects. The court granted DeSantis’s petition, and the grand jury will convene for a year before forming a decision.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/21/ron-desantis-covid-mandates-florida;guardian;health;2053
5547;5547;It’s showtime! Stage sensations to watch out for in 2023;2023-01-03T11:58:29Z;['Chris Wiegand'];['Stage', 'Culture', 'Theatre', 'Dance', 'Stagecraft', 'Musicals', 'Bristol Old Vic', 'Bush theatre', 'National Theatre'];;"Mei Mac Somewhere backstage at the Barbican there’s a giant cuddly Totoro and I can’t be alone in wanting to dive on top of it. That’s testament to My Neighbour Totoro’s puppet masters, of course, but also to the warm performance of Mei Mac as the younger of the Kusakabe sisters who encounter the furry forest sprite. The scene in which she scales the sleeping creature’s tummy is a delight. As her namesake, Mei, she veers between happy-as-can-be glee, determination and distress whether through mile-a-minute dialogue or, just as effectively, in silence. Adult actors playing kids can grate but Mac fully inhabits her character and lets us see the others through her eyes. On TV, she has already starred in Call the Midwife and Nigel Ng’s sketch show East Mode. Totoro is at the Barbican for a few more weeks – it will be fascinating to see what happens next for the show and for her. Sung Im Her
Margaret Perry’s Paradise Now! is a play that’s as much an earworm as the tracks by Nicki Minaj and Sophie that power its production at the Bush (where it runs until 21 January). The show’s impact is boosted by the movement direction of Sung Im Her, the South Korean choreographer who studied under Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker at Parts in Brussels and has collaborated with Les Ballets C de la B and Needcompany. She has created her own hypnotic dance pieces for 10 years – one of the latest is Everything Falls Dramatic – and with Paradise Now! she proved how stylish movement direction can turbocharge a drama, not just in the play’s off-kilter party sequences (including a frenzied night of bowling) but also its most fragile moments and even the scene changes in between. Frankie Bradshaw Was there a better looking play in 2022 than Blues for an Alabama Sky at the National Theatre? Frankie Bradshaw designs rooms you can smell on sight and costumes you can sense on your skin. Her revolving Harlem tenement block set teemed with life and those slinky silks, Sunday best suits and choice accoutrements brought out the dreams and fears of every one of Pearl Cleage’s characters. A former Linbury prize finalist, Bradshaw also designed an eye-popping, chessboard-floored Hamlet for kids at the National. That show returns in March and this year she also designs Unexpected Twist, an adaptation of Michael Rosen’s take on Oliver Twist. Maimuna Memon
Where to begin with Lancashire’s Maimuna Memon? She’s an accomplished composer and lyricist for theatre. She’s a superb actor with credits including Mary Magdalene in Jesus Christ Superstar at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre. She’s a singer-songwriter who released her first open-hearted singles in 2022. And, at last year’s Edinburgh festival, Memon brought all those talents to bear in her mesmerising gig-theatre show Manic Street Creature, which drew mellifluous wisdom from even the most inharmonious plot turns. Also a founding member of Wildcard theatre company for emerging artists, she’s next to be seen in the Richard Hawley musical Standing at the Sky’s Edge at the National Theatre. Sophie Ellerby Back in 2006, a teenage Sophie Ellerby played Pob in Shane Meadows’ film This Is England. Based in the East Midlands, the actor went on to become a playwright and her blistering account of adolescence, Lit, was staged by HighTide in 2019. She then reunited with Lit’s director, Stef O’Driscoll, for To Whom it May Concern, a play about welfare and homelessness staged by Cardboard Citizens. Ellerby excels at portraying teenage lives and often works with youth theatres – last year her new play Painkiller was presented by the Stratford East Young Company while trainee actors at the Lyric Hammersmith put on her update of Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, set around a protest at an STI clinic. Now she’s developing her own screen projects, too. Ross Willis I can’t wait to see Grim Brenda which is due to be staged at the Orange Tree and offers the enticing pairing of maverick director Ned Bennett (of Pomona fame) and playwright Ross Willis (who had his own cult hit with his debut play Wolfie in 2019). Each deliver the unexpected with productions that can seem nothing less than quests to tap theatre’s magical potential. In Wonder Boy at Bristol Old Vic, Willis’s dialogue fired around the stage like a pinball and showed he had an affinity with youthful turbulence. Grim Brenda finds seven-year-old Binky and his teddy bear on a mission to thwart a 2,000-year-old demon. Sounds like a walk in the park for Willis. Tyrell Williams
Three young men’s life goals emerged through kickabout sessions at their local sports ground in Red Pitch, the debut of playwright Tyrell Williams at the Bush in 2022. Williams had previously co-created the viral YouTube series #HoodDocumentary and been an assistant director on plays at the Young Vic and the Gate. Red Pitch came with a hat-trick of brilliantly written roles and won him a handful of prizes including the George Devine award for an original new stage play by a promising playwright. It proved he can create comedy, pathos and tension through documenting a shifting sense of place as well as complex characters who are themselves on the cusp. Hayley Grindle The return of Iphigenia in Splott last year was a cause for celebration, not just for Sophie Melville’s performance but for Hayley Grindle’s equally indelible design for Gary Owen’s white hot monologue. The designer started 2022 with a bold Macbeth at Leeds Playhouse and created a striking set for the touring musical play Blood Harmony. Accessibility and creative captioning have been at the heart of such productions as The Boy With Two Hearts, first seen at Wales Millennium Centre in 2021, where she ingeniously and powerfully presented the precarious spaces shared by one family as they flee the Taliban. This year she reunites with Owen and Splott’s director Rachel O’Riordan for Romeo and Julie at the Sherman in Cardiff and the National Theatre. Alex Howarth
The relationship between three siblings was at the heart of last year’s Edinburgh fringe hit Cassie and the Lights but the play’s writer, director and designer Alex Howarth also ensured an uncommonly moving bond between them and the audience. Assured, authentic, brilliantly performed and imaginatively staged for the company Patch of Blue, it deserves to be widely seen. Assistant director on Richard Eyre’s La Traviata at the Royal Opera House and creator of an inclusive panto at Applecart Arts in east London, Howarth clearly works with care, mirth and musicality. Nancy Medina Bristol Old Vic’s new artistic director takes up her post in March, succeeding the esteemed Tom Morris, and it will be intriguing to see what she has in store for the UK’s longest continuously running theatre. Medina has directed plays including Two Trains Running at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton and The Darkest Part of the Night at the Kiln. Originally from New York, she has long been based in Bristol and is dedicated to making accessible theatre. Her response to securing the role was inspiring: “It will be a great honour to listen, reflect and engage with the people of Bristol and together imagine what the future of theatre and the arts can be in this shining city of the south-west.”";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/03/its-showtime-stage-sensations-to-watch-out-for-in-2023;guardian;entertainment & culture;5547
41;41;‘It’s about the future’: parents on the school strikes in England and Wales;2023-01-31T19:17:06Z;['Clea Skopeliti'];['Schools', 'Education', 'UK news'];;"Members of the National Education Union (NEU) will strike in schools across England and Wales on Wednesday in the first of seven days of industrial action that is expected to impact tens of thousands of schools. A poll of teachers by the surveying app Teacher Tapp suggests that up to three in every five schools in England could be closed or partly closed on Wednesday. Five parents share how they and their children will be affected by school closures, and their views on the strikes. ‘My parents-in-law are looking after our kids’
“We’ve had an email from my children’s (ages three and six) school today to say they will be closing on Wednesday. We are very privileged in that my wife’s parents don’t live too far away, and have agreed to look after them. I would have been prepared to take a day off if not – I can’t really work with them at home. “In my experience teachers are some of the most dedicated, caring and hard-working of public sector workers. They consistently go above and beyond and have been rewarded with many years of poor pay, poor conditions and increased workloads as well as the risky and highly stressful situation they were placed in as a result of the pandemic. It’s shameful that the government have placed them in situation where they are forcing teachers to strike.” Matthew Rodriguez, 43, social worker in London ‘I’m more than happy to lose work to support the teachers’ “I have two children, a six-year-old and a nine-year-old. My youngest is having lessons as normal, but my eldest will be off school all day. I’m having to miss a full day of work, which I’m more than happy to do to support the teachers. I had the choice between taking it as holiday or losing a day’s wages – I decided to lose a day and save my holiday for family time instead. “Teachers are underpaid, unappreciated, and don’t have the support or tools they need. In 2020, we were calling them heroes for working through Covid. They have been constantly underfunded while private schools get tax relief and cuts. I have friends who are teachers, they do their prep and planning from home, marking from home outside their hours, they tell me they can’t slow down for the ones that need help and can’t speed up for the ones that are achieving. They shape the future for our children and they are being let down.” Benny, 35, cybersecurity apprentice in Newcastle ‘My daughter is missing out on SAT preparation’
“My daughter is 10 years old and currently preparing for her SATs. Her school is going to close tomorrow. She’s struggling a little in maths and has been put in additional groups so she’ll be missing out on that as well. I’ve got a tutor to support my daughter in the run-up to the SATs and hope that this is enough to get her through – we’ve asked him to do more hours because of strikes. “I’m a former lecturer in further education and I went on several strikes regarding pay and working conditions. I’m in complete support of the strike – teachers have been ignored for far too long, working under less than fair conditions. It’s just unfortunate it comes at such a crucial time. Her school will also be shut for three days in March. I know it seems small but it’s also the extra hours of [maths] support that are provided for those who are struggling. I have had to take annual leave on Wednesday, and have cancelled a few appointments in March.” Dr Mine Conkbayir, 42, early years author and consultant in London ‘The strikes are every parent’s worst nightmare’ “My seven-year-old son’s school has confirmed they will be closed tomorrow, unfortunately. It’s every parent’s nightmare. I’m a single parent working six days a week. I own my own business and can’t take the day off – it would be a lot of money to lose as the business would have to close for the day and there’s longterm effects on losing customers. “Luckily I’ve managed to get my mum to look after him on Wednesday – she had to take time off work from her job as a tailor. If it happens again, I don’t know if she’ll be available. I also won’t be able to do any school work with my son, he’s going to be behind if this happens – it’s so worrying.” Marjan Sangsefidi, 40, owns a barbershop in Leeds ‘This is about the future’
“My ten-year-old’s school will remain open on Wednesday as far as we know, but they won’t know for sure until the day. I’m a widow and have no childcare support so will be balancing work commitments with looking after my child. “I’m lucky, I would possibly be able to work from home – I might look at taking an impromptu day’s leave. It wouldn’t be ideal – I’m in a very small team with another lone parent with two small boys. “But I fully support the teachers. This isn’t about my being inconvenienced, nor about my child being glum and bored for a day or two. This is about the future. This is about preserving good teaching staff in the profession, paying them well and valuing them. Schools are so important in the community – they pick up so much slack from other underfunded agencies. If they need to strike to be heard, then so be it.” Rebecca Strong, 49, reporter in Gosport";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/31/its-about-the-future-parents-on-the-school-strikes-in-england-and-wales;guardian;politics;41
5872;5872;Hangovers through the ages – in all their cherry-tinged glory | Eva Wiseman;2023-01-01T08:00:42Z;['Eva Wiseman'];['Life and style', 'Hangover cures', 'Health & wellbeing'];;"Happy new hangover to all who celebrate! I trust your decorations are up, the wreath of tins, the decorative cigarette butts, the thick yellow air of a night well had. I don’t drink much these days, so when I do it is an occasion: a celebration of friends and liver function. New year is one of those occasions, a boundary of time which we cross with alcohol and sorrow. Unlike when moving house or having a baby, beyond the bottles we wearily survey in the morning there is no sign of anything having changed when the year turns – instead it is a celebration of time itself, a chance to note its strangeness and speed, the way we carry it behind us like the train of a dress, and a chance to brace for the oncoming year. Vodka is advised, sometimes necessary. But over the course of a life, its effects and textures evolve. So far, I have witnessed the following ages of hangover… Teenagers: a teenage hangover hits like a water balloon, equal part exhilarating and maddening. Unpeeling yourself from a schoolfriend’s sofa, there is an air of slapstick hilarity as you spin in yesterday’s T-shirt through their sleeping house to find a receptacle for your cherry-flavoured vomit. This is sick like you’ve never sicked before – some Alice in Wonderland sorcery here – with the first sick you get bigger, a thousand feet tall and grand like an adult, with the second you shrink down to the size of a thumb, specifically your own thumb, which in a lamentable moment last night you raised when you passed Bethany Kim outside the Nisa Local oh God oh God. But when the vomit has been evacuated, so has the hangover, and you return to your body with new wonder at the world, and the infinite freedoms it contains. Twenties: alcohol is bravery medicine. Newly hatched into the adult world, you have been building yourself daily as if out of Lego, trying to find a shape that fits. You have a drink, the pieces rearrange, you have another, and the pieces snap on to someone else. The next day you wake crushed into the wall in somebody else’s navy-sheeted single bed, and retch politely as you note the lack of pillow case. You could close your eyes and charm yourself back through time into the lust and honesty of 3am, but instead you will grim your body out of the bed, overpowered suddenly by the smell of your own burnt breath, and drink two litres of Coke on the way home. Here you will relax into the fleecy feel of your housemates’ group hangover and order pizza. As the alcohol seeps from your skin it will be replaced by a cloudy kind of poetry, and you’ll tell the story of last night as if an epic war movie. The evening after is what the drinking was for; you always forget this. Thirties: where once you’d save ticket stubs and ribbons in a box under your bed, now you keep memories of nights, not just out of fondness but also as little warnings. Alcohol has become a sort of WD40 for your social life – you no longer have time to ease into an afternoon of gossip, you must pack three nights out into a single evening, and the bottles empty quickly. The hangovers are worth it, and you maintain this, you repeat this to yourself and whoever will listen, they are worth it, even if sometimes they bring shuddering waves of anxiety and shame. Oh God oh God, the memories scrape against your eyelids, oh God oh God, you check your sent messages. Your body feels like a lost mitten, propped up dolefully on a gate. Why didn’t you have children? Why didn’t you marry that boy with the navy sheets? Why did you have children? Why did you marry that boy with the navy sheets? Wine lubricates parenthood too, and the hangovers feel suitably punishing – you deserve this grinding stomach, this blood-temperature exhaustion, it’s good for you. This is the age some people decide the hang is not worth the over. This is also the age in which it can bring shattering truths – the pit of the hangover becomes a therapist’s couch, where you are both therapist and therapee, and emerge into the daylight scarred but whole, and perhaps with a limp. Forties: you drink to the loving memory of fun. You have a cocktail shaker now, and there’s something vaguely fabulous about mixing oneself a Martini while the telly screams bad news into your living room. And when the hangover arrives, you welcome it as if an old friend visiting from the city – what have you brought me this time, old friend? What violence and greed, and unlikely takeaway orders, and awful realities, and late-night eBay purchases, and long-dead arguments hidden in the ancient burial grounds of conversation, and unflattering camera angles, and stifling compliments, and awkward phone calls, and movements that cause one’s back to go, and regrets and kittens, and old episodes of Have I Got News for You, and freezing cold opinions, and typing with empathy into the internet before quickly deleting it, and what photos will you press into my eyes as a memory from my photo app, and what filters? You light a fire, you settle in.

1185;1185;Britain, here’s a plan: stop applying old fixes to new problems. And stop obsessing about growth | David Edgerton;2023-01-26T06:00:53Z;['David Edgerton'];"['Economics', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'UK news', 'Tax and spending', ""Workers' rights"", 'Public sector pay', 'Labour', 'Austerity', 'Brexit', 'Climate crisis']";;"According to our politicians and most of the media, the central problem facing the British economy is a lack of growth. We need growth, we are told, to pay for this or that public service, or good wages, or housing. Just this week it was reported that the chancellor would need to plan further cuts in expenditure as a result of the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrading the UK’s growth prospects. But we should beware framing the lack of growth as the main affliction. In any case, the solutions to the growth problem have been tried and largely failed, whether the austerity of the Cameron years, the tax cuts proposed by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng or the innovation promised by all governments since the 1990s. The problems of the present are genuinely novel, and require not so much growing the British economy as transforming it. Since the great financial crisis of 2008, the UK economy has grown very slowly by historical standards. This has been widely discussed by economists, who have cited a stagnation in productivity, which means GDP per person, or per hour worked. The low level of labour productivity growth, some 0.5% per year between 2008 and 2020, is indeed unprecedented in British economic history since the 18th century. Yet as far as public discourse was concerned, this fall in productivity growth was long disguised by a deluded revivalism according to which the economy had become so successful that it could take its leave of Europe, and take on the world. After the general realisation that Brexit has made things worse, and that the real wages of public sector workers are collapsing, along with the services themselves, that fantasy appears to have dissolved – and political commentators have now turned back to lamenting the problems of the British economy. But as the economic historian Adam Tooze has correctly pointed out, political analysis has not yet taken on board either the extraordinary longevity and novelty of Britain’s stagnating productivity, or the partly separate fall in living standards that so many people have experienced. Instead we are falling back on old and inappropriate analyses. Politicians speak of the need to grow the metaphorical pie before we can all get a piece of it. The problem here is that we need to update our analysis of the relationship between productivity growth and equality. They once grew together: as the economy grew, so did workers’ share of a rapidly growing pie. But that link was broken in the 1980s. Whether the economy was stagnating or growing, the rich have been taking a bigger slice of the cake for decades now. Consider this thought experiment. One way to increase the rate of growth of the British economy, and increase equality, would be to reverse the economic history of the last 50 years and return to the economy we had in the 1970s. Of course, that is not possible, or desirable, but it does make the point that the dynamics of the economy have changed. As well as a crisis of productivity, we face a mounting crisis of wealth inequality and income misdistribution, not least in the hugely unequal housing wealth that was caused, in part, by our model of economic growth. This needs urgent action, irrespective of whether the economy grows or not. Indeed, we may find that direct redistributive measures to deal with these problems will themselves stimulate productivity.
The old declinist panaceas, which featured so prominently in previous periods of concern about growth, are with us again. In the past, as today, declinism was accompanied by calls for austerity, wage cuts and the loss of workers’ rights. The demands of the cruel world supposedly demanded belt-tightening. This is a key reason why I have long argued against the temptations of declinism for the left. But there are other, more appealing, declinist theses that are wrong, too, such as Rishi Sunak’s bathetic proposal for compulsory maths education till 18, or the need for more entrepreneurs, and more competition, and more globalisation, all of which would supposedly put the UK in the lead once more. Our culture is saturated with cliches dressed as innovations. Indeed much of what has happened to the economy and to society since the 1970s has been driven by old policies – tax cuts, policies to stimulate entrepreneurship – that were supposed to reverse the decline. An even graver problem than the failure to grow is that we can’t afford more growth of the current sort. Twenty-first century growth still means more cars on the road, more flights, more concrete roads and runways, more plastic and more greenhouse gas emissions. What’s needed is change: radical changes in the size of different industries, and in the nature of many. Are we ready to imagine a smaller aviation sector, fewer cars and fewer cattle farmers? A green Industrial Revolution means more of some jobs and fewer of others. Whatever the average overall growth rate, we need structural change, transformation from which there will be winners and losers.
Labour is calling for a greener, more national economy, a more unionised labour force and more attention to the everyday, foundational economy. As Michael Jacobs has pointed out, its policies are in these respects very much closer to those of Corbyn’s Labour than New Labour. But the political presentation points in a very different direction. Labour has publicly adopted a pro-growth, austerity-till-we-get-it position. It has sung the praises of “sound money” and seems to dream of once against achieving British leadership in hi-tech through entrepreneurship. It is claiming that what we have seen over the last Tory years is inaction, “sticking-plaster politics”. This is too tempting a thesis: it is true that, in contrast to the politics of spin and gesture, we need a politics of real change rather than hype, of really building hospitals rather than lying about them; of really decarbonising rather than spinning technical fixes. But the “sticking plaster” rhetoric actually disguises a serious problem for Starmer. The Tories have hardly been inactive since 2010: they have pushed through huge cuts in much of the public sector (while recently increasing public spending overall) and utterly transformed the nation through Brexit. They built on the politics of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and New Labour. Indeed we need to understand that all the governments since 1979 have been transformational – it is their actions, not supposed lack of action, that we need to understand. What is needed now are different sorts of actions, pointing in different directions, not more of the same pretending it is novel. More of the same will simply deepen our problems, not solve them.

3990;3990;Savings: Britons urged to act soon as some interest rates pass 4%;2023-01-12T07:00:04Z;['Miles Brignall'];['Savings rates', 'Savings', 'Banks and building societies', 'Money', 'Banking', 'Business', 'UK news'];;If you are one of the millions of people whose savings are languishing in an account paying little or no interest, it might be time to act because you could be earning 4.25%, or more on your cash. Earlier this week the Coventry building society warned that Britons have a collective £268bn sitting in easy and instant access accounts paying no interest – an increase of more than £9.6bnon a year ago. After a long period when interest rates on savings accounts were so poor – typically zero or 0.1% – it appears that consumers have got out of the habit of moving their money to get a better deal. But, fast forward to 2023, and interest rates are back to the point where this exercise is worthwhile. This week Ford Money relaunched its savings products and is offering 4.25% for those prepared to lock their money away for a year – or 4.5% for those signing up to its two-year bonds. These are savings rates that seemed unthinkable, even until relatively recently. “Just over a year ago, when the base rate was still at 0.10%, the best easy access account on the market was paying about 0.71% – today Zopa is offering 2.86%, four times as much,” Anna Bowes, who runs the Savings Champion website, said. “In terms of what that means for the pounds in your pocket, if you have £50,000 in an account paying 0.71%, that would produce interest of £355 a year. If you are instead earning 2.86%, your £50,000 would earn £1,430 per annum. People really need to check what they are getting. For example, Virgin Money is offering just 0.25% on its Everyday Saver easy access account. It’s important to make sure you are not languishing in one of these poor paying accounts,” she said. Savers who want to keep some access to their money can get 3.35% by opting for a notice account. OakNorth Bank is offering that rate to savers prepared to give it 120 days (about four months) if they want to make a withdrawal. You can also get 3.2% on 90-day notice accounts with several other providers, which will be a better bet if you think you’ll need the money sooner. While the big banks continue to pay low rates to online savers – typically 0.5%, customers can get significantly better rates even within the same bank, which makes it considerably easier to switch. For example, Barclays is paying 0.5% on its “everyday” saver, or a much more palatable 4% on its one-year flexible cash Isa. Jeremy Cox, head of strategy at the Coventry building society, says that towards the end of 2022 money going into interest-paying easy access accounts hit an all-time high of £1tn, but that more than £268bn of household savings was still sitting in accounts earning zero interest. “As we enter the new year, rates of about 3% are readily available in the savings market and we expect money going into zero-paying easy access accounts to lower as savers shift money into higher-rate accounts to maximise their savings pots,” Cox said.;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/12/savings-accounts-interest-rates-savings-accounts-deals;guardian;business & economy;3990

It is a relief to escape the constant buffeting and descend into the shelter of the river’s gorge, into still air heavy with woodland aromas of wet soil and decay. Ahead, a wren – furtive, wary, tail cocked – glances in my direction then vanishes among fallen leaves. On one side of the narrow footpath, there’s a steep drop into the river; on the other, a low cliff where my line of sight is level with lichen-encrusted rock, tree roots, tangled ivy and an emerald carpet of mosses under elegant, arching fern fronds. Tiny, translucent, ephemeral toadstools digest dead leaves’ soft tissues, until only the skeleton of their veins remains.
There is so much life down here, even in mid-winter, nurtured by last autumn’s decomposing debris. It’s the season for new moss growth, stimulated by sunlight flooding through a bare tree canopy. In a two-inch tall rainforest, fresh shoots of hart’s-tongue thyme-moss, Plagiomnium undulatum, are weaving their way through filigree branches of tamarisk moss, Thuidium tamariscinum. There is the promise of spring in the irrepressible energy of new foliage. Hard-tipped bluebell leaves, and stems of dog’s mercury bearing clusters of green flower buds, are shouldering aside matted beech leaves, straightening, reaching for the light. Wild arum, spearing through soft ground, unfurling its arrowhead leaves. Tentative runners of barren strawberry, inching across the soil surface. Some pungent sprouting wild garlic bulbs have been dislodged by rain, and delicate seedlings of herb Robert and goosegrass are everywhere, already well established. Hidden somewhere here, in wrens’ world, lives a menagerie of springtails, worms, slugs, woodlice, millipedes and countless other small invertebrates. This is where the green fuse is lit, where spring stirs, here on a woodland floor. It’s all so easily overlooked, underfoot. I had come, armed with binoculars, intent on looking for birds in treetops. I left with a belated new year resolution: to crouch more often, for a wren’s-eye view of life, despite these ageing knees that are becoming as creaky as some of those wind-tortured branches overhead. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/country-diary-much-to-be-found-in-the-two-inch-tall-rainforest;guardian;environment;2864
8644;8644;'Faulty and ambiguous' government guidance partially to blame for Grenfell Tower tragedy, Michael Gove admits;Sunday 29 January 2023 03:58, UK;[];['grenfell tower'];['guidance', 'mr', 'system', 'grenfell', 'partially', 'blame', 'ambiguous', 'tower', 'michael', 'companies', 'tragedy', 'gove', 'faulty', 'final', 'inquiry', 'department'];"The government is partially to blame for the Grenfell Tower tragedy because of ""faulty and ambiguous"" government guidance, Michael Gove has said.

The housing secretary added the guidance allowed ""unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy"".

He made the admission in an interview with The Sunday Times as he placed a deadline on unsafe blocks.

The fire at the residential tower block in North Kensington, west London, in June 2017 killed 72 people and triggered a public inquiry.

The inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is yet to deliver its final report,

Evidence to the inquiry showed official guidance was widely seen to allow highly flammable cladding on tall buildings.

When asked if accepted the rules were wrong Mr Gove replied: ""Yes.

""There was a system of regulation that was faulty. The government did not think hard enough, or police effectively enough, the whole system of building safety. Undoubtedly.""

""I believe that (the guidance) was so faulty and ambiguous that it allowed unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy,"" Mr Gove added.

It comes after the inquiry's final hearing in November heard that firms appeared to have used the inquiry to ""position themselves for any legal proceedings"" that may follow it, instead of showing remorse.

Image: Michael Gove has admitted guidance was 'faulty and ambiguous'

In closing submissions, lead counsel Richard Millett KC accused companies of a ""merry go round of buck-passing"" in order to protect their own interests.

On Monday, the housing secretary will announce a six-week deadline for developers to sign a government contract to fix their unsafe towers - or be banned from the market.

""Those who haven't (signed) will face consequences. They will not be able to build new homes,"" Mr Gove added.

The minister will use the so-called ""responsible actor scheme"", to be established in the spring, to block such companies from getting planning or building control approval.

Sky News learnt that major companies including Barratt Developments and Persimmon are preparing for the imminent signing of a legally binding contract with the government that could ultimately cost the industry £5bn or more.

One executive said they expected the final contract to be signed and unveiled as soon as next week, although they cautioned that the timing remained fluid.

Last year, dozens of developers signed a pledge to fix buildings constructed since the early 1990s, with revisions to the deal with government in recent weeks having focused on the scope of companies' exposure.

The Grenfell inquiry heard many of the companies involved in the tragedy have failed to accept blame for their role in the events prior to the disaster, showing what Mr Millett called a ""lack of respect"" for the victims and their families.

The inquiry also heard from Jason Beer KC, for the department of levelling up, housing and communities, who said the department ""apologises unreservedly"" for its failure to recognise weaknesses in the regulatory system.

""The department recognises that it failed to appreciate it held an important stewardship role over the regime and that as a result it failed to grasp the opportunities to assess whether the system was working as intended,"" he said.

""For the department's failure to realise that the regulatory system was broken and that it might lead to a catastrophe such as this, the department is truly sorry and apologises unreservedly.""

Concluding the hearing, inquiry chairman Sir Martin said the panel had already started working on its final report and promised to produce it ""as soon as we can"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129040206/http://news.sky.com/story/faulty-and-ambiguous-government-guidance-partially-to-blame-for-grenfell-tower-tragedy-michael-gove-admits-12798090;skynews;politics;2735
5082;5082;River of melted butter blocks Wisconsin waterway after fire at dairy plant;2023-01-05T17:14:05Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['Wisconsin', 'US news'];;A fire that broke out a Wisconsin dairy plant on Monday night sent a river of melted butter flowing across the factory floor and into nearby storm drains, where it clogged a historic water artery. The conflagration erupted at an Associated Milk Producers facility in Portage around 9pm local time, firefighters said on Wednesday. Nobody was injured. Authorities said it was unclear what caused the blaze, which is under investigation, and will assess the runoff before deciding how best to clean it up. Firefighters tried to enter the burning building but were deterred “due to the heavy smoke and runoff”. The fire broke out in a butter-storage room, and the butter started to “flow” throughout the facility. “The butter runoff and heavy smoke slowed access to the structure,” officials said. “Many” firefighting crews worked for hours to contain and extinguish the fire. “When we first tried to go up the stairs to that part that collapsed, this stuff, the butter, was running down like, three inches thick on the steps. So our guys were up to their knees trying to go up the steps to get to the top, and they’re trying to drag the hose line,” local NBC affiliate WMTV quoted the Portage fire chief, Troy Haase, as saying. “The hose line got so full of butter they couldn’t hang on to it any more.” A local hazardous materials team tried to prevent the slick runoff from pouring into storm sewers and the Portage Canal. This nearly 200-year-old waterway is on the National and State Register of Historic Places, as it once served as an important means of transportation. While fires at food processing plants are not uncommon, some social media users in spring 2022 supported a false conspiracy theory that they were planned intentionally, in order to cause food shortages. Tom Super of the National Chicken Council told Reuters the speculations were “fake news”. “I can only speak for chicken, but like any manufacturing plant/industry, there are generally a few fires that occur each year across the country,” Super said. “The majority of them are accidental and are contained rather quickly. And certainly not enough to affect the chicken supply.”;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/05/butter-wisconsin-dairy-plant-canal-melted;guardian;entertainment & culture;5082
5163;5163;UK’s record hot 2022 made 160 times more likely by climate crisis;2023-01-05T11:34:15Z;['Damian Carrington'];['Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Climate science'];;"The record-breaking heat in the UK in 2022 was made 160 times more likely by the climate crisis, indicating the dominant influence of human-caused global heating on Britain. Last year has been confirmed as the UK’s hottest on record, with the average annual temperature passing the 10C mark for the first time. Scientists at the Met Office calculated that such heat is now expected every three to four years. Without the greenhouse gases emitted by humanity, such a warm year would be expected only once every five centuries. The 10.03C recorded in 2022 beat the previous record of 9.88C set in 2014, and is 0.89C above the average of the last three decades. All the UK nations set new record annual temperatures.
The world’s longest instrumental record of temperature is the 364-year-long Central England Temperature and this also set a new high in 2022 of 11.1C. Scientists were shocked in July when the daily temperature record passed 40C for the first time, obliterating the previous high of 38.7C. The hot summer led to thousands of early deaths. A cold spell in December made little difference to the overall average annual temperature. The scientists estimated the influence of global heating on the UK’s record hot year by comparing the results of climate models reflecting today’s high levels of carbon dioxide with models representing the pre-industrial period, when CO2 levels were much lower.
Dr Nikos Christidis, a Met Office climate attribution scientist, said: “We calculated that by the end of the century, under a medium [future] emissions scenario, a UK average temperature of 10C could occur almost every year.” Guardian analysis in August revealed how people across the world were losing their lives and livelihoods because of more deadly and more frequent heatwaves, floods, wildfires and droughts brought by the climate crisis. Dr Mark McCarthy, at the Met Office, said: “The UK surpassing an annual average temperature of 10C is a notable moment in our climatological history [and] comes as no surprise. Since 1884, all 10 years recording the highest annual temperature have occurred from 2003. It is clear from the observational record that human-induced global warming is already impacting the UK’s climate.” Nine of the 10 coldest years on record occurred more than a century ago, the Met Office data showed. “Even with the influence of climate change we don’t expect every year to be the hottest on record from now on,” McCarthy said. “Natural variability of the UK climate means there will always be some variation year to year. However, looking at longer term trends it is easy to pick out the influence climate change is having over time.” Prof Richard Allan, at the University of Reading, said: “Higher temperatures in the UK are contributing to more severe heatwaves, droughts and wildfires but also more intense rainfall events and flooding. These impacts will become progressively worse until global temperatures are stabilised by cutting global carbon emissions to net zero.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/05/uk-average-annual-temperature-tops-10c-for-first-time;guardian;environment;5163
4401;4401;Flu season in England is worst for a decade, says health secretary;2023-01-09T17:50:49Z;['Aubrey Allegretti', 'Robert Booth', 'Denis Campbell'];['NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Steve Barclay', 'Social care', 'Society', 'Health', 'Politics', 'England', 'UK news'];;"England is suffering its worst flu season for a decade, the health secretary has said, as he sought to acknowledge “severe pressures” in the NHS and expressed “regret” for some patients receiving poor care. Steve Barclay said 5,100 people were in hospital with flu – a huge rise compared with the figure of 50 last year. He said the rise happened “quickly and early”, with a sevenfold increase between November and December. It came at the worst possible time for the NHS, when GPs were at their most strained and being forced to limit services due to staff sicknesses, Barclay added.
At the same time, he said, delayed discharges – people who were medically fit to leave hospital but unable to do so due to blockages in the social care system – stood at about 13,000 people a day, about double the level during the first few months of the Covid pandemic. Despite criticism of the government’s handling of the NHS crisis over its refusal to up an offer for striking nurses and ambulance workers to receive more pay, Barclay made no mention of talks to avert future strikes in a statement to parliament on Monday afternoon. “Every cancelled operation, delayed appointment and ambulance disruption due to strikes could have been avoided if he had just agreed to talk to NHS staff about pay,” claimed the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting. To head off criticism the government was not aware of the scale of issues in the NHS after more reports of those who have suffered due to long wait times for ambulances and A&E treatment over Christmas, Barclay acknowledged there had been failings. “I and the government regret the experience for some patients and staff in emergency care has not been acceptable in recent weeks,” he said. Barclay confirmed plans to block-book beds in residential homes to release about 2,500 medically fit patients in order to free up space in hospitals. This would quicken the speed with which those waiting in ambulances could be admitted to hospital and in turn free up more ambulances to respond to callouts, he told MPs. One Tory MP broke ranks to criticise the government over its handling of the crisis. Edward Leigh asked Barclay what “our long-term plan” was for helping fix structural issues with the NHS and social care. He added: “We can’t leave the Labour party to have a long-term plan and we don’t.” The health secretary told him there was already an elective recovery plan and that ministers were working on a workforce plan as well. The biggest not-for-profit care home chain has backed demands for higher fees for using care homes to ease the NHS beds crisis. Methodist Homes (MHA), which looks after close to 20,000 people in a nationwide network of care homes, said fees needed to rise by up to £600 a week per place – almost double the rate paid by many local authorities. Care England, which represents the largest for-profit care companies, also said its members needed £1,500 a week to properly help those patients. “As things stand there are 165,000 staff vacancies in social care and if we don’t have enough care workers, then we simply cannot take in more residents and look after them safely,” said Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA. “New discharge plans need to come alongside a long-term, sustainable approach to funding social care.” Meanwhile, council social care leaders said the emergency £200m discharge fund had come too late. Warnings about the need for more funding this winter have been made since July 2022, according to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). It also said the extra money handed to the NHS to block-book care beds would mean councils finding themselves in competition for beds with health boards. Sarah McClinton, the president of Adass, said she feared people being discharged from hospital could end up “inappropriately placed and then remaining in residential provision indefinitely”. She urged as many people as possible to be cared for in their own homes. “We must recognise that long-term, sustainable investment is needed in primary and community-based care and support and for family carers,” she said. “We must stop thinking that pots of crisis funding are the solution.” David Fothergill, the chair of the cross-party Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, echoed that criticism. He described the initiative as a “sticking plaster” on the longstanding crisis in social care and £200m as “piecemeal funding”. Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, welcomed the use of care home beds to reduce the intense strain on hospitals. But it was “only a short-term solution to the immediate crisis” and longer-term solutions to prevent overcrowding were needed, he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/09/flu-season-england-worst-for-decade-health-secretary-steve-barclay-nhs;guardian;health;4401
2479;2479;Cash and the crown estate: a look at the British monarchy’s funding deal;2023-01-19T16:54:26Z;['Alex Lawson'];['Crown estate', 'Land ownership', 'King Charles III', 'Monarchy', 'Wind power', 'Public finance', 'Tax and spending', 'Business', 'Oil', 'Gas', 'Real estate', 'Land rights', 'UK news', 'Duchy of Cornwall', 'Duchy of Lancaster'];;"King Charles has declared that profits from a £1bn-a-year deal to lease offshore windfarms will be used for the “wider public good”, weeks after citing the cost-of-living crisis in his Christmas Day speech. The funds come from the crown estate. Here, we look at the body and how it functions. What has happened? The crown estate, which generates money for the Treasury and the royal family, said on Thursday that it had signed lease agreements for six offshore wind projects that will provide it with about £1bn a year in revenue and have the potential to power more than 7m homes. Three of the six projects are located off the coasts of north Wales, Cumbria and Lancashire, and three are in the North Sea off the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire coastlines.
What has the king said? Buckingham Palace has described the money generated from the new leases as a “windfall”. The king’s keeper of the privy purse, Sir Michael Stevens, has asked the government for “an appropriate reduction” in the percentage of crown estate profits used for the sovereign grant. The exact amount has not been declared. Under the taxpayer-funded sovereign grant, which is currently £86.3m a year, the king receives 25% of the crown estate’s annual surplus, including an extra 10% for the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. What is the crown estate? The crown estate – a vast portfolio of land and property – belongs to the reigning monarch “in right of the crown”. But it is not their private property. The monarch surrenders the revenue from the estate to the Treasury each year for the benefit of the nation’s finances, in exchange for the sovereign grant. The funding arrangement dates back to 1760, when George III reached an agreement to surrender his income from the estate in return for an annual fixed payment. What assets does it have? The monarch owns the seabed and half of the foreshore around large parts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, generating revenues from oil and gas drilling rights and royalties, as well as wind and wave farm developments. The portfolio includes property across large parts of central London including St James’s and Regent Street, as well as farmland, offices and retail parks. The crown estate is also responsible for managing the Windsor estate, which includes parkland and ancient woodland, and Ascot racecourse. How did the monarchy come to own the seabed? The right to collect royalties from wind and wave power around the British coastline was handed to the monarchy in 2004, when Tony Blair’s Labour government granted it through an act of parliament. Amid the transition to low-carbon energy, seabed plots have become more sought after and lucrative for the crown over the last two decades.
What is the crown estate worth? The revenue from the crown estate is worth more than £312m a year. The total value of the crown estate’s properties swelled by 8.3% last year at £15.6bn. The current value of the seabed rights is estimated at £5bn, and the six newly awarded licences could generate up to £9bn over the next 10 years. Is that all of the monarchy’s assets? The sovereign and the wider royal family have two other sources of income – the Duchy of Lancaster, which has various agricultural and commercial interests, and the Duchy of Cornwall – with combined assets of more than £17bn.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/19/cash-and-the-crown-estate-a-look-at-the-british-monarchys-funding-deal;guardian;politics;2479

1463;1463;Everton put up for sale by Farhad Moshiri with asking price of over £500m;2023-01-24T19:41:29Z;['Will Unwin'];['Everton', 'Business', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Everton have been put up for sale by Farhad Moshiri, who is looking for offers of more than £500m for the Premier League club. In recent months Moshiri has sought outside investment but he has finally put Everton on the market, and would consider a minority or majority sale. A number of potential buyers have expressed interest.
Moshiri would like to recoup the money he has invested in the new stadium being built at Bramley-Moore Dock. It is understood that Deloitte has been instructed to handle the sale of the club, who are in the Premier League relegation zone. Deloitte offered no comment when approached by the Guardian. The British-Iranian billionaire’s attempt to sell can be revealed on a day when Everton were dealt a double setback with Marcelo Bielsa expressing doubts over replacing Frank Lampard as manager and Tottenham hijacking their move for Arnaut Danjuma. Moshiri and his fellow board members have been fiercely criticised by Everton fans over recent weeks, with widespread calls for the owner to sell after almost seven years and for the directors to go.
About £700m has been spent on more than 50 players in the Moshiri era, with just over £400m recouped in sales. The attempted sale comes at a perilous moment for Everton with the stadium under construction at a cost of at least £550m, the club’s last three available set of accounts showing combined losses of £372.6m and lucrative commercial ties cut with companies owned by the oligarch Alisher Usmanov after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Moshiri has funded the construction costs of the stadium so far but has been seeking the additional investment required to complete the project. In a video posted on Everton’s website on Tuesday that is believed to have been filmed last week, Moshiri insisted he was not planning to sell the club. “The club is not for sale but I’ve been talking to top investors, real quality, to bridge the gap on the stadium,” he said. “I can do it myself and the reason I want to do it is to bring top sport investors into Everton for some of the reasons that the fans want improvement, more talent, and we are close to having a deal done.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/24/everton-for-sale-farhad-moshiri-asking-price-more-than-500m;guardian;sports;1463
5240;5240;Arizona county blames human error for discrepancies in attorney general race;2023-01-04T22:44:07Z;['Rachel Leingang'];['Arizona', 'US news', 'US politics'];;"The third-largest county in Arizona is blaming human error and poorly-trained staff for the hundreds of additional votes it found during a state-mandated recount, which narrowed the already close race for state attorney general.
In a meeting Wednesday morning, Pinal county officials laid out various human errors and training lapses that led to a discrepancy of more than 500 votes between the canvassed results and the recounted totals. The initial count was off by 0.3% from the recounted results, the county said. The errors included not tabulating ballots that should’ve been counted because of problems with poll workers checking in voters on Election Day and not double-checking ballots flagged by machines for further review. “We made mistakes. There’s no two ways about it,” county attorney Kent Volkmer told the county’s board of supervisors on Wednesday. “Fortunately, it did not result in anybody’s election being changed.” Volkmer said he is now confident that the recounted totals are correct. “It took us a second try,” he said. “And a third try, quite frankly, with the day-of ballots. We have very thoroughly examined why this happened. And we’re taking every step we can to ensure that it does not happen again.” Until last year, statewide recounts in Arizona were rare, but a new state law that went into effect in September 2022 increased the margin for automatic recounts, sending two statewide races to them. It’s not unusual for recounted vote totals to differ from initial counts by a few votes, barely affecting the total and hardly ever changing the winner. But Pinal’s different totals is an outlier. The changes most dramatically affected the attorney general race between Democrat Kris Mayes and Republican Abe Hamadeh. Mayes won the election, but her lead narrowed to just 280 votes after the recount, down from 511. Hamadeh is now seeking a new trial to contest his loss. The large difference between the vote totals in Pinal county has led some Republicans to call for further counting in other counties, where discrepancies were nowhere near as big as Pinal’s. The meeting of the county’s board of supervisors followed a public report that detailed the counting problems for day-of ballots, which include: Some provisional ballots were not counted correctly. Some polling electronic poll pads would not scan voters’ driver’s licenses, so some voters cast ballots without being formally checked in. Paper jams in tabulation may not have been interpreted correctly, leading to miscounts. Ballots with unclear marks weren’t adjudicated and counted in some cases. A tabulation team in one case didn’t sort through ballots that were flagged for not being processed by the machine, leading to a stack of ballots that weren’t counted. The county attributed the issues to “human error” largely caused by training lapses, not machine problems or any outside interference. The problems during the general election come after different woes plagued the primary election in Pinal county. In the primary, some precincts ran out of ballots, causing long waits for voters, some of whom did not end up voting. After the primary, the county fired its new elections director, David Frisk, and replaced him with the county recorder, Virginia Ross. The amount of staff and election spending increased under Ross, though long-standing issues with turnover, funding and a lack of institutional knowledge couldn’t be fully cured in the short time between the August primary and November general election. Another new elections director, Geraldine Roll, is now in place, as Ross was only tapped to run last year’s election. Roll is the county’s fifth elections director since 2020. Ross received a $25,000 (£20,730) bonus for completing the general election successfully. Roll told the supervisors she found “absolutely no evidence” of anything nefarious with the vote count, but that she believed the canvass of results was done “prematurely”.
“I think we had enough to have raised a few questions and we should have taken more steps before we canvassed, and we certainly had time,” Roll said. Ross was in charge of the department at the time of the canvass in November. Roll, now tasked with leading the department after yet another problem election, said she will be compiling an internal procedures manual to ensure that all employees and poll workers know how to complete their tasks accurately and thoroughly. The manual, Volkmer said, will help address the gaps in institutional knowledge in the department. While the vote count was off, board of supervisors chairman Jeff Serdy noted, “every vote got counted”.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/arizona-recount-attorney-general-election-human-error;guardian;politics;5240

Corio’s parrot featured in the background of the calls and she sent the casting team a tape of her climbing a tree. For Pardee, the sessions were designed to recreate the safe, playful environment she would usually establish in person. “There’s a fallacy in our industry that if people want it bad enough, they’ll make it happen for themselves. Bullshit. Not everyone is blessed with front-footedness; doesn’t mean they’re not right for the role.” Pardee is one of the world’s best known streetcasters, renowned for her painstaking searches for films such as American Honey, Catch Me Daddy and Rocks. She sees her work as “democratising opportunity” in an industry that “can be ridiculously grand” – finding people who would not or could not otherwise get into acting. She spent nine months in schools to find teenage girls for the coming-of-age drama Rocks. Lead Bukky Bakray, who subsequently became the youngest ever Bafta Rising Star winner, confessed she thought Pardee was just “the laziest Ofsted inspector on the face of the planet”.
Most famously, Pardee found Katie Jarvis for Andrea Arnold’s Fish Tank at Tilbury Town station. Looking for someone with “proper fire”, she had seen “2,000, maybe 3,000 girls”. But it was on her way home from youth club workshops, having missed her train, that she saw Jarvis have a massive row with her boyfriend. Biding her time – “Katie was really angry, and I thought, if I go over to her now, her blood’s up so she’s not gonna hear what I’m saying” – Pardee boarded the train then got off early, following Jarvis to ask her to audition. Jarvis was a revelation, but Pardee knew she would be: when she saw her, she got a “cold feeling at the top of my stomach. That’s the telltale.” She got the same feeling with Corio once they met in person, during an improvisation where Corio had to think about something that made her sad: “She cried but it wasn’t a performance. She was just sad and this tear dropped down her face.” Last month, Aftersun, in which Corio stars opposite Paul Mescal, picked up seven British independent film awards. Streetcasting has long had an air of romance about it. Whether it is Martin Compston in Sweet Sixteen or Thomas Turgoose in This Is England, the idea of someone plucked from obscurity and parachuted into stardom is a thrilling one. And while it is true that casting directors often spot their subjects in the most unlikely of places, searching for the right person can be a big slog. “It’s not romantic; it’s serious business and accountability is extremely important,” says Pardee.
When Kharmel Cochrane approaches someone in the street, armed with her ID lanyard and DBS check, she often gets mistaken for a police officer. “I try to be relatable,” she says. “Like: ‘Hey, I like your trainers!’ I try not to go straight in with: ‘Do you want to be in a film?’” It does seem like an offer that might be too good to be true, but as the longtime casting director for Robert Eggers, Cochrane genuinely has a life-changing opportunity on the table. She found the child actors for Eggers’ horror The Witch by scouring schools in Leeds, and sourced hulking Nordic sailors for The Northman by posting call-outs on Instagram for men over 6ft 7in. Pre-Covid, she would trawl boxing clubs, cafes in Soho and Westfield shopping centre. When she was casting the BBC Three horror Red Rose, the hot scouting tip-off was Greggs in Bolton. But introducing total newbies to the industry brings a special kind of responsibility. “The thing I always think about streetcasting is that these are just people going about their lives and you come in with an opportunity they might never have known existed,” says Cochrane. “There was the attitude for a long time of ‘We’ll streetcast and get people cheaper.’ We’ve really had to argue and say no, you have to pay the exact same – whatever was in your budget. It’s not about the exploitation of your average Joe.”
For truly naturalistic performances, though, streetcasting is often the go-to route. Kahleen Crawford has been collaborating with Ken Loach for almost two decades and is well used to finding people able to deliver the kind of rawness his films require, understanding that it’s “a massive leap of faith” for someone who has never considered acting as a path. Paul Brannigan, who played the lead in Loach’s The Angels’ Share, was a youth worker whom writer Paul Laverty met while doing research. Brannigan ghosted Crawford several times before finally showing up to an audition: “When people are from a background where they haven’t been built up to have much self-esteem, to put themselves in the line of fire takes a huge amount of courage. He did come in the third time and he was extraordinary,” says Crawford. Streetcasting is also useful when the role demands specifics the traditional pool of actors might not satisfy. Crawford found Matthew Jordan-Caws, who plays Billie Piper’s son in I Hate Suzie Too, by contacting deaf schools, while Amber Fitzgerald-Woolfe, who plays the young deaf character of Ama in His Dark Materials, was discovered via an Instagram search. Elsewhere in TV, when Sam Levinson was assembling his eclectic bunch of teenagers for HBO hit Euphoria, his cast included A-listers (Zendaya), nepo-babies (Maude Apatow) and indie favourites (Alexa Demie) – but it was the unknowns who made the biggest splash. Angus Cloud (lovable drug dealer Fez) was snapped up while walking down a Manhattan street, Hunter Schafer (free-spirited Jules) was a model and activist who happened upon a casting call for transgender girls, while Chloe Cherry (fan favourite Faye) was an adult film star who Levinson found on Instagram. The refreshingly bold performances of all three made them breakout stars.
For Aisha Bywaters, streetcasting is the answer for “things you don’t believe are in the system”. That was certainly the case with We Are Lady Parts, for which Bywaters won a Bafta. “Lady Parts is about a female Muslim punk band. We didn’t know if that did or didn’t exist,” she says. “One of the main women is played by Juliette Motamed and she was streetcast. We found her on Instagram – she was a model, a musician and doing all these creative things so we took a chance … She’s now in the new Magic Mike movie.” Occasionally, when Bywaters puts out an open call-out for a role, she gets negative feedback from disgruntled trained actors. Does she ever get professionals pretending to be novices? “Loads! All the time.” Her call-out for unknowns for the lead in the upcoming adaptation of Candice Carty-Williams’s novel Queenie included a disclaimer that professional actors were also being considered. “I understand it,” says Bywaters. “You’ve gone through the system then someone tells you: ‘No, we want authentic.’ So then, what is acting? Is it just ‘being’? But I do feel like there’s enough for everyone.”
Most recently, Bywaters worked on Daniel Kaluuya’s first feature film co-writing credit, The Kitchen, due later this year, and streetcast 12-year-old Jedaiah Bannerman from a call-out on Instagram: “You knew from this boy’s tape that he was pretty good, then you have an audition with him and this guy has got such emotional intelligence. And he’s 12 years old, just loving football and loving his life. You’re just like: ‘Oh my goodness – this little boy just exists in society, having these great instincts! What is going on?!’” It’s that gut feeling that is extra special when it comes to streetcasting. However exhausting, lengthy or seemingly impossible the search might seem, there is a magic to unearthing someone who otherwise would never have taken steps in this direction. As Pardee says: “It’s never good enough to say: ‘We tried and we put the poster up but we didn’t find them,’ because the truth is they’re out there.”";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/06/our-best-tip-off-was-greggs-in-bolton-the-secrets-behind-finding-the-hottest-new-screen-stars;guardian;entertainment & culture;4937
4397;4397;Protesters gather at Iranian prison in attempt to stop ‘imminent executions’;2023-01-09T18:05:58Z;['Patrick Wintour'];['Iran', 'Protest', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news', 'Human rights', 'Law'];;"Protesters have gathered outside a prison near the Iranian capital in an attempt to prevent the rumoured imminent execution of two young detainees found guilty of running over a police officer in a car during protests in November. Footage posted on social media showed the mother of one of the men, 22-year-old Mohammad Ghobadlou, pleading for her son outside Rajaei-Shahr prison in Karaj, a satellite city west of Tehran. She said it had been established that her son had not been at the scene when the police officer died. Human rights activists had raised the alarm after Ghobadlou and fellow prisoner Mohammad Boroughani were taken to solitary confinement, which is often a preliminary step before execution. Their lawyers are claiming the two men require a retrial in the supreme court. Four people have been executed so far in relation to the protest movement that has swept Iran since the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September. Some warnings of imminent executions have proved false, possibly because protests around specific prisoners have unnerved the authorities. Iranian ambassadors in Europe are still being summoned over the execution of two men on Saturday, and Iran is now having to weigh up whether to ignore the international condemnation over the lack of due process, including prisoners being denied access to lawyers of their choice. On Monday, a daughter of the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was sentenced to five years over “propaganda” and “acts against national security” for encouraging people to join the protests. Faezeh Hashemi, 60, a former lawmaker and women’s rights activist, was charged with “collusion against national security, propaganda against the Islamic republic and disturbing public order by participating in illegal gatherings”, her lawyer said. The repression, which is seen by the Iranian authorities as an appropriate response to injuries inflicted on security officers during the protests, is stifling any chances of the talks of a renewed nuclear deal, pushing part of the Iranian regime to look for closer relations with Russia as an alternative to the west. Over the weekend the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, attended memorials in Toronto for the 176 people killed on Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 that was shot down by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on 8 January 2020. Trudeau said the Tehran regime did not represent its people, a position that takes him closer to expelling Iranian diplomats from Canada, one of the key demands of the protestors in the large and increasingly unified Iranian diaspora. The execution of two men, Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Mohammad Hosseini, on Saturday led to protests around the world, but no immediate sanctions. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, described the executions as “appalling”, adding that France reiterated its opposition to the death penalty, in all places and in all circumstances. French senators have also tabled a resolution calling on the EU to end nuclear negotiations with Iran; designate the Revolutionary Guardsas a terrorist organisation; as well as several other measures. The Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, also denounced the executions, saying: “Two more lives lost to senseless executions from the Iranian regime.” Calling on Iran to put an end to such brutal and inhumane sentences, Joly expressed solidarity with Iranians who have a right to their human rights. Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human rights activist in Iran, said due process had not been allowed, turning the executions into “open murder”. The Iranian foreign ministry rejected the criticism, saying: “Remarks of self-styled defenders of human rights are replete with racist thoughts.” Iranian judicial news agencies reported that Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate champion, had been sentenced to death, along with two others. Amir Nasr Azadani, a former football player, was sentenced to 26 years in prison. The Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution meanwhile slammed the door on relaxing rules around the hijab, saying in a lengthy statement that western societies had destroyed the family by promoting female sexuality. “Covering up causes a woman to be recognised in society by her thoughts and personality, not by her body and beauty,” it said. “This is the greatest service that religions, especially Islam, have given to women, which obliges her to observe hijab so that her dignity is preserved and she is not sold or passed around like a commodity.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/protest-iran-prison-karaj-executions;guardian;politics;4397
352;352;Napoli’s rivals melt away to leave an end to their scudetto wait in sight | Nicky Bandini;2023-01-30T12:11:10Z;['Nicky Bandini'];['Serie A', 'Napoli', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Milan', 'Juventus', 'Sport'];;"By the end, it felt like a cup final: two teams playing as if everything needed to be settled right here. One moment Roma’s keeper, Rui Patricio, was making a save at his near post and the next he was sprinting toward the opposite goal, joining the attack for a corner. As teammate Gianluca Mancini’s final attempt was blocked, Napoli players spilled from the dugout punching the air, yelling, embracing. Why should it matter like this? José Mourinho had told us on Saturday that the Serie A title race was already over, offering his congratulations. “I don’t want to be misinterpreted … [but] Napoli have won it, it’s theirs and they deserve it,” he said. “They are the strongest team.”
The Roma manager is famous for his mind-games, but this felt a realistic assessment. It was not just that Napoli are brilliant, but that they have no rivals, every challenge melting away before the spring thaw even begins. Second-place Milan were already 12 points behind and would lose 5-2 at home to Sassuolo in Sunday’s lunchtime kickoff. What has become of Italy’s reigning champions? That result came on the heels of a 4-0 mauling by Lazio, the first time Milan have conceded four goals in consecutive Serie A games. Before that, was the 3-0 defeat to Inter in the SuperCoppa. They are winless in six matches in all competitions. Sassuolo have been a bogey team for them ever since achieving promotion to the top-flight a decade ago. This was the fifth time since then they have scored at least three goals against Milan and it was their 4-3 win in the reverse fixture that provoked Silvio Berlusconi to fire Massimiliano Allegri in 2014. They hardly arrived in compelling form, without a win of their own since October, but scored more times on Sunday than they had in their previous eight matches combined. Domenico Berardi was at his swaggering best, running past defenders one moment and playing the pivot the next as he set up his team’s first two goals before heading home the third from a corner. He provided the assist on Sassuolo’s fifth goal, too, with Armand Laurienté scoring from the penalty spot in between. Olivier Giroud had a goal ruled out for Milan at 0-0, an early victim of Serie A’s newly introduced semi-automatic offside system, but after that they were barely in the game, falling behind 2-0, then 3-1 by the interval and 5-1 in the second half before Divock Origi scored a spectacular consolation.
How did we get here? Stefano Pioli sounded as perplexed as anyone: “Everything that has worked for us over the past two years has stopped working in the last month.” Milan were missing Fikayo Tomori and the decision to replace him with Matteo Gabbia backfired, the 23-year-old terrorised by Berardi and at fault on several goals. Would things have gone any differently, though, if the veteran Simon Kjær was selected instead? The Dane was on the pitch for three of the four goals Milan conceded against Lazio, and Tomori for the other. Pioli had tried to give his team a jolt by dropping Rafael Leão and giving Charles De Ketelaere a first start in almost four months, but the €35m summer signing again failed to leave his mark. It is too soon to write off the 23-year-old off as a failed investment but Milan’s directors can certainly be accused of putting too many eggs in one basket. There was never any question Milan had overachieved on their way to winning the title last term, Pioli drawing the best out of a young group, but also lucky that a thin squad was never exposed. The departure of Franck Kessié and the injury to Mike Maignan have left unfilled gaps. Pioli signalled on Sunday he had given up hope of successfully defending the title, saying “our Scudetto will be getting into the Champions League”. It is a higher bar than another of the teams who were supposed to challenge Napoli can set. After Juventus lost 2-0 to Monza on Sunday, Allegri said his team needed to face up to the reality they are not safe from relegation.
Theirs is a unique situation, created by the 15-point penalty they were handed by the Italian Football Federation. They hardly looked like a team that belonged in a title fight, though, as they were beaten by these promoted opponents for the second time. Monza were excellent, Patrick Ciurria and Dany Mota scoring both goals before half time while Gianluca Caprari had another disallowed for offside. Only four teams have collected more points since Raffaele Palladino was promoted from academy coach to take over their first team in September. Still, this was another low moment for Juventus in a month full of them. The only previous team to win their first two Serie A encounters with the Old Lady was Inter in 1930. If not Milan or Juventus, who else is supposed to challenge Napoli for the title? Inter looked the part when they beat Naploli at the start of the year but a draw with Monza and loss to Empoli has left them 13 points back. That was the same gap Roma faced before kickoff. Mourinho’s assessment that the Scudetto was already decided did not stop his team from treating the game as a six-pointer. Milan’s collapse and Juventus’s points deduction have opened a path for Roma to qualify for the Champions League and perhaps to fight for second place. Napoli took the lead with a goal-of-the-season contender from Victor Osimhen, who manoeuvred Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s cross from his chest to his thigh to his boot and then the roof of the net without the ball touching the floor. Roma fought back admirably, opposing superior technicality with defiant tenacity, an outmatched boxer holding their ground in the middle of the ring and finding a way to trade blows.
When Nicola Zalewski swung at the back post in the 75th minute, Stephan El Shaarawy arrived with the follow-up jab for 1-1. But parity did not last. Giovanni Simeone came off the bench to score a fine winner for Napoli, punishing loose marking from Chris Smalling as he spun to sweep a left-foot shot into the top-right corner. It was another reminder of why the leaders are where they are, a depth unmatched in the league. “Our whole squad was playing that game,” said the Napoli manager, Luciano Spalletti. “Even those who were on the bench – right down to the kitman.”
He resisted title talk, saying his team just needed to stay focused on the next game. Pre-game he had drawn a parallel with a bike accident he suffered in September, saying that sometimes when you’re having a pleasant ride it’s easy to lose your concentration and get distracted by the view. Quietly, he might even have been grateful to Roma for making this trip less serene.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/30/napoli-seriea-milan-juventus-scudetto;guardian;sports;352
8454;8454;Tyre Nichols killing: Memphis braces as five ex-officers charged with murder over father-of-one who was beaten like 'a human pinata';Thursday 26 January 2023 22:37, UK;[];['tennessee'];['fatherofone', 'officers', 'human', 'killing', 'tyre', 'pinata', 'exofficers', 'charged', 'department', 'black', 'video', 'nichols', 'family', 'murder', 'memphis', 'footage'];"A grand jury has indicted five former police officers on murder and other charges in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols.

US President Joe Biden called for any protests to be peaceful following the charges on Thursday.

Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said, before being allegedly beaten by the officers for three minutes.

Five black officers involved in the arrest were subsequently sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Officials are expected to release bodycam footage of the incident on Friday evening.

""We're here today because of a tragedy that wounds one family deeply but also hurts us all,"" district attorney Steve Mulroy said at a news conference.

He added that the five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct.

The Memphis Police Department identified them as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr, and Justin Smith, who are all black and aged between 24 and 32.

Each officer had served with the department for around two and a half to five years, and were dismissed from the force last Saturday.

Meanwhile, two Memphis Fire Department employees who were involved in the response were also relieved of their duties during an investigation, a department spokesperson said earlier this week.

President Biden said in a statement: ""Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.

""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all.""

Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said on Wednesday that other police officers remain under investigation for police infractions.

In a video shared on YouTube, she asked for calm when the bodycam footage is made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels. I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights,"" she said.

""I expect our citizens to exercise their First Amendment right to protest, to demand action and results, but we need to ensure our community is safe in this process.""

Several recent incidents of police brutality against black people in the US have sparked outrage and calls for reforms in policing.

Second-degree murder will go a considerable distance in meeting public's expectations James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky America has been here before. A black man dead at the hands of police officers, brutality captured on camera. Rodney King and George Floyd are just two names that define a deadly dysfunction in the institution that exists to protect and serve. Now add Tyre Nichols - 29 years old, a father and family man who worked at FedEx and enjoyed skateboarding. ""Nobody’s perfect,"" said his mother RowVaugn. ""But he was damn near."" We are told the events leading up to his death are contained in a video lasting an hour, multiple angles of what has been trailed as a savage assault. A lawyer for the Nichols family spoke of him being beaten ""like a human pinata"". The Friday night release of the footage is shrouded by a sense of dread. Experience shows it is shocking video content of a sort liable to ignite violent street protests and, in Memphis, they are aware of the danger. It explains why the build-up to the release of the footage has been choreographed around charges for the police officers involved. In a place where the public demands accountability, laying charges of second-degree murder will go a considerable distance towards matching expectations. Murder in the second degree accuses the officers of knowingly killing Mr Nichols. Does it make a difference that the five men in uniform were black? Perhaps. Time will tell if, and how, that plays into the wider public response. Much of the reaction, so far, has focused on the power that police have and the inclination to abuse it with deadly consequences. In video form, evidence of it will soon be laid bare - and Memphis is braced.

The Nichols family watched the police footage on Monday with their lawyer, Ben Crump, who compared the beating to the 1991 Los Angeles police assault on Rodney King that was captured on video and sparked protests and police reforms.

""He was defenceless the entire time. He was a human pinata for those police officers,"" Antonio Romanucci, Mr Crump's co-counsel, told reporters.

Mr Crump said Nichols' last words heard on the video were of him calling for his mother three times.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126234909/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-killing-memphis-braces-as-five-ex-officers-charged-with-murder-over-father-of-one-who-was-beaten-like-a-human-pinata-12796236;skynews;entertainment & culture;2545

The controversial influencer, 36, is suspected of being involved in human trafficking and part of an organised crime gang.

Tate's brother Tristan and two Romanian women have also been detained in the same case.

As the brothers arrived handcuffed together on Thursday morning at the Bucharest offices of the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (Diicot), Tristan Tate told reporters: ""What evidence is there? There is none.

""That should be the story. Please cover that story. The police have fabricated the evidence. There is no evidence. There is no victim.""

Andrew Tate told reporters as he left the offices on Wednesday: ""There is no evidence in my file because I've done nothing wrong.""

Diicot spokesperson Ramona Bolla said it was taking time to go through the ""multiple devices"" seized.

998;998;Trump’s return to Facebook will ‘fan the flames of hatred’, say experts and politicians;2023-01-26T23:01:35Z;['Martin Pengelly', 'Kari Paul'];['Donald Trump', 'Facebook', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Democrats', 'Meta'];;"Politicians and civil rights advocates have weighed in on Meta’s decision to allow former president Donald Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram, stating that his presence on the platforms will “fan the flames of hatred and division”. The social media firm has lifted a ban imposed on Trump after the January 6 Capitol attack and will allow him to post again in the coming weeks. Experts in online hate speech say there is no reason to believe Trump will not return to spreading dangerous misinformation and hate speech upon his return. “Giving Donald Trump access to his Facebook account allows him to once again use his platform as a megaphone to spread misinformation about the integrity of our elections, incite violence and stoke the flames of white supremacy,” said Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of racial justice movement Kairos Action.
Democratic politicians have also spoken out against the decision, with Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, of Illinois, saying that reinstating Trump “will only fan the flames of hatred and division that led to an insurrection”. Trump was impeached for inciting the January 6 riot, a deadly attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The events also led to his being banned from a number of major social media platforms, including YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter. The Twitter ban was lifted in November, after the site was purchased by the Tesla owner, Elon Musk. Trump has not tweeted since, although he is active on his own social media platform and would-be Twitter rival Truth Social. Google, owner of YouTube, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would be allowed to return, but some experts have suggested that the decisions from Meta and Twitter could set a precedent that leads other platforms to follow suit. In a blog post explaining Meta’s decision, its president of global affairs and former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the company’s platforms should be available for “open, public and democratic debate”. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying – the good, the bad and the ugly – so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” he said. Clegg also said that Trump would be allowed back with new “guardrails” preventing future violations of platform policies. He would, for example, be “permitted to attack the results of the 2020 election without facing consequences” but would face action if he “were to cast doubt on an upcoming election – like, the 2024 presidential race”. Many have argued that Meta’s decision is largely for financial benefit, as the company has floundered in recent months amid a declining user base and huge expenditures on its virtual reality project, the metaverse. The company lost more than $80bn in market value and laid off thousands of employees in 2022. “Meta knows the impact of bringing Trump back – the company knows he will turn Facebook and Instagram into a cesspool of hate, violence, and extremism – but it doesn’t care,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America. “Facebook is a dying platform, and Meta will do anything to cling to relevance and revenue – even if that means endangering its users and our democracy.” Among Democrats, Adam Schiff, a former House intelligence committee chair, said Trump had “shown no remorse [or] contrition” for January 6, and Facebook had “caved, giving him a platform to do more harm”. Schakowsky added: “The reinstatement of Trump’s accounts show that there is no low [Meta chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg will not stoop to in order to reverse Meta’s cratering revenue and stagnant consumer growth, even if it means destroying our democracy.” Eric Swalwell, like Schiff now barred from the intelligence committee by Republican leaders, said: “We know that [Trump’s] words have power and they inspire, and then the leaders in the Republican party, like Speaker [Kevin] McCarthy, they don’t condemn them. And so when they’re not condemned, they’re a green light and open lane for more violence to occur.” But there was support for Meta among some civil liberties groups, who have argued that censoring him is a threat to first amendment rights. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country’s leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. “The biggest social media companies are central actors when it comes to our collective ability to speak – and hear the speech of others – online. They should err on the side of allowing a wide range of political speech, even when it offends.” The debate over Trump’s accounts has renewed longstanding arguments that individual corporations and executives at their helm should not have such power to moderate public speech.
“Meta will always prioritize its profits over the safety of Black and other marginalized communities – which is why vital communications platforms that have monumental impact on our everyday lives should not be led by private companies,” said Ruiz Firmat of Kairos. “If we want a digital realm that works for all of us, we must put governance of the internet in the hands of users.” Meanwhile, Trump used his own platform, Truth Social, to celebrate, writing: “Facebook, which has lost billions of dollars in value since ‘deplatforming’ your favorite president, me, has just announced that they are reinstating my account. Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting president, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/trump-facebook-return-reaction-democrats;guardian;politics;998
4411;4411;‘They were in ecstasy’: how Bolsonaro mob’s orgy of violence rocked Brasília;2023-01-09T16:56:34Z;['Tom Phillips'];['Brazil', 'World news', 'Americas', 'Jair Bolsonaro'];;"Carla Coutinho da Rosa rode her mud-caked bicycle to Brazil’s day of chaos, joining thousands of far-right militants as they marched on congress with a clear objective in their minds. “The idea was to get rid of Lula,” the 60-year-old businesswoman said of Brazil’s democratically elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who defeated her preferred candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, in October’s election. Like millions of devoted Bolsonaristas, Rosa rejects the outcome of that vote and after lunch on Sunday she took to the streets of the capital, Brasília, joining a mass protest that she said was designed to overturn the result. “He’s a corrupt thief,” Rosa fumed of the veteran leftist, claiming marchers had planned a peaceful demonstration as they made the 8km hike from their encampment outside Brasília’s army headquarters to the nerve centre of Brazilian politics. The result was anything but peaceful. Journalist George Marques, who reached the area outside Oscar Niemeyer’s spectacular congress building at about 3pm on Sunday after disguising himself as a Bolsonaro supporter, said he saw thousands of people storm the complex. “There were so many people … and the barricades [outside congress] had all been torn down and destroyed … the police were no longer there and the ramp leading into congress was completely overrun,” he said.
From congress, Marques, 32, followed the demonstrators – many wearing the green and yellow Brazil flag appropriated by Bolsonaro’s far-right movement – as they advanced over the road to the Planalto presidential palace, where Lula had been sworn in just seven days earlier. “The Bolsonaristas were shouting: ‘Come on! Come on! The time has come! It’s now!’” Marques remembered, describing a carnival-like atmosphere as the elated radicals swarmed towards the building’s marble ramp. “It was a moment of Bolsonarista joy. They were almost in orgasm … They were in ecstasy – as if they were staging a revolution that was positive for the country,” Marques said, adding: “Many of them truly believe in this nonsense”. Inside the palace, Bolsonaro’s followers ran riot. Offices were invaded, historic works of art – including one by the master painter Emiliano Di Cavalcanti – smashed. Portraits of Brazil’s former presidents were torn from the walls and thrown to the ground. Weapons were reportedly stolen from the Institutional Security Bureau, which is responsible for presidential security.
One of the palace’s ransacked offices belonged to one of Lula’s closest allies, the former defense and foreign minister Celso Amorim. “I feel extremely shocked,” Amorim told the Guardian on Monday as he flew back to Brazil’s modernist capital to assess the damage. “It was unquestionably an attack on Brazilian democracy by deranged people.” Amorim said the pro-Bolsonaro “band of fascists” appeared to have vandalized the office of Brazil’s first lady, Rosângela Lula da Silva, with particular delight. “Just as Bolsonaro is a cheap imitation of Trump, this was a cheap imitation of the [US] Capitol [invasion on January 6 2021],” Amorim said, warning of “tense moments” in the days ahead as the government pursued those responsible for the havoc. From the presidential palace, the demonstrators moved on to the supreme court on the other side of Brasília’s Three Powers Plaza which suffered even more severe damage.
A replica of Brazil’s 1988 constitution was ripped from a display case and carried outside. A black robe belonging to one of the court’s justices was pillaged and shown off to the hordes of mobile-phone-toting rioters. The phrase “You lost, you prick” was daubed on to the court’s outer windows – a reference to a remark from the supreme court judge Luís Roberto Barroso urging Bolsonaro followers to accept Lula’s election win. “I’m still trying to process everything I saw … It was like a scene from a war,” said Marques. “They were unimaginable scenes of destruction and savagery. Never in my 12 years covering politics in Brasília did I think I’d witness acts of such violence and depredation … Historic objects were smashed, busts, works of art … were burned or destroyed … I felt a mixture of despair and sadness. I wanted to cry. I didn’t know if someone was going to get shot.” As the Bolsonarista mob ran amok, Brazil and the international community looked on in horror, with world leaders including Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron, Gabriel Boric and Joe Biden condemning what the US president called an “assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil”. Amorim said such an outpouring of international support was crucial to Lula’s week-old government as it confronted the aftermath of what many call the most serious outbreak of political violence since the return of democracy in 1985. “Even the prime minister of Italy, who is said to be extreme or ultra-right, has spoken out against this brutal act,” Amorim said.
But Rosa, the Bolsonarista activist, rejected claims she had been part of a terrorist attack on her country’s democratic institutions. “It was a peaceful protest,” she insisted on Monday as she sat with her bicycle beside the pro-Bolsonaro camp outside the army HQ waiting for hundreds of riot police and army troops to clear away the tents. “We pay our taxes. None of us are terrorists – nothing of the sort.” Rosa wept as she described her conviction that October’s election had been rigged – a conspiracy theory that Bolsonaro and his allies repeatedly peddled in the lead-up to the vote.
“I feel so angry. It’s all so cowardly. We are patriots. We love our flag. These people only think about stealing,” she said, hailing Bolsonaro as the leader of a noble patriotic revolution. “When I was at school we used to sing the national anthem … these days all they talk about is homosexuality and I don’t know what else. The values have changed. It’s all wrong,” she complained, adding that she believed her leader was right to abandon Brazil on the eve of Lula’s 1 January inauguration. “They want to arrest him – of course he had to go,” she said of Bolsonaro, who watched Sunday’s turmoil from a mansion in Orlando, Florida. Another pro-Bolsonaro activist at the camp, 29-year-old William Sartott, blamed Sunday’s destruction on leftist agitators who, without evidence, he accused of hijacking a “peaceful” protest in order to discredit the right, with help from the “rotten media”. “They infiltrated the protest and these infiltrators carried out numerous acts of vandalism, setting fire to things and breaking things in congress,” Sartott claimed. “I’ve got loads of videos on my Telegram channel that prove this … We’re absolutely certain of it.
“What happened yesterday was an outrage,” Sartott added as he livestreamed the police operation to remove the pro-Bolsonaro camp. “It was the second Capitol – this was the Brazilian Capitol version 2.0,” he added – although for Sartott the culprits were from the left. “They want to impose the idea that the Brazilian right are terrorists. This is the narrative they want to sell so that upstanding citizens do not rise up … [to stop] Brazil becoming yet another communist country in Latin America, like Venezuela, Cuba and the others.” Marques said such conspiracy theories were typical of Bolsonaro’s hardcore base. “Some of these people are so utterly furious and there’s no talking to them. It’s as if they have been bulletproofed against any kind of truth or fact,” he said. As he prepared to board a flight back to Brasília, Amorim said many questions remained about Sunday’s anarchy. “Did they want to create havoc that might spark a military intervention? Or was it just depredation and an act of terrorism designed to intimidate and inspire others to follow them?” he asked. “I don’t know.”
But Lula’s special aide was particularly troubled that the Presidential Guard Battalion had not intervened to stop the sacking of some of Brazil’s most beautiful architectural treasures. During previous protests, demonstrators had been kept well away from the palace. “This time there was nothing. Why was there nothing? Why were reinforcements not sent? It’s impossible to believe there wasn’t intelligence about this. I don’t want to blame anyone … but this is very troubling. “It’s as if it was allowed to happen. This is very serious,” added Amorim, calling for the punishment of the demonstrators and those who financed and masterminded their historic attack on Brazil’s democracy. “I’m worried,” he said. “But we will overcome this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/brazil-riot-palace-attack-bolsonaro-far-right-supporters-lula;guardian;politics;4411

Julie grew up on a farm in Edenbridge, Kent, with her parents, Janet (nee Vessey), a potter, and Frank Boston, an RAF pilot, dairy farmer and school cook, and her younger brothers Christopher and Richard. She went to Ashford school for girls and then Exeter University, in the early 1950s, where she studied English literature and became a campaigning socialist. There she met Will Fancy, a fellow socialist. They married in 1957 and settled in south-east London. The life of a suburban housewife did not completely suit Julie, as she expressed in an article in Peace News entitled The Home As a Prison. But she made the family’s house and garden feel like an adventure playground, full of creativity. With other mothers, she set up nurseries and holiday play clubs. She was active in the Labour party but was expelled in the early 60s for standing up for unilateral nuclear disarmament, against the wishes of the party leadership. Julie taught at Sherington and other primary schools in Greenwich and was active in the National Union of Teachers, contributing to the Rank and File teacher group and magazine. The house was a hive of union activity, hosting meetings in the living room, striking miners and even a family who had been evicted when their father was sacked by a local dairy. In the early 80s she left home, though she did not divorce or formally separate from Will, and returned to being Julie Boston. She visited the Greenham women’s peace camp and supported Women Against Pit Closures, travelling the country singing songs and sharing poems. Julie moved to Bristol in the late 80s and worked in nursery schools in the city. After her retirement, in 1994, she learned Spanish and travelled alone to Bolivia, Nicaragua, Cuba and Mexico, gaining inspiration from the countries’ social movements and public services. Back home in Bristol she threw herself into the live poetry scene. Seeing the decline of the local railway branch line, Julie and Will – who had by then moved into the flat above hers – formed the Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways. She stood proudly on the recent RMT picket lines. She also campaigned for better public libraries, public toilets, buses and – being a lover of walking – public footpaths. Will died in 2009. She is survived by her three children, Stuart, Rachel and me, 11 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and by her brother, Christopher.;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/02/julie-boston-obituary;guardian;politics;5640

5236;5236;Conte praises Spurs character after Palace win but ‘Levy Out’ chants remain;2023-01-04T23:21:19Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Tottenham Hotspur', 'Antonio Conte', 'Crystal Palace', 'Harry Kane', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Antonio Conte praised Tottenham’s character after they bounced back from their demoralising defeat to Aston Villa by reviving their top-four challenge with a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace. Spurs were without several key players at Selhurst Park but moved two points behind fourth-placed Manchester United thanks to a superb second-half display. The outstanding Harry Kane scored twice and created a goal for Son Heung-min, and the performance delighted Conte, whose recent negative demeanour has suggested he will need to think long and hard before deciding to extend his contract before it expires at the end of the season.
“It’s always important to get three points and have this type of win,” Conte said. “This brings confidence. The game against Aston Villa, after a good first half, we conceded the goal and our confidence dropped a lot and to recover in two or three days after a defeat at home where we are expected to win, and to go again, was not easy. The response was really good. My players showed great character, great personality.” It was the first time Spurs had opened the scoring in 11 games. Conte’s style of play has drawn criticism and supporters have reacted to the team’s disappointing form by calling for the chairman, Daniel Levy, to resign. However, while there were more “Levy Out” chants during the win over Palace, the performance suggested Conte’s team will be in good shape when they face Arsenal and Manchester City later this month. Conte hopes that Richarlison, Dejan Kuluseveski and Rodrigo Bentancur will return from injury for those games. “We know we face Arsenal and Man City, the two title contenders for this Premier League,” the Spurs manager said. “To arrive with a good win is really important. I hope to recover players who are injured. We are talking about important players. I hope in these 10 days to have all the players available: Richarlison, Kulu, Bentancur.” Conte praised performances from the young duo of Oliver Skipp and Bryan Gil before going on to hail Kane, who now scored 264 goals for Spurs, only two behind Jimmy Greaves’ club record. “We are talking about a world-class striker and he is going to beat every record with the goals,” said Conte. “In the difficult moments you know Harry is on the pitch, ready to fight, ready to help teammates, ready to sort the situation with goals and assists.” Patrick Vieira had few complaints after watching Palace suffer a second consecutive heavy defeat at home. “The problem was the quality of the Spurs forwards,” said Palace’s manager.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/antonio-conte-praises-tottenhams-character-after-crystal-palace-win;guardian;sports;5236

A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that we have commenced legal proceedings in the High Court against PPE Medpro Limited for breach of contract regarding gowns delivered under a contract dated 26 June 2020.

""We do not comment on matters that are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.""

Politics live: Health secretary says he is keen to talk to unions

PPE Medpro said the case over the supply of sterile gowns would be ""rigorously defended"" and accused the DHSC of a ""cynical attempt to recover money from suppliers"" who acted in good faith.

It said in a statement: ""PPE Medpro will demonstrate to the courts that we supplied our gowns to the correct specification, on time and at a highly competitive price.

""The case will also show the utter incompetence of DHSC to correctly procure and specify PPE during the emergency procurement period. This will be the real legacy of the court case and it will be played out in the public arena for all to see.""

The company has been at the centre of a Westminster controversy, with Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone taking a leave of absence from the Lords following allegations linking her to it.

Reports - denied by Lady Mone - have suggested the peer may have profited from the firm winning contracts worth more than £200m to supply equipment after she recommended it to ministers in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

PPE Medpro claim the government department was fighting over ""contract technicalities"" such as whether gowns were single or double-bagged because it had ""vastly over-ordered"" protective equipment.

The firm said it had made ""numerous attempts at mediation with DHSC"" but ""they didn't want to settle"".

The PPE Medpro statement said: ""Over a two-month period, July through to end of August 2020, PPE Medpro supplied DHSC with 25 million sterile gowns.

""The gowns were manufactured to the correct quality, standards and specification set out in the contract, delivered on time and at a price that was 50% of what DHSC had been paying at the time.""

But ""by the end of 2020 it was clear that DHSC has vastly over ordered and held five years supply of PPE across the seven major categories including gowns"" and because of limited lifespans for products ""it was clear that the DHSC would never be able to use all the PPE they procured"".

Who is Michelle Mone and what is the PPE controversy swirling around the Tory peer?

""Consultants were then brought in to pick over all the contracts and fight product not on quality but on contract technicalities that were never envisaged at the time of contract.

""For example, PPE Medpro's contract never specified double bagging of gowns. Yet it became clear in late 2020 that all the gown manufacturers who had correctly produced single bagged gowns were being unfairly challenged by DHSC.

""Despite numerous attempts at mediation with DHSC, it is clear they didn't want to settle.

""Too many gowns and other PPE items that will never enter the supply chain. That's why DHSC currently have 174 disputes with suppliers to a value of £4 billion. Most of this product will be incinerated or given away.""

Ministers are under significant pressure to explain how they assessed PPE Medpro fit to receive government contracts worth more than £200m during the pandemic.

Earlier this month, it was announced that Lady Mone would be taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords with immediate effect.

A spokesman for Lady Mone said: ""With immediate effect, Baroness Mone will be taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her.""

PPE Medpro was granted contracts to make surgical gowns and masks during the COVID pandemic after Lady Mone flagged the firm to ministers through a so-called VIP lane system.

She has since faced accusations of profiting from the business, but has consistently denied any ""role or function"" in the company, with lawyers previously saying she is ""not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity"".

Lady Mone is currently under investigation by the House of Lords' commissioner for standards, with parliament's website saying the probe is over ""alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro leading to potential breaches…of the House of Lords code of conduct"".

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said earlier this month: ""Due diligence was carried out on all companies that were referred to the department and every company was subjected to the same checks.

2705;2705;Jean Blondel obituary;2023-01-18T17:32:45Z;['Ivor Crewe'];['Politics books', 'Politics', 'University of Essex', 'Books', 'Higher education', 'Education', 'Culture'];;"Jean Blondel, who has died aged 93, was one of the founding fathers of modern political science. He transformed the comparative study of democratic political institutions through his research and many publications, and by his energetic development of the discipline throughout Europe. In both his intellectual and organisational endeavours, Blondel was a creative revolutionary. In 1963, he published Voters, Parties and Leaders, a pioneering study of how public opinion, elections and party organisations together formed the input side of the British political system. The first to make extensive use of emerging survey data and participant observation research, it inspired the upcoming generation of academics recruited to the rapidly expanding political science departments of the 1960s to follow suit. Blondel’s radically novel Introduction to Comparative Government was published in 1969. Until then, the established way of comparing structurally different political institutions, such as presidential as distinct from parliamentary governance, or two-party versus multi-party systems, was to undertake a detailed historical study of two or three countries, typically the US, Britain and France, and add occasional cross-references and insights. However, Introduction to Comparative Government covered every independent country in the world – 150 of them – in a rigorous, systematic fashion, using comparable information about each country’s political institutions that he had painstakingly assembled from international organisations, Keesing’s Contemporary Archives and any other reputable source he could lay his hands on. He would skip from China to the Philippines to Austria in a single paragraph. Its underlying assumption was that the specific design of a political institution, such as an electoral system, or the committee structure of a legislature, operated in fundamentally the same way irrespective of country; the variations produced by distinctive national histories and cultures were incidental. Through this book, Blondel defined and formalised the field of systematic comparative politics, ushering in a new way of analysing political institutions, which remains the predominant approach to this day. The aim was to establish regularities, laws and taxonomies, not particularities; the unit of analysis was the institution, or relations between institutions, not the country; the form of analysis was computer-driven statistical inference and modelling, not historical description. From Blondel’s hand there followed a steady stream of comparative studies of party systems, political leadership and governmental organisation for the rest of his life. Born in Toulon, to Marie (nee Santelli) and Fernand Blondel, Jean went to the Jesuit school Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, and the Lycée Henri IV, both in Paris. He then attended the Institut d’Études Politiques in the city, graduating in 1953, before a spell of field research in Brazil, and postgraduate study at St Antony’s College, Oxford. Incensed by the Gaullist takeover of France in 1958, he chose to remain in Britain. After lectureships at Manchester and Keele universities, and a formative year at Yale, then at the forefront of the new behavioural political science, he was appointed in 1964, at the age of only 32, to the foundation chair of government in the new University of Essex. Offered the rare opportunity to build a large department from scratch, he created a recognisably world-class department in fewer than 10 years, by ignoring the conventions of the academy. He replaced the traditional politics curriculum, steeped in history, philosophy and law, with data-based behavioural political science; he bypassed protocol to recruit young and unorthodox talent, including mathematicians; and he insisted that every lecturer, however junior, published research, rapidly promoting those who did and sacking those who did not. In 1970, having secured the pre-eminence of his department at Essex, he turned his attention to the poor state of political studies in Europe, as the effective founder and first director of the European Consortium for Political Research, which he led for 10 years. The uninspiring name disguised a unique institution that created a distinctive European political science. The idea was to offer academics Europe-wide, particularly the younger ones, the opportunity to engage in rigorous, collaborative cross-national research, through methodological training, research workshops and journals. It began with 25 member universities and institutes, and has more than 300 today. Few political scientists in Europe have been untouched by it, not least in the widening of their horizons and networks; Kipling’s “what should they know of England who only England know” might have been penned by Blondel. No other academic discipline has a comparable infrastructure. The consortium was a prodigious feat of institution building, the product of Blondel’s skills as fundraiser, diplomat, organiser and tactician. His volcanic personality was critical. Gregarious and sparkling, he turned on – and off – his carefully curated Gallic charm to get his way. Tirelessly creative, energetic and resourceful, he had an exceptional ability to turn vision into reality. In 1983, Blondel took early retirement from Essex, and a year later joined the European University Institute in Florence, where he concentrated on his comparative research, notably on cabinets and ministers. He retired again in 1985 to take up a chair at the University of Siena, where he continued to write into his late 80s, publishing studies of presidential institutions in Africa and Latin America. He received numerous honours and awards, most notably the Swedish Johan Skytte prize, the closest that political science has to a Nobel prize. Blondel’s first marriage, to Michele Hadet, ended in divorce in 1979. He is survived by his second wife, Tessa Martineau, whom he married in 1982, and his daughters from his first marriage, Nathalie and Dominique. • Jean Fernand Pierre Blondel, political scientist, born 26 October 1929; died 25 December 2022";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/jean-blondel-obituary;guardian;politics;2705
2883;2883;Cost of supermarket budget brands rose 20.3% in year to December, survey finds;2023-01-18T00:01:30Z;['Sarah Butler'];['Inflation', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Business', 'Economics', 'J Sainsbury', 'Retail industry', 'Supermarkets', 'Asda', 'Aldi', 'Lidl'];;"Consumers reliant on supermarkets’ budget ranges bore the brunt of food price inflation in the run-up to Christmas, with increases far outstripping those for luxury own-label and premium brands, according to a survey. The price of budget items rose 20.3% on average in December, compared with the same month a year before, according to research from the consumer group Which?, while supermarkets’ luxury ranges rose 12.6% and the price of branded items went up 12.5%. Overall food price inflation averaged 13.3% in December, according to the British Retail Consortium’s latest figures. However, price hikes for grocery staples including butter and spreads, milk and cheese were much bigger, according to the Which? survey – up 29%, 26% and 22% respectively, across all supermarket chains. Bakery items were up 19.5% and savoury pies, pastries and quiches rose 18.5%. Inflation was lowest for chocolate products,with prices up 6.5% on average.
The biggest individual price rise across all supermarket chains tracked by Which? was Quaker Oat So Simple Simply Apple (8x33g) at Asda, which increased 188% from £1 to £2.88 on average between December 2021 and 2022. Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, said:“Some households are already skipping meals to make ends meet and our findings show trust in supermarkets taking a hit as many people worry they are putting profits before the people suffering during this cost of living crisis. “Supermarkets must do more, Which? is calling for them to ensure everyone has easy access to basic, affordable food ranges at a store near them, particularly in areas where people are most in need.” As the cost of living crisis has deepened, shoppers have turned to discounters Aldi and Lidl in a bid to save money. However, those retailers’ tight profit margins have given them little room for manoeuvre on rising costs, prompting them to put up prices faster than their bigger rivals in percentage terms, according to Which?. Prices were up 21.1% year-on year at Lidl and 20.8% at Aldi in December, compared with 13.7% at Sainsbury’s, 13.1% at Tesco and 15.4% at Asda. Aldi and Lidl remain generally cheaper than their bigger rivals on similar products – so in cash terms, the hit to shoppers pockets is not likely to have been as big. Several supermarket chains challenged the findings of the Which? survey, saying the products it focused on did not give an accurate picture of inflation in their stores. Which? tracks annual inflation of tens of thousands of food and drink products across three months at eight major supermarkets – Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose. An Aldi spokesperson said: “We are the lowest-priced supermarket in Britain. Our customers will always pay less for their shop with Aldi and that is why Which? has named us as the cheapest supermarket in 2022.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “With household budgets under increasing pressure we are absolutely committed to helping our customers, by keeping a laser focus on the cost of the weekly shop. Earlier this week, we were pleased to be recognised by The Grocer as the retailer doing the most to keep prices down right now.” An Asda spokesperson said: “We’re working hard to keep prices in check for customers and remain the lowest-priced major supermarket – a position recognised by Which? in their regular monthly basket comparison.” Andrew Opie, director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Retailers understand the pressure households are under and are doing everything they can to limit price rises on their products. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of many items including wheat, fertiliser, and animal feed, as well as global energy prices, leading to higher prices for man staples.” • The headline of this article was amended on 23 January 2023 to clarify that the 20.3% increase is from December 2021 to December 2022.

4440;4440;No belt? No toggle? No worries! How to replace a garment’s missing pieces;2023-01-09T14:00:18Z;['Lucianne Tonti'];['Fashion', 'Life and style', 'Australian fashion', 'DIY', 'Sewing'];;"There are few things more annoying than going to put on an outfit and discovering something crucial has been lost: a belt that leaves behind empty loops on a coat; the matching tie that gave a dress a waist; a broken fastening that once held a pair of trousers’ fly shut. Although small, the absence of each can make a garment less satisfying (or even decent) to wear. But all you really need is creativity and a little bit of motivation to remedy these missing pieces, freeing clothes from that corner of the wardrobe dedicated to things we don’t use but feel weird about throwing away. Missing dress ties Just because a dress came with a tie or belt, it doesn’t mean it needs to be cinched if they are lost. Start by considering whether a belt is required at all, says Julia English, a repair advocate and host of the podcast Seam Change.
“If you like how it looks without the belt, remove the evidence! Unpick belt loops or trim off the thread loops that hold it in place.” If you want to have the option of wearing a belt or tie, there are a few solutions. The most obvious is to find something else in your wardrobe that works – like a belt or tie from a different dress.
“A simple leather belt in black or a neutral tone can be worn across many outfits,” says Holly Simpson, the founder of repair service Hot Dog Workshop. Alternatively, English suggests searching for some fabric or a heavy-weight ribbon. You can even make ribbon stiffer by stitching two layers together. Replacement buckles can be found online or through haberdashery stores. “Look for the ones that look like an oval with a bar through the middle,” Simpson says. “These use friction to hold the belt together rather than eyelets or holes. This means it’s simpler to do yourself.” If you really need it to match, a more involved alternative is to graft a new tie from the skirt’s hem. Simpson recommends first looking at the hem allowance (the amount of fabric folded up under the bottom of the skirt). “If that is around 5cm or more, you will be able to take the fabric from here without altering the original look of the garment.” If the skirt doesn’t have a large allowance, you will have to shorten the hemline. But Simpson cautions this can be complicated and might alter the proportions of the dress. Unless you are confident in your skills, employ a professional seamstress or tailor to do it for you. Lost coat belts If a belt was necessary for keeping a coat closed, replacing it with some kind of fastening is integral – otherwise it won’t keep you warm. “A quick solution is to purchase an oversized metal safety pin,” English says. “This can hold your jacket closed and maintain a minimalist aesthetic.” If you’re more of a maximalist, she recommends reaching for a large brooch.
Alternatively, Simpson says you can make a belt replacement with another piece of fabric or cord. She also suggests adding buttons to keep the belt in place. “Wrap it around you to the fit you feel comfortable in and mark out some placements for the buttons and buttonholes or loops to secure, choose your buttons and off you go.” While the buttons might be simple enough for an amateur sewer to attach, button holes can require more skill, especially on thick material. Make some inquiries with a tailor to see if this is something they can assist you with.
While you’re there, you could also ask about the possibility of recreating the belt using fabric from elsewhere in the coat, such as the hem or the lapel. “Coats often have complex hems to allow for linings and facings,” English says. “This might be a good chance to support a local alterations specialist, if you have your heart set on regaining a matching belt.” Otherwise, depending on the brand, you might be able to contact the coat’s manufacturer for a replacement. An increasing number of fashion companies now offer repairs or replacement parts – and they may not even charge you for it. Slipped cords
If the cord has fallen out of your tracksuit pants or hood and vanished, Simpson says depending on how long it was, “a shoelace could do the trick”. Alternatively, you might need to take a trip to a haberdashery to source some cord in the right length and colour to match or complement the garment. Gemma Metheringham, a former creative director turned circularity expert, says once you’ve found your replacement “the trick is to put a safety pin through one end of the cord and gently push it back safety pin first”. Don’t forget to secure the cord with a knot, or you risk losing it again. Torn off toggles If the toggle has gone missing from the end of an elastic or cord, don’t panic. “Toggles are surprisingly easy (if fiddly) to replace,” English says. “You can find them at haberdashery shops – or on old sleeping bags.” For a perfect match Simpson recommends searching online.
To put a toggle back on your garment, it helps to understand how they operate. “Toggles work by passing the cord through an inner and an outer component. These have aligned cylindrical holes. When the toggle is released, the spring pushes on the inner section so that the hole no longer aligns, gripping the cord that runs between in the process,” English says. “To replace, press on the toggle to align the holes, pass the cord through, and knot.” Unfastened trousers Broken trouser hooks are one of the easiest problems to fix, Simpson says, and “an opportunity for you to practise hand sewing”.
Depending on the trousers, the fastening may require either a hook and eye, or a bar and eye, which is a larger, sturdier fastening. Simpson says both can be bought at haberdashery stores and packets of them make useful additions to your at-home repair kit. “All that needs to be done is to make a few secure stitches to the garment then add the hook and eye to the position,” Simpson says. “[Add] a couple more stitches through the metal loops [then] make a neat knot to secure, trim threads and you’ve got yourself hooked in.” Do you have a fashion emergency you’d like closet clinic’s help to solve?

When I’m feeling a bit unhappy, cooking is such a soothing, happy-making thing for me, so there’s usually stuff in the freezer. After lunch? My husband, John, is tremendously good with the grandchildren. We have Segways, scooters and swings and, for the grownups, a boules court. Sundays growing up? I had a childhood of privilege. We had a big house in Johannesburg with a pool and tennis court. There was a hammock underneath the pergola. I used to lie in it and eat chocolates and read books. My father loved mowing the lawn; the sound of him going backwards and forwards making that clackety-clack noise, and the smell of the cut grass, is such a happy memory for me. Once the guests leave? I’m quite partial to a siesta. More food later? Scrambled eggs and bacon on toast. We have a cosy Sunday evening together with the fire on, so I don’t get the Sunday blues.

1727;1727;Total wipeout: ‘Netflix curse’ strikes tennis players at Australian Open;2023-01-23T16:00:41Z;['Hannah Jane Parkinson'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Tennis', 'Netflix', 'Sport'];;"One by one, they dropped their heads, smashed their rackets. One by one, they slung their bags over their shoulders in defeat, exiting the court in bitter disappointment at shock results. They are the victims of a sporting curse the likes of which no streaming service has seen before. This is the phenomenon of Break Point, the Netflix documentary that follows the careers of 10 top tennis pros and is being blamed for the wipeout of each from the Australian Open, which kicked off last week. While the chatter around the curse on social media has mostly been lighthearted rather than conspiratorial, it is remarkable that no player to feature in the documentary – most of whom were either favourites and/or grand slam-finalists – has made it to the second week. Three of them didn’t even make it to the baseline, with home favourites Nick Kyrgios and Ajla Tomljanović and the Spaniard Paula Badosa pulling out with injuries beforehand.
Matteo Berrettini, who brought a little romcom to the show as the handsome then-boyfriend of Tomljanović and was filmed in Italy telling his family this was “his year”, fell in a five-set slog to a resurgent Andy Murray. Berrettini slammed the easiest of match points into the net, allowing himself a rueful smile afterwards. Round two proved nothing short of a bloodbath for the rest. Ons Jabeur, the world’s second-best female player – she reached the US Open and Wimbledon finals last year and features heavily in the episode Great Expectations – crashed out in three sets, two of which she lost 6-1. Casper Ruud, the No 3 men’s player and a two-time grand slam finalist (who was part of the funniest moment in the show), was upset by an up-and-comer. Taylor Fritz, the men’s US No 1 (and men’s world No 9) fell to a player ranked 98 places below him.
Murray – who is the star of a documentary on rival streamer Prime Video – proved a double assassin. After striking down Berrettini, he knocked out Thanasi Kokkinakis, the best friend and doubles partner of Kyrgios. Netflix’s access to the two tennis bad boys (known as the Special Ks) was one of Break Point’s biggest selling points. But in a five-set thriller against Murray – which ended after 4am and was the longest match of Murray’s career – Kokkinakis was helpless in the face of the curse. Joining him on the cutting room floor was Maria Sakkari, the fist-pumping Greek women’s world No 6, with arms that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger envious, who fell to Lin Zhu, the world No 87.
And then there was one – as though Agatha Christie were a tennis correspondent. Félix Auger-Aliassime, Canada’s great hope, who is shown in the series pushing Rafa Nadal to the limit at Roland Garros. The men’s world No 7 was toppled by the No 71, Jiří Lehečka, who had never before won a grand slam match. Total wipeout – and it wasn’t even the quarter-finals. As journalists and fans on social media noticed the show’s characters being picked off one by one, so did the players – and Netflix, which tweeted: “To clarify, this is purely a coincidence … ”
Tomljanović seemed less amused by the debate, tweeting: “Can we stop with the Netflix curse lol … it’s just sports.” Auger-Aliassime was able to laugh about the whole thing – at least while he was the last man standing. Explaining to a press conference that his girlfriend had shown him the memes, he said: “I thought it was funny. Maybe the players that lost … feel like it’s connected somehow. I don’t think they do. But, yeah, so funny how things work out sometimes.” No news yet on whether he thought it was funny after the curse came for him, too. Meanwhile, there may be bad news for a different set of players – those who will feature in the second part of the show, due for release this year. Given the misfortunes of those who have gone before, perhaps Netflix should rebrand Break Point as a horror series …";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/23/total-wipeout-netflix-curse-strikes-tennis-players-at-australian-open;guardian;entertainment & culture;1727
3928;3928;‘For gays, this is our moon landing’: the unadulterated camp joy of Real Housewives;2023-01-12T12:51:56Z;['Joe Stone'];['Television', 'Reality TV', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];;"Where were you when Lisa Rinna left Real Housewives? I was in Budapest on a spa break intended to start the new year with a clean slate and empty mind. This stab at tranquility was interrupted on the third morning when I woke to a flurry of notifications from frenzied gays – had I heard the news? After eight years as a Real Housewife of Beverly Hills, agitator-in-chief Lisa had been let go. Attempting to elicit some kind of response from my sleepy boyfriend, I may have referred to this history-changing development as “our moon landing”. For gay people, the Real Housewives franchise has become a uniting force. It binds disparate groups – from Canal Street twinks to Stockwell bears – with a shared interest and common parlance. It is football for gays; a fast track to intimacy between men with little else in common. “Are you up to date on (Real Housewives of) Potomac” has become our “did you see the match?”
As with football, fans are fiercely loyal to their favourites – although these are highly medicated 50-year-old women rather than regional teams. Each episode is accompanied by fiercely contested post-match analysis. Did Mia go too far by throwing a drink at Wendy? Does Yolanda really have Munchausen syndrome? Where does the recent conviction of Jen Shah (tagline “the only thing I’m guilty of is being Shah-mazing”) for wire fraud leave the women of Salt Lake City? If you want to explain the appeal of Housewives for a significant contingent of gay men, you could do a lot worse than look at Lisa Rinna’s departure. It came after feuding with recently anointed fan favourite Kathy Hilton (mother of Paris) during a trip to Aspen, in which Lisa claims that Kathy suffered a “psychotic break”, referred to her fellow castmates as “pieces of shit” and threatened to “ruin” her sister, show stalwart Kyle Richards. The majority of fans believe that Lisa had exaggerated Kathy’s tirade, leveraging the drama for her own ends and damaging an already fractured relationship between Kathy and her sister. Lisa, a woman entirely unacquainted with the concept of understatement, claimed that she would “get cancer” if she was unable to gossip about Kathy.
Housewives is Dynasty for the TikTok age. Susan Sontag defined camp as, “a love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration.” On the strength of Lisa’s lips alone, the show fulfils that brief. In a world which has sought to diminish us, gay people love to self-aggrandise (note our propensity to refer to people’s opinions of us as “fan theories”). This is also true of the Housewives, who approach choosing a reunion outfit as if they are strategising an armed conflict. Sontag also suggested that, “the whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious”. Life is hard and being gay is stressful, from the cost of living crisis and a surge in LGBTQ hate crimes to unflattering office lighting. Look, I’m not saying that dissociating by watching rich women accuse one another of having bad breath is an act of radical queer joy. But I’m not not saying that. And for the record, Lisa was right, Kathy is evil. All episodes and seasons of Real Housewives are available exclusively on Hayu";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/for-gays-this-is-our-moon-landing-the-unadulterated-camp-joy-of-real-housewives;guardian;entertainment & culture;3928
2825;2825;Jonathan Raban, travel writer and novelist, dies aged 80;2023-01-18T08:53:25Z;['Sian Cain'];['Jonathan Raban', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Travel writing', 'Travel', 'UK news', 'Seattle'];;"Jonathan Raban, the British travel writer, critic and novelist known for his candid accounts of travelling the world in books such as Passage to Juneau and Coasting, has died aged 80, his agent has confirmed. Born in Norfolk in 1942, Raban grew up the son of an Anglican clergyman in several Church of England vicarages. The family had little income but several “upper-middle-class connections: coat-of-arms, one-time country house”. “We belonged nowhere,” he wrote in his 1986 book Coasting. “We had the money of one lot, the voices of another – and we had an unearthly goodliness which removed us from the social map altogether.”
Raban, who died on Tuesday in Seattle, attended the University of Hull – where he became friends with Philip Larkin – and went into academia at the University of East Anglia. But he spent his vacations writing fiction and journalism, and eventually moved to London to become a freelance writer in 1969, lodging with the US poet Robert Lowell. The two became friends, and Raban was inspired by Lowell’s ability for “turning the turmoil of his life into art”. Soon he was travelling and writing about everything he saw. He went through the Middle East in Arabia: Through the Looking Glass (1979); down the Mississippi River in Old Glory (1981); around the British Isles by boat in Coasting (1986); and across the Atlantic in a container ship in Hunting Mister Heartbreak (1991). Raban then unpicked the history of south-eastern Montana in Bad Land: An American Romance (1996). His 1999 book Passage to Juneau began as a tale of navigating Alaska’s Inside Passage, until his trip was interrupted by the death of his father and the end of his marriage, transforming the book into an exploration of mortality and fatherhood. “It’s the great consolation of the writer, I think. You’re given these catastrophes – and they’re gifts,” he told the Guardian in 2006. “I mean, your father dies and your wife leaves you, all in a couple of months. There was a bit of me that was thinking, ‘God, this is going to be good for the book.’” His blending of personal crises, sharp observations of people he met and beautiful passages about countries and seas earned Raban acclaim and prizes over his career. The New York Times once called him “a sort of English Capote: vivid, funny, accurate, full of hyperbolic wit and outrageous metaphor; no reticence at all. But at least as important is the author’s ability to make an instant connection with virtually any human being whomsoever.” Some took issue with his vivid and often harsh descriptions of the people he encountered, befriended and sometimes romanced on his trips. “How are you going to report life if you report it as a series of wonderful people?” Raban once wrote to the Washington Post, in reply to a particularly offended critic. “Some people are repulsive. Some are lovable.” His journeys also often walked in time with turmoil in the world he was exploring: Old Glory, about his journey on the Mississippi, took place in the lead up to Ronald Reagan’s victory in the 1980 US presidential election, while Coasting followed a year spent circumnavigating Britain just as the nation was entering the Falklands war. Raban also wrote three novels: Foreign Land (1985), which was nominated for the Booker prize, Waxwings (2003) and Surveillance (2006).
He moved to the US in 1990 after meeting his third wife, who was from Seattle, and he lived there for the rest of his days. In 2011 Raban had a stroke while at home and used a wheelchair from then on. He became a father to his only child, Julia, when he was 50. “I see a travel writer as someone who’s sampling other people’s holidays and writing a bright little piece about the glories of Weston-super-Mare or something,” he told the Guardian in 2016. “I always thought of it as escaping from genre together, the mixture of memoir and travelling – not going to get anywhere, but going for the going’s sake. Perhaps the notion is pretentious, but it’s of what a journey could really be: a miniature scale-model life, which you would survive miraculously at the end.” Raban’s literary agent, Clare Alexander, said she remembered that after Raban’s stroke a doctor had said: “You’re the one who used to be a writer.” Jonathan had replied: “I very much hope that I’m still a writer.” “And so he was to the very end, completing his memoir shortly before his health began to fail,” Alexander said. The day before he died, he dictated an email to his daughter Julia to go out to all his friends, Alexander added. “Even though he knew he was facing the end, he bid us all farewell in perfectly judged sentences and paragraphs.” Raban’s memoir Father and Son is due to be published this autumn. He is survived by his daughter, who said that on his last day he saw a bald eagle swooping and playing in the wind from his hospital window, before it flew off over Puget Sound, off Washington state.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/18/jonathan-raban-travel-writer-and-novelist-dies-aged-80;guardian;entertainment & culture;2825
2393;2393;Treasure hunters circle in search of Islamic State’s lost loot;2023-01-20T05:00:28Z;['Martin Chulov'];['Islamic State', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Middle East and north Africa'];;"One evening three years ago, Ayad, a former Iraqi army officer, took a call from a contact who not long before had been a mortal foe. The man on the phone was a shepherd from a town that had been a stronghold of the Islamic State terror group, and he had some information to share. For years, the shepherd had been an IS member, a resident of the hardline town of Baaj who had been swept up in the marauders’ 2014 rampage across northern Iraq and in the blood-soaked bedlam that followed. Tending his flock had given him a unique vantage point on the extremists as they consolidated a stranglehold on Mosul province, and then, when the region slipped from their grasp, as the resurgent national army and global coalition fought back. The shepherd was now sitting on one of the biggest secrets of them all: where the fleeing terror group had stashed its loot. He knew of one particular site where IS fighters had buried at least $3m (about £2.5m). If Ayad could dig it up, he and his new friend could share in the spoils. The shepherd had contacted Ayad because he felt the former army officer had the connections to pull off the job. “And then I made a big mistake,” said Ayad, recounting the story in a mountaintop cafe in northern Iraq. “I called my cousin who worked in the intelligence service, and who could get there easier than I could, and asked him to retrieve it. He said he would.” The decision Ayad was faced with is one of many similar reckonings made in the years since IS was defeated on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria, where the most chaotic period in the Middle East’s recent history is slowly giving up its secrets. From under the deserts of both countries and amid the ruins of their cities, a vast array of treasure is slowly being recovered, often by the most unlikely of consortiums. Once-impossible alliances of former foes have been formed to retrieve some IS treasure, while once-tight family networks have been shredded in the same pursuit. From islands in the Euphrates, under wells in Anbar province, in the sewers of Mosul’s old city, and under nondescript homes across Nineveh, the treasure of the “caliphate” is emerging, its location pieced together by a small network of people patiently waiting for an opportunity to seize vast amounts of bullion, dollars and jewels that IS had assembled into a makeshift treasury.
Just what, and how much, was buried as vanquished IS members fled is unknown. But the sums recovered so far offer an irresistible lure to a growing number of officials and treasure hunters. “This isn’t a myth,” said one former IS member, now in Syria. “But there are only a few people left alive who know where some of these stockpiles are.” In some cases, IS prisoners and avaricious guards have made faustian bargains of freedom in return for riches. And in others, militias, army units, tribes and spies have been involved in a years-long standoff near a suspected hiding spot, with no one prepared to share in the spoils and all willing to bide their time, hoping a competitor looks away, or loses interest. Former IS members, such as the shepherd, are now a prized asset. “He was only Isis because he had to accept the reality,” said Ayad of the herder who had pointed him to an underground bonanza. “He wanted a cut too. The spoils of war are fair game.”
Ayad’s cousin took two men with him to Baaj in late 2019. He followed directions exactly as they were relayed to him. “I told him to walk to the end of an irrigation pipe, then turn right a few metres and start digging. He did, and he found a blue plastic pickles barrel with a mesh top. He called me and asked what to do. I’m an explosives expert and told him it could be booby trapped. So they cut the barrel instead and the money was all there in bags, wrapped tightly.” Of all Iraq’s possible treasure sites, say police officers, IS prisoners and intelligence officers, Mosul’s old city offers the most potential. Even with the city now being rebuilt, and the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, from where the now dead IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a so-called caliphate in mid-2014, nearly fully reconstructed, rubble is still yielding surprises. Two years ago, a senior Iraqi police officer recovered a bag containing $1.5m from one ruined home. “I counted it out and decided to give it to the government,” said the officer, a veteran of the fight against IS for the city. “I thought it was my duty. Do you know what they said to me? ‘Where’s the rest of it?’ Rather than get thanks from them, I got suspicion and trouble. I wish I didn’t give that money to them, and next time I won’t.”
The officer pointed to his five war wounds, three bullets and two shrapnel scars. “What has the state given us for our sacrifices? Not much,” he said. Near his office in the old city are two suspected treasure sites, both known to all the security forces that control the town. “There’s one near a Unesco house and another nearby,” he said. “No one dares take them, because there are cameras nearby. And no one could agree on who gets what.” In November, the Guardian visited one of the sites and found a freshly dug hole in the ground of a basement floor. “I dug a hole where I was told and all I found was a bag carrying explosives and shit,” said one of the men present. “There was something there, but it had been taken.” Further west, towards the Syrian border, Shia militias have also been hunting treasure. Prisoners in their custody had suggested that some of the bigger hauls of cash and bullion had been buried in fridges under the soil near the Syrian border town of al-Qaim. “We can’t find it,” said one of the militia members. “But it’s out there somewhere.”
To the south of al-Qaim, a confirmed stockpile of gold and dollars totalling around $16m has laid untouched under a well since it was buried in late 2018. Shia militias, tribesmen, IS, and Iraqi officials are aware of its location, but none dare extract it without other groups knowing, for fear of facing the wrath of their rivals. “Everyone has had a look at this for a long time,” said a source in close proximity to the leadership of Lebanese Hezbollah in Iraq. “If one group tried to take it, the others would kill them. You could probably take it from the well, but getting it from there to safety is impossible. The American army would need to reinvade. In Erbil, to the north, a Kurdish intelligence officer admitted that his organisation had little idea which of its IS prisoners had information about treasure. “What we do know is they are low on cash and low on options,” he said. “They are back to basic smuggling and stand-over tactics. They can’t tax anyone any more.” When Ayad’s cousin returned from his treasure hunt in Baaj, he had some bad news. “He told me there was nothing in the boxes, and the mission failed,” Ayad said. “I didn’t believe him. Later his wife told me she had seen all the money laid out in their home. There was $3m total. He bought four new villas after that. And he still tells me they found nothing.” The shepherd also went empty-handed. “It was the biggest regret of my life to trust [my cousin] with that,” Ayad added. “I know there’s a lot more treasure out there, but that’s the only one I knew of. I was an officer in the Iraqi army when Mosul fell. I went back to fight Isis with the National Defence. We have all paid a big price to rebuild this country. But the biggest price I paid was at the hands of my family.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/treasure-hunters-circle-in-search-of-islamic-states-lost-loot;guardian;entertainment & culture;2393
1215;1215;Justin Roiland dropped from two more TV shows after domestic abuse charges;2023-01-26T01:19:12Z;['Sian Cain'];['Animation on TV', 'Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'US news', 'Hulu'];;"Justin Roiland has been dropped from two more animated shows, Solar Opposites and Koala Man, after being charged with felony domestic violence against a former girlfriend, a day after he was dropped from hit series Rick and Morty. US network Hulu announced on Wednesday that it had “ended our association with Justin Roiland”, a day after Rick and Morty distributor Adult Swim released a similar statement saying he would no longer voice the titular characters or work as showrunnner.
The 42-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial after being charged with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, fraud, violence or deceit in Orange County. The charges relate to a 2020 incident against an unidentified woman Roiland was living with and dating at the time. In a statement earlier this month, Roiland’s attorney T Edward Welbourn said: “Not only is Justin innocent but we also have every expectation that this matter is on course to be dismissed once the district attorney’s office has completed its methodical review of the evidence.” All three shows will continue without his involvement.
Roiland was co-creator, executive producer and voice of the main character, Korvo, on Solar Opposites, an animated comedy about a family of aliens who crash-land in the US. Season four had been anticipated to be released this year, but whether Korvo will be recast ahead of it airing remains to be seen. The first season of the recently launched Koala Man, an Australian American animated comedy about a suburban dad’s superhero alter ego, was executive produced by Roiland, who also voiced a guest character.
Both Koala Man and Solar Opposites are shown on Hulu in the US and on Disney+ in the UK and Australia. All were produced with Roiland’s animation studio, Justin Roiland’s Solo Vanity Card Productions. Video game studio Squanch Games, which Roiland co-founded, also announced that Roiland had resigned from the company on 16 January, four days after the domestic abuse charges emerged. The studio’s latest game, High on Life, was created by Roiland and has been a huge hit on Xbox. “The passionate team at Squanch will keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life,” the studio said in a statement. This article was amended on 27 January 2023 to correct a reference to the game High On Life. It is the fourth release of Squanch Games, not the first.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/26/justin-roiland-dropped-koala-man-solar-opposites-tv-shows-rick-and-morty-domestic-abuse-charges;guardian;entertainment & culture;1215
3056;3056;Meditation could have positive impact on gut and overall health;2023-01-17T06:00:06Z;['Andrew Gregory'];['Meditation', 'Medical research', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Life and style', 'Health', 'Society', 'Buddhism', 'Religion', 'World news'];;It is a practice favoured by Lena Dunham, Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga to boost their focus and bring about calmness in an often busy, distracted world. Now researchers have found evidence that frequent meditation over several years may help alter the human gut – boosting the body’s immune system and reducing the risk of anxiety, depression and heart disease. In a small study of Buddhist monks, researchers found deep meditation could help regulate the gut microbiome, and lower the risk of physical and mental ill health. The findings feature in the journal General Psychiatry, which is published by the British Medical Journal. “The microbiota enriched in monks was associated with a reduced risk of anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and could enhance immune function,” the researchers wrote. “Overall, these results suggest that meditation plays a positive role in psychosomatic conditions and wellbeing.” Meditation is increasingly used to help treat substance abuse, traumatic stress, eating disorders and chronic pain. But until now it has not been clear whether it could also be able to alter the composition of the gut microbiome. In an effort to find out, researchers led by the Shanghai Mental Health Centre at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University school of medicine analysed the stool and blood samples of 37 Tibetan Buddhist monks from three temples and 19 secular residents in the neighbouring areas. Tibetan Buddhist meditation originates from the ancient Indian medical system known as Ayurveda, and is a form of psychological training, the researchers said. The monks in the study had practised it for at least two hours a day for between three and 30 years. None of them had used agents that can alter the volume and diversity of gut microbes – antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or antifungal drugs – in the previous three months. Both groups were matched for age, blood pressure, heart rate and diet. Stool sample analysis revealed significant differences in the diversity and volume of microbes between the monks and their neighbours. “Bacteria enriched in the meditation group at the genus level had a positive effect on human physical and mental health,” the researchers wrote. “This altered intestinal microbiota composition could reduce the risk of anxiety and depression and improve immune function in the body. “Collectively, several bacteria enriched in the meditation group [have been] associated with the alleviation of mental illness, suggesting that meditation can influence certain bacteria that may have a role in mental health.” The researchers applied an advanced analytical technique to predict which chemical processes the microbes might be influencing. This indicated that several protective anti-inflammatory pathways, in addition to metabolism were enhanced in the monks practising meditation. The findings also indicate meditation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the researchers said. Blood sample analysis revealed levels of agents associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease were significantly lower in the monks than in their secular neighbours. The researchers cautioned that the study was observational and the number participating was small, all male and living at high altitude, making it difficult to draw any firm or general conclusions. The potential health implications could only be inferred from previously published research, they added. However, based on their findings, the researchers said the role of meditation in helping to prevent or treat mental and physical illness merited further research. “These results suggest that long-term deep meditation may have a beneficial effect on gut microbiota, enabling the body to maintain an optimal state of health,” the team concluded. Earlier this month, Hanks, 66, revealed how he had the comedian Jerry Seinfeld to thank for his love of meditation. The two-time Academy award-winning actor told NBC’s Today show how Seinfeld, 68, had first recommended the practice to him. “I said, ‘Oh, I’ve been working. I’m taking a year off [because] I’m just really tired. I’ve been working like six years,’” Hanks recalled before Seinfeld, 68, suggested meditation. “He goes, ‘No, you’ve got to. I’ve been doing it since college. He put me together with his teacher, and it’s an odd, easy, life-changing thing. “And should everybody do it [meditate]? Sure, why not?” Hanks added. • The image on this article was changed on 18 January 2023 to better reflect the story.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/17/meditation-could-have-positive-impact-on-gut-overall-health-microbiome;guardian;health;3056
3196;3196;The case for a new Keynesianism when Labour returns to power | Letters;2023-01-16T12:02:55Z;['N/A'];['Economic policy', 'Labour', 'Money', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Bank of England', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'UK news', 'Business'];;There is little point in James Meadway regretting Keir Starmer’s lack of spending commitments while maintaining the fiction that “spending increases will have to be met by at least some tax rises” (Keir Starmer may win power, but he won’t be able to turn the UK around on the cheap, 9 January). The government creates new money by instructing the Bank of England to credit private bank accounts to pay salaries, benefits, grants, etc. It needs neither taxes nor borrowing (its own money) to do this. Taxes cancel some of that money, but they have other important purposes. Tax rises to accommodate a “fiscal rule” serve no purpose. The government’s economic remit is to facilitate the fair and efficient allocation of the real resources available – in the world’s sixth-richest country, we have plenty. It does this by spending and by curbing the power of other economic actors via taxation and regulation. We had the same real resources after the financial crash as we did before. There was never a need for austerity. It is time that the monetarist policies that caused the crash were replaced by a new Keynesianism in this age of free-floating fiat money. Carol Wilcox Highcliffe, Dorset • It was very disappointing to read James Meadway, the director of the Progressive Economy Forum, perpetuating an underlying institutional myth about government expenditure. How do you know if it’s spending or investment? In popular political discourse, if money is being devoted to the creation of private profit, it’s investment, but if it’s being devoted to health, security and education, it’s spending. What nonsense. Intelligent investment is about allocating resources in the most effective way, which will sometimes be through the market, and very often through public services. Either way, if it’s done right, it’s investment, not pouring money down the drain. Please don’t reinforce the false paradigm that private expenditure is always wise and good, and public expenditure foolish and spendthrift.

The former prime minister said it was a ""privilege"" to be invited to the war-torn nation by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had a close working relationship during his time in office.

Downing Street indicated Rishi Sunak was ""supportive"" of the visit, after claims it could undermine his authority on foreign policy.

Ukraine war latest: Putin ally warns West against weapons deliveries

Mr Johnson was pictured visiting Borodianka near Kyiv - a town heavily damaged by the Russian invasion.

In a statement, Mr Johnson said: ""The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long.

""The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win - and to win as fast as possible. This is the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job.""

A spokesperson for Mr Johnson added that he fully supports UK Government policy on Ukraine, including the recent decision to send Challenger 2 tanks.

The ex-prime minister pitched himself as a key ally of Kyiv during his time in Number 10, providing support and calling on Western allies to follow suit in the early days of Russia's invasion last February.

As his scandal-plagued premiership unravelled, Mr Johnson was accused of using trips to Ukraine or phone calls with Mr Zelenskyy as a distraction for crises at home.

This trip comes amid allegations BBC chairman Richard Sharp helped the former prime minister arrange a guarantee for a loan - and that Mr Johnson later recommended Mr Sharp for the role of BBC chair.

Mr Johnson's spokesperson denied the report as ""rubbish"", but Labour has called for independent investigations to establish the facts behind the ""murky affair"".

The Guardian reported on Mr Johnson's plans to travel to Ukraine earlier in January.

Senior Tories raised concerns about the trip, with Commons defence select committee chair Tobias Ellwood telling the newspaper that Mr Johnson should ""not interfere with the messaging or the official lines of communication"" between London and Kyiv.

But Mr Sunak's press secretary said he is ""always supportive of all colleagues showing that the UK is behind Ukraine and will continue to support them"".

The prime minister has followed in the footsteps of Mr Johnson and Liz Truss in being a vocal supporter of Kyiv.

He visited Ukraine in November, pledging continued British support to the war-torn country in the fight against Moscow's forces.

Earlier this week, Mr Johnson spoke in a panel discussion on Ukraine at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he was introduced as a ""legendary figure"" in Ukraine.

2446;2446;Rishi Sunak hits the north to try to woo public – but only the invited;2023-01-19T18:55:18Z;['Kiran Stacey'];['Rishi Sunak', 'Conservative leadership', 'Politics', 'North of England', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Elections past', 'Yorkshire', 'Lancashire', 'Eden Project', 'UK news'];;Rishi Sunak flew to the north of England on Thursday, on a 14-seat RAF jet, to show voters there that he understood the cost-of-living crisis. The prime minister travelled from Accrington to Morecambe and on to Hartlepool on a whistle-stop tour aimed at promoting the government’s “levelling up” agenda but which also foreshadowed what could be a long election campaign ahead. Sunak is likely to spend much of the next two years in this part of Britain as he looks to hold on to the “red wall” seats his party won in 2019. During a 50-minute question and answer session with voters in Morecambe, Lancashire, he was at pains to show he was a straight talker who could translate his message outside Westminster. “The easiest thing in the world would be for me to promise you the earth, but I wouldn’t be being straight with you,” he told the crowd of invited attendees. The Morecambe event was the first in what advisers said would be a series of similar sessions aimed at capitalising on what they see as Sunak’s ability to answer questions off the cuff with both detail and charm. He is not the first prime minister in recent years to reach for the question and answer format in an attempt to connect with voters. John Major set a precedent when he climbed on his soapbox during the 1992 campaign and spoke to often hostile crowds through a loudspeaker. That campaign was later credited with helping him pull off one of the biggest surprise victories in modern electoral history, one that would be matched if Sunak does win the next election, which is likely to be in 2024. The format has often worked best when party leaders are exposed to an element of hostility, allowing them to show they are truly listening to voters’ concerns. Major was physically jostled in 1992 while campaigning in Luton. And a person questioning Tony Blair in 2005 asked him: “How do you sleep at night?” In 2010, David Cameron turned up at an event in Brighton to be confronted with a student wearing a T-shirt that read: “Step outside posh boy.” Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, said: “For this to work, people need to see some rough and tumble. When Major got off the campaign bus on to his soapbox and shouted over the noise of the crowd, that was politics in the raw.” There was little chance of any such conflict on Thursday. All of those who attended had been invited, whether by David Morris, the local Conservative MP, their employer, or the nearby further education college. Many attendees were delighted at the morning’s announcement that the town would get £50m through the levelling up fund to build the long-planned Eden Project Morecambe. “This is an absolutely fantastic day,” Caroline Jackson, the Green party leader of Lancaster city council, told the prime minister. “I don’t think I can think of a better day ever.” Jackson later said she wanted to impress upon the PM the importance of funding such projects even without the type of competitive bidding process the Eden Project had to go through. But the format did allow Sunak to show his warmer side. Speaking to the audience in his shirtsleeves, he was keen to show he could translate Treasury concepts into normal speech. “It’s a bit techie, but it’s important,” he began one answer about small business support. Describing the government’s investment in the railways, he said: “I’m going to come out with an enormous sounding number here – £96bn. It’s kind of hard to know what to do with that number.” And in a moment which attracted smiles in the room but which would probably go down less well with his MPs in Westminster, he said: “I want to cut your taxes … but the reason we can’t is because of all the reasons you know. You’re not idiots, you know what’s happened.” The audience was largely charmed by the performance. “You could really see his passion today,” said Laura Domville-Powney, a business owner whose shoe shop might benefit from more tourists when the new Eden Project opens. Another attendee, Joanne Hales, said: “He is a plain-talking man trying to deliver on what he says.” Domville-Powney provided one of the event’s most memorable moments when she asked a question about funding for the local branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and forced her son Luke Powney, an RNLI volunteer, to raise his hand to identify himself. Sunak invited Powney to meet him afterwards, joking to him that the moment had been reminiscent of an Indian mother trying to find her son a girlfriend. Behind the bonhomie, however, there lies scepticism that the Conservatives can fix the political and economic problems for which many voters hold them responsible. Powney said: “There is a lot of frustration, that certain people seem to have been around the Conservative government for a long time and keep circulating, even if they are found to have done something wrong. They just keep turning up in a different department.” He added, referring to Sunak: “I liked him. But I’m not sure I am going to vote for him.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/19/sunak-aims-at-straight-talking-on-the-soapbox-to-woo-voters;guardian;politics;2446

4044;4044;Next Level Chef review – Gordon Ramsay’s cooking competition is bizarre, banal nonsense;2023-01-11T22:00:28Z;['Jack Seale'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Gordon Ramsay', 'Food TV'];;"There’s a moment early on in the first episode of Next Level Chef (ITV1) when Padstow restaurateur Paul Ainsworth, one of the judges on this new cooking competition, turns to Gordon Ramsay and takes the mickey: something about the head judge not having worked in a real kitchen for years. It’s forced banter, but it does point to why Next Level Chef is a breathless, bewildering gabble of a show. This is a cookery contest that is so obsessed with contrived competition that it almost completely forgets about food. A dozen contestants – a mix of professional chefs, social media influencers and people who just make good scran at home – are split into three teams, each mentored by one of the judges. They cook within a huge metal structure built on three layers. The top-floor kitchen is state-of-the-art, the middle level is a normal working kitchen and the dreaded basement is a greasy mess of outmoded appliances, unseasoned pans and wonky stoves. Create the week’s best dish and your team gets to use the top kitchen next time; cook one of the two worst and you face the “cook-off”. The loser of the cook-off goes home, and what’s left of that contestant’s team is consigned to the basement next time. Next Level Chef leans further into its multi-storey gimmick. An open-sided dumbwaiter shuttles up and down, heralding the start of the week’s task by descending from the roof and stopping first at the top floor, where the chefs have 30 seconds to choose and pick up ingredients. After that, the grub shelf plummets to the middle level, where that team has the same amount of time to select from whatever the top floor didn’t want. Finally, the basement gang sift through the dregs. If you take an ingredient, you have to use it. You then have 45 minutes to cook whatever you like: the second that time limit is up, the moving platform ascends again and if your plate isn’t on it, your work won’t count. If the point of reality cookery is to find talent and inject it into the UK food scene, you do wonder how useful success in this steampunk Ready Steady Cook is likely to be. Not everyone has the specific set of skills required. When the ingredients elevator descends, former army chef Selwyn panics and indiscriminately scoops as many foodstuffs as he can carry, ending up with something so eclectic it looks as if he’s coping with an unexpected domestic freezer defrost – because, remember, you have to use every ingredient you take. Scared of falling foul of this rule, home-maker Tia goes too far the other way and restricts herself to just a tomato, a potato and a duck breast. “It’s a minimal grab,” comments her mentor Nyesha Arrington, who knows the relevant terminology having also judged Next Level Chef in the US. Arrington is presumably a terrific chef, but the judges hardly ever offer any wisdom about how to actually cook – the opening week’s big takeaway is that, while you must be careful not to overcook a rack of lamb, it’s also crucial not to undercook it. They’re there to motivate, adrenalise, high-five and harry the participants, while constantly repeating the phrase “next level” as if it were a sponsor slogan. “Grab a protein! Grab a vegetable!” says Arrington as her team swarm around the nosh lift. “Next-level cooking, guys!” Later on, Ainsworth is jubilant when he tastes an excellent pork chop: “That is some serious next-level cooking!” When the completed meals of all three teams are laid out, Ramsay surveys them and approves. “Some great dishes. Definitely next-level.” Next Level Chef revolves around Ramsay, so it’s convenient that his team (“We may be down in the basement but … we are cooking next-level!”) contains the episode one winner, which means he oversees the eliminator. The two under-threat contestants can use the top kitchen, but they have 30 minutes instead of 45 and, most dauntingly, Ramsay looms so closely over them his chin is almost dragging in their beurre blanc. Under the strain of the time limit, plus her well-meaning teammates shouting that her cabbage is burning, one contestant crumbles, looks up at Ramsay and desperately blurts out: “I love you.” This is less embarrassing than it sounds – because she’s not the first. At the top of the show, before any ingredients are vertically distributed or any countdown clocks activated, social media chef Jade does the same thing during an introductory Ramsay pep talk. She can’t believe she’s on a show with Gordon Ramsay himself – not the chef, but the mentor from other cooking contests. What she’ll actually cook for him doesn’t seem that important.

2354;2354;Toy Fights: A Boyhood by Don Paterson review – God, brawls and jazz;2023-01-20T09:00:33Z;['John Mullan'];['Don Paterson', 'Autobiography and memoir', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Poetry'];;"Don Paterson does not have a typical poet’s CV. He grew up on a council estate in Dundee and left school at 16, having failed most of his Scottish Highers. Poetry is indeed entirely absent from his memoir, which takes us through his first 20 years and some extraordinarily retentive memories of working-class life. Paterson likes being jokey and grim in equal measure. How tough was his Dundee secondary school? “On a regular day, chairs were hurled through windows, legs were ripped off pigeons and shites taken in teachers’ desk drawers. Discipline was enforced through corporal punishment: officially, the threat and practice of belting children insensible with an oven-baked Lochgelly, the fork-tongued, hand-tooled leather tawse.” Some poetic licence? It is difficult to know. The book’s title is the name of a childhood game that the author found himself doomed to play. “Toy fights” were mass brawls, begun without any reason by one child’s announcement that fighting should start. This serves as a metaphor for Paterson’s boyhood – his main fights being with “God, drugs and insanity”. God came first, when, in his early teens, Paterson joined a fundamentalist Christian sect. Its zealots are vividly recalled. Here, as elsewhere in the book, you realise that the most striking poems in his 1993 debut, Nil Nil, were versified but unedited fragments of his youth.
The memoir is thickly populated with characters from his past. How many fellow pupils from school can you remember by name, character and physical peculiarity? Paterson, 59 years old, can recall scores, and gives them to us as capsule caricatures. Luke was “a charismatic firebrand and brutal bully of a boy. His eyes were a foot apart and he had a forehead so prominent I want to use the word ‘prehensile’”. Paterson’s prose style is resolutely colloquial. He relishes hyperbole, vigorous cliches and swearing. He often departs from his memories for grumpy asides. In lengthy digressions he fulminates against middle-class “fake leftists” or everything to do with social media. Footnotes grumble about “young white BLM-ers” or tell us how Scottish education should be reformed. Though the book is full of descriptions of the effects of poverty on those around him, his own family had their heads just above water. His father worked for the local publisher DC Thompson, colouring by hand the comic strips of the Beano and Dandy. Outside work hours, he was a country-and-western singer in local clubs, embarrassing his son yet serving as an unacknowledged role model. Paterson became an accomplished jazz guitarist and the book is, as he acknowledges, “music-obsessed”. There is a great deal about guitar playing and the idiosyncrasies of various Dundee musicians. He warns the reader that he is “geeky” when it comes to musical technique, and duly justifies his warning. But the effort to describe the music – folk and pop and jazz – that he loved as an adolescent leads him into the book’s most rapt and heartfelt passages. And music saved him. In his late teens, there was “my breakdown”, “like the arrival of the bailiffs, the ego’s dismantling by a brutally efficient team of hired contractors”. It was diagnosed as an acute schizophrenic episode. Even recounting his four months on a psychiatric ward, alternately fizzing or stupefied from the drugs he was given, he remembers each of the other patients with whom he shared his bay and (vividly) Gary, the thoroughly nasty nurse. Recovery seems mainly to have come from membership of a band. Most of the last part of the book is devoted to the shifting shapes of one Dundee jazz/folk/pop group after another, until, aged 20, one leads him out of Dundee to London, on a one-way ticket. • Toy Fights: A Boyhood by Don Patersonis published by Faber (£16.99).

3401;3401;Texas sent a migrant woman and her sick daughter nearly 2,000 miles away: ‘I was afraid’;2023-01-15T11:00:11Z;['Justo Robles'];['US-Mexico border', 'Colombia', 'Philadelphia', 'Americas', 'US news', 'Migration', 'Texas'];;"Not long after being released by US immigration officials in Del Rio, Texas, Diana was told there was a bus service waiting and her hopes lifted that she would be taken to her intended destination, where she could get work to fund her young daughter’s healthcare needs. But when workers at the shelter near the US-Mexico border, where she and her daughter Danna, 10, were staying, showed the Colombian mother a map, she became worried. They were pointing to a city more than 80 miles (128km) away from Newark, New Jersey, where she hoped to join family members and wait for her immigration court hearing. “They simply explained to me that there was a ride for free somewhere … and from there, we had to find our way,” Diana said, hugging Danna, who had been diagnosed as a newborn with retinopathy of prematurity, an eye disease that affects premature babies which has left her virtually blind. They had few options so they boarded a bus provided by the authorities in Texas, where the right-wing Republican governor last year started transporting asylum seekers to northern, Democratic-led cities without coordinating with the destinations, dropping them off in New York, the street outside vice-president Kamala Harris’s residence in Washington and Chicago. Diana, 37, asked fellow passengers if they knew where they were going and she was told Philadelphia, a place she had never heard of. As they journeyed across America in the chilly November weather, it was cold on the bus and Danna developed flu-like symptoms and couldn’t sleep. Food was in short supply and there was no medical attention available.
During the last stretch of a three-day ride, Danna’s health worsened and she was pale and sweating feverishly, her mother said, before they finally entered Philadelphia before dawn. “When we arrived early in the morning, I got scared because I saw a big crowd through the window,” Diana told the Guardian. In fact, the people at the city’s 30th Street station were there to welcome the 28 asylum seekers from the bus. When they realized Danna was sick, she was rushed to the hospital in an event that made national headlines and sparked a new burst of outrage from critics of Texas governor Greg Abbott.
In her first interview since the incident, Diana said that she’d alighted, then anxiously gotten back on the bus until one of the volunteers found her and reassured her. “I didn’t want to alert anyone about my daughter’s fever because I was afraid we were going to be deported,” she told the Guardian in late December. Blanca Pacheco, co-director of the New Sanctuary Movement, a grassroots immigration advocacy group in Philadelphia, had spotted Diana at the bus station. Born in Ecuador and now living in the US for more than two decades, Pacheco reassured the pair that they were safe. “I remember Diana hugging her daughter… I told her she didn’t have to worry, that I would go with her in the ambulance. Later, I hugged her in silence and she broke down in tears,” Pacheco told the Guardian. Danna was rushed to the emergency room of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and treated for acute dehydration and high fever. A month later, Diana and Danna had been able to reach the relative sanctuary of her relatives’ home in Newark, where five of her Colombian relations live while they, too, go through the asylum application process. From there, she gave an exclusive interview to the Guardian. All six adults were paying close attention to the TV news in Spanish. “We always watch TV, hoping that we hear good news,” Diana said. Danna bounced around on a queen-sized bed in the cramped apartment. She didn’t speak, but her mumbling-type noises signaled something to her older brother, who picked her up in his arms and rushed her off to use the bathroom. On top of her neonatal sight problems, Danna was diagnosed with autism at the age of five. Autism spectrum disorder can have many genetic and environmental causes but the family had watched her symptoms really develop in 2014, after they became quite isolated when Diana witnessed the killing of a sister-in-law during a spate of violence in their home city of Bogotá. Ever since, Diana said, the entire family lived in fear of becoming victims of violence, too, which is why she requested to withhold her and Danna’s last names and didn’t want to be photographed.
The family kept out of the murder investigation, afraid of possible retaliation, and withdrew significantly from their community, after which Danna increasingly experienced communication and behavioral difficulties, Diana explained. Eventually, deepening danger in the community and Danna’s healthcare needs prompted Diana in late 2021 to plan to leave her daughter in Bogotá and head overland towards the US. She knew that the eye disease alone would preclude Danna from being able to endure the hardships at the infamous Darién Gap, the mountainous jungle connecting Panama with South America, let alone cross the rest of Central America on foot. So Diana embarked on the perilous journey without her daughter and made it to Mexico City early last year with one goal in mind, buying an air ticket for Danna. She got a job in Mexico City’s largest wholesale market, selling shoes until she had saved up enough for Danna to fly from Colombia and the two of them to reach Ciudad Acuña, which stands on the south side of the Rio Grande across the border from Del Rio, Texas. “I had heard that the healthcare system here is good for kids like my daughter,” Diana said. She hoped an American specialist institution would be able to help her. “She needs a place where doctors can treat her right, help her with her communication skills and to advance in her education.” In Ciudad Acuña, she paid a man to put Danna on his shoulders and carry her across the river that marks the line between Texas and Mexico. The Rio Grande can provide a benign crossing or, all too often, a death trap with hidden depths and currents, depending on the day or place. Once safely in Del Rio, they claimed asylum – an exercise that is an international right but has been made increasingly difficult at the US border in recent years and became yet more restricted last week when Joe Biden announced new border rules that advocacy groups slammed as putting “more lives in grave danger”. Biden then made a brief and controversial first visit to the border as US president. Meanwhile, the day after the debacle of Danna’s health emergency, Dominick Mireles, Philadelphia’s emergency management director, fired off a stern letter to Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas division of emergency management, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian. Mireles wrote “to request that you uphold a core tenet of our profession: collaboration”.
It went on: “Your bus of asylum seekers that arrived yesterday took the city of Philadelphia and its partners by surprise. As you may have heard, a child required emergency medical care upon arrival.” The letter had a list of measures expected by the Philadelphia authorities, including 72 hours notice prior to buses arriving, health screening, notification of passengers with disabilities or special needs, families being kept together and buses reporting to a “safe and secure location of choice, not a street corner”. Pacheco said it was the New Sanctuary Movement that got a tip-off from a fellow organization in Texas that a bus carrying asylum seekers from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic was en route to Philadelphia. A city source familiar with the handling of asylum seekers told the Guardian last week that there had been no response to the letter and Texas officials have still not coordinated any plan with Philadelphia, despite sending more buses.

185;185;What kind of society sends young men to jail and ruins lives because of the lyrics in a song? | Ciaran Thapar ;2023-01-31T07:00:41Z;['Ciaran Thapar'];['Rap', 'Race', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Crime', 'UK news'];;"Recently, I stood on a raised court podium being cross-examined by a roomful of barristers. I was there as an “expert witness” to the case in hand – a group of young Black men from a small English city charged with conspiracy to possess a firearm – which mostly involved commenting on the extensive use of rap lyrics as evidence. Local police officers had transcribed, translated and interpreted songs and YouTube music videos, many of which had been recorded and released more than five years before the alleged crime, to make their case. I’d maintained that the vast number of lyrics under consideration were not proof of any wrongdoing. They were violent and perhaps not to everyone’s taste, full of bravado and threats, for sure. But they were also outdated, clearly performative and not to be taken literally. This experience is one of many during my time over the past two years as a witness in criminal trials where social media and music content has been mined for evidence, usually to demonstrate the guilt of groups of young, Black men. It’s a growing trend: alongside Telegram messages, music videos and lyrics were used in a landmark case in Manchester last year, which resulted in 10 Black men being convicted of being part of a violent conspiracy. This development should ring alarm bells about the direction in which British civil society is heading. As a youth worker and writer, one of the most consistent strands of my professional life, which I’ve recently started documenting in my newsletter ALL CITY, has been forging a dialogue with young men who rap. I’ve held check-ins with boys to dissect the lyrics scribbled in the back of their exercise books, funded students to set up recording equipment at home during lockdown, and delivered workshops about music culture at pupil referral units, secondary schools and youth clubs across the UK. Meanwhile, I’ve interviewed some of the UK’s most successful rappers, including Dave, J Hus, Digga D and Ghetts.
I’ve therefore gained a vantage point from which to view the landscape of UK rap and drill music. On the one hand, these genres have become a world-beating micro-economy while churning out award-winning, chart-topping releases. They’ve paved a path for a whole generation of marginalised young people to follow. On the other, concern about the perceived glorification of violence in lyrics and videos persists. “Since its original conception, hip-hop and its descendant genres have been the topic of a chicken-and-egg debate,” I wrote in my first piece about drill, six years ago. I went on to ask whether violent lyrics honestly reflect social reality and therefore serve the purpose of empowering their artists, or if they reinforce and exacerbate the issues they describe. The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle. As serious youth violence soared in 2018, in the media frenzy that ensued there were calls to apply terrorism legislation to drill rappers. The Metropolitan police started issuing criminal behaviour orders (CBOs) – the modern version of antisocial behaviour orders (asbos) – and “gang injunctions” – applied without a need for evidence to anyone over 14 who is suspected of being in a gang – to young, disproportionately Black musicians. They banned artists from performing and recording songs without permission. The Met also began requesting the removal of music videos from YouTube. There is no proof that doing so helped to stem violence. Cancelling UK drill music was the PR stunt of a Tory government seeking to give the impression of tackling crime firmly. But it was lazy alarmism. As the pandemic focused public attention elsewhere, these hardline attitudes have trickled deeper into the criminal justice system. Police and prosecutors now prolifically mine rap lyrics and videos for evidence. Any teenager charged with a crime who might have scribbled some apparently criminal lyrics on their smartphone can suffer perverse consequences . Lyrics are commonly relied on even when there is a lack of other forensic proof. When it’s a certain demographic of young men, investigators can sit in front of YouTube, listen to lyrics and grab screenshots of videos gathering material sufficient for an argument about a defendant’s bad character or gang membership to crystallise. It is a dangerously wrongheaded approach. First, rap lyrics are not unequivocally literal. From the pioneering New York sounds of the 1980s and 1990s to the soundsystem and pirate radio clashes of UK grime throughout the 2000s, MCs have long laid lyricism over beats for performance and entertainment. Even when they are ostensibly violent, their words are generally, like literature, mythology or paintings, artful expressions; simulacra of lived experience. UK rap and drill music is no different. But because these subgenres have developed in the influencer-driven social media economy, their lyrics blur the line between reality and virtual reality even more. Succeeding can require playing the dirty game of grabbing audiences’ shortening attention spans with deceptive, shock-and-horror tactics. Treating videos and lyrics as if they are automatically confessional signals a rushed lack of humility, nuance or cultural sensitivity. Yet I’ve seen police officers translate a rapper’s taunts about an “opp” (enemy) getting stabbed as a first-person admission of having committed the stabbing. A hyperbolic brag about firing a gun can be turned into an admission of physically owning and using one. On the very rare occasions that violent lyrics are demonstrably literal and specific, it’s still practically impossible to credibly prove the author’s involvement in actual wrongdoing to a criminal standard without convincing forensic evidence. Second, rap lyrics are meant to be heard by a listener, not read off a sheet of paper. Rappers invent slang, ad-lib, switch between flows, hit different time pockets, raise and lower their voices, cry and whisper, sing and state, dominate and soften. Each recording can be a purgation of negative emotions. It can also be an immature moment of adolescent fun. But as soon as raps are transcribed by someone else, their original purity is diluted. Having a police officer, of all people, translating and interpreting them cuts them off entirely from their roots. Third, the police process of scanning the internet for music content before typing up pages of lyrics and providing specific commentary to vague snippets of musical evidence must be mind-numbingly time-consuming – and a mammoth waste of taxpayer-funded resources. And there are, of course, repercussions of criminalising music for wider society. It’s no bad thing for young musicians to be aware of the law, but forcing them to suppress feelings of exclusion and hide experiences of violence by demonising what is, for many, their only expressive and creative outlet, will make things worse in the long term. Society and prosecutors need to think again. Lyrics should be banned as pivotal criminal evidence. This is not about letting people off the hook, being soft on crime or permitting horrific social media content to circulate. It’s possible to be strict and critical about these things without being authoritarian. We should just expect better from our justice system. And we should certainly protect young people who don’t otherwise have a voice. • Ciaran Thapar is a London-based youth worker and author of Cut Short.

3405;3405; Men reporting badly! Nish Kumar and Josh Widdicombe find being hacks is no joke;2023-01-15T10:00:11Z;['Vanessa Thorpe'];['Television', 'Josh Widdicombe', 'Regional & local newspapers', 'Nish Kumar', 'Channel 4', 'Sky', 'Media', 'Television & radio', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'Newspapers', 'Culture', 'Comedy'];;"It is easy to make fun of local newspapers. At first glance, the stories can appear limited in scope or even ridiculous. But then Nish Kumar and Josh Widdicombe picked up their reporters’ notebooks for a TV challenge. In an unlikely turn of events, perhaps suited to a bold headline and an exclamation mark, the two television comedians may have accidentally improved the wider reputation of journalists in the course of making a deliberately silly show. Their series, Hold the Front Page, which goes out weekly on Sky Max and Now TV, sees the two performers temporarily join the staff of a string of established local titles in an attempt to get their news articles printed. “We met a lot of great people and great newspaper editors while making this show,” Kumar told the Observer, “but we also felt a lot of that sinking feeling when you realise nothing has been set up for you and you have to go out there and find something to write up.” Searching for fresh stories on the promenade at Blackpool, in the Sussex countryside or on the Yorkshire moors, the real-life friends quickly realised that nabbing “a scoop” and then writing to deadline are not simple tasks. “The papers we worked on are at the centre of their communities and rightly take it very seriously. It seems good to show this at a time when social media has done a lot of damage to the idea of journalism,” said Widdicombe. “You are always nervous before a new show goes out on air, but I’m not sure I’ve ever had such a positive reaction. I think it is because people can see it has its heart in the right place.” Widdicombe, best known as a presenter of Channel 4’s The Last Leg, already had a healthy respect for the reporter’s trade. He studied journalism and had an early job on a magazine devoted to the children’s TV show Dora the Explorer, before working freelance on the Guardian a decade ago. “It is a proper trade, despite the widespread lack of trust now. And we got a sense in some of the newsrooms, like the Yorkshire Post, just how historic they are. There are reproduction front pages on the wall from Victorian times. “Reporters today often have to make videos and take photographs too, and write for websites that are real local touchstones, as well as for the printed editions. Editors may have freelance writers helping out, but a lot of papers are working on a skeleton staff and so were genuinely pleased when we first arrived, offering an extra pair of hands.”
Highlights of the show, however, are the duo’s many failures to hit the mark. Stand-out humiliations include Kumar’s vain attempt to confront a visiting Boris Johnson, then prime minister, with a searing political question, and Widdicombe’s doomed efforts to produce a football match report in real time on a deadline. Kumar said: “In certain places, all the stuff we produced wasn’t good enough and so it didn’t go in. That’s how it should be. I don’t think I have laughed so much before on a show as I did reading Josh’s report. It didn’t even have the final score in it. “We were mainly interested in Hold the Front Page being funny but – although I know Josh will roll his eyes at this – I also think there is a point behind it all. The funding model for a lot of news journalism has been so broken by the arrival of the internet, it’s important to show what reporters still do on the ground. “We only ever want to make fun of people who deserve it and, as two comedians coming along, we deserved to be the butt of the joke, and were more than happy to be that. It was always about celebrating local journalism.” Kumar added: “Anyone who had doubts about local journalists will remember the way the radio interviews with Liz Truss went during her short time as prime minister. There had been sniffy comments about her avoiding the scrutiny of the national networks, but these local interviewers were totally professional and well-briefed, and they all handed her backside to her. It makes total sense to me now.” “For many of these journalists, the job is a real calling, despite all the conspiracy theories about ‘mainstream media’,” said Widdicombe. “So if me and Nish doing journalism really badly has shown a bit more about what the job really is, then that is my gift to the world.”";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/15/comedians-nish-kumar-josh-widdicombe-tv-hold-the-front-page;guardian;entertainment & culture;3405
3291;3291;History revisited: what the isolationist Qing dynasty tells us about Xi Jinping’s China;2023-01-16T00:17:38Z;['Verna Yu'];['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'World news', 'Asia Pacific'];;"At the height of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese empire was one of the great powers of the world. Its territory spanned all the way to Inner Asia and its economic prosperity and military might was the envy of the world. But despite its success, rampant corruption, weak governance, internal revolts and foreign invasion led to the decline of its national power and its eventual collapse. The beginning of the 20th century would mark the end of China’s centuries-long dynasties, ruled over by emperors. For decades, the Qing imperial dynasty’s isolationist policies have been widely blamed for the country’s downfall, but that history is now being revisited.
The recent promotion of a historian – who spearheaded a rehabilitation of the period – to the highest levels of Chinese society has led to speculation that the past is being reinterpreted to bolster President Xi Jinping’s ideological and political authority. Historian Gao Xiang was appointed president, as well as the more powerful role of secretary of the Communist party, at the influential Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass) just before the new year. The Cass is the top national research institution that formulates ideology and advises leaders on policymaking. At the 2019 launch of the Chinese Academy of History, of which Gao is also president and party chief, Xi stated its mission was to push a historical narrative with “Chinese characteristics”. Chen Daoyin, a former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, says Cass is not so much an academic institution but a body to formulate party ideology to support the leadership. “[Xi] needs experts to reinterpret Chinese history to bolster his credibility,” Chen says. Xi regards history as a highly contentious issue and has repeatedly emphasised the importance of upholding the party’s own version of the past. Since he took power, authorities have pulled out all the stops to suppress unorthodox versions of history that they fear would tarnish the image of the party and threaten its legitimacy. In 2013, an internal Communist party edict known as Document No 9 denounced “historical nihilism” among the seven supposedly subversive influences on society. In 2016, the authorities forcibly took over the management of a political magazine, Yanhuang Chunqiu, which often contested official versions of history with eyewitness accounts. In 2017, the country legislated against defaming the Communist “heroes and martyrs” to punish those who challenge the official history. The Chinese Communist party has a record of manipulating historical records as well. Photos in state press were often altered to cut out purged individuals and historical documents were tampered with to suit the latest political needs. Gao, an expert on China’s two last imperial dynasties – Ming and Qing, which ruled from late 14th to the early 20th centuries – is known for his loyalty to Xi and his defence of Xi’s ideology and policies. Last summer, an article written by a panel led by Gao at the Chinese Academy of History created a furore. Readers saw it as an oblique justification of China’s isolationist foreign policy amid the Covid lockdowns and escalating tensions with the west. The article was a defence of biguan suoguo (“closing and locking up of the country”), an isolationist policy implemented by the imperial rulers of the Ming and Qing dynasties that is widely blamed for China’s decline in the late 19th century. The article contends that the popular depiction of the closed-door policy as backwards and barbaric is a “western-centric” historical narrative. It argues that the policy should be seen in historical context as a self-defence strategy to fend off the “threatening aggressive western colonial forces”. A video clip embedded in the official social media post highlights the message of China under siege under western colonialism with images of warships and colonial invaders in 19th-century costume. Gao has also penned numerous articles in the state press in support of Xi’s rhetoric and his vision of the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. Last week, an article by Gao touted on the website of Cass insisted that “one cannot stray from the party’s firm leadership and the firm discipline for a moment … the nation can only be strong when the party is strong”. Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute, says Xi’s appointment of Gao was not due to his academic merits but, rather, his political loyalty. His appointment was in the same vein as Xi’s promotion of his allies to the party’s top political decision-making body at the 20th party congress last year, he says. “Under Xi, be it history, literature or music, everything has to serve the purpose of patriotism, and Xi personifies the state … If history doesn’t dovetail with Xi’s rhetoric, that’s unpatriotic.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/what-the-isolationist-qing-dynasty-tells-us-about-xi-jinpings-china;guardian;politics;3291

What does it mean for you?

Virgin Mobile customers are to begin switching to O2 plans in the coming months after the merger of the two companies in 2021.

When is it happening?

The first batch of customers is to begin receiving communications about the change in February, before the migration begins in March.

Exact details of the change will be outlined clearly to individual customers at least 30 days before their migration takes place, Virgin Media O2 said, with the company aiming to have all existing and newly joined Virgin Mobile customers on O2 plans by the end of the year.

The migration is set to carry on throughout 2023.

How will it happen and will it cost you any extra?

Virgin Media O2 said the move will occur seamlessly and over the air for the vast majority of customers, with no need to replace sim cards or change any billing information.

No customers will see the cost of their plan rise as a result of the switch, the company said.

It said millions will receive unlimited texts and voice calls, as well as an increase in their data allowance.

What else has Virgin Media O2 said?

Chief commercial officer Gareth Turpin commented: ""Our teams will guide customers through every step of the migration, and we're laser-focused on making sure this all occurs in the most hassle-free way possible.

""With all of our mobile brands now powered by the award-winning O2 network, we are making fantastic progress in our integration plans while continuing to deliver a range of knockout mobile services that cater for all needs.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230111114809/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-are-we-returning-to-cash-virgin-mobile-customers-to-be-moved-to-o2-could-a-caravan-save-you-thousands-each-year-12615118;skynews;business & economy;1034
3834;3834;Trump appointee named special counsel in Biden papers investigation;2023-01-12T20:30:33Z;['Hugo Lowell', 'Martin Pengelly'];['Joe Biden', 'Delaware', 'US news', 'US politics'];;"The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel on Thursday to investigate Joe Biden’s retention of classified documents from his time as vice-president.
The move to name Robert Hur, a former Trump-appointed federal prosecutor and former top justice department official, was a rapid decision from Garland to insulate the department from possible accusations of political conflicts or interference. Hur will be responsible for investigating the potential unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents at Biden’s home and his former thinktank, and will have the authority to prosecute any crimes resulting from the investigation, the order signed by Garland said. “I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgement. I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service,” Hur said in a statement released by the justice department. The decision to appoint a special counsel comes at a fraught moment for Garland, who only just named Jack Smith in November to serve as special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s unauthorized retention of national security material and his role in the January 6 Capitol attack. Speaking at justice department headquarters in Washington, Garland said “extraordinary circumstances” – namely that the president, to whom he and the department reports, could yet become ensnared in the investigation – necessitated an independent prosecutor to oversee the inquiry. The announcement comes amid growing scrutiny of whether Biden was involved in taking the documents to either his Delaware home or the office space at the University of Pennsylvania’s Biden Center for Diplomacy in Washington, where he was an honorary professor until 2019. Special counsels are prosecutors with more independence than other federal prosecutors, who can be installed for high-profile investigations when there are conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts, though they ultimately answer to the attorney general. The Biden special counsel will examine approximately 10 classified documents found at the thinkthank, which included US intelligence memos and some materials marked as Top Secret/Secret Compartmented Information, and an unconfirmed additional number of classified documents that were in the garage and a storage space nearby.
From the information released so far, there are major differences between the Biden case and that involving Trump, who retained hundreds of classified documents and only partially complied with a grand jury subpoena that led to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago last August. By contrast, Biden and his lawyers proactively returned the classified documents dating back to the Obama administration when he was vice-president to the government as soon as they were discovered. Biden was also not responding to a grand jury subpoena. Biden’s personal lawyers found the first set of documents at the Penn Biden Center on 2 November and alerted the National Archives and the justice department. The archives then issued a formal referral, leading Garland to task the Trump-appointed US attorney John Lausch to conduct a review. Biden’s lawyers then found additional classified documents in Delaware on 20 December. On 5 January, Lausch recommended that Garland appoint a special counsel to conduct an investigation. Lausch added it could not be him, since he was due to return to private practice, according to a source familiar with the matter. The revelation about the new documents came hours after the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said the White House was committed to handling the matter in the “right way”, pointing to Biden’s personal attorneys’ immediate notification of the National Archives. “As my colleagues in the counsel have stated and said to all of you yesterday, this is an ongoing process under the review of the Department of Justice. So we are going to be limited on what we can say here,” Jean-Pierre said. Before the special counsel appointment, Biden told reporters: “I’m going to get a chance to speak on all this, God willing, soon. People know I take classified documents and classified material seriously. I also said we’re cooperating fully and completely with the justice department’s review.” The top Republican on the House intelligence committee has since requested that the US intelligence community conduct a “damage assessment” to assess the impact of their storage in an unauthorized location. In a statement on his Truth Social platform shortly before Garland spoke on Thursday, Trump said Garland should “immediately end special counsel investigation into anything related to me because I did everything right, and appoint a special counsel to investigate Joe Biden who hates Biden as much as Jack Smith hates me”. According to a justice department biography, Hur’s prosecutorial career has included cases including gang violence, drug trafficking and domestic terrorism, as well as white-collar crime such as fraud, tax offenses, intellectual property theft and public corruption. Hur graduated from Harvard College and received his law degree from Stanford. He clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist before working for the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, when he ran the justice department’s criminal division during the George W Bush administration. Most recently, he was a partner at the highly esteemed law firm Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher after he left the justice department at the end of the Trump administration, where he served as the principal associate deputy attorney general, the top adviser role to the deputy attorney general.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/biden-more-classified-documents-found-garage-delaware;guardian;politics;3834

In a statement, it said the government would ""always protect the ability to strike"", but added: ""It must be balanced with the public's right to life and livelihoods"".

The legislation will be put to the Commons ""in the coming weeks"" and set minimum service levels for fire, ambulance and rail services when the sectors decide to take action.

The government will consult on what those service levels should be, but said it would take into account that ""disruption to blue light services puts lives at immediate risk"".

There had been reports that other sectors would also be covered by the new laws, including health, education, nuclear power, other transport services and border security.

But the department said it ""expects to continue to reach voluntary agreements"" with those unions and ""would only look to consult on minimum safety levels should these voluntary positions not be agreed"".

Speaking to reporters, business secretary Grant Shapps said he would ""rather we never have to go down this this route"" and hoped that unions and employers could ""get together and do sensible things in order to guarantee a minimum safety or service level in each different area"".

But he said recent ambulance strikes left the country with a ""postcode lottery"" of services, which was ""unacceptable"", and the government would now have the power to impose service levels to stop that happening.

""There has to be a minimum safety level that people can expect even on strike days, particularly in areas like health care, making sure that an ambulance can turn up, for example,"" said Mr Shapps. ""That's very patchwork at the moment.""

The business secretary hit back at criticism from unions who say such laws will impact the rights of its members, saying other modern European economies already have minimum safety levels.

""If, for example, you've got somebody who has a heart attack, maybe a stroke, the idea that there may not be an ambulance coming because there's a strike on I think is unacceptable,"" added Mr Shapps.

""We're not proposing to go the full hog. Other countries, parts of America, Canada or Australia, they have legislation which bans those blue lights entirely from going on strike. We're not proposing that.

A section of the stands has filled up with bouquets of flowers placed by mourners and sent by football stars, while loudspeakers played a song named Eu sou Pele (I am Pele).

Geovana Sarmento, 17, came with her father and was wearing a Brazil shirt with Pele's name on the back.

""I am not a Santos fan, neither is my father. But this guy invented Brazil's national team. He made Santos stronger, he made it big, how could you not respect him? He is one of the greatest people ever, we needed to honour him,"" she said.

Caio Zalke, 35, said the footballer was ""the most important Brazilian of all time"".

""He made soccer important for Brazil and he made Brazil important for the world,"" he said.

Meanwhile, 32-year-old Claudio Carranca said loving Pele is ""a tradition that goes from father to son in Santos"".

""I learned his history, saw his goals, and I see how Santos FC is important because he is important,"" he said.

""I know some Santos fans have children supporting other teams. But that's just because they never saw Pele in action.

5887;5887;Wings of War review: how the P-51 Mustang gave the Allies the skies;2023-01-01T07:00:39Z;['Charles Kaiser'];['Books', 'US military', 'Second world war', 'History books', 'World news'];;"One of the secrets to writing a great book is to deliver more than you promise. Wings of War presents itself as the story of a single fighter plane, the P-51 Mustang, whose introduction in early 1944 turned the air war around for the Allies after months of horrific losses inflicted by the faster and nimbler planes of the Nazis’ Luftwaffe.
David and Margaret White, a husband and wife team, tell the story of this little plane beautifully, from its gestation in the mind of a German immigrant in California, to the wartime corruption and shortsightedness that delayed the introduction of the Mustang after its successful test flights, to its final triumph in the skies over Europe in 1944 and 1945. But this crisp and authoritative book does much more. It includes a mini-history of the birth of aviation, cameos from Charles Rolls and Henry Royce, whose company produced the engine that took the Mustang from good to great, a thorough account of the air war in Europe from 1940 to 1945, and even the essential highlights of the war on the ground. It’s a book full of small, pleasant surprises. Did you know Gustave Eiffel invented the wind tunnel, and was the first to figure out that “lift is the result of air pressure above the wing”, not below it? Or that Royce and Rolls were an upstairs-downstairs team, Royce having grown up “dirt poor” with “only one year of formal education” while Rolls was an Etonian and the son of an aristocrat? The book opens with a reminder of what a close call the European war was in 1943 – an account of Black Thursday, a disastrous raid on a ball bearing factory deep inside Germany by more than 200 B-17 Flying Fortresses, at a time when the Allies lacked fighters to protect the bombers all the way. Of the 229 planes that reached their target, “60 were shot down and 17 more were lost on the way home … 642 men were lost out of a force of 2,900 or 22% killed in action”. We learn that three years earlier, the young German immigrant Edgar Schmued was working at the fledgling North American Aviation Company when his boss asked him to meet Britain’s urgent need for a new fighter by designing “the fastest airplane you can”, around a 5ft 10 inch, 140lb man. In July 1940, the Royal Air Force ordered 3,340 of the new planes. Fifteen months and 41,880 engineering man hours later, a test pilot fired up the Mustang’s 1,120hp engine and aced its first test flight. But when the British received their first deliveries, they discovered the plane could only perform well below 25,000ft. The crucial breakthrough came in April 1942, when an RAF officer realized that if he replaced the Mustang’s American engine with a Merlin 61 built by Rolls-Royce, the plane could outperform the Germans’ newest and fastest plane, the Focke-Wulf 190. By October, the newly dubbed Mustang Mk10 was ready for takeoff. It reached an astonishing 427mph at 21,000ft. Even more astonishing, as it flew higher it no longer lost speed. It gained it. The engine design had been licensed in 1940, to the Packard Company in Detroit. Barely a month after the first British test of the new version of the plane, a reconfigured P51B took its first American test flight. Even though every type of British-American collaboration was crucial, the authors report the remarkable fact that apart from radar, no other important weapon “had been developed by two nations in partnership during the war”. It turned out this triumph of collaboration would have a serious downside. American Army Air Force officers were so chauvinistic, they resisted the introduction of the bi-national plane for most of 1943, when the Germans were dominating the air war, just because the plane was not 100% American.
Wings of War describes the crucial role of Lt Col Thomas Hitchcock, the husband of a Mellon heiress and a graduate of St Paul’s, Harvard and Oxford who was so close to F Scott Fitzgerald he became a model for two of the novelist’s most famous protagonists: Tom Buchanan in the Great Gatsby and Tommy Barban in Tender is the Night.
At 17, Hitchcock joined the French Lafayette air corps in the first world war. Shot down by the Germans, he escaped aged just 18. After Pearl Harbor he tried to enlist in the US army but was told he was too old because he was over 40. But his former housemaster at St Paul’s was Gil Winant, the new American ambassador to Great Britain. Winant decided to make Hitchcock his assistant air attache. Hitchcock flew the Mustang. He quickly became its biggest advocate but it would take the better part of year to overcome anti-British prejudice, as well as an outdated belief that bombers did not need the protection of fighters, before the final recognition that this little plane could turn the air war around. A chart at the end of the Whites’ book records Hitchcock’s success. In 1943 the US Army Air Force had accepted just 1,710 Mustangs. The next year the number jumped to 6,904, with another 5,435 in 1945. Wings of War is in some ways a testimonial to the fathers of both authors, although only Margaret White’s is mentioned. Thomas Standback Jr – still alive at 103 – served with and told stories of the “pilots and crews of the 20th Fighter Group” which “were the genesis of this work”. But the book’s successes are also a tribute to David White’s father, Theodore H White, because his Making of the President books of the 1960s and 70s were some of the most celebrated books of nonfiction of the last century.

With the economic outlook uncertain and in the wake of high mortgage rates, buying a house may feel more daunting than ever.

But house prices in the UK have fallen for the fourth month in a row so more people could be looking to buy in the near future.

Satnam Sidhu, a mortgage broker at specialists Haysto, has explained exactly what you'll need to know if you're looking at getting onto the housing ladder...

January is a busy time for the housing market

If you want to beat the competition from other buyers, Mr Sidhu suggests working with a broker to get a decision in principle quickly.

Estate agents are going to want this and it's all about being prepared.

Get your taxes prepared if you are self-employed

Buying a house can be a little more complicated if you're self-employed, so you should make sure you have completed your latest personal tax return and have paid all outstanding taxes.

This means mortgage brokers will have all the information they need to submit your mortgage application on time, Mr Sidhu says.

Check how you have budgeted

""If you are serious about purchasing in the first quarter of the year, it's important that you have ensured you have budgeted accordingly, especially over the festive season,"" Mr Sidhu says.

Remember, lenders will be looking at your bank statements to make sure you are not over-commitment.

Double-check your paperwork and work with your broker

One of the most important things is to make sure you have your paperwork in order, including valid passports, a driving licence with your current address, and bank statements.

""Overall, working with your broker is the secret to getting through what can be a very stressful period. Your broker will help you through the process, and can establish what you can afford so you can play your property viewing carefully,"" Mr Sidhu says.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125113237/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-interest-rate-hike-expected-next-week-royal-mail-reveals-how-many-britons-are-now-re-gifting-or-selling-unwanted-xmas-gifts-12615118;skynews;business & economy;2353
3102;3102;Berlin fashion spoof causes chaos as Adidas denies involvement;2023-01-16T18:31:04Z;['Philip Oltermann'];['Fashion industry', 'Germany', 'Fashion', 'Business', 'Manufacturing sector', 'World news'];;"Adidas has had to deny it appointed a former Cambodian union leader as its new co-CEO and launched a Derelicte-style collection of garments pre-worn by factory workers, as a spoof launch event at Berlin fashion week sent confusion around the fashion world. A spoof press release, written by culture jamming activist duo The Yes Men and sent to fashion bloggers from a fake Adidas email address, announced a “revolutionary plan” for the German sportswear company, designed to “own the reality” of working conditions in the south-east Asian factories where many of its clothes are made.
Cambodian former garment worker and trade union leader Vay Ya Nak Phoan was announced as a future co-CEO alongside Bjørn Gulden, the former Puma executive who took over as head of Adidas at the start of this year. The new direction for the company was to be underlined by a new “realitywear” product range, supposedly curated by rapper Pharrell Williams, consisting of “carefully distressed” garments “upcycled from clothing worn non-stop for six months by Cambodian workers who are owed wages withheld during the pandemic”.
At a spoof launch event in central Berlin, bruised and bloodied models stumbled across the catwalk in “realitywear” garments in front of an audience that seemed to accept the collection as genuine. A pair of Adidas slippers with spikes pushing through the soles was presented in a glass cage, as an example of the company’s new ethos.
By midday, Adidas denied it was behind the launch. “This announcement is not by Adidas and not correct,” a spokesperson said. By then, the press release had been picked up by several fashion news websites and bloggers. “Adidas seems to have learned from past mistakes and seems interested in a serious correction of its course,” wrote news portal FashionUnited, in an article later taken offline. Another report, picked up by MSN’s news aggregator, presented the new range as Adidas trying to “make amends” after being forced to cancel its collaboration with Kanye West over the rapper’s antisemitic comments.
“Adidas is a company close to my heart,” said Yes Men co-founder Igor Vamos, who operates under the alias Mike Bananno. “They have this history of incredible scandals they have managed to overcome. They are masters of greenwashing. “Bjørn Gulden has talked a lot about doing the right thing – perhaps today’s stunt will nudge them into actually doing it.” Vamos and his co-conspirator Jacques Servin have in the past posed as spokespersons for the World Trade Organization, McDonald’s, Dow Chemical, and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last summer there was industrial action at Adidas supplier factories in Cambodia, where unions said there was a rise in targeted sackings of union leaders during the Covid pandemic. Pressure groups claim that over 30,000 workers in eight factories that produce Adidas apparel across Cambodia are owed $11.7m (£9.6m).";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/16/berlin-fashion-spoof-causes-chaos-as-adidas-denies-involvement;guardian;entertainment & culture;3102

3835;3835;Steve Barclay privately concedes he will have to increase pay offer to NHS staff;2023-01-12T20:14:19Z;['Denis Campbell', 'Pippa Crerar', 'Peter Walker'];['Industrial action', 'NHS', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Steve Barclay', 'Politics', 'Doctors', 'Jeremy Hunt', 'Trade unions', 'Health policy'];;"Steve Barclay has privately conceded he will have to increase his pay offer to NHS staff, in a U-turn that may help to end the growing wave of strikes. However, the Treasury has made clear he will have to find any new cash from within the existing health budget, raising the prospect of cuts to key services. According to senior sources who have spoken to the Guardian, Barclay has acknowledged that more than 1 million frontline personnel deserve more money – after months of repeatedly insisting the existing £1,400 award for 2022-23 was all the government could afford. His hardline stance led to him being called a “bullyboy” by nurses’ leaders and health unions claiming that ministers’ “intransigence” would lead to a campaign of industrial action that could last for months and involve regular disruption of NHS care and treatment. His newfound determination to end the walkouts by increasing the £1,400 offer, which has been confirmed by well-placed Whitehall sources, comes in advance of nurses in England staging two more stoppages next week, which will again force hospitals to scale back their activities.
A government source said that the Treasury is waiting for Barclay to set out which NHS services could be scaled back in order to release what health service insiders estimated would be the £2bn to £3bn needed to offer more than 1 million workers an improved deal for 2022-23. Once he has done that, Treasury officials will assess whether going beyond the £1,400 original sum will threaten the government’s ambition to get inflation under control during 2023. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has ruled out providing any extra cash, including from the Treasury’s reserves, to fund a one-off settlement for 2022-23 for health workers. He has told Barclay he will have to raid the budget of either his own Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) or more likely NHS England in order to fund any improved offer. “Ministers are intent on preventing further NHS strikes and understand that there will have to be the offer of extra support on the table for 2022-23,” the government source said. Several health unions confirmed Barclay is working to find the money to fund an improved deal for this financial year. Unions have made clear that NHS staff must get more than the £1,400 planned or their strikes will continue for the foreseeable future. “There does seem to be some seriousness on the part of the DHSC to find a solution now,” said one official. Union leaders spoke of a change in atmosphere between them and Barclay on Monday, when he gave the first signals that his longstanding position was no longer sustainable. Ministers are closely watching talks on the long-running rail dispute, which both sides have said are nearing resolution, with an offer of 9.5% over two years expected, made up of 5.5% the first year and 4% the year after. This could set a benchmark for pay in other public sectors, meaning that Barclay would then know how much cash he would have available for an enhanced offer. NHS staff paid between £35,000 and £45,000 are regarded as particularly vulnerable to cost of living pressures, with many of those taking home less also receiving some benefits. Unions are preparing to escalate their campaign of industrial action over this year’s pay award. The GMB union is expected to announce early next week a series of further walkouts by its members in ambulance services in England and Wales. And a British Medical Association (BMA) ballot of 45,000 junior doctors in England is likely to produce a strong vote in favour of strikes. However, Barclay is unlikely to be able to bring forward any new proposals on pay in time to head off the strike next Wednesday and Thursday by nurses in England. He got a reminder of how difficult it will be coming up with a new offer that unions will find acceptable on Thursday. Health unions in Wales reacted negatively to the Welsh Labour government’s bid to break the deadlock over NHS pay there by offering staff a one-off payment, which would not be added to the baseline of their salaries, on top of the £1,400. But unions insisted they would only accept a bigger percentage increase in their salaries than the one already offered, which amounts to between 4% and 5% for most staff. Strikes are likely to continue as planned in Wales. In Scotland, Unite and Unison have accepted a “best and final” offer from Nicola Sturgeon of a £2,205 rise, which equates to about 7.5%, but the GMB and Royal College of Nursing have rejected it, underlining the difficulty of reaching agreement with all NHS staff. On Thursday, Barclay met the BMA, Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association and British Dental Association, whose members’ pay is advised on by a separate NHS pay review body to the one that helps set pay for all other health workers. Afterwards, though, Prof Philip Banfield, the BMA’s chair of council, said Barclay’s lack of recognition of the need to pay doctors a substantial salary uplift – junior doctors are seeking 26.2% – meant that trainee doctors should vote to stage walkouts in protest. He accused Barclay of using “platitudes” when he stressed his commitment to the NHS. Banfield urged the health secretary to use the time before the ballot ends on 20 February to make a concrete offer on junior doctors’ pay. “In the meantime, the best thing junior doctors can do now is … vote ‘yes’ to taking action, ‘yes’ to standing up for our health service and ‘yes’ to protecting patient care,” he said.
Pressure on ministers to find a solution to at least some of the NHS strikes is all the more intense given the prospect of disruption in yet more areas of the public sector, notably civil servants. The PCS and Prospect unions were scathing about their meeting with Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin on Thursday morning, with the head of the PCS describing it as a “total farce”. While the Cabinet Office said Quin wanted to “listen to and understand” union concerns, Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer.” The head of Prospect, Mike Clancy, said his union would continue with plans to ballot members on strike action given the lack of movement from Quin.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/12/steve-barclay-privately-concedes-he-will-have-to-increase-pay-offer-to-nhs-staff;guardian;health;3835
5493;5493;Knife that ‘smells tumours’ can detect womb cancer within seconds;2023-01-03T16:52:30Z;['Andrew Gregory'];"['Cancer', 'Medical research', ""Women's health"", 'Health', 'Technology', 'Society', 'Cancer research', 'Science']";;A revolutionary surgical knife that “smells tumours” can diagnose womb cancer within seconds, researchers have found in a breakthrough that could enable thousands of healthy women to get the all-clear quicker. The disease is the fourth most common cancer in women and affects about 9,000 a year in the UK, but only about 10% of those with suspected symptoms who undergo a biopsy are found to have it. Now experts at Imperial College London have discovered that the iKnife, a device that is already used to treat breast and brain cancers, can accurately detect the presence of endometrial cancer. “The iKnife reliably diagnosed endometrial cancer in seconds, with a diagnostic accuracy of 89%, minimising the current delays for women whilst awaiting a histopathological diagnosis,” the team of researchers wrote in the journal Cancers. “The findings presented in this study can pave the way for new diagnostic pathways.” The iKnife uses electrical currents to differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissue by analysing the smoke that is emitted when the biopsy tissue is vaporised, after it has been removed from the womb. The researchers said its effectiveness was proved using biopsy tissue samples from 150 women with suspected womb cancer, and the results compared with current diagnosis methods. The team plans to launch a major clinical trial, which could lead to its use becoming widespread. Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, which funded the research, said: “Waiting for test results is stressful – especially if that test is to find out whether or not you have cancer. When you hear that the ‘c’ word is even a possibility, the days can’t pass quickly enough until a clinician gives you the all clear. “Womb cancer has one ‘red flag’ symptom of postmenopausal bleeding that should always get checked out on a two-week referral from your GP. To wait a further two weeks for the results can be really hard for patients. “There are many reasons for abnormal vaginal bleeding after the menopause – womb cancer is just one of them – the ability to provide a diagnostic test that rules cancer in or out immediately, and with accuracy, could make such a positive difference. “This Eve-supported research has the potential to create a step change in faster diagnosis, and for the 90% of women with postmenopausal bleeding that isn’t cancer, a really effective way to put their minds at ease. We know how important this is for patients.” Alison, a 57-year-old from west London who had symptoms of womb cancer earlier this year but eventually got the all-clear, said the iKnife would have made a huge difference to her experience. “Thankfully, I was one of the people with postmenopausal bleeding lucky enough to find out it wasn’t caused by cancer. It was really frustrating waiting for the results, which was almost three weeks for me. “I was asked to go in person to receive the results too, which to me was a clear indication that it was bad news and I did have womb cancer. It was terrifying. “It would have made such a difference to know straight away that I didn’t have cancer and not have to wait three weeks.” Prof Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami, who led the research at Imperial College London, said getting a diagnosis within seconds could enable women confirmed to have cancer to start treatment sooner, while those deemed healthy would avoid weeks of anxiety. “The iKnife has the potential to completely revolutionise the way we manage people seen in the rapid-access clinics with significant abnormal vaginal bleeding who have been referred for potential diagnosis of endometrial cancer. “With its high diagnostic accuracy of 89% and positive predictive value of 94%, one could immediately reassure the person of the very low likelihood of having cancer if the iKnife result is negative and expedite further tests and scans and treatment for people whose biopsies indicate presence of cancer. This could happen whilst awaiting confirmation from standard pathology, which can take up to two weeks.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/03/knife-that-smells-tumours-can-detect-womb-cancer-within-seconds-iknife;guardian;health;5493

One of mine asked me to be his dominatrix | Liz;2023-01-23T14:26:54Z;['Liz', 'Simon Hattenstone'];['Friendship', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Energy bills', 'Household bills'];;"I’ve had a disaster since my last column. I was driving back from work one evening in December when a car veered on to my side of the road on a bend. I went off the road straight into a tree. Luckily, I was only going at about 10 mph and, though my little Kia was written off, I was physically OK. If I’d been driving any faster I would have gone over the edge with a 20ft drop on the other side. No car means no work. I had to scrape together £750 to get myself a new motor. The only reason I managed was that I’d just taken out a £600 social fund budgeting loan from the government, which is available to me because I’m on employment and support allowance. That 600 quid was going to help me through Christmas – ask anyone struggling financially and they’ll tell you how tough that time of year is, and it’s much harder as a single parent like me. In the end, the £66 from the energy bills support scheme enabled me to put enough bits and bobs away to buy the kids presents. Cars loomed large again. My son got a remote control car. I gave my daughter a £50 New Look voucher to get herself some new clothes. I was disgusted when I went to get my energy grant, though. While people who are billed for their electricity (generally, people who are better off) get the £66 a month automatically, those of us on prepayment meters have to apply for it. It’s not even been well promoted, so loads of poorer people on meters haven’t applied, and it’s going unclaimed. Those of us on prepayment meters usually pay for our electricity at a higher rate too. Yet again the government has rigged things in favour of people who are better off. When you’re down is when you get to see who your true friends are. A few weeks ago I shared with others how difficult things were for me and the kids. It’s the first time I’ve gone public about it. I wasn’t asking for or expecting anything, but the response was amazing. Before I knew it, there were parcels left on my doorstep. Bernadette, the mum of one of my daughter’s friends who works for the NHS, sent round a whole lot of stuff – sweets, chocolate, crisps, slices of meat, dips, Dreamies for the cat. I was so touched.
When you’re struggling is also when you get to see that some friends aren’t quite as true as you’d thought. Take Danny, who I’ve been mates with for years. He recently said he wanted to ask me something, but he was embarrassed about it. I told him we were close enough for him to ask me anything. He muttered something about wanting me to do something for him, and that there’d be money in it for me that could help the kids. The next thing I knew he’d sent me a photo of his naked arse, with an angry red whip mark slashed across it. Yep, that’s right, he wanted me to be his dominatrix. I was offended on three fronts. First, Danny knew so little about me that he thought I’d do it. Second, that he would take advantage of my situation to ask me. Third, his bare-faced cheek at sending me the photo of said arse. I told him I thought that would be crossing a line and it’s a line I don’t want to cross with him, or anyone else for that matter. Actually, in the end I told him to get lost.

8937;8937;Future industrial action 'will be even bigger' if ministers do not act, union boss warns - as hundreds of thousands of workers walk out;Wednesday 1 February 2023 09:01, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];['rishi sunak', 'strikes'];['boss', 'industrial', 'workers', 'sky', 'union', 'future', 'unions', 'warns', 'walk', 'schools', 'strike', 'action', 'thousands', 'pay', 'hundreds', 'ministers', 'strikes'];"A union leader has warned if the dispute over workers' pay is not resolved, further industrial action ""will be even bigger"" and strikes will continue ""right through the summer"".

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of The Public and Commercial Services Union - one of the largest unions in the UK - told Sky News ministers should be aware that ""the amount of people taking or voting for action is going to grow"".

""It's not feasible that they can sit back with this unprecedented amount of industrial action growing because it's half a million today,"" he told Kay Burley.

Largest strikes in more than a decade underway - politics latest

""Next week, we have paramedics and we have nurses. There will be the firefighters we know who have now voted for strike action.

""So the amount of people taking or voting for action is going to grow - and I don't believe the government will find it can get away with putting its head down while all this disruption takes place.

""And I think they'll be forced to take a much more realistic attitude.

""But if they refuse, we are planning for our campaign to continue right through the summer with both long-term, sustained, targeted strikes - but also mass actions like today.

""And I think we will see if there is another one, it will be even bigger than the one today.""

Mr Serwotka added there is ""a crisis of in-work poverty"" - and claimed that 40,000 civil servants are using food banks.

Meanwhile, the leader of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt of being ""missing in action"" as hundreds of thousands of workers strike in the biggest day of industrial action for more than a decade.

General secretary of the TUC Paul Nowak told Sky News the government is ""playing a little bit fast and loose with the British public"" in suggesting that issues around workload, recruitment and retention can be addressed without talking about pay at the same time.

""They're absolutely connected,"" he said.

""And really the government needs to sit down. As I say, the prime minister and the chancellor come to the table, find some new money.""

Mr Nowak added: ""I think last time I was on your programme two or three weeks ago, I said that we wanted to sit down with the chancellor and the PM to talk about what could be done in terms of fair pay settlements, new money on the table.

""We haven't had a response.""

He continued: ""I'm an optimist and I'm a negotiator, and I hope that the government will listen and will come to the table.""

Teachers in England and Wales who are members of the National Education Union (NEU) are staging walkouts today - which the union estimates will affect 23,000 schools.

Data from the NEU suggest 85% of schools across both nations will be fully or partially closed, leaving some parents with no choice but to take leave from work or arrange childcare.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan admitted to Sky News that the government ""don't know"" the exact number of schools that have closed their gates but will be publishing that information ""this afternoon"".

""We have done a survey which a lot of heads responded to, so that gives us some idea,"" she said, adding that ""the majority of schools would be open"".

Ms Keegan added that it would be ""irresponsible"" to offer pay rises in line with inflation.

Train drivers from the RMT and Aslef unions are also staging another strike as a long-running dispute over pay and conditions rumbles on - with university lecturers and bus drivers taking action too.

About 123 government departments are set to be disrupted by industrial action as well.

Protests are being held across the country against the government's controversial plans for a new law on minimum service levels during strikes.

Downing Street conceded that today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public.

A Number 10 spokesperson said: ""We regret the decision taken by multiple unions to strike as we greatly value the work of their members.

""We want open and honest dialogue about pay.

""Secretaries of state continue to have constructive meetings with their union counterparts, representing a positive step towards increasing dialogue and finding common ground.

""We also want to discuss non-pay concerns including conditions and workload.

""We cannot chase the tail of inflation. Increasing all public sector pay would cost £28bn - equivalent to £1,000 for every household.""

2744;2744;Nearly half of Spanish families pay for private ‘shadow education’;2023-01-18T14:05:32Z;['Sam Jones'];['Spain', 'Education', 'Europe', 'Tutoring', 'Teaching', 'World news'];;Almost half of Spanish families pay for private classes for their children, but while richer households invest in “widening and perfecting” their offspring’s knowledge, poorer ones pay to help “repeat and reinforce” what their children learn at school, according to a thinktank report. The study, produced by the Esade Centre for Economic Policy and titled Shadow Education in Spain, shows that €1.7bn (£1.5bn) was spent on private lessons between 2019 and 2020, with 47% of households with school-age children shelling out for them. Languages – especially English – account for 46% of all private classes and remain the number one priority for Spanish families who pay for private lessons. The more money a family has, the more it will spend on private language classes, regardless of the kind of education it chooses for its children. However, the report lays bare a series of socioeconomic inequalities when it comes to how much is spent – and to what ends. Families with children in state education accounted for almost two-thirds of the total spent on private lessons, with those with children at private and semi-private schools (concertados) making up the remainder. But while families of state schoolchildren spent an average of €235 on private classes per student, that figure rose to €300 for those in concertado education and €606 for those in fully private education. “As well as these differences in spending per student, the most noticeable difference in spending patterns between the different kinds of educational centre was in the proportion spent on private classes on key elements of the school curriculum, which we identify as classes to repeat and reinforce,” the authors write. “While those classes are practically nonexistent among private school students, they account for 30% for private classes for concertado students and 40% of private classes for state school students.” According to the report, the money spent in Spain on “widening and perfecting” children’s education is in line with a global trend – already seen in Europe but particularly notable in Asia – towards ensuring that they are equipped with “a competitive advantage” when it comes to getting into elite institutions. The authors say that hypothesis is backed up by the fact that the richest households spend the most on private language and arts classes. The report, which notes that private classes have grown “in an unstoppable fashion” so far this century, said a variety of conclusions could be drawn from their continuing proliferation. “As a whole, a greater weighting in private classes towards widening, perfecting and enriching languages and arts should be read as indicative of a greater will among parents to increase their children’s learning opportunities,” it said. “But there will also be those who attribute it to a discontent or dissatisfaction with the quality, or perhaps rather the quantity, of learning opportunities within the school curriculum when it comes to both languages and arts.” Despite noting that education departments in different countries had used supplementary lessons to make up some of the academic progress lost during the Covid pandemic, the report warned that “school systems will have to compete with shadow education if they want to ensure they don’t lose public funding over the medium term”. The key to stopping shadow education becoming the norm, the authors say, is to reduce demand for it by building more public confidence in state schools and teachers. They suggest policies to address the factors driving the demand, such as “unjustifiably high rates of failure and repeating” and highly competitive exams. “Furthermore, reforms are needed when it comes to the certification of learning, and personal and professional orientation, as well as an increase in educational subjects that turn schooling into a race that everyone can find their own way of winning.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/18/nearly-half-spanish-families-pay-private-shadow-education;guardian;business & economy;2744
2120;2120;MI5 refused to investigate ‘Russian spy’s’ links to Tories, says whistleblower;2023-01-21T13:35:08Z;['Carole Cadwalladr'];['Conservatives', 'Russia', 'MI5', 'Espionage', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'UK security and counter-terrorism'];;"MI5 repeatedly refused to investigate evidence that an alleged Russian spy was attempting to cultivate influence with senior Conservative politicians and channel illegal Russian funds into the party, a Tory member has alleged in a new complaint lodged with the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT). Sergei Cristo, a Conservative party activist and a former journalist with the BBC World Service, has lodged a complaint with the investigatory powers tribunal, filing the case after corresponding with the chair of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who recommended he take the information to the authorities. The committee’s Russia report claimed in 2020 that the security services had turned a blind eye to “credible evidence” of Russian interference and Cristo’s allegations offer potentially explosive new evidence that confirms its findings. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said “allegations that the security services ignored evidence from a Conservative whistleblower exposing Russian infiltration at the highest levels of the party are truly shocking” and claimed the “Conservative party’s Russia problem” was an ongoing threat to Britain’s national security. Cristo says that it was reading the Russia report that made him “suddenly aware that maybe the story I had was more significant than I thought” and, at Lewis’s suggestion, he wrote to Cressida Dick, then commissioner of the Met police. He received a response from the counter-terrorism command (SO15) who said it was not a matter for the Met and advised him to take it to the IPT – which oversees the security services – which he has now done. The allegations centre around the formation of a group called Conservative Friends of Russia in 2012, and its relationship with a Russian diplomat, Sergey Nalobin. In August of that year, the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, hosted a lavish launch party for the group in the gardens of his residence in Kensington with guests who included the former minister of culture, media and sport, John Whittingdale, and Boris Johnson’s now wife, Carrie Symonds. The Russian government also funded an all-expenses-paid trip to Moscow for a handpicked group of members including the future CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott. Cristo says his suspicions about Nalobin, who was the political first secretary at the embassy, had been aroused two years earlier when he was approached by the diplomat and they met at the Carlton Club. When Nalobin learned that Cristo was a volunteer with the treasurers’ department of the Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ), he said he could “make introductions to Russian companies who would donate money to the Conservative party”.
“I knew straight away that what he was suggesting was illegal under UK law,” Cristo wrote in a letter to Lewis last year. Alarmed by Nalobin’s efforts and the embassy’s sponsorship of the group, Cristo contacted Luke Harding at the Guardian and revealed Nalobin’s background and his disturbing relationship with the group. Harding and journalists at Russia’s The Insider found Nalobin had family connections to the FSB spy agency: his father, Nikolai, was a KGB general whose responsibilities included supervising Alexander Litvinenko, while his brother Viktor also worked for the FSB. The resulting articles led to the resignation of the honorary president of Conservative Friends of Russia, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, and the renaming of the group. What Cristo has never previously revealed is his abortive attempts to get the security services to act. He says that he whistleblew to the Guardian only after his attempts to get the authorities to act failed. In 2011, he tried repeatedly to raise the alarm with MI5. After an initial meeting with a junior agent went nowhere, he wrote to the director general of MI5, which resulted in a further meeting with two agents in a government building in Whitehall. Cristo offered to meet Nalobin again and question him while wearing a hidden camera about how the Russian government intended to make the donations. That offer was also declined and he was advised to cease contact with Nalobin. He also took his concerns to senior members of the party after a discussion with Britain’s most famous Russian defector, Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB colonel. Gordievsky studied Nalobin’s biography and told Cristo that he believed he was a spy. Conservative Friends of Russia was reinvented as the Westminster Russia Forum and only finally shut down altogether last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile Nalobin continued to cultivate close relationships with MPs and Conservative party activists for a further three years until the Foreign Office declined to renew his visa. In 2017, the Observer published an article that referred to Nalobin’s interest in the rivalry between David Cameron and Boris Johnson and his forced departure from the UK. It resulted in a series of furious emails from the Russian ambassador who sought to “correct” the article. The Observer declined to do so. Last year, Nalobin surfaced in Estonia when news broke that he had been expelled for espionage and had been “directly and actively engaged in undermining Estonia’s security”. Russian president Vladimir Putin has been accused of deploying more intelligence agents in London than at the height of the Cold War. “I think this is important because none of this ought to have happened,” Cristo said last week. “If MI5 had taken action, Conservative Friends of Russia would never have launched and Nalobin would not have been allowed to get close to so many key Conservative politicians and party members.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/21/mi5-refused-to-investigate-russian-spys-links-to-tories-says-whistleblower;guardian;politics;2120

3712;3712;Talking Horses: Scarface can ensure bookies pay out in the Lanzarote;2023-01-13T13:42:00Z;['Greg Wood'];['Horse racing tips', 'Horse racing', 'Sport'];;"The betting on the Lanzarote Handicap Hurdle at Kempton Park on Saturday is dominated by Charles Byrnes’s Green Glory, who won with something to spare on his handicap debut at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting, and the first question for most punters will be whether they are with or against the 4-1 favourite when there are 19 alternatives in opposition. Many will look no further. Byrnes is a famously canny operator whose runners often find plenty of improvement when handicapping, and his son Philip, who was also in the saddle for Green Glory’s cosy win last month, is well worth his 5lb claim.
Green Glory’s winning time, however, was nothing special, and he will be racing off a 16lb higher mark on Saturday, which tips the balance towards taking him on. There is a credible case to be made for at least a dozen of his opponents but when the likely odds are taken into account, Scarface (2.40) – at around 20-1 – emerges as the most tempting proposition. Joe Tizzard’s six-year-old makes his handicap debut after two wins in small-field novice hurdles this season, and clocked a decent time in the second of those victories despite facing only two rivals. His stable thought it worth giving him a try in a Grade One at Cheltenham in March, and an opening mark of 126 could well prove generous. Kempton Park 1.30 A slight ease in grade for the front-running Annsam, who led the Coral Gold Cup field to four out in November and is now just 1lb above his last winning mark over fences. Warwick 1.50 Galia Des Liteaux needs to be forgiven a poor run at Grade One level last time, when an early mistake seemed to knock her confidence, but has a realistic chance against Complete Unknown, the likely favourite, on her debut form at Bangor.
Kempton Park 2.05 Paint The Dream was an easy winner off a mark of 154 at Newbury in November and that form gives him a serious chance to notch a first Grade Two success. Warwick 2.25 All seven runners go to post with a chance, but Knowsley Road, unbeaten in two starts over timber, may have most scope for progress. Warwick 3.00 Lord Du Mesnil made a promising return behind Le Milos, the subsequent Coral Gold Cup winner, at Bangor in November and has an obvious chance at around 8-1 if he can build on that here.

936;936;‘Tip of the iceberg’: why abuse in Canadian sport is worse than it seems;2023-01-27T09:00:46Z;['Matthew Hall'];"['Sport', 'Canada', 'Ice hockey', 'Gymnastics', 'Football', ""Women's football""]";;Canada’s government is under pressure to launch an independent judicial inquiry into abuse in sport during a series of parliamentary committees in the country’s House of Commons following harrowing testimonies by abuse survivors in December. Appeals for a widespread inquiry into abuse from athletes, politicians, and academics have so far been resisted by Justin Trudeau’s government and his Minister for Sport, Pascale St-Onge, sparking one senior member of the government to split from her party to demand “real leaders step up”. “Abuse is a dirty hidden secret in sports and what people are seeing is the tip of the iceberg,” Kirsty Duncan, the former deputy leader of government in the House of Commons, told the Guardian. “The problem of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment in sport is multifaceted and deep rooted. It is about the assault, abuse, and harassment of athletes by coaches and trainers and their support staff. The only way we can get to the complexity of this issue is through this inquiry.” Canada was rocked last year by scandals across many sports that not only exposed abusive coaches but also institutional mismanagement of abuse by national sporting organizations. Among a long list of revelations across many sports: Hockey Canada used player registration fees for a secret fund to settle sexual assault cases Gymnastics Canada had its government funding frozen after widespread allegations of abuse. An investigation into how Canada Soccer managed sexual harassment allegations against a national team coach later convicted of sexual assault revealed legal advice recommended not disclosing the true reasons for his exit. Water Polo Canada faces a lawsuit from former players alleging physical, psychological, and emotional abuse, sexual harassment and mental suffering. Swimming, skiing, bobsleigh, rowing and boxing are among other sports where allegations of abuse have recently surfaced. “There has to be a strong signal that safe sport matters,” Duncan said. “It has to be the number one priority ahead of winning medals and tournaments. We will not get where we need to be without a national public enquiry across sport to probe the darkest reaches of the sport system.” Two parliamentary committees held hearings on Canadian sport late last year. The Heritage Committee investigated governance issues related to sports federations and the Status of Women Committee heard from victims of abuse across multiple sports. Following the committee hearings Rob Koehler, director general of Global Athlete, an international athlete advocacy organization, told the Guardian an inquiry was needed in Canada to allow athletes a platform to speak about a sports system that did not prioritize their welfare. “Athletes have been silenced by systems and have been afraid to speak out,” Koehler said. “Sport very easily and quickly names and shames athletes. Athletes have no power, they have no financial backing, and they fight for themselves. Sport authorities, coaches, and administrators are backed by structures, organizations, and legal teams and it is harder to make them accountable. There is a pure power imbalance in play.” Canada’s Minister for Sport, Pascale St-Onge, has yet to commit to an inquiry instead citing the creation of the Office of the Sports Integrity Commissioner [OSIC] in 2022 as the required progress in managing allegations of abuse. St-Onge did not respond to requests from The Guardian for an interview. Critics have described St-Onge’s muted response to calls for an inquiry as “woefully inadequate”. A coalition of almost 100 academics recently wrote to Prime Minister Trudeau claiming “without complete independence from Canada’s sport authorities, the OSIC will always lack the powers necessary to resolve this crisis. The OSIC is an inadequate response to the toxic culture of abuse.” Yet St-Onge is not without support in her reluctance to commit to an inquiry. Gretchen Kerr, a professor at the University of Toronto who focuses on athlete maltreatment, told the Guardian she does not believe an inquiry is required because research into abuse in Canadian sport already exists. Kerr is widely regarded as an expert on abuse in sport in Canada and also serves as a volunteer harassment officer for Gymnastics Canada in a role that involves managing and investigating complaints of athlete maltreatment. “A lot of people don’t realize what we already know,” Kerr says. “We know the prevalence. We know the types of harms. We know what it is caused by and we have some good solutions. All of that has not made it into the sports landscape broadly. I would say we know enough to put our resources into solutions rather than understanding the problem further. It is time to act and time to move. “The roots of a judicial inquiry are that athletes want a voice to talk about their experiences. That is really important and I think there are better ways to get at that than through a judicial inquiry. I’m thinking more of restorative justice processes where there are forums where athletes can talk about their experiences and get the support they need to deal with it.” Athlete frustration in reporting abuse and how reports are often managed has been highlighted in a video by former gymnast Ryan Sheehan. In a video posted on YouTube, Sheehan described multiple incidents of abuse by an unnamed athletic trainer who held multiple roles in high level Canadian sport. Sheehan also described the complicated path athletes must take in reporting abuse and the lack of accountability for both individuals and organizations enabling abuse. “The part I find so hard to accept is that there are so many people that are paid to protect us and say they are there to protect us and all these processes and policies that all these national sports organizations pay for to protect athletes and fundamentally it does nothing,” Sheehan said in the video. Kerr, who was involved in the case when it was reported to Gymnastics Canada and is name-checked by Sheehan in the video, said she “had a different interpretation of the process [to Sheehan]. I can’t answer whether [Sheehan’s] experience is typical. My work with the athletes has to stay confidential so it is difficult to talk about [this case].” Kerr added: “The problems around the complaint mechanisms have been recognised broadly across sport. That’s a reason why OSIC has been established. It is very important and a huge step forward.” Kerr agrees good governance by sporting organizations is a major hurdle in tackling abuse. In a brief written with academic colleagues submitted to a Heritage Committee hearing in December she noted the same committee had called for the board minutes of national sports organizations in bobsleigh and skeleton, gymnastics, rugby, skating, soccer, and swimming, alleging coverups. “If there is to be a national inquiry it would be more productive to investigate the woeful lack of transparency and accountability in Canadian sports governance,” Kerr wrote. The Guardian previously reported on last year’s McLaren Report into Canada Soccer and how the organization handled allegations against former Canada’s U-20 women’s national team coach and now-convicted sex offender Bob Birarda. The McLaren Report said Canada Soccer leaders, including Victor Montagliani and Peter Montopoli, “mischaracterized” the reasons behind Birarda’s sudden exit from a national team program. Montagliani is president of Concacaf and a vice-president of Fifa and has said legal advice was behind the misleading narrative. Montopoli is currently chief operating officer of the Canadian section of the 2026 World Cup. Fifa has backed the executives since the report was made public. “The report … confirmed that Canada Soccer acted in good faith and that there was no evidence of a cover up,” Fifa said in a November 2022 statement to the Guardian. Global Athlete’s Rob Koeher continues to be surprised by the lack of accountability across sport: “It is unthinkable in any other industry that if someone was involved in cover ups they would be still in their position to be responsible for one of the biggest events Canada is going to be hosting. That is mind boggling and shows you the lack of ability for sport to self regulate. Government provides money and funding for these organizations but without the ability to have oversight. It is ridiculous.” Kirsty Duncan believes the evidence of the past 12 months – and longer – point to no other alternative but for Canada to hold an inquiry that can have global repercussions. “The current approaches that focus on symbolic compliance and avoiding legal liability and protecting reputations and legacies have not changed the number of abuse cases,” Duncan said. “Real leaders step up. A whole lot of athletes were harmed and let down shamefully by the despicable actions of people in power. It is a decades old dirty secret and we have to fix it for the next generation in and around sport.”;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/27/abuse-canada-sport-inquiry-hockey-gymnastics-soccer;guardian;sports;936
5657;5657;How Sumy’s residents kept Russian forces out of their city;2023-01-02T15:13:29Z;['Isobel Koshiw'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'World news'];;"On 24 February, when Russia invaded, there were only a few dozen Ukrainian professional soldiers in Ukraine’s north-eastern city of Sumy, and they had no command centre. That evening, those 50 or so paratroopers were ordered to leave the city – about 20 miles (30km) from the Russian border – for another area. Most of the police force had already fled, along with much of the city’s leadership. Sumy’s residents were left, confused and in shock, to defend the city on their own as Russian forces rolled towards them. The Sumy self-defence forces, which formed for the most part on the first day of the invasion, managed to hold the city for almost six weeks, despite being encircled. After 6 April, the Russian forces were pushed out of Sumy region, and most of the self-defence forces members then joined the army where they are now serving.
Sumy region borders Russia on two sides, to the north and east. The efforts of Sumy self-defence forces and ordinary residents inside and outside the city contributed to the disruption of the Russian supply lines from the Russian border to Kyiv. Their efforts helped prevent Russian forces from successfully surrounding the capital and seizing control of the country’s command centre. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has commended Sumy’s territorial defence forces several times. In his New Year’s Eve address, the equivalent of the queen or king’s Christmas Day speech in Britain, Zelenskiy singled out Sumy’s resistance efforts, describing how ordinary residents became the “bone in the throat” of the Russians.
Though there were only a few thousand civilians with rifles, a few dozen anti-tank weapons and no armed vehicles or heavy weaponry, by mid-March the Russians were scared to enter the city. In an alleged recording of a phone call released by Ukrainian intelligence services on 16 March, a Russian soldier can be heard breaking down after telling his mother that they needed to take the road through Sumy city but “not a single column of [theirs] had survived”. City council workers and close friends, 29-year-olds, Serhiy and Ihor, were among the 400 Sumy residents that took up arms on the first day of the invasion. Others joined in the days that followed as they overcame the shock, according to those involved. They said only about 20 out of 400 had previous military experience and coordination was carried out through messaging apps and phone calls, with groups riding around to locations in civilian cars and trucks to meet the incoming Russians. “Formally it was called territorial defence forces but in reality, it was just people who had received arms from an army warehouse and formed reactive groups,” said Ihor, who along with Serhiy has now joined the regular army. “It was so chaotic that it’s even difficult to describe,” said Ihor. “There was no coordination or instructions from Kyiv or anything like that. We made [everything] up ourselves.”
The self-defence forces had some handheld anti-tank weapons that they used but otherwise, they were just armed with guns and molotov cocktails, say the pair. Neither Serhiy or Ihor had body armour. “An old man walking through the city saw me and said his grandchild had fought and he would bring you a helmet,” said Serhiy, who said the bulletproof vest that he found did not have protective plates. One of the main factors which saved the city, said Ihor and Serhiy, was the first battle which took place outside the city’s art college. The 50 paratroopers destroyed a whole column of Russian tanks. Both sides did not at first realise they were facing the army, said Ihor and the Russians even got close enough to ask the Ukrainians for directions. But the Ukrainians twigged first and opened fire at a close distance successfully destroying the tank column, said Ihor. But when Serhiy and Ihor reached the paratroopers that night, with the rest of their small group of armed civilians, to their dismay, they were leaving. “We saw their armoured vehicles and we thought ‘phew’ we are not alone with our rifles,” said Ihor. “But then they were told to leave, and we were left on our own.” “People would call us from one district, like Kursk Street, and say: ‘Get down here, there’s a battle going on,’ and then someone else would ring you because they spotted Russians elsewhere,” said Ihor, describing how they would arrive ahead of columns and set up defensive positions and start shooting. It was this initial battle and other attacks mounted in the first few days by the self-defence forces which convinced the Russians there were lots of weapons and regular troops in Sumy, said Serhiy. “We were lucky. In reality, it was just self-defence forces like us.”
“Everyone started working for the victory. My girlfriends from the university were bringing us boxes of molotov cocktails to the base. There were grandmothers texting us with the locations of the Russians. I think because of this, the city was able to withstand the invasion,” said Serhiy. After the first three to four days, the Russians stopped attempting to enter and set up checkpoints, encircling the city. The self-defence forces did the same. Serhiy and Ihor, along with others, started to slip out of the city to ambush columns. Unlike the Russians, they said they knew all the small lanes. “Our task was to destroy their fuel trucks, after a while they had no fuel left,” said Ihor. “What kept happening was the tank would run out of fuel and then they would ditch it. Sometimes getting into other vehicles or sometimes taking cars from civilians.” “Four of our group died after running into the enemy because there was very little experience there was no plan,” said Ihor of the ambushes. After their failure to use Sumy city as a throughway, the Russians started to go around the city and use the southern Sumy region towns of Trostianets and Okhtyrka, where the regular Ukrainian army was present.
Oleh Anatolyvych, a 57-year-old man from the village of Krasnopoliya, metres from the Russian border in Sumy region, did not have a gun when the invasion started. He hid in the bushes along the highway which crossed the border and filmed the Russian columns and counted the number of vehicles. He then sent the videos to his son who was serving as an officer in Trostianets. “In the first few days, there was a new column every two hours,” said Oleh, who has now joined the official territorial defence forces. “They did not suspect me because I look like an old man.” When they set up checkpoints in the village, Oleh said he pretended to be older than he was and avoided questioning. Oleksandr Nesterenko, a major-general from Sumy who fought in the battles for Kyiv and Kharkiv and is now overseeing his home area, said that the Russians “can try” to attempt the same but he has no doubt that it will fail. “What you have to understand is that all these people who were accountants and businessmen nine months ago, now have nine months of training. We’re here with more manpower, weaponry and we’re motivated,” said Nesterenko. “It won’t be like February again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/how-sumy-residents-kept-russian-forces-out-of-their-city;guardian;politics;5657
5588;5588;Stonehouse story ‘far more fascinating’ than TV drama suggests, relative says;2023-01-03T06:00:37Z;['Harriet Sherwood'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'ITV channel', 'Labour'];;"The true story of John Stonehouse’s entanglement with espionage and faked death was far more fascinating than the television drama airing this week, according to his great-nephew Julian Hayes. Hayes, who has clear childhood memories of Stonehouse and the impact of his disappearance in 1974 on the family, said little of the dramatised version was strictly factual. A honeytrap executed by the Czech secret services has been substituted for the real-life “slow insidious grooming” of the Labour MP for Wednesbury and Walsall North, he said. “If you’d written the Stonehouse story as fiction, it would be completely unbelievable. There’s no way on earth that anybody would swallow it as a plot line. It’s a classic case of truth being stranger than fiction.”
Hayes, a lawyer, saw a preview of the first episode of the three-part drama and read the scripts as part of a consultation. “It says it’s based on a true story, and that’s really as far as it goes. Most of the peripheral characters are made up, and very little is factually correct,” he said. At a meeting with the producers, he expressed “certain views” about the drama. “I don’t think it’s been changed dramatically,” he said. The ITV show stars the real-life married couple Matthew Macfadyen as Stonehouse and Keeley Hawes as Barbara, who was married to the disgraced Labour MP and former cabinet minister at the time of his disappearance. The script was written by John Preston, whose credits include A Very English Scandal, about the Jeremy Thorpe affair, which became a TV drama starring Hugh Grant, and The Dig, about the archaeological site Sutton Hoo, which was made into a 2021 film starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan. Stonehouse was a member of Harold Wilson’s cabinet as aviation minister and postmaster general, but his career crashed when he was named in 1969 as an agent of the Czech secret service. His problems were compounded by worsening financial troubles and an affair with his secretary, Sheila Buckley. After stealing the identities of two deceased men in his constituency to create fake passports, Stonehouse flew to Miami, checked into the Fontainebleau hotel and went for a swim, leaving a pile of clothes on the beach. After he failed to return, he was presumed drowned, leaving a wife and three children.
Five weeks later, he was arrested in Australia, where he had been joined by his lover. Stonehouse was later sentenced at the Old Bailey to seven years in prison for fraud, theft and deception. Hayes, whose biography of his great-uncle, Stonehouse: Cabinet Minister, Fraudster, Spy, was published in 2021, said the TV drama misrepresented how the politician became embroiled with the Czech secret services. “The drama portrays a honeytrap, but in fact they psychologically groomed him over a period of time. There was no sex involved. “A Czech agent befriended him and worked on him over lunches and dinners. If they’d said, ‘John, we’d like you to spy for us’, he’d have said no. But a slow insidious step-by-step persuasion to cooperate worked. “He was not a spy in the sense of James Bond or the novels of John Le Carré. But he provided the Czechs with information and got a lot of money from them. He knew what he was doing.” Hayes said he pored over detailed files in Czech archives while researching his biography. “That’s why I’m quite certain that a honeytrap was never on the agenda,” he said. “They massaged his ego and gained his trust.” Stonehouse’s daughter, Julia, dismissed the spy claims in her own book, John Stonehouse, My Father, published in 2021. “She puts his behaviour down to depression, breakdown and use of prescription drugs,” said Hayes. “I fully understand and sympathise with why she’s made that case. But it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny – and it certainly wasn’t believed by the jury in his trial.” Hayes was nine years old when Stonehouse faked his death. His father, Stonehouse’s nephew and business partner, later gave evidence against him in court. “Stonehouse’s actions were the result of meticulous planning of the most premeditated nature – fake identities, false bank accounts and credit cards, taking money out of his businesses,” said Hayes. “He knew that his wife and children would believe he was dead. It was utterly callous and heartless.” ITV said: “Based on years of extensive research, the writer John Preston dramatised the aspects that interested him most and has created a rich, colourful and poignant account of an unforgettable politician.” Stonehouse is available on ITVX.

2458;2458;Baby steps as relaunched Rish! is sent out in front of soft crowd | John Crace;2023-01-19T18:02:57Z;['John Crace'];['Rishi Sunak', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];;If at first you don’t succeed … For his first few months as prime minister, Rishi Sunak’s minders have tried to keep him away from the public as much as possible. The submarine commander. Leading us to victory from beneath the waves. Or not. Because it turns out that you can dislike what you don’t see. Rish!’s attempts to steady the economy and resolve the strikes have been met with at first scepticism and then incredulity. The man sold to us as a competent tech bro, the management consultant for all seasons, was yet another Tory dud. Not much better than Liz Truss or Boris Johnson. So, just a few months in, it’s time for a relaunch. Sunak 2.0. Rish! is to be uncaged. To be let loose among his people. On a tour optimistically called PMConnect. Except the prime minister can barely connect with himself, let alone the rest of the country. So more like PMDisconnect. There’s a gaping void between him and the country. And how could there not be? The whole point of being part of the megarich is not having to engage with the little people. To immunise yourself from the day-to-day stresses of ordinary life. Rish! can no more suddenly decide he wants to spend time among us than we can share his cushioned lifestyle. His awkwardness with people is painful to watch. His desperation to be thought normal comes across as inappropriate eagerness and enthusiasm. A knot of need that can never be fully met. He barks “Sir” or “Ma’am” to people like an American chatshow host. Always talking down. Manufactured intimacy, masquerading as sincerity. Yet we’re in for much more of this. Sunak’s handlers have decided he needs to get out more – to be seen – and, in a final throw of the dice in what is now an 18-month general election campaign, have sent him out on a soapbox permatour, coming to a town near you. Baby steps, though. Team Sunak aren’t completely stupid. They know their man has a problem with people. A lack of basic emotional intelligence. So they’ve chosen to make life easy for him. By only sending him out in front of home audiences for now. Places where he is assured of a good reception and will get an easy ride. From people who have been paid to love him. Literally. For the first sighting of PMDisconnect, Rish! flew up to Lancashire to visit a former railway station in Morecambe that had been converted into an arts centre. On the day the government had announced that Morecambe had won a £50m government grant in the second round of the levelling up fund bidding. No wonder the few dozen people who had been allowed into the venue were so thrilled to see the prime minister. Hell, he could come every week if he promised to bring £50m of local investment every time. Rish! removed his jacket and headed for the front. Stripped and ripped. Inaction Man. How could he help? Did anyone have questions for him? Er … not really. It could have been a shareholders’ sleepy AGM, only at least at those you get the odd tricky customer. Here, all anyone wanted to do was lovebomb the prime minister. Would he like to tell us how wonderful he was? And why he was so right to give Morecambe £50m? How could the process not have been transparent and fair if the good guys were winning? “I believe in action and accountability,” said Sunak. You could feel him wanting to fall deep into the audience’s eyes. He pointed to his five pledges, printed on the backdrop. Reduce inflation? He’d done that already. Though all economists agreed that inflation would be coming down even if he’d done nothing. Hospital waiting lists down. He’d done that, too. Though down by the merest fraction from more than 7 million. Winning with Rish!. He might as well have promised to keep Christmas Day on 25 December. Things became rather more awkward when Sunak took questions from the media. Though he must have been hoping for another easy ride as the only questions he took from the print media were from the Tory-friendly Sun and Mail. But even they had had enough of playing softball. Too claggy. Too fake. ITV got things going. Wasn’t the levelling up a bit of a sham? Loads of money going to the south to prop up the Tory vote? Hunger Games-style bidding war pitting council against council? £27m of public money wasted in bidding wars? No joined-up government? Money just a partial refund on budget cuts over the past 13 years? Rish! was outraged. He had made sure his own wealthy constituency had been successful. He was a hands-on prime minister. Sunak went on to declare that anyone who thought tax cuts were imminent were idiots. Nice to know what he thinks of half the Tory party. And he couldn’t see what all the fuss was about him taking another private jet. His carbon footprint had been more than offset by the net zero bid he’d awarded to Blackpool. With that he was off to Hartlepool. To have more non-conversations with people he didn’t care much about. Back in London, the junior levelling up minister Lucy Frazer was having a far more uncomfortable time in the Commons as she was forced to answer an urgent question on the cash distribution, with Michael Gove having declared himself awol. He literally had one job … Still, I’m sure he sent a reassuring message to Frazer, who crashed and burned while making no secret of the fact she would rather be elsewhere. Nor did she really bother to conceal the fact that the funding mechanisms were hopelessly flawed and open to political gaming. Like many ministers, she appears already to have given up and be planning her next move. Rather, she just went through the motions as Labour took her apart and many of her own MPs from constituencies that had been unsuccessful in the bidding process expressed their reservations about the system. But there’s always Tory Harriett Baldwin. She couldn’t have been happier that her constituency had got lucky. People should stop moaning because they lost out, she said. Instead, they should take some responsibility, roll up their sleeves and prepare better bids next time. That’s telling them, Harriett.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/19/baby-steps-rishi-sunak-relaunch-soft-crowd-morecambe;guardian;politics;2458

8641;8641;Getting a manicure? Wear gloves or sunscreen, GP warns, after study reveals UV lamp risks;Sunday 29 January 2023 00:00, UK;[];['cancer'];['reveals', 'cells', 'sunscreen', 'skin', 'wear', 'uv', 'risk', 'used', 'cause', 'nail', 'exposure', 'warns', 'risks', 'manicure', 'mutations', 'gp', 'study', 'lamp'];"If your idea of pampering involves a trip to the nail salon, a doctor has a warning for you - protect your hands or risk damaging your skin cells permanently.

Dr Najia Shaikh - a GP, skin doctor and the founder of One Skin Clinic - told Sky News ""it's better to be safe than sorry"" when getting a manicure.

Her warning comes after a study found the UV nail polish dryers used in salons can damage DNA and lead to cancer-causing mutations in human cells.

The study looked at cells from humans and mice, and found cells died when exposed to levels of UV radiation commonly found in nail salon dryers.

'It's better to protect your hands'

Dr Shaikh said there's still very little evidence about the exact harm caused by nail lamps.

But she added ""any kind of UV radiation can actually affect the cells, mutate the cells, change the DNA"".

""It's better to protect your hands,"" she said.

She advised people to wear gloves with the fingertips cut off, or to apply a broad-spectrum cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 50 that protects against both UVA and UVB rays, if they do choose to expose their hands to the lamps.

These precautions are particularly important for people who get manicures regularly as the effect of UV is cumulative, getting worse with each exposure, she said.

The study doesn't mean everyone should immediately cancel their nail appointments, though, according to Dr Shaikh.

She likened the risk level to the dangers of a sunny day.

""We can't stop people from going out in the sun just because sun radiation is going to cause damage,"" she said.

What is important is being aware of the potential risks and guarding against them, she added.

UV lamps cause cells to die

Scientists have long sounded alarm bells over the cancer risk related to salon sunbeds used for tanning but new research indicates the devices used to dry gel manicures could also be harmful.

Tanning beds use a spectrum of UV light that studies have conclusively proven to cause cancer - but the spectrum used in the nail dryers has not been well-studied.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego have now found the nail dryers cause cells to die and cause mutations that could lead to cancer.

The researchers noted that a long-term epidemiological study would need to be done before ""stating conclusively"" that using the machines leads to an increased risk of skin cancers.

But Ludmil Alexandrov, one of the authors of the study published in Nature Communications and a professor at UC San Diego, said the devices were currently being ""marketed as safe"", even though little research has been done into the dryers.

What the researchers found

Use of the UV dryers for one 20-minute session resulted in 20-30% cell death, researchers found, while three consecutive 20-minute exposures caused 65-70% of the exposed cells to die.

The study looked at cells from both humans and mice. The cells were exposed to two different conditions: acute exposure, classed as two 20-minute sessions an hour apart, and chronic exposure, 20-minute sessions on three consecutive days.

Mr Alexandrov said they saw that DNA gets damaged and that some damage does not get repaired over time. This DNA damage leads to mutations after every exposure with a UV nail polish dryer.

Exposure may also cause ""mitochondrial dysfunction"" which could result in additional mutations, he said.

""We looked at patients with skin cancers, and we see the exact same patterns of mutations in these patients that were seen in the irradiated cells.""

The idea for the study came from an article Mr Alexandrov read about a young beauty pageant contestant who was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer on her finger.

""I thought that was odd, so we began looking into it, and noticed a number of reports in medical journals saying that people who get gel manicures very frequently - like pageant contestants and aestheticians - are reporting cases of very rare cancers in the fingers, suggesting that this may be something that causes this type of cancer,"" he said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129011706/http://news.sky.com/story/getting-a-manicure-wear-gloves-or-sunscreen-gp-warns-after-study-reveals-uv-lamp-risks-12795899;skynews;health;2732
668;668;Otherlands author Thomas Halliday: ‘Some people have insisted on reading the book backwards’;2023-01-28T18:00:26Z;['Killian Fox'];['Science and nature books', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Science', 'Biology', 'Environment'];;"Thomas Halliday was born in 1989 and raised in Rannoch in the Scottish Highlands. He studied zoology at Cambridge before specialising in paleobiology for his master’s and PhD – winning the Linnean Society Medal for the best doctorate in biological studies. His debut book Otherlands: A World in the Making – which comes out in paperback on 2 February – was Foyles’ nonfiction book of 2022, while the historian Tom Holland called it “the best book on the history of life on Earth I have ever read”. Halliday lives in north London with his wife and sons. What is paleobiology? In the late 20th century, we began to realise that we could study far more aspects of past life than simply describing the forms and defining them into taxonomies. Paleobiology encompasses everything from cell biology to genetic relationships to ecology. It’s like any other part of biology, except it happens to be set in the deep past. Where did the idea for Otherlands come from? One thing that led to it was the idea that when we think about organisms in the past, we tend to talk about them in a family-tree sense, but never stop to think about what is going on in any given slice through time. A few years ago I entered the Hugh Miller writing competition and wrote about some of the earliest four-limbed vertebrates to come on to the land, which had been found in south-east Scotland. When it won, I thought: maybe I can turn that approach into something longer form. It’s quite a challenge, distilling 550m years of natural history into 300 pages. How did you go about it? The idea of having one chapter for each geological division of time came fairly early on. I wanted to make sure that I covered not just the vertebrates that get done over and over – the dinosaurs and the ice age mammals – but a variety of places and times and environments. The difficulties came in making sure I had a global representation of sites. Africa is the least well-studied continent in terms of palaeontology, but there are sites there which are phenomenally interesting.
You bring each site to life very vividly, no matter how alien its flora and fauna seem to us now. I wanted to avoid writing things like, “In 1974, so-and-so did this study”, which is a useful form of science communication, but when I’m trying to evoke a place, it really takes you out of it. So there are almost no references to people at all – and that includes me or the reader. You can read it as if you’re there. It’s purely descriptive of the place. I was inspired by a lot of nature and travel writing, particularly books like John Lewis-Stempel’s Meadowland, Adam Nicolson’s The Seabird’s Cry or Robert Macfarlane’s Underland – books that really give a sense of place. Where do you write? I don’t have a particular place that I need to be. A lot of Otherlands was written in Birmingham. I had to commute up from London for work and was spending two nights a week in a largely empty house, and writing was something to do to relax in the evenings. I also wrote on the train and in libraries. In our house there is no dedicated writing space. The table I often write at is also the table that, until recently, we were using for nappy changes. But I did very much enjoy writing at the British Library, because you have to leave everything else at the door. It’s a very good way of getting on without any distractions; you can’t suddenly disappear into the kitchen and have a snack. What have you been reading lately? I read Eoghan Daltun’s An Irish Atlantic Rainforest, which is absolutely fantastic, a paean to rewilding and the benefits of letting nature do what it does best. It’s an exploration of how much life there is just waiting under the soil to return. I really enjoyed Katherine Rundell’s The Golden Mole, a selection of essays about endangered species that is very evocative. I’ve just started Elderflora: A Modern History of Ancient Trees by Jared Farmer, and it’s very interesting so far. One novel I absolutely loved recently was The Binding by Bridget Collins, a fantasy book about bookbinding and magic. Otherlands is teeming with literary references. Do you have a favourite piece of fiction that considers the pre-human world? A lot of the works of fiction that deal with the past end up being a little bit too rough-and-tumble adventure-y for me. That’s why I didn’t refer to things like Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World, where characters go in with guns and bring back specimens, or the likes of Jurassic Park where it’s all very bestial. There was quite an interesting book set in the deep past called Hawksbill Station by Robert Silverberg. The conceit is that humans have discovered one-way time travel into the past and the government is using it to send political dissidents back to the Cambrian period. It ends up being a really interesting story about your place in time and what makes it home, though it’s not really about the organisms that live there. Otherlands came out in hardback a year ago. How have readers responded? People’s responses to it going backwards in time have been really interesting. I arranged the chapters from most recent to oldest, purely for the purposes of easing the reader in, so we start off with organisms that are more familiar. But some people have insisted on reading the book backwards, so that it’s a story of the Earth in chronological order. Some said [going backwards in time] gave them a sense of decentring humans: we are there at the beginning, but then we’re gone and it’s no longer the story of Earth leading up to us. I really liked that interpretation. There was one person who said going back in time made it a happier experience, because if you learn about something being extinct in one chapter, then all of a sudden, in the next one, it’s alive and well. • Otherlands by Thomas Halliday is published by Penguin (£10.99).

2304;2304;Piano forte: Cate Blanchett’s Tár costumes set power chic crescendo;2023-01-20T13:00:38Z;['Hannah Jane Parkinson'];['Fashion', 'Cate Blanchett', 'Life and style', 'Film', 'Culture'];;"It’s the zeitgeist film that has split opinion. Critically adored, awards contender and praised by Martin Scorsese. On the other hand, slated by the prominent conductor Marin Alsop for being “anti-women” and scoffed at as patronising by younger audiences for belittling cancel culture. But there’s one area in which everybody agrees that Tár, Todd Field’s epic about the reputational downfall of a fictional maestro, excels: the clothes. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) embodies the power-lesbian ideal. Crisp, pale blue button-downs. A cashmere sweater slung over her shoulders when curled up in her gigantic, book-lined brutalist apartment. She marches down the streets of Charlottenburg in a luxe, virgin wool coat with padded shoulders, a silk shirt underneath. Clean lines and sharp silhouettes dominate.
It’s the kind of aspirational wardrobe that has made people of all genders swoon – and generated fashion world approval. It was not a reaction that costumer designer, Bina Daigeler – who has worked with Blanchett before on the TV series Mrs America – expected. Usually, her aim is that “nobody should notice the clothes, although they are part of the language of the film … it was a big surprise to me”. But Daigeler knew from her first read of Field’s script that Tár’s sartorial choices were – as with all of us, but perhaps especially in Tár’s case with her self-mythologising – key to her character. Daigeler approached the task with the same level of research as she would a period film. The main theme was clear: power dressing. “I think we all do this – when we need to project strength, we dress in a certain way. [Lydia] Tár is a lot about power and strength.” In response to Alsop’s criticism, Blanchett has said Tár was “not a film about gender but about power”; but her silhouette is often a masculine one. Tár is a wealthy woman. Daigeler mentions Margaret Howell, Max Mara and Dries van Noten, among other high-end labels featured. Studio Nicholson and Lemaire supplied many of the staple pieces. The film’s budget was just $35m, which sometimes proved challenging, with Blanchett at one point joking that they had spent most of it on the Diana coat from The Row (which retails at around £3,000). Tár carries the iconic Hermes Birkin (from £7,000), and, for a woman who talks of controlling time, wears a Rolex (approximately £4,000) with the face turned inwards. Daigeler created an entire wardrobe for Tár, as though she were a real person. Some things were specified by Field in the script – Tár’s baseball cap when travelling incognito. Others were Blanchett’s ideas during fittings: the shirts worn over turtlenecks, for instance, a styling trick seen also at the recent Brioni presentation, one of the most luxe brands in the world.
As well as haute designers, Daigeler brought in vintage blouses from stores in Berlin and New York, and a lot of custom pieces: “It was a complete mixture”. Tones were mostly muted to reflect Tár’s severe nature and to “match the grey Berlin skies”. It is also about lifestyle – there is little chance for Tár’s beige and pastel Oxford shirts and knitwear to pick up dirt when doing the school run in her electric Porsche and flying first class. Most important to perfect was Tár’s high-collared penguin tuxedo when conducting. They looked to the Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan, and mostly other past male conductors, for inspiration. “I realised also when I watched Cate in rehearsal [conducting], that it was very important for her to be able to move. But also to have strength in the core. So I made these high-waisted pants to support her,” says Daigeler. There is an extended scene in which Tár visits the tailors and is measured up. As Tár’s world unravels, her put-together look becomes somewhat less put together. Tár is never going to wear jogging bottoms, Daigeler points out, but the outfits become looser, the collars less pressed. The sweaters hang untucked (all in the film are Margaret Howell, which cost about £300). Even trainers and a leather jacket make an appearance. It is about as shabby as the assiduous Tár allows. Given how nice the clothes are, I ask Daigeler if she took any pieces home. She didn’t. For her, “once a job is done it’s done” – but Blanchett did. “There was a very nice Dries van Noten suit which I have seen her in a few times since.” Is there anything accessible for Tár fans who might not have quite the income of a globally famous cultural icon? Try the New York Rangers baseball cap. Yours for £16.50. • This article was amended on 23 January 2023.

The supermarket chain said it was awarding the 7.3% rise to 127,000 workers, up from £10.25 an hour previously, which will be implemented early in February. It puts Britain’s second-biggest supermarket chain on a par with the discounter Aldi – which also raised pay to £11 this month – and well ahead of rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. The pay increase, which is now above the voluntary “real living wage” of £10.90, comes five months after Sainsbury’s last raised starting pay and just under a year after a previous rise. As part of the latest package Sainsbury’s will also extend an offer of free food during shifts for store and depot staff – first introduced by the company in October – by a further six months, after it was due to end in March. Workers will also be able to get extra payday discounts of 15%, up from the usual 10%, for an extended period, and also received £15 vouchers to spend over Christmas. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “We really get how tough it is for millions of households this winter with the rising costs of living and we know that particularly after Christmas, budgets will be tighter than ever. “As well as doing all we can to keep prices low for customers, it’s our job to also support our colleagues as they face rising costs. That’s why we are bringing forward this year’s pay increase.” He said Sainsbury’s had not struggled to recruit the 20,000 extra workers it took on over Christmas, and hoped that the retailer could hold on to some of them. “There is a business reason to do this [pay rise] as we want to give customers the best service and fundamentally believe that colleagues deserve to be paid the best rate we can afford,” he said. The pay increase comes amid fierce competition between retailers for staff. Aldi has raised pay three times in a year, while employers including Tesco, Asda and Marks & Spencer have all offered mid-year pay increases amid a tight jobs market. Dave Gill, a national officer for the shop workers union Usdaw, said successive substantial pay increases at Sainsbury’s made a big difference for its members. “With the cost of living continually rising, we have kept open our dialogue with Sainsbury’s and we are pleased the business has responded so positively. These unprecedented additional pay awards, along with free food and additional discount, will be appreciated by our members. “The scale of the financial challenges facing all workers is immense and there still needs to be significant interventions from government. Even under their plan, energy prices will have still doubled in six months and look set to go higher. Along with other prices sky-rocketing, the cost of living is simply unaffordable for far too many workers.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/04/sainsburys-to-pay-at-least-11-an-hour-for-127000-lowest-paid-workers;guardian;business & economy;5353
5755;5755;Labor flags wastewater tests on inbound planes as mandatory Covid checks for China arrivals resumes;2023-01-02T00:06:44Z;['Paul Karp'];['Coronavirus', 'Australian foreign policy', 'Health', 'China', 'Asia Pacific', 'Mark Butler', 'Infectious diseases', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics'];;"Australia is planning to introduce wastewater testing for incoming flights in an attempt to gather more information about the possible entry of new Covid variants. The health minister, Mark Butler, announced the measure on Monday in a round of interviews defending the decision to reimpose pre-flight Covid testing for passengers from China as necessary because of a “absence of comprehensive information” about the disease in China. The announcement on Sunday has already prompted calls to expand pre-flight testing, with the independent MP Monique Ryan questioning if it was now “time to require pre-travel testing of all travellers entering Australia from Europe, the US, Africa and Asia”.
On Monday Butler told Radio National there is “no evidence right now” of new emerging variants in China and that “the evidence does suggest that the main driver of this very large wave in China is a variant of Omicron”, the dominant strain in Australia and around the world for the last 12 months. “It’s a variant called BF.7 which is a derivative of the BA.5 variant of Omicron which has been the main driver of Covid cases in Australia for the last 6 or 7 months, he said. “So it’s a variant that we’re familiar with that has been in Australia for several months – BF.7 – and, as I said, there’s a broad consensus there’s no imminent public health threat.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Butler said Australia had imposed pre-flight testing for travellers from China “out of an abundance of caution” due to “what the World Health Organization pointed to [as a] lack of information that would allow us to identify very quickly the emergence of that new variant”. “What we’ll be doing is looking to introduce wastewater testing from aeroplanes that land in Australia. That’s an Australian innovation that’s been picked up by America and some other countries. “That again gives us a good line of sight, if there are Covid cases coming into Australia, what the variants are … and very early information about the possibility of a new variant emerging as well.” In October 2021 the Australian science agency CSIRO released a study with Qantas and the University of Queensland showing that wastewater testing can be an effective way to screen incoming passengers for Covid-19. In the last week, the US Centre for Disease Control and the UK both announced they are considering use of wastewater testing. Australia’s mandatory testing within 48 hours of departure will apply to travellers from Hong Kong and Macau, in addition to those from mainland China, and is set to begin on Thursday. But on Monday, Butler could not say whether travellers will be required to take a PCR test or if they can use the quicker, more accessible rapid antigen tests. “Those details are being finalised, right now, they’ll be published very shortly, including on the Smartraveller website” The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, told 4BC Radio if travellers tested positive pre-flight “then of course we’re asking them not to get on the plane, and we’re asking airlines to play a role in preventing that from happening”. “But for people who were to contract covid on the plane, we’d be asking them to stay at home, isolate, test, and be considerate of other people,” he said, ruling out “anything like … hotel quarantine or mandatory isolation days”. Earlier, Butler told ABC News Breakfast that a ban on travel from China is “not on our table right now” because Australia wants to see resumption of travel. Butler told Channel Seven’s Sunrise that Australia’s decision for testing “reflects decisions that have been taken across the world by countries in North America, in Europe and across Asia”.
“… for example, by Japan, by India, South Korea, Malaysia and others,” he said. “So this, we think, is a balanced decision, a modest decision, but it will start to ensure that we have better information about what is happening in China right now.” On Thursday Prof Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases physician, told Guardian Australia a lack of transparency about Covid in China was worrying because “we don’t know what variants are circulating in China at the moment … [and] whether those variants are different in terms of their response to vaccination”. The end of China’s zero-Covid approach comes as case numbers surge, with low vaccination rates especially among elderly people. Ascertaining the spread and severity of Covid is more difficult than ever as Beijing has stopped publishing daily case numbers and ended mass testing. “They’ve changed very quickly from a zero-Covid approach to completely relaxing things, so maybe that’s happened too quickly to keep up,” said Dwyer, who was one of the experts tasked with travelling to Wuhan early in 2021 to investigate the origins of the pandemic in a report for the WHO.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/labor-flags-wastewater-tests-on-inbound-planes-as-mandatory-covid-checks-for-china-arrivals-resumes;guardian;health;5755
2695;2695;Who will protect women from police misogyny? | Letters;2023-01-18T17:44:00Z;['N/A'];['Police', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Women', 'UK news', 'Metropolitan police', 'Crime', 'Sarah Everard', 'Green party', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'London'];;"The police service is finally coming to terms with having a significant number of rapists and domestic abusers in its ranks (Elite Metropolitan police officer David Carrick revealed as serial rapist, 16 January). From the state-sponsored abuses of the spy cops scandal to the murder of Sarah Everard and the arrest of those at her vigil, the police have failed to deal with misogyny in their own ranks. The turning of a blind eye when women reported that their police officer partners were abusing them is also part of this pattern of failure that has led to record low conviction rates for crimes of sexual violence against women. Six police services in England are in special measures and hundreds of thousands of everyday offences are not being investigated as they are “no crimed”; yet the government is obsessed with passing draconian laws aimed at peaceful protesters who commit no violent acts. The distorted priorities of ministers, who are afraid of protest against corruption, austerity and rightwing policies, means that they wish to hand a mistrusted and failing police service the ability to arrest people who are thinking about protesting peacefully. Jenny Jones Green party, House of Lords • The focus is on the Metropolitan police now, but misogynistic culture in policing is a global challenge for these male-dominated institutions. Systemic abuse of power by police is increasingly the norm rather than an exception. Other examples include dismissal of women’s disappearances by Mexican authorities, sexual violence by security force personnel in Chile, and the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran. Transformative change to policing will depend on looking deeper than just institutional recruiting processes and protocols. This is because those working in the police are just a reflection of the culture that exists across wider society. To shift attitudes and behaviour, challenging gender norms must be at the centre of training practices and disciplinary decision-making, but real change will depend on more structural commitments. This means more women in politics, digital regulation of online misogyny and access to violent pornography, legislative and judicial shifts to focus on perpetrators rather than victims/survivors, and early years education to halt abuse before it starts. Caroline Harper Director of gender equality and social inclusion, ODI • I finished my police career in 2004. In my day, there was locker-room banter, but no one had a nickname like “Bastard Dave”. Our locker room seems a very innocent place compared with current Metropolitan police behaviour. A common feature, however, was the sometimes terrible handling of rape complaints. While I was serving as a police officer, my daughter was one such victim and the wildly botched handling of the incident caused much unnecessary additional strife for her, me and the rest of my family. Many unjustified sexist biases existed and are obviously deeply rooted. Vetting of police officers must improve, for the sake of the service as much as the sake of the public. Name and address supplied • Twenty-five years ago, I taught an undergraduate course in policing at Liverpool John Moores University. My colleague, a former police officer, contributed a set of lectures that he entitled “Can’t change, won’t change”. Enough said.

692;692;Sabalenka’s storybook comeback amazes in Australian Open triumph | Emma Kemp;2023-01-28T14:23:35Z;['Emma Kemp'];['Australian Open 2023', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'Tennis'];;"Aryna Sabalenka started the final with a double fault and ended on the ground sobbing. It was, in a way, the story of her previous 12 months. Last year, the Belarusian was the self-described “queen of double faults” – a tour-high 440 of them last season. She also operated at the behest of her own emotions, stripped of her agency when confronted with an opponent’s defiance. She became a champion on Saturday because she bested both – and, in turn, Elena Rybakina. She brought herself to heel after losing the first set and after each of the 10 break points she engineered but did not win.
When Sabalenka had a first championship point and double-faulted she howled, then pushed back her shoulders and shimmied. Shook it off, reset. It took another three match points to finally get over the line. The result was deserved. The match felt overwhelming in its potency, pickling the senses and destroying what we thought we knew about the leaders in women’s tennis. At the start of this Australian Open, the favourite was Iga Swiatek. The form guide had the world No 1 v the rest of the field. Who would challenge her? Jessica Pegula was certainly one, Ons Jabeur another. There were other possibilities, but Sabalenka and Rybakina were low on the list. That it turned out to be that pairing made for a gripping show of mental and physical mastery, two players with similar skill sets but differing methods of execution.
Rybakina does not look like a power player. The ball does not seem to cop the full brunt of her body and her ball striking is pure in its absence of any other sound. There is no grunt or scream or audible struggle. Rybakina moves like a player who has plenty of time and space, and strikes as if casting a fishing rod. Even in the second set, 4-1 down with the pressure on her serve, she was calm, clear, and remained that way throughout the 10-minute game that went to deuce four times and featured three break points. Her reaction to that hard-fought hold was identical to the one after she took the next point with a forehand winner.
It was the same again when Rybakina lost the subsequent four points. Occasionally, after offering an expert tutorial on how to transform defence into attack, she allowed herself a small fist pump. What then, would have warranted a greater rush of emotion? Winning the title? When she won Wimbledon last year, that small fist pump was all that came. Whatever internal monologue motivated her at Melbourne Park until the very last point will remain a mystery, but it carried as grace under pressure and has done throughout a campaign when she defeated three grand slam champions to reach the final. Against Sabalenka, as a compelling contrast to the lid threatening to bubble over at the other end. Every one of Sabalenka’s shots is heard loud and clear, every small victory a major celebration and each error a deliberate effort to maintain control. During this tournament she revealed she stopped working with a psychologist. “I realised that nobody [other] than me will help,” she said a couple of days ago. “On the pre-season I spoke to my psychologist saying, ‘Listen, I feel like I have to deal with that by myself, because every time hoping that someone will fix my problem, it’s not fixing my problem.’ “I just have to take this responsibility and I just have to deal with that. I’m not working with a psychologist anymore – I’m my psychologist.” And Sabalenka was, all the way until the end, against a player as hard-wired to attack as she. Physicists have broken down the Serena Williams serve; they will soon be studying the same from both of these players. Rybakina’s first serve is a cannon that hit 195kmh in this match, even if it did fall away while Sabalenka pounced on her second and worked the angles to devastating effect to send down 51 winners. As Sabalenka got to her feet she was greeted with a hug and a shy smile from Rybakina, then embarked on her own Pat Cash moment by climbing to her player’s box. Holding the trophy, she said her triumph was more about her team than it was her, to epic applause befitting an epic final.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/28/sabalenkas-storybook-comeback-amazes-in-australian-open-triumph;guardian;sports;692
845;845;Inquest into deaths at Brixton O2 could lead to criminal charges, court hears;2023-01-27T15:16:14Z;['Diane Taylor'];['UK news'];;"The Metropolitan police are conducting a “vast and complex” investigation into the deaths of two people after a crush at a south London music venue last month, which will probably result in criminal charges, an inquest heard on Friday. Speaking at the opening of the inquest at London Inner South coroner’s court into the deaths of Rebecca Ikumelo, 33, and Gaby Hutchinson, 23, DCI Nigel Penney, the Met’s senior investigating officer in the case, told the court: “It’s a vast and complicated process. It’s a huge investigation.”
He said police were tracking and tracing witnesses and were watching hundreds of hours of CCTV footage to work out how the crush occurred. “There are a lot of lines of inquiry to establish the facts and get to the truth,” he said. Ikumelo had gone to watch the Nigerian Afrobeats star Asake perform at the O2 Academy Brixton on 15 December last year when she was caught up in a crush outside the venue, where Hutchinson was a security guard. The senior coroner, Andrew Harris, asked if there could be homicide or related charges in connection with the two deaths. Penney replied there was a “strong possibility of criminal charges” at a future point in the investigation. He requested permission for the inquest to be suspended while the criminal investigation is carried out. Granting permission, Harris said: “It seems to me that if this is a complex criminal investigation, this matter is going to take some years.”
Dozens of Ikumelo’s family and friends attended the hearing. In their first media interview, the family called for justice for Ikumelo. Her younger brother Anthony Ikumelo, 30, said: “We want answers, we want to know what happened and we want accountability.” Ikumelo, a mother of two boys aged seven and four, the older one who is autistic, regularly posted on TikTok, where she had 16,000 followers, about parenting an autistic child. Her mother, Yetunde Olodo, 59, said: “She was an amazing mum. Her children were her life, 100%,. The little one keeps asking: ‘Where has mummy gone? When is she coming back?’ They don’t understand what’s going on.” Olodo said: “We will try our best to make sure her children have a good life. She was a shining light and she really cared for her community.” She added: “As a parent I never imagined I would ever be mourning the loss of a child. I am hurting and my family is hurting too. When Rebecca died I lost a daughter, a best friend and my confidante. I am just so sad that her two boys will grow up in this world without having their mother there. Nothing can fill the void that Rebecca’s death has left in our family but it is important that we get justice for her death.”
Anthony Ikumelo said the family became worried when Rebecca did not arrive home when expected, something he said was out of character for her because she was always on time to get back to her children “She was a great sibling,” he said. “She taught me how to read and write when I was small. She was always trying to help people.” Interested parties in the case are AP Security and Academy Music Group. The inquest heard that the Health and Safety Executive had declined to participate in the investigation and that the Met, the lead agency in the investigation, was in consultation with Lambeth environmental health officials.
Family and friends gathered for a vigil in Ikumelo’s memory on 14 January close to her home in Newham, east London, and set off balloons to mark her untimely death. Family have urged anyone with information about what happened on the night Ikumelo died to contact them on Twitter at J4R_Ikumelo Cyrilia Davies Knight, of Saunders Law, which is representing Olodo and other family members, said: “Today is the start of my client’s quest for justice. She knows that this journey will be a long and difficult one but she is determined to find out what happened to her daughter and for those responsible to be held accountable. She hopes that the police will do a robust and thorough investigation.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/27/inquest-into-deaths-at-brixton-o2-could-lead-to-criminal-charges-court-hears;guardian;entertainment & culture;845
2826;2826;NBA midseason superlatives: Surprising Kings to Lakers questions;2023-01-18T08:30:40Z;['Claire de Lune'];['NBA', 'Sacramento Kings', 'Utah Jazz', 'Minnesota Timberwolves', 'Phoenix Suns', 'Los Angeles Lakers', 'Oklahoma City Thunder', 'Boston Celtics', 'Denver Nuggets', 'Los Angeles Clippers', 'Philadelphia 76ers', 'New Orleans Pelicans', 'Brooklyn Nets', 'Basketball', 'US sports', 'Sport', 'LeBron James'];;"It’s a longstanding NBA custom to jump to conclusions. MVP chatter begins in the first week of the season, coaches are on the hot seat by week two, and before even a month has passed, “burn it down” roster discussions emerge. Far be it from me to stray from tradition. So here, a month before the All-Star break, are my too-early NBA Season Superlatives, a selection of premature evaluations and awards plucked out of thin air. Most pleasant surprise Sacramento Kings. One of the most historically maligned teams in the league, it’s hard to say that the Kings haven’t earned some of the skepticism around the direction of their franchise. But the turnaround, overseen by new head coach Mike Brown, since their personnel swap with the Pacers this past offseason of Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy Hield for Domantas Sabonis, has been nothing short of miraculous. While losing a rising star like Haliburton is never ideal, Sabonis seems to have unlocked guard De’Aaron Fox’s potential. Other fringe signings (like Malik Monk) round out a fun, aggressive, and competitive team that’s making downright shocking noise in the Western Conference.
Honorable mention: Utah Jazz. Pretty much everyone had the Jazz penciled in for the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes when they traded away their two biggest stars, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. But new head coach Will Hardy and his motley roster apparently missed that memo, and power forward Lauri Markkanen has made a compelling case for an All-Star appearance. Biggest disappointment Minnesota Timberwolves. I already waxed poetic about how much of a disaster this Timberwolves season has been, but it bears repeating that the Gobert trade is shaping up to be one of the worst front-office moves in recent memory. Questionable as the fit among Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Anthony Edwards was, it was universally agreed upon that the three-time defensive player of the year would all but guarantee them a spot in the playoffs, and maybe even get them home-court advantage in the opening round. That assumption was a gross underestimate of the level to which Gobert appears to be locker-room cancer, and also of the importance of the pieces Minnesota traded away to acquire him. The once-hyped team is now likely to end up in the play-in tournament, or maybe worse. Honorable mention: Phoenix Suns. How the mighty have fallen. It’s hard to believe that this team is comprised of mostly the same pieces that took them to the brink of a championship less than two years ago. But life comes at you fast: Chris Paul finally seems to be feeling the impact of Father Time and the joyless, chemistry-less Suns (who, yes, desperately miss a sidelined Devin Booker) are likely to have missed their window.
Biggest ‘what if?’ Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron James is 38. If you’ve turned on even 30 seconds of a Lakers game or an ESPN talk show this season, you’ve heard that fact mentioned ad nauseum. But it’s central to what makes this particular Lakers season so frustrating for fans of the team, and for fans of James himself. The Russell Westbrook experiment has been a rollercoaster ride, to be sure, but the highs are simply not nearly high enough to justify the lows. After a disastrous season last year, most expected Westbrook and his $47m salary to be moved this past summer. But the front office stood pat, and appear to have opted to see the 2022-23 season through, retaining Westbrook (and their infamous 2027 and 2029 first-round picks). In doing so, they’re essentially punting what is, in all likelihood, one of the last James-as-a-contender years. It’s difficult not to wonder what might have been for the sub-.500 team, who has shown promising flashes, if they had made moves in the offseason, or, at the very least, when Westbrook first showed signs of life off the bench.
Honorable mention: Oklahoma City Thunder. Before the entire NBA was foaming at the mouth over Wembanyama, there was another lanky seven-footer who captured the league’s affection. But Chet Holmgren, the Thunder’s No 2 overall draft pick last year, was injured in a pro-am game this summer, which left him sidelined for the entirety of this season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has been a revelation, and Josh Giddey is progressing nicely. With the Western Conference wide open, it’s fair to wonder if the young team could have made a postseason appearance with Chet in tow. Most likely to succeed Boston Celtics. It feels simultaneously like just yesterday and also like 10 years ago that the Celtics were making headlines for the wrong reasons, in the wake of the sudden, shocking, “indefinite” suspension of head coach Ime Udoka and the team’s questionable (at best) handling of the situation. Even keeping in mind that the team was fresh off their first appearance in the NBA finals since 2010, not many prognosticators had them sitting comfortably atop the league-wide standings for the duration of this season after Udoka was replaced with interim head coach Joe Mazzulla just days before the start of training camp. But the Celtics weathered the storm, and Mazzulla seems to command the respect of his locker room. Jayson Tatum has rebounded from a disappointing postseason by playing at an MVP level, Jaylen Brown has also been excellent, and the signing of guard Malcolm Brogdon is proving fruitful. The team is poised for a return to the promised land. Honorable mention: Denver Nuggets. Nikola Jokic has won league MVP the last two years running, but even then, his supporting cast wasn’t strong enough to push the Nuggets into contention. This year feels different. Jamal Murray is back from an ACL injury and starting to look like himself, Michael Porter Jr also made his return from a back injury, Aaron Gordon is starting to blossom in the Jokic system, and fringe signings like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope are rounding out the roster nicely. Sitting atop the West, the Nuggets have arrived, for real.
Most likely to repeat history Los Angeles Clippers. The “little brother” syndrome in the NBA is far from mythical. Some teams have a stronghold on their markets – New York, for example, while now home to a Nets team that boasts one of the best players in the league, will always be a Knicks town (miserable as the franchise often is). At the crux of many of the Los Angeles Clippers’ problems is an attempt to circumvent that complex with shortcuts and marketing. The Clippers moved heaven and earth to sign Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to league-wide fanfare in 2019, and launched headfirst into a “Streetlights over Spotlights” rebrand, emphasizing the team’s alleged grittiness (and implying that the big-brother Lakers were all Hollywood, no heart).
The problem being, of course, that they forgot to actually be gritty, or develop team chemistry. This hubris resulted in a shocking Game 7 loss to the Denver Nuggets in the second-round of the 2020 playoffs, a monkey the team is still trying to get off its back. The Clippers did make it to the Western Conference finals the following year while down Kawhi Leonard, but they’ve yet to have a finals appearance, a marked disappointment considering what they gave up for Leonard and George. The team has hovered around the upper middle of the Western standings this year, but it feels like a sound wager that the Championship DNA just didn’t make it to this younger sibling. Honorable mention: Philadelphia 76ers. It’s hyperbolic to call any NBA franchise “cursed,” but for some of them it certainly feels that way. In retrospect, the Sixers almost certainly got the better end of the Ben Simmons trade (James Harden has been excellent this year), and Joel Embiid remains one of the best players in the league. But years of precedent make it almost impossible to trust them to do anything of substance in the postseason, especially with playoff-plagued head coach Doc Rivers at the helm. Most promising dark horse New Orleans Pelicans. I have made my case why the Pelicans should be taken seriously as contenders. Even though they’ve stayed at or near the top of the West all season, their relative inexperience in combination with bad injury luck has made many NBA experts reluctant to back them. But the team’s response during stretches where they’ve been missing their biggest stars, Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, anchored in huge part by an All-Star caliber showing by veteran CJ McCollum, only strengthens their case as a real threat. Willie Green has steered the ship with grace, the supporting cast have enthusiasm for their roles, and they’re second only to the Grizzlies in the West in defensive rating. They may not have any seasoned, battle-tested superstars on their roster, or even an MVP candidate, but no one should write off this Pelicans team. Honorable mention: Brooklyn Nets. I was the first person to count out this Nets team, even though Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant, because they just couldn’t seem to escape their own penchant for drama and nonsense. From the (probably necessary) firing of Steve Nash to Kyrie Irving’s promotion of an antisemitic documentary, this season was only the latest instalment in a consistent trend of chaos for the Nets since Durant and Irving came to town. But give them credit: they really seem to have gotten it together, Jacque Vaughn appears to command more respect from the team than Nash, and never count out a Kevin Durant-led team with a competent supporting cast.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/nba-midseason-superlatives-surprising-kings-to-lakers-questions;guardian;sports;2826

The fight to normalise these conversations and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health is an ongoing battle, one in which we all have a role to play. From the current cost of living crisis to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, we know that people are struggling. Research from the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute tells us that people with mental health problems are nearly twice as likely to say they are unable to cope due to the rising cost of living. A staggering 46% of us have reduced the number of meals we eat every day, and one in five (19%) say they’ve missed an appointment for their own mental health. What these statistics clearly reveal is that we must act now to create a space to talk about it. Since becoming president of Mind in 2011, I have made it my mission to promote better conversations around mental wellbeing. I know myself that talking about a diagnosis can be scary, but it’s vital – and we all know that talking can help us feel less alone, more able to cope and encourage us to seek the support we need. That’s why I am so proud to support the nation’s biggest conversation about mental health, Time to Talk Day. This year, it is on Thursday 2 February. Last year, we had nearly 2 million conversations. This year, with your help, I know we can surpass that number. I am asking readers to make space on that day for a conversation about mental health. It could be that you simply send a text to a friend, or perhaps you lend a listening ear to a colleague who you know has been a bit down. Or maybe you would like to share some issues or problems that have been concerning you. Even better, think about hosting an event in your community to raise awareness. And don’t worry – those lovely people at the charities organising Time to Talk Day have plenty of tips and resources on their websites to help. Above all, though, this is a chance for all of us to talk, to listen and to change lives. So, from me, in advance, a giant “thank” and a whopping “you” for anything you can do to help.

The plan, which Mr Barclay will announce on Monday, is understood to be aimed at block-buying up to 2,000 care home beds in Care Quality Commission-approved facilities over the next four weeks.

Patients who should be discharged from hospital but have been unable to as they need more care but have nowhere to go will then be moved to the care home beds.

The aim is to reduce NHS waiting lists and ambulance waiting times that have been exacerbated by beds being blocked by these types of patients, through no fault of their own.

There are currently about 13,000 patients stuck in NHS hospitals who do not need to be there.

As the government faces further strikes from NHS workers, including nurses later this month and possibly junior doctors in March, the health secretary has doubled down on insisting pay review bodies are the best way for public sector salaries to be decided.

For months, ministers have been saying salary negotiations are for the pay review bodies, made up of experts and staff from the relevant fields, to decide.

But unions have said ministers have the final say on whether to accept the recommendations and have also argued this year's salaries were decided before inflation soared above 10%.

Mr Barclay is set to meet union leaders on Monday but the health secretary wants to focus on pay negotiations for 2023/24.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it will go ahead with its strikes on 18 and 19 January unless the last few months of this financial year are discussed.

Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, has urged ministers to meet nurses halfway on their demand for a 19% pay rise for this financial year.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak indicated to the BBC on Sunday only 2023/24's pay is up for discussion.

Ms Cullen said she had a ""chink of optimism"" as she said she noticed a ""little shift"" in Mr Sunak's stance.

Health Minister Maria Caulfield, who is also a cancer nurse, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme the talks on Monday will be about ""both pay and conditions"" after the government had previously said only a change in conditions was on the table.

Mr Barclay, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, said he recognises ""inflation has made life tougher for the workforce"", which is why he is ""so determined to talk about what we can do next year on pay"".

""Doing this work through the independent pay review bodies process is clearly the best way to do this, not least because spending each winter frozen in pay negotiations with the unions would take focus away from the other challenges the NHS faces,"" he wrote.

The health secretary added that he is ""ready to engage with the unions"" and NHS staff could get a significant pay boost from April - if they accept radical reforms to improve productivity such as ""virtual wards"" at people's homes.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures the NHS is facing following the impact of the pandemic and are working tirelessly to ensure people get the care they need, backed by up to £14.1 billion additional funding for health and social care over the next two years.

""This winter, we're providing £500m to speed up discharge and the NHS is creating the equivalent of 7,000 extra beds to boost capacity.

""We are continuing to consider all options to help urgently reduce delays in the discharge of medically fit patients from hospital. Further steps will be set out in due course.""

On Saturday, Mr Sunak held an emergency meeting with health leaders as he called for ""bold and radical"" action to alleviate the NHS's winter crisis.

He said a ""business-as-usual mindset won't fix the challenges we face"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230108131915/http://news.sky.com/story/government-plans-to-move-patients-stuck-in-hospital-to-care-homes-but-will-not-discuss-this-years-nhs-pay-12782335;skynews;politics;749
3785;3785;Already ‘failed’ Dry January? There’s another way, and I’ve been doing it for years | Barbara Speed;2023-01-13T07:00:08Z;['Barbara Speed'];['Alcohol', 'Society', 'Health'];;"I am not doing Dry January this year. I didn’t do it last year, or the year before that. But I do know, down to the glass, what I drank on every single one of those January days. Two post-new year amarettos on 2 January 2021; two glasses of prosecco on 9 January 2020 (if I’d known what was coming in March, I might have stretched to three); a lone bottle of beer on a Sunday in 2019. This isn’t some incredible feat of memory. The data is at my fingertips thanks to something I started doing just over five years ago, in late 2017. Every day – or, let’s be realistic, often a few days later – I plug the amount I’ve had to drink into an app.
I should start by saying that this wasn’t sparked by any deep concern about my drinking. (If you’re worried about your alcohol consumption, contact your doctor, or an organisation such as Action on Addiction.) Instead, I had a feeling that I suspect many of the Dry January-curious share: that I wanted slightly more of a handle on what I drank, and to drink slightly less. I thought I was probably within healthy limits, but I wasn’t certain. Not knowing felt like choosing “cash without balance” when getting money out in my twenties: a combination of avoidance and shame that I hadn’t been quite as temperate as I’d meant to be. All other benefits of moderation aside, tracking freed me of that feeling – it helped me press the “balance please” button and confront the numbers on the screen. I didn’t start with any particular targets, but simply noting what, when and how much I drank. The app I use (which is made by the charity Drinkaware) colour-codes your calendar according to the drinking and no-drinking days, and it was useful to notice that a few green (no-drinking) days in a row left me sleeping better, while a string of blue (drinking) days would have the opposite effect. Logging my drinks was a constant reminder that some are much stronger than others, and would make the difference between ordering a small over a large, a single over a double. Going sober for the night means later pressing a large “drink free day” button, with the accompanying dopamine kick. A big part of making the habit stick, and of its value, lies simply in remembering: having a running counter in your head of glasses and sizes, even during an interminable wedding or a confusing series of 2am rounds. Facing down the empty app after a week-long Italian holiday was not an easy task, and I wouldn’t place much stock in the accuracy of some of my data. But forcing yourself to simply notice – not judge, not even necessarily restrict, but notice – what you’re drinking is, I think, a useful step. I’ve been doing this so long that remembering what I’m drinking has become subconscious, rather than a fun-spongeing, night-out-ruining tallying exercise. But the tracking means that it’s far harder to rely on alcohol as a complete switch-off, an escape from reality: you are always present, quietly counting. For some, that may be a downside, but for me it’s a helpful line in the sand. Dry January works brilliantly for lots of people, and can, of course, be combined with other forms of alcohol moderation. Where it doesn’t appeal to me – and, I’m sure, to others – is that it is something you can easily fail. I might get a little mixed up on the number of glasses of wine I had and forget to track them for a few days, but I can fix that a week later with the help of a bank statement and some guesswork. Habits that allow you to make up for the occasional lapse are much easier to stick to than the all-or-nothing of Dry January, which also contains its own get-out clause of, “I’ve had a beer, I’ve failed – that’s the end of that.” Perhaps that’s why I’ve only completed one single Dry January, back in 2016, but have kept up my tracking habit for over 1,800 days. I don’t blame you if, like more than one of my friends, you think this all sounds a little excessive. Tracking your life can have a dark side – counting calories, for instance, is unsupported by evidence and can lead to over-restriction and disordered eating. But I would argue that alcohol is different. We don’t need to drink it to survive, and a greater sense of control can be a helpful counterweight to a culture that encourages endless drinking around Christmas and total abstention at the beginning of the year. Which brings me to the million-dollar question: has tracking my drinking actually reduced it? The data suggests that it has – my consumption has been falling over the years, though that could be partly a product of becoming older and more boring. In 2018, I drank 1,055 units – an average of 20 a week. By 2022, it was 770 units (14.8 a week), with around four non-drinking days every week. What is certainly true is that in 2017, I could not have imagined facing up to those numbers myself, let alone sharing them with strangers. So the app has, without question, given me the thing I went looking for in the first place: a better relationship with alcohol. • In the UK, Action on Addiction is available on 0300 330 0659.

5612;5612;Stonehouse review – Matthew Macfadyen is a brilliantly bad baddie in this fun, death-faking romp ;2023-01-02T22:05:26Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Drama', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];;"Last week, No 10 issued a statement regarding what it considered to be “very concerning” reports of MPs indulging in sex and excessive alcohol while on parliamentary trips abroad. (Perhaps the suitcase full of wine served a purpose beyond Downing Street?) With fortuitous timing, Stonehouse (ITV 1) is here with the vintage edition. This fun and funny drama, high-spirited and revelling in its absurdities, retells the story of John Stonehouse, Labour MP for Walsall North, a former postmaster general and rising star of Harold Wilson’s government, who got himself in a spot of financial and espionage-based bother. His solution was to fake his own death on a beach in Miami in 1974, before fleeing to Australia with his secretary and assuming a new, stolen identity. The problem for him, and the joy for viewers, is that Stonehouse is not very good at being a baddie. Matthew Macfadyen plays him as a heedless buffoon from the start. In the Commons, he parrots what Wilson says; at home, he parrots what his wife, Barbara (played by Macfadyen’s real-life wife, Keeley Hawes), says. He is a man in search of an identity, and on a work trip to Czechoslovakia (as it was then), he makes much use of the “traditional Czech specialities” on offer by getting extremely drunk and having sex with his guide and translator – an act which is, naturally, filmed by the Czech secret service and used to blackmail him into spying for them. Stonehouse, a family man in an ordinary house, does not seem particularly perturbed by this development. He sees it as a chance to inject a bit of excitement into his suburban life. The trouble is, he is not very good at spying either. His information is either boring – and the on-screen Stonehouse is talented at boring for England, if nothing else – or delightedly delivers outdated information. “You are the worst spy I have ever come across. Ever!” barks his handler, who wanted state secrets and got a dreary Bond acolyte instead. He is so bad at delivering useful information that you start to wonder if it is a strategy. One of the case studies in Stephen Grosz’s fascinating book about psychoanalysis, The Examined Life, is of a man who seems set on boring everyone around him; Grosz concludes that it is a deliberate act, designed to exclude others. I wonder if that might be what Stonehouse is up to, but perhaps that is reading too deeply into the story. Besides, the evidence for it turns out not to be particularly strong; Stonehouse gleefully informs the Czechs of the invention of Concorde, only to be told that this bombshell had been on French television news, two nights earlier. The tone is spot-on, tongue-in-cheek and cheeky. It is written by John Preston, who also wrote the book on which 2018’s A Very English Scandal, about disgraced MP Jeremy Thorpe, was based, and it canters along at a similar pace. Much of the scandalousness is played for comic effect. The title sequence is Mad Men-ish, the soundtrack Pink Panther-esque, and the espionage is campy rather than sinister. Macfadyen’s Stonehouse has a touch of his Succession character, Tom Wambsgans, though the MP lacks the watery cruelness of Wambsgans; Stonehouse is less devious and easier to please. But there are cruelties here, casually buried within its slapstick, as you might expect from a man who attempts to convince the world he is dead. Poor Barbara tries to intervene in the household budget, as newer cars and bigger houses turn up on the scene while private school fees go unpaid. “Which one of us is a graduate of the London School of Economics?” her husband says, pretending there is nothing to worry about. He hires a secretary whose shorthand is lacking, mostly because he fancies her. And later, he steals the identity of a dead constituent, flattering his widow by attending the man’s funeral, only to betray him for his own dreadful purposes. Last July, Stonehouse’s daughter expressed concerns that the drama would be a “misrepresentation” of her father’s story. As with most of these types of drama, it gets a disclaimer at the beginning, explaining that it is “based on a true story” with some parts “reimagined” for dramatic purposes. It seems inevitable that there would be complaints by surviving relatives, as it is not particularly sympathetic to Stonehouse. From The Crown to The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, the question of what a drama inspired by real life owes to its subjects, if it owes anything at all, will continue to be the subject of debate. As a drama, though, the brief rise and astonishing fall of Stonehouse, John Stonehouse, makes for enormously entertaining television.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/02/stonehouse-review-matthew-macfadyen-keeley-hawes;guardian;entertainment & culture;5612
8271;8271;Briton arrested after 'hiding Russian yacht by changing its name from Tango to Fanta';Wednesday 25 January 2023 11:18, UK;['reemul balla', '@reemul_b'];['russia'];['vekselberg', 'briton', 'mr', 'russian', 'hiding', 'vekselbergs', 'vladimir', 'arrested', 'tango', 'fanta', 'osipov', 'masters', 'sanctions', 'yacht', 'changing', 'allegedly'];"A British man has been arrested after allegedly helping an oligarch with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin evade sanctions.

Richard Masters, 52, was arrested in Spain on Friday, though his co-accused Vladislav Osipov remains at large.

The pair, charged separately, reportedly helped Russian-Cypriot oligarch Viktor Vekselberg evade US sanctions.

The scheme was allegedly facilitated through Mr Vekselberg's 255ft yacht Tango, which is thought to be worth $90m (£73m).

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) claimed Masters ran a yacht company in Palma de Mallorca and managed Tango after initial sanctions were imposed on Mr Vekselberg in 2018.

Masters allegedly called Mr Vekselberg's yacht ""the Fanta"" to hide thousands of dollars from banks that would ultimately benefit the oligarch.

It is claimed Masters and Russian-Swiss Osipov masked Mr Vekselberg's involvement with the yacht, with Osipov using shell companies to hide his ownership.

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said both have been charged with multiple offences: Conspiracy to defraud the US and to commit offences against the US; violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); and money laundering.

Mr Vekselberg faced US sanctions in April 2018 following Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Tougher measures were imposed on him in March last year after Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The UK, Australia and Poland also seized Mr Vekselberg's assets in March, imposing travel bans, with the DoJ seizing Tango in Spain a month after.

US attorney Matthew Graves said: ""Facilitators of sanctions evasion enable the oligarchs supporting Vladimir Putin's regime to flout US law.

""The United States will not allow its financial institutions and persons to be manipulated or defrauded for the purposes of benefitting those supporting an illegal war.""

Andrew Adams, director of the Task Force KleptoCapture department, said Masters had to face the ""consequences"" of his actions.

He explained that corporations and executives ""have a choice"" of either fighting against ""corruption, sanctions violations, and money laundering"" or choosing the path of the accused.

""They can as Osipov and Masters are alleged to have done, attempt to shield themselves and their clients behind a veil of fraud,"" he added.

""These men made their decisions, and now face the consequences of a failed attempt to profit through, rather than standing against, a sophisticated, transnational criminal enterprise.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125123243/http://news.sky.com/story/briton-arrested-after-allegedly-hiding-russian-yacht-by-changing-its-name-from-tango-to-fanta-12794873;skynews;politics;2362

It had the adhesion of a slug, but was wetter and slicker. I stopped myself from immediately flicking it away as a piece of unidentified yuck and looked more closely. Perched on the whorl of my forefinger was a tiny snail no more than four millimetres long. Its shell was a glossy, pointed twist, turning five times from lip to apex. Like most snails, the shell circled clockwise. As I watched, a minute pair of black-beaded horns emerged – and then retreated into the shining brown shell. It was a slippery moss snail (Cochlicopa lubrica), also known as the glossy pillar snail. They are common across the UK in shady, damp corners, especially among leaf litter in gardens, where they feed on microbial fungi.
The silky shells are a defence against birds, mice and other predators, enabling them to escape by slipping out of the grip of a beak or paw. The snails maintain this smoothness by cleaning themselves with their radulas, the long tongue-like muscle that also helps them scrape up food. Their semi-translucent shells look delicate and easily crushed, but they are immensely strong for their size. Underneath the smooth, organic outer coating lies an interlocking lattice of calcium carbonate that the snail secretes as it grows. Judging by the size, this individual was comparatively juvenile. It will probably grow another couple of millimetres before it reaches maturity and starts reproducing. Moss snails generally mate in pairs, but they are hermaphrodite and also capable of self-fertilisation. In freezing winter conditions, they can hold the fertilised eggs inside their bodies in a kind of hibernation until warmer weather comes. After photographing it, I carefully replaced the snail on its tree. Noticing it, rather than wiping it aside as an inanimate piece of grot, was a good reminder for me that we are surrounded by fascinating creatures. You don’t need to hike miles into the mountains to see them, buy specialist equipment or have esoteric knowledge. All you need is a dash of curiosity and the willingness to observe more closely what is, literally, at hand. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/04/country-diary-a-tiny-wonder-in-our-midst;guardian;environment;5420
1266;1266;Victoria Azarenka casts aside doubts and ‘villain’ tag on semi-final return;2023-01-25T18:00:36Z;['Emma Kemp'];['Australian Open 2023', 'Victoria Azarenka', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Tennis', 'Sport'];;"“Do you know what happened 10 years ago?” says Victoria Azarenka. It is hard to read her emotions because of the sunglasses she wears at her press conference, but her voice is laced with long-held contempt. Assumptions were made about what occurred at Melbourne Park in 2013 when the 23-year-old Azarenka, having just squandered five match points in her semi-final against Sloane Stephens, took a lengthy, controversial medical timeout before winning the match and then defending her 2012 title. But a decade on, in the context of her references to anxiety and panic attacks fuelled by – among other things – an intense fear of failure, there is a sense the reality may be more nuanced. That Azarenka was, as she put it, painted as the “villain” in the Hollywood narrative that accompanies so many sports. “But we’re not villains, we’re not heroes – we are regular human beings that go through so many, many things,” she says, adding that she sympathises with Novak Djokovic over external doubts about his hamstring injury.
“It was one of the worst things that I’ve ever gone through in my professional career, the way I was treated after that moment. The way I had to explain myself, until 10.30pm at night, because people didn’t want to believe me. “Assumptions and judgments, all those comments are just shit because nobody’s there to see the full story. It didn’t matter how many times I said my story, it did not cut through … it took me 10 fucking years to get over it. I finally am over that.” The Azarenka renaissance is not just about her tennis, though her tennis has played a significant role. The Belarusian former world No 1 is back in the final four of an Australian Open for the first time since those events in 2013 thanks to what might be labelled a “vintage” quarter-final performance against the third seed, Jessica Pegula. But that would be to infer that this vintage of Azarenka is identical to the first, when so much about the current version differs. The heights of her first coming were reached when she was in her early 20s and bringing then musician boyfriend, Redfoo, to press conferences. Back then she did not always understand the feelings she had on court, let alone what to do about them. These days she is more likely to bring her seven-year-old son, Leo, to meet the media. A difficult custody battle has shaped her outlook and perspective, as has her “daily work” to develop an awareness of her emotions and combat negative self-talk.
“I started with not trying to be positive, just trying to be neutral, not to go negative,” she says. “Accepting the anxiety that I have, accepting the fear that I have, kind of working through it … which is pretty hard to do. “I’m pretty happy that the process that I’m going through makes me feel confident about myself, happy about myself, and helps me to be more open, be more accepting, be compassionate. ‘Compassionate’ was a very hard word for me to understand.” When she plays Elena Rybakina for a place in the final on Thursday she will not need external validation, though she will surely receive it anyway for this campaign, which brings to memory her 2020 run to the US Open final. Arguably this tournament’s best returner, she will be pitted against its best server in the reigning Wimbledon champion, who herself has had to fight to be taken seriously but firmly announced herself via her fourth-round defeat of the top seed, Iga Swiatek, and then Jelena Ostapenko in the quarters. Only Rybakina now stands in the way, and the Kazakh will not be as generous with her serve as Pegula, who lost half of her first-serve points. But should Azarenka triumph she could yet form one half of a potential all-Belarusian final, with the fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka hoping she won’t become the latest top-50 player undone by Magda Linette after the unseeded Pole outdid Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday to secure her place in the semis. Whichever way the results fall, Azarenka is comfortable in who she is. “I’ve been called that I’m cheating, that I’m faking, that I was trying to throw people off their game,” she says. “It’s everything that is so wrong about my character if somebody actually knows me. At some point you’re like: ‘Really? Am I?’ Those doubts starts to creep in. “Now I just don’t care. I am more and more confident in what I know about myself, and I’m at peace with that. Those comments, judgments, they’re there – I notice them, but I don’t care.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/25/tennis-victoria-azarenka-australian-open-semi-final-elena-rybakina;guardian;sports;1266
2643;2643;Long way around: Australian man’s epic 5,000km detour to get his car back home;2023-01-19T03:44:45Z;['Elias Visontay'];['Australia news', 'Western Australia', 'Flooding', 'Extreme weather'];;"Christmas is meant to bring loved ones together, but when a “biblical flood” wreaked havoc on a family celebration, it forced one Australian man to make an almost 5,000km detour alone through the outback to get his car home. Chris English, a 64-year-old from Kununurra in far northern Western Australia, is this week driving through red desert by day and camping out at night on his way back home.
In December, English and his wife drove from Kununurra to the coastal hub of Broome so they could catch a cheaper flight to Perth to be with their children and their families for Christmas and the new year. But by early January, towards the end of their stay in Perth, the couple realised they were in trouble. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup They watched on as the northern part of Western Australia was inundated by the “worst ever” floods to hit their state. The road between Broome and Kununurra was destroyed when the Fitzroy River flooded, and the couple came to the realisation they would not be able to pick up their car as planned and drive the same route back home. When they consulted Google Maps for the next best way home to avoid road closures, the trip was staggering – a vast U-shaped route down through the centre of Western Australia, feeding into the base of the Northern Territory and up to its tip, before driving west back to Kununurra. The trip would take 64 hours, across 4,770km of road – a longer journey than driving from Madrid to Moscow. English’s son Craig told the Guardian his father is “a very seasoned in terms of outback driving” so was undeterred by the mammoth detour.
“He’s very much a country guy, so it seemed normal to us that he wanted to, that’s just what he’s like,” Craig said. “He’s the only one mad enough to do the trip.” English managed to persuade his wife and got permission to fly to Broome and rescue their stranded car, while she would fly back to Kununurra as she needed to get back earlier for work. On Monday morning, English set off on the ambitious trip in his Nissan Patrol four-wheel-drive with a swag, a portable stove and supplies for a week. His son Craig began sharing updates intended just for his small following of friends on Twitter. Soon, Craig had thousands of new followers eager to hear about his father’s latest whereabouts. When English next entered a town with reception, Craig told his father of his newfound celebrity. “He was laughing his head off that people were supporting,” Craig said. “Totally blown away by it and even a bit overwhelmed I think.” “He told me ‘I’m not doing this for any attention, I just want to get the car back’,” Craig said. By Wednesday, English had made it into the Northern Territory, and spent the night camping just next to Uluru. His family expect him to arrive back home in Kununurra by Monday. Craig estimates his father will spend about $1,000 in petrol over the course of the trip, with higher bowser costs at remote service stations. “None of us are worried about him. If he gets lost the whole country is looking for him.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/long-way-around-australian-mans-epic-5000km-detour-to-get-his-car-back-home;guardian;environment;2643

11;11;Emily Atack: Asking for It? review – a truly sickening look at the torrent of sexual images online;2023-01-31T22:00:01Z;['Emine Saner'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television'];;"Receiving 37 sexually explicit messages in one morning, including dick pics, would surely ruin anyone’s breakfast. “That did put me off my scrambled eggs,” says Emily Atack, who must have been thankful sausages weren’t the plan that morning. But none of this is funny. The actor and comic has made Emily Atack: Asking for It? (BBC Two), a documentary about her experience of receiving thousands of sexually aggressive messages and images on social media, and its impact on her. News of the programme makes the front page of the Sun (“TV Emily sex pest hell”), which prompts one of her harassers to get in touch. “I’ll be masturbating while watching your new documentary,” he writes, spectacularly failing to get the point or – far more likely – getting a thrill out of tormenting her. Atack is a warm and engaging presenter who can laugh at the hideous photos and messages when she is with friends, such as the writers on her ITV2 comedy show, but she admits to using humour as a coping mechanism. It is not funny to receive violent fantasies and sexual images when she is at home alone and has to check the locks on her door. Atack’s underlying question is whether she has been asking for it. If she posts pictures of herself in a bikini online, is it – as people have told her – her fault that men send her vile messages and photographs? (No, is the obvious answer.) But dick pics are merely the symptom of a sick misogynistic culture. “I’ve used my sexuality to get things I want and need at times. Does that make me part of the issue?” she wonders, but never gets much deeper than this. She did photoshoots for lads’ mags – a tiny part of the wider objectification of women – and I would have been interested to hear more about how she feels about her part in that now. I’m not blaming Atack for it, of course; she is as much a victim of the culture as any of us. She tells us later how she had her first sexual experience at the age of 12 with an 18-year-old man and received sexual attention from men from an even younger age. No wonder she grew up to be a woman who thought she had to do what photographers wanted and blamed herself for the dick pics. The point is, women get these kinds of messages regardless of what they wear or how they behave because it’s about shaming and intimidating them. As a public figure, Atack might get more than most, but the documentary also includes women who don’t have a public profile and the impact it has on them. It makes them feel sick, they say. “It really is humiliating, embarrassing for some reason, even though I didn’t do anything wrong,” says one. Most incensing are the experiences of the 16-year-old girls Atack visits at a school, almost all of whom have received dick pics or videos of men masturbating. One says she started receiving them when she was 12. “It starts when you get a phone,” she says. Another says the messages ramp up whenever she is pictured in her school uniform. Most of the messages come from much older men. “I feel more vulnerable in my uniform than I do in anything else,” says one. I can’t stop thinking about these girls, and wondering how we got to a point where it can be considered normal for men to send pornography to children. It is a frustrating watch in some ways. It is a shame the tech companies weren’t questioned on their failure to tackle unsolicited sexual images; even a we-tried-but-they-declined-to-comment would have spoken loudly about how uninterested these platforms seem to be in tackling abuse against women. Although Atack mentions she has spoken at a briefing of MPs, it is not clear in the rest of the documentary what parliament plans to do about “cyberflashing”. (It will be criminalised in England and Wales when the online safety bill becomes law, which this programme could have made clear, since the online safety campaigner interviewed here by Atack says we need education alongside legislation.) The documentary is more affecting as a portrait of the impact this torrent of sexual images has. Like many women, Atack feels humiliated and ashamed by it. When she finally reports some of the abuse to the police, having never thought they would take it seriously, she cries. She has been damaged by it, she says, and she doesn’t know if she can change that. It is heartbreaking and enraging.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/31/emily-atack-asking-for-it-review-a-truly-sickening-look-at-the-torrent-of-sexual-images-online;guardian;entertainment & culture;11
4035;4035;Republican-controlled House pushes for new abortion restrictions;2023-01-11T22:53:30Z;['Lauren Gambino'];['US politics', 'Abortion', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'World news', 'US Congress', 'House of Representatives'];;"The Republican-led House on Wednesday pressed ahead with a pair of anti-abortion measures, despite warning signs that the issue had galvanized the opposition in the wake of the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade last year. Voting mostly along party lines, Republicans first approved a bill that would compel doctors to provide care for an infant who survives an attempted abortion – an occurrence that is exceedingly rare. After its passage, Republicans broke into applause on the House floor as the bill’s sponsor, congresswoman Ann Wagner, a Republican of Missouri, waved the text of the legislation in celebration. Democrats, several of them wearing white in protest, remained silent. However, on the measure, two Texas Democrats broke with the party: the congressman Henry Cuellar, who opposes abortion, supported it while his colleague Vicente González voted present. The House also passed a non-binding resolution condemning attacks on pregnancy crisis centers, with the support of all Republicans and three Democrats. The proposals, among the first moves made by Republicans’ new, narrow House majority, are unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. But their passage will provide the Republican majority an opportunity to draw a sharp contrast with Democrats on the issue of abortion ahead of the 2024 elections.
“I am proud that Republicans are following through on the promises that we made to the American people,” the majority leader, Steve Scalise, the second-highest-ranking House Republican and a staunch anti-abortion advocate, told reporters this week. “All life is sacred and must be protected.” Anti-abortion groups have long pushed so-called “born alive” legislation similar to the version under consideration in the House, which could carry a prison sentence of up to five years for medical workers. Critics, including medical professionals, say such measures are based on distortions and misinformation about what is often an extremely painful and often unwanted decision to end a pregnancy. Abortions after the point of viability, which is defined as about 23 weeks, are extremely uncommon, according to federal and state data. In the rare instances they do happen, they often involve serious fetal abnormalities or risks to the life of the mother. Moreover, opponents say newborns are already protected by a bipartisan law passed in 2002, which established full legal rights for infants born at any stage of development. In a floor speech, Jerry Nadler, a Democrat of New York, said the measure “does nothing new to protect infants” but neither was it “harmless”. “The bill directly interferes with a doctor’s medical judgment and dictates a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances, which could, in fact, put infants’ lives at greater risk,” Nadler said. Abortion rights advocates also reacted to the bill. “Let’s be clear: doctors are already required to provide appropriate medical care by law,” Jacqueline Ayers, a senior vice-president at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. “This is not how medical care works. It’s wrong, irresponsible, and dangerous to suggest otherwise.” But Wagner, who has repeatedly championed the measure, argued, without evidence, that additional protections for infants born after abortion attempts were necessary because “many of these sweet little ones are denied the medical care they need to survive and thrive”. Public support for abortion rights has climbed since the supreme court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion last summer. In November, voters punished Republicans for building the conservative court that overturned Roe. Despite rampant inflation and Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, Democrats defied expectations in November, keeping control of the Senate and limiting Republican gains in the House, where their razor-thin majority is already proving to be a challenge. Efforts to restrict abortion have even been met with fierce resistance in traditionally Republican states. In Montana, a conservative western state, voters rejected an initiative related to infants born after attempted abortions that is similar to the one House Republicans passed on Wednesday. Abortion remains a top concern among conservative Republicans and anti-abortion activists alarmed by the backlash to the supreme court decision. Yet the early focus on abortion has given some Republicans in swing districts cause for concern. “We learned nothing from the midterms if this is how we’re going to operate in the first week. Millions of women across the board were angry over overturning Roe v Wade,” Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Noting that the bills had little chance of becoming law, she called the move “tone-deaf” and said Republicans were merely “paying lip-service to life”. “If you want to make a difference and reduce the number of abortions with a Democratic-controlled Senate, the No 1 issue we should be working on is access to birth control,” she said. Nevertheless, Mace voted for the bills alongside her party. Republicans also advanced a resolution, which carries no legislative weight, condemning violence against “pro-life facilities, groups and churches” which drew Democratic opposition because of its failure to address the threats targeting women’s healthcare clinics and abortion providers. “By ignoring these acts of violence, Republicans are sending a very dangerous message that will only embolden the extremists behind them,” said Diana DeGette, a Democrat of Colorado and co-chair of the House Pro-Choice Caucus. Speaking on the House floor ahead of the vote, DeGette urged Republicans instead to adopt a counter-resolution that would condemn acts of political violence in any form. Republicans, arguing in favor of the resolution, said anti-abortion groups had become targets of political violence since the supreme court’s June decision, and denounced the department of justice’s response to these attacks as inadequate. “This resolution is very simple and its language is clear,” said Jim Jordan, a Republican of Ohio, who has been critical of what he says is evidence of political bias within federal law enforcement against anti-abortion groups. “It also calls upon the Biden administration to take action now to bring the perpetrators to justice. Who could be opposed to that?” In a statement, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, affirmed that the bills were “doomed” in the Senate, where he said Democrats would act as a “firewall against this extreme anti-choice Maga Republican agenda”. “Just months after a historically disappointing midterm election, the Maga Republican-controlled House is putting on full display their truly extreme views on women’s health with legislation that does not have the support of the American people,” Schumer said ahead of the House vote. “Once again, Republicans are proving how dangerously out of touch they are with mainstream America.” Reproductive rights activists won another political victory this week in Virginia, where abortion was at the center of a closely watched state senate race. Democrats flipped the seat, a result that will probably prevent the state legislature from enacting a 15-week abortion ban backed by the state’s conservative governor, Glenn Youngkin.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/11/new-abortion-restrictions-bills-republicans-house-congress;guardian;politics;4035

877;877;Inspired by winter;2023-01-27T14:00:35Z;['N/A'];['Guardian Masterclasses'];;"I’m walking through the winter, each breath in this coldness visible, taking each footstep with care. I’m walking through a place where there are only four hours of daylight in this darkest of seasons. Here is a place where you might think nothing could possibly grow or flourish. I’m walking with particular care because the last time I was here, I fell and shattered the bones in the limb which is my livelihood, my right arm. Thereafter I had a year of darkness and depression, pain and illness. Now I’m back walking through winter in Iceland’s Thingvellir National Park. I look ahead, and I’m stopped in my tracks by luminous green amidst the snow and dark rocks. Moss! Marvellous moss — able to grow even in the toughest and bleakest of climates. Be more like moss, I think. Flourish even in the darkest, coldest places when the odds seem stacked against you.
Later, I’m back writing about the experience in the snowcapped mountains of Mossfellsbaer, known as the ‘green town’ due to its geothermal activity, greenhouses and abundant lakes and rivers flowing down to the sea. I’m staying in a place named after the Icelandic writer and former Nobel Laureate, Laxness, a writer who knew that even winter could be a source of inspiration. Iceland is a lesson in how alive and colourful the wintertime can be, with the hot springs gushing from the earth, the turquoise lagoons, and the fiery sunsets. Writers the world over have captured the beauty and glory of the season, as well as in my writing masterclass. I encourage participants to do so too, wherever in the world they might be. Taking time to pay attention to nature, even in winter, can bring enormous benefits to our physical and mental health. Also, taking the time to write about the natural world, to capture the experience in words even when we may be back inside or far from nature, can again do wonders for our well-being. I realise how that marvellous moss has grown inside the mind, layered itself in the internal landscape. In my hometown of Manchester, UK, I walk through winter and wonder at the tree branches, stripped bare to the bone. I stop to admire the glory of winter wildlife and all that still grows and sings through the cold and darkness, the beauty of birdsong taking the sting out of a brutal year and the bright red berries a joyous hot spot of colour in the dark. Walking through wintry landscapes, I’m focused on the outer world and feel the positive effects on both the body and mind — endorphins are released, my breathing is more even, and with each footstep, anxious ruminations quieten down and, for a while, I’m lifted beyond the still persistent pain in my wrist. Winter reminds us of the virtues of darkness within which life grows; I walk and think of life beneath the black soil, of cells multiplying and dividing, of seeds soon enough to flourish in Spring.

4230;4230;The truth about James Cameron: what is the film director’s billion-dollar secret?;2023-01-11T06:00:10Z;['Helen O’Hara'];['James Cameron', 'Film', 'Culture'];;"James Cameron may have been on to something when, after winning the best director Oscar for Titanic in 1998, he claimed exuberantly to be “king of the world”. He has occupied the top spot at the worldwide box office for nearly 25 years, thanks to 1997’s Titanic and 2009’s Avatar, which have grossed more than $5bn (£4.1bn) between them. His latest film, Avatar: The Way of Water, joined the all-time Top 10 after only three weeks and was the sixth-fastest film to make $1bn. It’s now at No 7, with Titanic at No 3 and the original Avatar at No 1. If it were to overtake Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Cameron would end up with three of the four highest-grossing films ever. Yet before the release of each of his past four films, all said to be the most expensive film then made, Cameron has been more or less written off. He was extravagant, too ambitious and out of touch, claimed commentators. That Titanic speech became a stick with which to beat him, while Avatar’s success was treated as though it was the result of a fleeting madness that had afflicted audiences, with commentators pointing to its lack of “cultural footprint” (“Name three characters,” challenged detractors on Twitter as The Way of Water approached release). Cineastes tend to sideline Cameron from their lists of great films and great directors. He doesn’t appear on the latest Sight & Sound 100 Greatest Films poll and he only squeaked into the American Film Institute’s 100 Years … 100 Movies list in 2008, with Titanic placed at No 83. No one, least of all in Hollywood, seems to understand what makes his films so phenomenally successful. You know they don’t, because otherwise they would be trying harder to do the same thing. So where did it all go right?
Cameron-level success doesn’t look like that of other blockbusters. You don’t see many people in Titanic T-shirts or dressed as Avatar’s Na’vi aliens for Halloween – and it’s not just the high price of blue body paint that stops them. The “cultural footprint” doesn’t look like that of the Marvel movies or Harry Potter. But that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. The difference is that Cameron fans, or rather fans of his individual films, are not online picking fights about Batman or speculating about Doctor Strange cameos. Instead, you will find a thriving community at learnnavi.org studying the Na’vi’s constructed language. Created at the University of Southern California by Dr Paul Frommer, who still adjudicates on developments, the language now has more than 5,000 words, including derivatives; enough to write poetry and songs. “Some people do come in for just the academic exercise,” says Mark Miller, a network engineer and special-effects creator who is the site’s administrator. “But most folks show up because they are fascinated with the film. We can’t go to Pandora [the Na’vi’s home world], but why not try to, as a fan, be involved in the aspects of it that we can actually participate in? Our users are not necessarily superfans or very nerdy – they just want to feel a little bit more part of that world.”
In the six or seven years after Avatar’s release, there were annual meetings, too, as there were for the more general Avatar fansite tree-of-souls.net, but those died down when no sequel emerged, as expected, in 2014 or 2015. Some fans have gone further. Raymond Knowles, a carpenter from Edmonton, Canada, adopted the nickname Mr Avatar professionally about six years ago after he covered 95% of his body with Avatar-themed tattoos (skull, hand and foot tattoos are planned). Knowles, who has four portraits of Zoe Saldana’s heroine, Neytiri, among his tattoos, estimates that he has spent C$35,000 (£21,500) getting and refreshing his body art, with a further C$25,000 on Avatar art for his truck. A longtime Cameron fan, Knowles saw the film on opening night with his daughter. “I was pretty much in awe. Hardly said a word. Every emotion came out: tears, laughter, you name it.” He went back eight times in two weeks and found his perspective on life changed by the film. “There were so many correlations to our own planet,” says Knowles. “The ecological message. Cameron talks about how a regular person can be a hero. And Neytiri stuck with me right off the bat. She was the entrance in [to Pandora]. Ever since day one, that was pretty much it. I wouldn’t say I was in love. Obsessed? Yeah, maybe.”
Titanic also changed lives. Viewers have tattoos with the coordinates of the Titanic’s SOS call, the film’s VHS tape and the Heart of the Ocean jewel that features in the plot. Fans have built scale models of the ship, travelled to Titanic museums worldwide (Belfast, where the ship was built, renamed an entire district the Titanic Quarter) and planned life events around the film. Jess Chapman, a freelance writer, got married at the Olympic Restaurant at the White Swan in Alnwick, Northumberland, a venue fitted out with the panelling, glass and ceiling that once adorned the Titanic’s sister ship, the Olympic. “I watched Titanic when I was nine or 10 and quickly became obsessed. We’d roleplay it: I’d be Rose, my big sister would be Jack and my little sister would be [Billy Zane’s bad guy] Cal. She hates it to this day because we left her out.” An obsession with the film grew into a fascination with the history of the wreck and the age of ocean liners. As such, Chapman had decided on her wedding venue before she was even engaged; luckily, her husband was amenable. “It’s a perfect film,” she says. What I love most is the dedication to accuracy, but I love James Cameron’s stupid action guff, too. It, and the passion it spawned, has given me more pleasure in my life than anything else.” The comedian and writer Caitlin Durante, who is based in Los Angeles, watched the film at least once a day for entire summers as a child. She sports several Titanic tattoos. “Some movies are a feature-length historical romantic drama, other movies are a feature-length disaster movie,” she says. “Titanic said: ‘Why not both?’ Brave, subversive, iconic.”
The difference in fan behaviour is clearly not about passion. Demographics play a role, however. These fan groups were never dominated by adolescent males, unlike with many Hollywood blockbusters. Since Jaws in 1975, studios have largely focused on 16- to 25-year-old males, but Cameron’s recent films have also appealed to young women and older adults of both sexes. Perhaps, then, it’s a function of Cameron’s success that his online fandom is so muted. Comic books, video games and sci-fi were once the province of nerds, outward markers of fandom signalling your identity among a community. Because everyone and their mum went to see Avatar, there is less tribalism involved. A Titanic T-shirt doesn’t show peculiar discernment or reveal a particular predilection; it just shows you saw the same film as everyone else. So how does Cameron get the attention of people who go to the cinema once a decade? Scott Mendelson, a box office expert and film reporter at The Wrap, says that a crucial factor is Cameron’s emphasis on just that: the cinema. “The Way of Water is being sold, and so far embraced, as a film that you need to experience at least once in a theatre, preferably in 3D, ideally in Imax or something like that. That’s part of where its legs come from.” Since at least 1986’s Aliens, epic spectacle has been part of the Cameron brand, employing envelope-pushing visual effects that demand to be seen on the biggest screen possible. He pioneered CGI in films such as 1989’s The Abyss and 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as well as more subtle, real-world environmental effects on Titanic.
The director and Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin remembers going frame by frame through a 35mm print of Titanic with colleagues soon after its release. They were studying its computer visual effects (VFX), then an industry still in its infancy. “Back in 1998, no one expected viewers to pore over every single frame in the way that we can do in HD today, so you could get away with cutting some corners if need be,” says Franklin. “We didn’t find anything to call out even after going over the print in forensic detail. The judicious combination of miniatures, cutting-edge (for the time) computer graphics and stunning full-size physical effects produced a tremendous result that still has a tangible physicality that makes you believe in the ship.” Cameron’s perfectionism, going so far as inventing the technology he needs if it doesn’t exist, is notable, although not unique among elite directors. Particularly in his younger days, he was deeply unpopular with his crews – “You can’t scare me; I work for James Cameron” read a crew T-shirt on more than one of his films – and is reported to have nail-gunned mobile phones to the wall if they rang during shooting. But his obsessive focus on greater realism and his ability to oversee every aspect of production are part of his appeal. “I hear from friends who have worked closely with him that he is a very charismatic leader,” says Franklin. “They may end up being completely wrung out by the experience, but while they are inside the machine he definitely seems to exude that ‘reality-distortion field’ that encourages people to push through all sensible limits. Cameron’s intimate understanding of VFX has always helped him tell stories that would exceed the reach of other film-makers. His films have extraordinary longevity, despite relying very heavily on VFX: Aliens and even the original Terminator hold up extremely well.” His technical mastery is why hardcore Titanic and Avatar fans talk about the films’ immersiveness and ability to transport the viewer, whether to 1912 or 2154. “It’s my comfort blanket,” says Durante of Titanic. Meanwhile, there were numerous reports of Avatar fans being depressed by the impossibility of visiting Pandora. It’s also important that Cameron films speak to women in a way that few of his A-list contemporaries even attempt. “He has consistently created meaty roles for women,” says Anna Smith of the podcast Girls on Film. “We need to see ourselves reflected on screen, especially within the typically male-dominated action genre.” Now, films are accused of being “woke” simply for having a central female character, but Cameron has been creating or developing three-dimensional female leads for four decades, from Terminator’s Sarah Connor and Aliens’ Ripley to Titanic’s Rose and Avatar’s Neytiri.
It’s not just that Cameron seems actively to like women; he also likes the type of family drama or broad-strokes romance that is more associated with female audiences than big sci-fi directors. “You look at him and you think he’s this big, macho dude,” says Mendelson. “But on the inside he’s basically a hippy flower child that just wants everybody to love everybody else.” Cameron said he re-issued Titanic in 3D not to cash in on the craze for the format after Avatar, but because it allowed men to cry safely behind the 3D glasses. “As I try to figure out how to create real emotional stakes for the characters, my stories somehow always become love stories,” Cameron told Empire magazine in December. Not just love stories, but unapologetic love stories that you can devour over and over. The sinking of the Titanic and the destruction of Avatar’s Hometree are merely the backdrop for a story of good defeating evil and love triumphing over cynicism. “He has this unerring ability to give moviegoers what they don’t even know they want and, crucially, have them come back for more – because you need audiences to go back again and again to hit this big,” says Phil de Semlyen, Time Out’s global film editor. “No one would claim his storytelling is innovative. But his secret sauce is that there’s always a heart beating beneath the spectacle.” Ultimately, the combination of epic action and heartfelt sincerity may be the crux of it. Perhaps it’s the sincerity that is hardest to replicate, or maintain, in Hollywood. Beneath the veneer of all those pixels, there is something thoroughly old-fashioned in Cameron’s stories. Clearly, that is something that people still crave. They can get huge battles or groundbreaking effects elsewhere in the focus-grouped, carefully engineered efforts of other franchises. What Cameron, almost alone, seems to offer is the combination of new worlds and epic adventures with big, soppy love stories. If Pauline Kael was right and cinema is all about kiss kiss, bang bang, no one else comes close.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/11/the-truth-about-james-cameron-what-is-the-film-directors-billion-dollar-secret;guardian;entertainment & culture;4230
5043;5043;900,000 crimes committed by people on bail under Tories, analysis finds;2023-01-05T22:00:32Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['UK criminal justice', 'Prisons and probation', 'Law', 'Legal aid', 'Judiciary', 'England', 'Wales', 'UK news', 'Society'];;Nearly 900,000 offences including murder, kidnap, and child rape, have been committed by people on bail in England and Wales since the Conservatives came to power, a new analysis has found. The latest government figures show more than 20,000 offences were committed by those released from custody as they awaited a hearing, equating to 55 offences a day. More than 7,200 sexual offences, including some committed against children as young as 12, were also committed by people on bail since 2010, of which 260 were committed in the last recorded year of 2021. The data, released to Labour after a parliamentary question, came as the Ministry of Justice launched a review of London probation services after they were condemned for a lack of staff and poor management. Labour has seized upon the figures, as Keir Starmer attempts to reinforce the message to voters that it is now the natural party of law and order. The shadow justice secretary, Steve Reed, said: “Dangerous criminals must not be left to roam the streets and prey on new victims. “Labour is the party of law and order. We will increase the number of lawyers allowed to serve as crown prosecutors to slash the courts backlog. In government, we will prevent crime, punish criminals and protect victims to keep our communities safe.” A number of people accused of murder have been released on bail this year because of delays in the criminal justice system and strike action by criminal barristers. In September, four people on trial for the fatal stabbing of 40-year-old Keith Green were released on bail after a judge refused to extend the time they could be kept in custody pending trial during the strike. Judge Ian Pringle, the recorder of Oxford, was asked to extend the period the accused could be held on remand beyond the six-month limit but refused to do so. Pringle pointedly remarked on the current state of the criminal courts and the government’s failure to remedy it. He said the government had made “virtually no … reforms” to legal aid funding. It was part of a series of refusals by judges to extend custody time limits (CTLs) in cases affected by the barristers’ strike. Judges in Leicester, Bolton, Manchester and Isleworth, west London, all recently refused to extend CTLs, raising fears about potentially dangerous people being released. In one such case, at Bristol crown court, Judge Peter Blair QC blamed “chronic underfunding” for delays, the Law Society Gazette reported. According to the data, 20,121 offences were committed by people on bail in 2021, while 874,621 were committed between 2010 and 2021. A total of 265 sexual offences were committed by people awaiting a hearing in 2021, while 7,219 were committed over 11 years to 31 December 2021. The independent review of London probation would be led by a senior MoJ official, the government said on Thursday, after the service was condemned by the chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, for “shocking” standards. A government spokesperson said: “Bail decisions are made by independent judges and the police, not the government, but anyone who commits a crime while on bail faces a tougher sentence and we have strengthened bail requirements to protect victims. “Since 2010 we have also driven up average sentence lengths almost every year and increased convictions by 15%. And we are going further to improve our justice system, by recruiting an extra 20,000 police officers, creating 20,000 additional prison places and investing almost half a billion pounds to reduce the number of outstanding crown court cases.”;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jan/05/900000-crimes-committed-by-people-on-bail-under-tories-analysis-finds;guardian;politics;5043
7671;7671;Father who went missing with partner and newborn baby is registered sex offender;Wednesday 18 January 2023 19:35, UK;['sadiya chowdhury'];['london', 'metropolitan police'];['father', 'partner', 'went', 'marten', 'constance', 'newborn', 'believed', 'registered', 'missing', 'offender', 'mark', 'couple', 'station', 'vehicle', 'sex', 'cctv', 'essex', 'baby'];"A father missing with his partner and newborn child is a registered sex offender, it has emerged.

Detectives have been searching for Mark Gordon, Constance Marten and their baby since they went missing when their car broke down on the M61 near Bolton on 5 January.

Police believe their baby may have been born inside the vehicle and would have been no more than two days old at the time of the breakdown.

It is also believed that most of the couple's belongings were destroyed when their abandoned vehicle set alight, due to a mechanical issue.

Gordon, 48, was convicted of rape and battery assault committed in the late 1980s and served 20 years in a prison in Florida.

Upon release and deportation to the UK in 2010, Gordon was listed on the sex offenders register.

After leaving their vehicle in Bolton on 5 January, the pair are believed to have travelled by taxi to Liverpool before moving on to Essex and then London.

They are understood to have a substantial amount of cash and are thought to be using it to pay for taxis and Airbnb accommodation in order to live off-grid, according to police.

Ms Marten, 35, comes from a wealthy aristocratic family.

Detectives are increasingly concerned for the baby's health and say no medical professional has assessed the child or the mother during her pregnancy.

""It has now almost been two weeks since Mark and Constance's car broke down on the M61 near Bolton and they have been on the move all that time with a newborn baby,"" said Detective Superintended Lewis Basford, leading the investigation.

""As far as we are aware, neither Constance nor the baby have received medical attention since it was born. Our priority is to ensure the baby, and indeed both Constance and Mark, are safe and well.

""This is a complex investigation with officers from across the Met continuing to work around the clock to find Constance, Mark and their baby.

""There is nothing to suggest that any of them have come to any sort of intentional harm - we just need to ensure they are okay, especially the baby, and do not require any medical assistance for any underlying issues.

""Once again, I appeal directly to you Constance and Mark. Please do the right thing for your baby and get in touch with us so that we know that you are all doing okay.""

Around 100 Metropolitan Police officers are involved in the investigation and are being supported by specialist resources from the National Crime Agency.

They have examined 223 hours of CCTV footage in their search for the missing family.

Greater Manchester Police, working alongside Essex Police, released CCTV showing someone they believed to be Ms Marten in a red shawl outside Harwich Port, Essex, at 9am on Saturday 7 January.

The couple are also believed to have been spotted in Colchester.

The Metropolitan Police shared CCTV showing Ms Marten, with a red shawl around her head, and Mr Gordon, with his head lowered and wearing a beanie hat, at East Ham station in Newham, east London, on the same day.

Police believe the couple, who were at the station sometime between 11.45am and 12.30pm, took a taxi from Essex.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118203211/http://news.sky.com/story/father-who-went-missing-with-partner-and-newborn-baby-is-registered-sex-offender-12789631;skynews;entertainment & culture;1762
1542;1542;How to make perfect coffee at home without a machine | Kitchen aide;2023-01-24T14:00:03Z;['Anna Berrill'];['Food', 'Coffee'];;"I’m spending a fortune on takeaway coffee. Can I make a good one at home without a machine? Harry, Leeds You could save hundreds of pounds a year by upping your home coffee game. A little bit of investment goes a long way, says James Hoffmann, author of How to Make the Best Coffee at Home: “Take a month’s budget of cafe coffee and spend it on a grinder.” “Buying ground coffee is like buying a diced apple,” Hoffmann adds. “It rapidly starts to go stale and break down.” A grinder also lets you make coffee in a host of ways, by adjusting the grind size – medium to medium-fine for a cafetiere, say. “But make sure you go for a burr grinder for a consistent texture.” A set of scales for weighing the beans is also handy to ensure a reliable cup each time. That might seem nerdy, but you don’t necessarily need to fork out: “Kitchen scales work just fine,” Hoffmann says. When buying beans, look for a roast date. “Freshness is important,” says Dale Harris of Ozone Coffee in London, so buy little and often, and store in something airtight and in the dark. He suggests brewing the beans “within four to six weeks; that way, your coffee will taste significantly better.” Another factor is provenance, though Harris says the farm or producer’s name matters more than the country of origin, “because it’s more likely somebody personally chose that coffee for its flavour”. The roast will dramatically impact the taste of your coffee, too, Hoffmann says: “In supermarkets, you’ll see a strength guide,” which, he explains, is ultimately all about the roast. “The higher the strength, the darker and more bitter the roast.” Specialist coffee, however, won’t provide a strength level. “Most of the time, it will be a light-medium roast,” Hoffmann says. “If you see fruity words in the description, this indicates some level of acidity, whereas a more sweet and nutty description means a more aromatic brew.” If you’re at a loss, buy beans from your local cafe – you’re already a fan of the beans they use, after all. Next, you need to choose what you’re going to brew those beans in. Harris prefers “anything with a paper filter [from £10], although once you have a Chemex [a pour-over-style glass coffee maker at about £50], you’ll never go back”. They make a “really clean brew”. Harris uses 60g coffee per litre of boiled water, gradually poured through a filter. Nick Law, founder of Bean Shot Coffee in Bruton, Somerset, also recommmends a Chemex, or an AeroPress (about £30). “It’s a good, all-round device, and you can take it anywhere,” says Law, who uses 18-20g per 240ml water, which should be filtered and at about 90C. Hoffmann’s preferred brewer, however, is the Clever Dripper (£20 or so). “It has a little stopper at the bottom [of the conical dripper],” he says. He stirs 18g medium-fine coffee into 300g water. But, Harris says, a cafetiere can also produce amazing results. Hoffmann uses 60-70g coffee per litre of water in his. He leaves it to steep for four minutes, stirs the crust that forms on top and scoops off any residue. Be patient, let the grounds settle to the bottom, then plunge only as far as the surface of the liquid and pour gently. If you want a strong coffee, the iconic Italian Moka pot (from about £20) is great, too, Hoffmann says; he uses 100g medium-fine coffee per litre of water, but it won’t get you an espresso. “That is much more complex, because you need a proper machine rather than a brewer, which is expensive.” Much better to save the espresso for a weekly takeaway treat.

5603;5603;Unlike past campaigns, today’s concern for the Great Barrier Reef is stuck in neutral | Rohan Lloyd;2023-01-03T02:12:05Z;['N/A'];['Great Barrier Reef', 'Environment', 'Australia news'];;"As part of the coverage of Labor’s first budget, the ABC provided analysis of the nation’s winners and losers. In it, the Great Barrier Reef was listed as “neutral”. The reef received no additional funding beyond the commitments Labor had made during the election campaign. It is striking that an ecosystem – a more-than-human place – could be listed alongside major economic and social concerns such as families, the Pacific, NBN and the ABC itself. It is a testament to the importance of the reef to our national identity, but also how dire things have become for that environment in the last four decades. The state of the reef is a major concern. Almost yearly, Unesco approaches our governments to “do better” to avoid having the reef listed as “in danger”. Coral reefs are under threat globally, but the decline of corals on the Great Barrier Reef is a particular worry given its close management. Of course, the reef has faced perils before. A well-known story of the reef’s past is the Save the Reef campaign from 1967-1975. That campaign erupted in response to proposals to mine Ellison Reef (near Mission beach) for lime and develop the broader Great Barrier Reef for petroleum. It involved a popular campaign, issues of constitutional law, a trade union black ban, a royal commission, the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and ultimately the reef’s protection from oil and mineral exploitation.
In my research, I have argued that this campaign has been remembered as a “David and Goliath” battle because characterising it as such establishes it as a source of hope for contemporary activists, but also because it conforms to our public memory of the anti-environmental and anti-intellectual Bjelke-Petersen government. However, while I accept that the activists felt as though they were fighting an unwinnable battle, the historical archives, including the records of conservationists of the time, shows that they enjoyed considerable support from parts of the Australian media, the trade union movement, the commonwealth government and the broader public. The eventual royal commission into petroleum drilling on the Great Barrier Reef made it clear that while many people were comfortable with exploiting the reef for fish, tourism and port development, the prospect of oil drilling was too much. Biblical metaphors of David and Goliath are helpful scaffolding for remembering past successes, but to me it is equally powerful to recognise that the reef was saved because people overwhelmingly supported its protection.
Today, however, the circumstances are noticeably different. Unlike the campaign of the past, there is considerably more rejection of conservationist concerns for the reef, particularly within the media. Similarly, it is unlikely that the trade unions would initiate black bans on prospective mines in support of saving the reef initiatives. More perplexing, our governments have been slow, if not obstructionist, in creating meaningful policy change towards climate change (which is the biggest threat to the reef) while providing significant funding to reef research bodies like the Australian Institute for Marine Science, CSIRO, the marine park authority and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. Science has gained from this investment, while governments have benefited from the research when the reef’s health and outlook have come into question, shielding themselves from greater international pressure to act on climate change.
But of course, things are more complex than this, too. The huge amount of research into the reef since the establishment of marine park authority has laid bare the interconnectedness between the reef ecosystem and the people and industries that exist in its catchment. Furthermore, the pressures of climate change have also made the reef a national and international problem. We have all become linked to the reef’s health to different degrees. Despite being collectively entangled within this crisis, there seems to be little accord about what saving the reef means and how that is to be achieved. It feels like we are facing a goliath. The Save the Reef conservationists were successful because they tapped into the wide-held love, curiosity and admiration for the reef. They helped establish a chorus of concern for a future reef ruined by oil and mining, which led to the royal commission that ultimately recommended the creation of marine park authority. These accomplishments seem beyond our abilities at this stage. A sincere approach towards saving the reef could begin by building on our present and historic connection to it to confront climate change. At this stage, however, it seems our commonwealth government would prefer to stay in neutral. Rohan Lloyd is an environmental historian and high school teacher.

82;82;Just like Eva Green, I’m French and I’m rude. And no, I don’t care what you think | Marie Le Conte;2023-01-31T16:22:38Z;['Marie Le Conte'];['France', 'Society', 'Eva Green', 'Culture', 'Film'];;"The relationship between France and Britain, the best of frenemies, seems to finally be thawing. The Brexit wars are behind us, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson no longer annoy each other on a near weekly basis, and the first Franco-British summit in years will take place in March. That’s no fun. Allow me, then, to do my French patriotic duty and open up a new front of combat. Here goes: the British, despite what they might think, aren’t any good at complaining. This is an odd state of affairs, as they – well, you – see it as a proud national trait. But they are wrong. The British like to grumble and moan and whine, but really, no one does it like us. There is nothing like a true, spirited, cathartic French whinge. That, you could say, is what Eva Green has been trying to argue in court this week. Green is suing a production company over the collapse of a film she was meant to star in. As a result, some unflattering WhatsApp messages have been revealed in which she harshly insults the producers and others – but it was her response in court in London this week that really caught people’s attention. When asked about messages that described others involved in the film as “weak and stupid”, Green replied: that’s “my Frenchness coming out sometimes”. (She added: “Sometimes you say things you don’t actually mean. Of course they are not weak and stupid.”) You may laugh at her justification, but there is some truth to it. Aggressive, rude, constant complaining is what we do; it’s who we are. Take this satirical piece from Le Gorafi, France’s answer to the Onion, published last year. “France will send 10,000 French people to Ukraine to complain”, the headline read. “Among the French citizens who will be deployed, we will have 5,000 individuals whose job will be to repeat ‘It sucks so much here’, ‘What a shitty situation’, or even ‘If I’d been in power here I would have settled all this in a jiffy’”, was the (false) quote of the home secretary. Another popular parody from the site cited dire concerns from French citizens that putting an end to lockdown would mean that they would no longer have enough to complain about. In short, and whatever the cost may be, we’ll complain on the beaches, we’ll complain on the landing grounds, we’ll complain in the fields and … well, you get the gist. Of course, mere relentlessness isn’t what makes French complaining unique. While the British enjoy seething passive aggression and cloaking their feelings in euphemism, a good Gallic whinge must be vicious, and ideally come at an inopportune time. A classic from my own life involved a close friend exploding in my face about the various parts of my personality that she felt she could no longer stand. I was, at that point in time, sitting on a skip in the street, crying, having just been dumped. She apologised the next day, and it soon became something we both laughed about. She agreed that she could have picked better timing and I agreed that her criticisms had a point, and so we moved on.
Still, I understand that this can all be a bit of a shock to outsiders. In the same way that Brits are taken aback when they go abroad and find queues being ignored, trenchant Frenchness can grate if you aren’t used to it. This is something that another actor, Scarlett Johansson, found when she moved to Paris a decade ago. “When I first got there I thought people were not that whole kind of rude Parisian thing – you know, people aren’t rude, they’re wonderful,” she told David Letterman in 2014. “Well, that was before I was a mainstay there, and then people decided that once I wasn’t going away they could just be really terribly rude to me.” Johansson has since moved back to the US. Ultimately, the beauty of French complaining is its almost democratic nature. If we all know that we will all eventually fly into a rage at some inconvenient point, we find it hard to hold it against one another. We can also recognise its uses: sometimes harsh truths do just need to come out. They may feel painful when they do, but it is still better than leaving issues to fester. At risk of being sympathetic to the point of bias, perhaps this is what happened to Eva Green. She was concerned about the quality of the movie she was making, and felt she’d been misled. What else was she going to do? Sigh and tut? That’s just not the way we do things. Marie Le Conte is a French journalist living in London Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

3613;3613;Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 324 of the invasion;2023-01-13T19:09:12Z;['Jessica Murray'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news'];;Ukraine has denied Russia’s claim that Vladimir Putin’s forces have captured Soledar. On Friday, as Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the salt-mining town. Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting “ongoing battles”. Soledar is “Verdun for 21st century” according to a top Ukraine official. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, likened the fight for the town to the longest and bloodiest battle in the first world war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar. The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town. Ukraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly, a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour. Putin’s move to replace his top commander in Ukraine after a few months is a sign of military disarray and his growing impatience in a war Russia is not winning, analysts said. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday it had, again, replaced its top commander in Ukraine, putting the army chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, in charge. It is the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscow’s military leadership. Germany will continue to “weigh every step carefully” and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its “leading position” as one of Kyiv’s top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on “such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe”. A US envoy has called for Serbia to sign up to sanctions against Russia. Counsellor Derek Chollet expressed strong concern on Thursday about the activities of the Russian private military contractor Wagner group and its alleged attempts to recruit soldiers in Serbia and elsewhere in the world. A former Russian deputy minister of defence has suggested the country could increase the upper age limit for conscription from 27 to 30 for this year’s spring draft campaign. Andrey Kartapolov, the head of the State Duma defence committee, suggested the change could take place without altering the lower bar for conscription of 18 years. A US navy veteran has been released after almost a year in Russian detention, according to his family. Taylor Dudley, 35, of Michigan, was taken into custody by Russian border police last April after crossing the border from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. A Ukrainian soldier has had successful surgery to remove an unexploded grenade from his chest, senior officials in Kyiv have said. Surgeons removed the weapon from just beneath the heart of the injured serviceman, while two sappers ensured the operation was conducted safely, said Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence. Turkey has summoned Sweden’s ambassador over a protest in Stockholm in which a puppet of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was hung from its feet. Footage shared by pro-government Turkish media showed what they said were supporters of the Kurdish militant group PKK hanging an effigy of the Turkish leader at a demonstration outside Stockholm’s city hall. Sweden has been seeking Turkey’s approval of its Nato membership bid, which it applied for after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. Ankara has said Stockholm needs to clamp down on Kurdish groups it views as “terrorists”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-324-of-the-invasion;guardian;politics;3613
8152;8152;Zara Aleena: Law graduate's aunt calls probation failings around her killer 'extremely distressing';Tuesday 24 January 2023 10:47, UK;[];['zara aleena'];['graduates', 'failings', 'service', 'officers', 'calls', 'released', 'zara', 'prison', 'law', 'distressing', 'days', 'report', 'mcsweeney', 'aunt', 'probation', 'aleena', 'killer', 'extremely'];"The aunt of law graduate Zara Aleena - who was murdered on her way home after a night out - has called the findings of a report into the Probation Service ""extremely distressing"".

Farah Naz said it revealed ""a litany of errors"" in the lead up to her niece's death.

She told BBC Radio Four's Woman's Hour it's ""not a service that's doing its best with inadequate resources... This is a service that is incompetent and has the failures by people at the top to ensure a quality service.""

The report found failings by probation officers left sexual predator Jordan McSweeney able to stalk and kill Ms Aleena just days after he was released from prison.

The 29-year-old was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years for sexually assaulting and murdering the 35-year-old in Ilford, east London, on 26 June last year.

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab ordered a review of how probation staff had supervised McSweeney when it emerged he had been freed from prison on licence - where individuals are released from jail but still have a part of their sentence to serve in the community - nine days before the murder.

In the report, chief inspector of probation Justin Russell said: ""Jordan McSweeney should have been considered a high risk of serious harm offender. If he had, more urgent action would have been taken to recall him to prison, after he missed his supervision appointments on release from custody.

""The Probation Service failed to do so, and he was free to commit this most heinous crime on an innocent, young woman.""

In the nine days before the murder, McSweeney's licence had been revoked after he failed to attend any meetings with probation officers, but he had not been recalled to prison.

London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the probation failings are ""symptomatic of wider issues"" which ""must be addressed immediately"".

5627;5627;Antonio Mateu Lahoz plays his cards wrong to make history in Catalan derby | Sid Lowe;2023-01-02T18:19:57Z;['Sid Lowe'];['La Liga', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Referees', 'Barcelona', 'Espanyol'];;"Barcelona and Espanyol were a quarter of the way into their first game for more than 50 days, La Liga back at last, when the referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, was suddenly set off. Urgently heading across the pitch wearing a determined look, triggered by what he heard or perhaps remembering something really important he had to do, he sprinted straight at Xavi Hernández, who was all in black and shouting. This was only ending one way. Pulling up pitchside, he grabbed Barça’s coach. And then he kissed him, whispering in his ear. “He said he was happy to see me,” Xavi revealed later. “And I said: ‘Me too.’” The Barcelona coach was speaking for everyone. Well, sort of. Turns out that the World Cup star who most marked the return of domestic football was the one who doesn’t actually play but doesn’t half perform, the Spaniard who was in Qatar longer than any other. Antonio Mateu Lahoz – Toño to his mates, which he likes to think is everyone – did it again. A record-breaker for clubs and countries, the man whose name has become a verb was mateulahozing once more this weekend. The celebrity referee who handed out 17 cards during the Argentina-Netherlands quarter-final came home and immediately went one better, and without the benefit of extra time or penalties. Two matches, 35 cards, two all-time highs, and some show to restart football in Spain. They had been waiting for this, if not this exactly. Talking about referees is not big, not clever and best avoided. Sometimes, though, it is inevitable – and not just in Spain where it’s inevitable every time – and this was one of those. However hard you resist, Mateu Lahoz made it so on Saturday, at turns absolutely infuriating and very, very funny as he made history in the Catalan derby, providing the kind of wild New Year’s Eve where even the numbers don’t add up and the referees’ report, which must have taken him to midnight to complete, certainly doesn’t. Maybe this photo helps: Mateu Lahoz standing there like some gunslinger, yellow card in one hand, red in the other. At his side, Espanyol’s Sergi Gómez just shrugs.
“Chaos,” Frenkie de Jong called it, having somehow survived two recent meetings with Mateu Lahoz without getting a card. “I don’t know what happened exactly but the referee decided to give some red cards, I don’t know why,” the midfielder said after a match which ended 1-1, Joselu’s second-half penalty equalising Marcos Alonso’s early opener. Some? Mateu Lahoz might have forgiven Xavi with a kiss the first time but he did give the coach a red card in the 96th minute and that took him to 19: 15 yellows and four reds, one rescinded. No one has ever handed out more, his own record falling to the only man it could fall to, like the Sergey Bubka of referees. In a single afternoon, he handed out as many reds as all of the officials in Qatar put together, and one more yellow than he managed at Lusail. Which wouldn’t have surprised everyone: after that quarter-final, when most in Spain were just pleased that everyone else finally knew what they were up against, Lionel Messi admitted that Argentina’s players had been “scared because we know what he is like”.
What he’s like has often been exaggerated and has also changed. In a country where every referee is a suspect, always under attack, and the cynicism and bias comes invariably not from the judged but the judges; where the officials are handed a responsibility for results they simply don’t have, some of the criticism of him is grotesque: as unfair as it is facile, the tone terrifying. Born in Valencia, where he is a PE teacher, Mateu Lahoz is one of six siblings, a father of two sons, a footballer who reached Segunda B level, and became a referee partly because his father passed away and the family needed the money. He first went mainstream a decade ago when José Mourinho praised him as the only man to let the game go, employing dialogue and not just discipline. Soon though, the things he did well were held against him: talking to players, calling them by their first names instead of by surname or a number became a stick to beat him with. Chatting was a crime, smiling a disgrace. Who does he think he is?! He’s always trying to get on camera, they claimed as they turned their cameras on him, following every move, magnifying every gesture. A smile, a thumbs-up, a conversation with a player or fan, a wink to the camera or a wave to someone in the stands was proof that he should not be there. The people who accused him of thinking he is a celebrity made a celebrity of him; he’s a showman, they said, editing his showreel. He became a dog with a bad name, like Rex or Spot, an all to easily easily identified public enemy – as if you become Spain’s representative at the World Cup, or take charge of a Champions League final if you’re irremediably awful, as if any decisions ever happen entirely in isolation.
And yet it is also true that him getting those games baffles many here and he does have his moments; true too that he sometimes seems to follow his own rules, that he’s not always easy to work out, that occasionally the discipline seems disproportionate or just daft. Or other times, nonexistent. It was certainly true that sometimes players found him disconcerting, hard to predict; not least because he wasn’t always what he was supposed to be, the referee who opened dialogue suddenly deciding to shut all the doors, the chatty man turning all authoritarian. “You can’t talk to him,” Messi said of the referee who talked to them. A little before the World Cup break, in the last minute of one match, he gave Betis’s Sergio Canales – just about the most polite player in La Liga – two yellow cards in 13 seconds. The first was for “making observations” and, after showing it, he warned Canales: “If you keep talking, I’ll send you off.” To which Canales replied: “If I can’t talk, don’t ask me about personal things, then,” … and was sent off. Now, less than 24 hours after Xavi had said: “I like him, he talks,” he was at it again. La Liga had never seen anything like it.
It had started early, Ansu Fati booked for using his arm – the only one of Barcelona’s eight yellow cards to be given for a foul – before Gavi and Brian Oliván were booked for “arguing with an opponent, without insults or threats”. But the golden minutes were the five or 10 that followed Espanyol’s penalty, when suddenly he was dishing out the cards like a croupier on crack. At around 73.50, Jordi Alba and Viní de Souza were booked. On 74.58, Ferran Torres was. On 75.30, it was Pedri. On 76.13, Edu Exposito. On 76.56, Alba again, a red following, discussions starting. On 79.34, Souza got a yellow and Leandro Cabrera a red – which was taken off again on 84.29, via the VAR. In case you’ve lost track like everyone else, that’s eight yellows, two reds, one taken away again, in five minutes 44 seconds (10 minutes, 39 seconds if you count the wait for the red to be removed), and 31 seconds of actual play. Or to use the referee’s own report, there were yellow cards in minutes 74, 74, 74, 75, 76, 78, 80, 81, and reds in minutes 78 and 80. Six minutes for 10 cards. “I told him he lost control,” Xavi said. “He said: ‘Do you think?’” Those numbers suggest a mass brawl, but there was none. A game out of control, but it was not the game that was out of control: it was a referee who didn’t so much manage the situation badly as create it.
The stats suggest confrontations, bone-crushing challenges, but there were few. Of the yellow cards handed out, only five were for fouls, yet by the referee’s own admission there were no insults or accusations. “I’m aware that sometimes I protest too much, but that wasn’t the case this time,” Alba insisted. When Mateu Lahoz booked Torres, his gaze was fixed, waiting for the Barcelona player to say something, the card out lightning fast. When he told Cabrera he had not been sent off after all, instead of contrition there was a defiant look. Of the 10 minutes and three seconds of injury time, less than five minutes was played, Mateu Lahoz seeming determined to have as many unnecessary conversations as he could. Like the VAR, it’s not the decisions themselves that’s the issue – it’s what is done to the actual game.
Which is not always a bad thing. Because if there’s a serious point here, there is also a silly one. It may be childish to laugh but it’s also true. Worse is the way referees are attacked, there to be abused and discarded by those without the moral authority to stand in judgement, a useful scapegoat. In the final minutes, TV commentators were talking about how this was the definition of a derby but it wasn’t the derby that made this dramatic, different: it was him. One Catalan paper insisted Mateu Lahoz had “ruined the spectacle”, but that wasn’t true: he is the spectacle. “Every party needs someone to get it going,” Santi Giménez wrote in AS, “and Mateu Lahoz was a dancefloor-filler like Chimo Bayo, capable of turning the dullest meeting into the most memorable piss-up.” In the end, history was made and maybe it was more fun this way; and if there were many things that were Mateu Lahoz’s fault, the lack of football wasn’t one of them. Nor was the result. “I don’t blame Mateu,” said Xavi, the man he had come over to kiss at the start and sent off at the end.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/antonio-mateu-lahoz-plays-cards-wrong-catalan-derby-referee-barcelona-espanyol-la-liga;guardian;sports;5627
1081;1081;Jacob Rees-Mogg to host own chatshow on GB News;2023-01-26T15:12:28Z;['Alexi Duggins'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'GB News'];;The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has joined the rightwing TV channel GB News as a presenter. The former cabinet minister will host his own chatshow, which will tour the country to record in front of live audiences. His show will “debate the hot topics of the day” and feature guests from “across the political spectrum”, according to the broadcaster. There has been no suggestion that Rees-Mogg will resign from parliament to pursue his new career. He is the latest signing to the controversy-prone channel, whose presenters include Nigel Farage, Eamonn Holmes and Mark Steyn, whose show has repeatedly raised doubts about the safety of Covid vaccination. Ofcom has opened two investigations into Steyn‘s programme. “GB News is a bastion of free speech, which clearly has its finger uniquely on the pulse of public opinion and does not talk down to its viewers and listeners,” said Rees-Mogg. “I have been impressed by the channel’s independent-mindedness and its determination to talk to people with many different perspectives, which is exactly what I will do on my programme.” Rees-Mogg was the minister for Brexit opportunities between February and September last year, before being promoted to business secretary. He resigned from the cabinet seven weeks later. “Jacob is an authentic and authoritative voice of the Tory backbenches, with his trademark common sense, refreshing directness and an impish sense of fun,” said the channel’s editorial director, Mick Booker. “The programme will embrace a range of guests and viewpoints from all sides of politics but will also explore some of Jacob’s other wide-ranging interests. No doubt classic cars and good Somerset cider will feature at some point.” GB News was set up in June 2021, with the former BBC and Sunday Times journalist Andrew Neil as its chairman and the host of a short-lived primetime show. Neil stepped down that September, saying he had become “a minority of one” within the management.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/26/jacob-rees-mogg-to-host-own-chatshow-on-gb-news;guardian;entertainment & culture;1081
5131;5131;My partner and I love to travel, but he dismisses my ideas. How can we work together? | Leading questions;2023-01-05T14:00:24Z;['Eleanor Gordon-Smith'];['Life and style', 'Relationships', 'Travel'];;"My partner and I love to travel. We had both travelled extensively before meeting each other and are excited to do it together forever. My problem is this: he thinks his way of doing research and booking hotels/experiences is the only legitimate way to do it. Usually, to avoid an argument, I go with the flow and allow him to make all the plans and arrangements. To be fair, he does ask my opinion, however, if I suggest something different he generally poo-poos it. We are struggling now because I’m starting to feel marginalised and dismissed. He wants to be in charge but also complains that he “has to do all the planning”. How do you think we can resolve this and work together on planning without resenting how the other one does their “research”? ~ Eleanor says: For some people, knowing more than others is a way of demonstrating superiority. This is a weird phenomenon, because whether you know more than others or are right about what you think you know is frequently a matter of luck. All the same, for some people, knowing the Right way to do things can become a real point of pride. It can seem (to them) to demonstrate good things about them; they’re tasteful, shrewd, conscientious.
And in fact they can be right – it can be a blessing to have someone in the household who makes sure you won’t get swindled by a tour company or book something that looks better than it is. The hazard is when Knowing Lots turns into Knowing Best; when knowledge isn’t something you’re excited to share and grow together, but something one of you has and the other doesn’t. Knowledge can start to feel zero-sum in the relationship, like the possibility that you have some necessarily implies that he has less. It seems to me the challenge is to wrest back the idea that planning and organising is something you both could share. How can you make this collaborative again? One thing to get clear on is if this is genuinely a matter of not liking your “research” or if he just doesn’t want to do what you want to do. If you love group tours and he hates them, or one of you loves restaurants and the other street food, there’s no need to pretend that’s a planning problem or even that someone must be getting it wrong. You can just make time for different activities on your holidays. There’s only so much that two separate individuals can be expected to converge on indefinitely: it might be healthy (and fun!) to do separate things some days. That way you don’t always have to be jointly planning joint activities, and when you enjoy your own side mission, that might be unavoidable proof to him that you can plan after all. Another strategy might be to tell a lot of stories from your time travelling alone. How did you solve problems, foresee complications, have a good time even when it went wrong? It’s perilously easy for people to project an image on to you and then start seeing it as though it were real: you can remind him you were planning a lot on your own before he started thinking you couldn’t. Worst comes to worst, if you want someone to know something, there’s always the option of telling him: you can say, “I’ve actually travelled a lot and it makes me feel minimised when you think I just don’t know how to plan things. Can you tell me what you think I don’t get right?” If he’s a good enough sport, you might even be able to make some fun of it – have one day that you plan by yourself, laugh at how wrong (by his standards) it could possibly go. It’s an unpleasant feeling to spend your finite holiday time and money in a way that disappoints. But you know that, too. You’ll both be resentful if planning and knowing start to feel like skills only one of you has. You each need to be committed to proving that idea wrong. *** Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

7459;7459;Education secretary criticises teaching union for voting to strike;Tuesday 17 January 2023 08:22, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['strikes'];['eligible', 'need', 'union', 'wales', 'england', 'children', 'members', 'secretary', 'education', 'strike', 'criticises', 'voting', 'teaching', 'teachers'];"The education secretary has criticised a teaching union for planning to go on strike, telling Sky News: ""Our children don't deserve it.""

Speaking to Kay Burley, Gillian Keegan said she was ""very disappointed"" after members of the National Education Union voted in favour of industrial action, with thousands of staff set to walkout next month over pay and workloads.

But she pledged to work with the group and be ""as constructive as possible"", adding: ""You don't need to strike to get my attention.""

Politics live: Education secretary speaks to Sky News after thousands of teachers vote to strike

The NEU has declared seven days of walkouts in February and March, with more than 23,000 schools in England and Wales expected to be affected.

Nine out of 10 teacher members of the union voted for the action and the union passed the 50% ballot turnout required by law to stage the walkout.

However, headteachers in England will not stage walkouts after the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) union ballot turnout failed to meet the legal threshold.

The NEU said its vote showed teachers were not prepared to ""stand by"" and see the education service ""sacrificed"" due to ""a toxic mix of low pay and excessive workload"".

Ms Keegan said she had met with the union to try and avert the strikes, and they had ""wider discussions"" about the challenges teachers faced - including workload.

But she admitted she didn't negotiate on pay during the meeting, saying the focus needed to be on ""more flexibility, job shares [and] being able to do part time [roles]"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:31 Mary Bousted says the government has known that strike action was being considered by teachers for months.

The education secretary added: ""Teachers are doing a brilliant job... but we need children in school now.

""I'm disappointed that one union that has decided to go on strike. Our children don't deserve it, to be honest. We do need to keep teachers and children in school.

""And I will work with you. You don't need to strike to get my attention. I will meet with people. I'll be as constructive as possible.

""But we do need to be fair. And the number one thing we need to do is tackle inflation.""

Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell accused the government of ""inflaming"" the situation with unions - the last thing she believes will lead to strikes being called off.

""Teachers are crying out for conversation,"" she told Sky News. ""They're crying out to be heard. They need supporting.

Pointing to COVID lockdowns, she added: ""No one wants to see strikes happening, but I think we also learnt the value that teachers bring and that how many of us can't step in and become teachers to children overnight.

""The only way that that industrial action and these kind of disputes gets resolved is when everybody gets round the table and finds a way, a way forward to it.""

Ms Keegan confirmed there would be another meeting with the union on Friday to go through the pay offer on the table ""line by line"".

Anti-strike bill

Just hours after the teachers announced their industrial action, a controversial anti-strike bill moved closer to becoming law.

The government's draft Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill would restrict the right to strike by imposing minimum service levels and bosses would be legally able to fire employees who ignore a ""work notice"" ordering them to work on days of industrial action.

Despite opposition parties condemning the plan, it passed its second reading in parliament by 309 votes to 249 - a majority of 60.

The full list of proposed strike days from the NEU are as follows:

• Wednesday 1 February: all eligible members in England and Wales

• Tuesday 14 February: all eligible members in England and Wales

• Tuesday 28 February: all eligible members in the Northern, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber regions

• Wednesday 1 March: all eligible members in the East Midlands, West Midlands, and Eastern regions

• Thursday 2 March: all eligible members in London, South East and South West regions

• Wednesday 15 March: all eligible members in England and Wales

This means that from the point of view of Earth, Mercury will be the furthest it can possibly be from the sun. For many around the world, especially the southern hemisphere, this means it will be at its easiest to pick out from the early-morning twilight sky. The chart shows the view looking east from Cape Town, South Africa, at 05.20 SAST. Mercury is located in the constellation of Sagittarius, the archer. Even though it is a small planet, Mercury will appear bright because it is so close to the sun. The nearest bright star will be blood-red Antares in Scorpius, the scorpion. Unfortunately, from the UK and other similar northern latitudes, it will prove a much more challenging observation to make. This is because the ecliptic plane, where the planets are located, makes a shallow angle with the horizon at this time of year. So, although Mercury is widely separated from the sun, they rise at a similar time. In the southern hemisphere, the ecliptic makes a steeper angle to the horizon and so Mercury climbs higher into the sky before the sun appears. In the UK we will have to wait until March and April for a better view of the planet.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/23/starwatch-mercury-up-before-the-sun-but-only-in-the-southern-hemisphere;guardian;science & technology;1851

Ezra (Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the film with director Kenya Barris), a Jewish investment banker, meets Black costume designer Amira (Lauren London) by chance – he mistakes her for his Uber driver. But from this inauspicious encounter, romance blossoms. Soon enough, they meet each other’s parents. Ezra’s mother and father (Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Duchovny) tie themselves in mortifying knots to prove their liberal credentials. When Arnold (Duchovny) drops the name of rapper Xzibit into the conversation, it sounds suspiciously as though this is the only Black person he can think of. Meanwhile, Amira’s parents, particularly her father, Akbar (Eddie Murphy), are openly hostile to their daughter’s fiance. The first third of the picture is promising, if frequently excruciating.

1317;1317;Unusual sightings of ‘devil bird’ across Melbourne raise migration mysteries for researchers;2023-01-25T14:00:23Z;['Henry Belot'];['Birds', 'Environment', 'Animals', 'Wildlife', 'Australia news'];;"Climate change may be one reason why the so-called devil bird – known for its incessant late-night mating call – has become more common in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, according to researchers. The koel, a migratory bird, usually arrives in Australia from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia to breed from late September to early October, when the male will sing his advertising call day and night to attract a female. Jacinta Humphrey, who researches urban bird communities at La Trobe University, said koels were almost never seen in Melbourne until recently and were more common in New South Wales and Queensland.
“They used to be super rare in Melbourne, but now a lot of people report hearing them and they are hard to miss with their incessant calls throughout the night,” Humphrey said. “There hasn’t been a lot of research into why this is happening, but the general idea is that climate change may be involved.” Birdlife Australia’s public affairs manager, Sean Dooley, said there was no doubt koels were becoming much more common in Melbourne. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “I remember heading up to Fairfield Park by the Yarra River in 2000 to twitch what was about the sixth koel sighting on record in Victoria,” Dooley said. “That bird was perhaps the vanguard, as the records have really increased since then. Our Birdata monitoring website now has 750 records of the koel in Victoria.” Dooley said there were 121 recorded sightings of koels in 2022, according to Birdlife Australia’s latest annual bird count.
“This doesn’t necessarily mean there were 121 birds in the state, as their call is so loud that multiple counters may have heard the same bird,” he said. Michael Clarke, an emeritus professor in zoology at La Trobe University, has been conducting bird surveys at Victoria’s most southerly point, Wilsons Promontory, for 17 years. He says koels, which are a cuckoo species, leave their eggs in the nests of other birds to feed them. “In 2017 we got the first record of [koels] down there. There’s been another sighting this year … and that was noteworthy because the host, the red wattlebird, was noticeably abundant in my surveys,” Clarke said. “The number of sightings are going up and they are being detected more than they were in the past,” he said. “They are clearly exploring territory that we have never seen before and what’s driving that is really puzzling. “It may be a response to climate change, with places that were previously inhospitable to them now tolerable. “The red wattle birds at Wilsons Promontory need to be alert to a parasitic species that will deposit an egg into their nest or sometimes raid it.”
Humphrey and Clarke both said more research was needed to understand why koel migration routes were changing. “They are a bird that is used to warmer temperatures and as things are slowly warming up in the southern parts of the country, they’re deciding that this habitat is suitable and they’ll keep travelling south where there are more resources,” Humphrey said. Dooley said there may be other factors at play too, like an increase in food in Melbourne suburbs and an abundance of host species, like wattlebirds. “It’s definitely not due to birds moving our of their core natural range, as there has been an increase in numbers in Queensland and New South Wales,” he said. “There are a whole suite of east-coast rainforest birds like koels that are spreading south and west into Victoria. Most are fruit eaters, but not all.” • This article was amended on 27 January 2023 to correct the bird name in the headline and replace the photo.

2582;2582;Dr Martens blames ‘unseasonably warm weather’ amid latest profit warning;2023-01-19T09:09:28Z;['Sarah Butler'];['Dr Martens', 'Profit warnings', 'Industrial action', 'UK news', 'Business', 'UK weather', 'Supply chain crisis', 'Staff shortages'];;Dr Martens has warned that “unseasonably warm weather” and problems at a US warehouse hit sales in the run-up to Christmas forcing the company to issue its second profit warning in two months. The British bootmaker said it now expected to make underlying full-year profits of no more than £260m, £26m less than previously expected as it had been forced to open temporary warehouses in the US after becoming overwhelmed with stock, partly because deliveries had arrived more quickly than expected. Dr Martens said it forecast up to £11m in additional supply chain costs to fix the bottlenecks and could lose up to £25m of wholesale sales as a result of the hold-ups in LA. The firm said warmer than usual weather in October and November also hit sales. The company, based in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, expects the problems in the US and “a more uncertain economic environment” to hit the coming year’s sales as well. Dr Martens shares plunged by as much as 25% to 156p in morning trading on Thursday. The warning came just two months after Dr Martens told the City that its profit margins would be lower than expected amid higher costs and delays to £10m of sales because of strikes at the port in Felixstowe and staff shortages at its distribution centre in the Netherlands. The company is also putting the price of its main boots up by 6% this year because of rising material and manufacturing costs. Kenny Wilson, the chief executive, said “demand for Dr Martens remained resilient through challenging conditions during our peak trading period” but admitted profits would be lower than hoped because of “a combination of significant operational issues creating a bottleneck at our new LA distribution centre and weaker than anticipated US [direct to consumer] trading, in part due to unseasonably warm weather”. The warning came despite strong trading in Europe where sales rose 8% in the three months to 31 December, as sales accelerated in the final weeks before Christmas once the cold snap hit. However, overall sales growth slipped to just 3% in constant currency, down from 11% in the previous quarter, as sales in the US rose just 1%, once the effect of currency exchange rates was stripped out, as a result of a warm autumn and the US warehouse problems. Sales in Asia were down 4% with trading in China hit by Covid disruption.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/19/dr-martens-blames-unseasonably-warm-weather-amid-latest-profit-warning;guardian;business & economy;2582

4552;4552;Biden visits border for first time as critics condemn his migrant crackdown;2023-01-08T20:54:45Z;['Alexandra Villarreal'];['US-Mexico border', 'US immigration', 'US news', 'US politics'];;"Joe Biden on Sunday landed in Texas to visit the US-Mexico border for the first time in his nearly two years as president, even as lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates have widely condemned his administration’s hardline response to the deepening humanitarian emergency there. Biden, who is due in Mexico City this week for an international summit, made a brief stop in El Paso, a recent “ground zero” for the consequences of a US immigration system he has readily acknowledged is deeply broken.
The reliably Democratic border city in blood-red Texas has been struggling for months to triage thousands of stranded migrants and asylum seekers, many of whom have had little choice but to sleep on the streets in cold, rain, and squalor. Biden greeted local politicians at the airport, including Texas’s rightwing Republican governor Greg Abbott, who has courted controversy with his stringent border policies, including bussing migrants to Democratic cities in the north-east. Abbott handed Biden a letter that read in part: “Your visit to our southern border with Mexico today is $20bn too little, and two years too late.” Biden then later traveled to the Bridge of the Americas border crossing, where northbound cars lined up to cross into El Paso from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Wearing a suit and his trademark sunglasses, Biden chatted to local law enforcement officers and watched demonstrations of bordering policing, including by a dog unit searching a car for contrabrand food items. Biden, accompanied by several members of border patrol, also visited a migrant welcome center and a stretch of the border wall that runs between El Paso and Juárez. The meetings took place with no press present, aside from those watching at a distance. Biden answered a brief shouted question by promising more help for the border situation. “They need a lot of resources. We’re going to get it for them,” he said. Biden’s first trip to the border since becoming president follows a record-breaking fiscal year of roughly 2.4 million migrant encounters there, amid mass forced displacement because of regional instability, growing wealth disparities, climate disaster, and targeted persecution in various countries throughout the hemisphere. It also comes mere days after the administration announced new changes to federal migration-related policies, which engendered immediate and intense backlash from pro-immigrant organizations and progressive members of Biden’s own party. “For once, just once, I’d like to see this administration make the moral argument to the rest of the country that we need to put in place an effective, humane, accessible, welcoming, and compassionate system of protection at the border,” said Dylan Corbett, executive director of El Paso’s Hope Border Institute. Instead, Corbett excoriated the administration’s new approach as an entrenchment of “dangerous, ineffective, and inhumane policy” and equated the strategy to “a broken promise”.
These latest policy developments, announced on Thursday, include an even more severe crackdown at the US-Mexico border through the increased use of expedited removal, where migrants are rapidly deported without ever seeing a judge. They also expand a highly criticized Trump-era practice that allows border authorities to quickly expel migrants and would-be asylum seekers to Mexico or elsewhere, without even the chance to ask for asylum. This controversial measure – which began amid the pandemic as an invocation of public health law but has warped into a cynical immigration tool – will now be deployed to target Nicaraguans, Haitians and Cubans for expulsion to Mexico, after a similar move against Venezuelans in October was followed by a significant drop in the number of people from there arriving at the US-Mexico border. The Biden administration coupled these heightened deterrence mechanisms, in part, with an announcement of more legal pathways for at least temporary admittance to the US for a limited number of Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans who can afford to bankroll their own commercial travel, own an unexpired passport, and have someone stateside who is willing to sponsor their application, alongside other requirements. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the administration’s recent moves to reporters traveling with Biden. “What we’re trying to do is broadly incentivize, safe and orderly way, and cut out the smuggling organizations. So what what we’re trying to have is to incentivize them to come to the ports of entry instead of in between the points of entry,” he said. But critics have pointed out that few of the most vulnerable forcibly displaced people within the hemisphere can actually furnish the wealth, resources and connections to meet such narrow criteria. Detractors also expressed alarm and disdain over news that the Biden administration would be advancing a new rule to further restrict asylum eligibility, drawing comparisons between the Democratic president and his right-wing predecessor. “This week’s policy announcements are completely out of touch with the actual circumstances of people seeking asylum, many of whom arrive at our border fleeing imminent threats to their lives,” said Melissa Crow, director of litigation at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies. “It has been deeply disturbing to hear the president affirm that seeking asylum is legal, pledge to create a safe and humane process at the border, and then turn around and announce policies that further undermine access to the US asylum process.” The implications of Biden’s border strategies to date have already been deeply felt in El Paso, where vulnerable Venezuelans and other nationalities scared of being expelled back to Mexico have started evading US authorities and been consequently denied access to some of the city’s shelters. Huge crowds of migrants have been languishing on the streets in downtown El Paso and outside of the city’s Sacred Heart church for weeks. Desperate mothers have had to worry about their babies potentially freezing to death when temperatures drop. Some of these people have felt stranded, afraid that if they try to leave the city they will run into immigration enforcement at a checkpoint and end up detained or expelled. Others never even had the chance to take that risk, after immigration officials rounded up and detained scores of them in the last few days. In chaotic footage obtained by NBC News, local police and border agents inundated the streets around Sacred Heart Church’s shelter Tuesday night, sirens blazing, as they apprehended what a witness estimated to be between 100 and 150 people. Experts warned the operation – so close to a place of worship – may have in fact violated the Department of Homeland Security’s own guidance, NBC News reported. A similar action in the city’s downtown cleared out migrants who had been staying near a local bus terminal on Wednesday night, according to media organization El Paso Matters. “The cynic in me contemplates the possibility that this was a cleanup action intended to showcase El Paso in a particular light and the president’s enforcement actions in a particular light,” Lisa Graybill, vice-president of law and policy at the National Immigration Law Center, told NBC News. Yet for Isabel Salcido, a city representative for El Paso, Biden’s trip was more about him finally bearing witness. “This crisis is not going away,” Salcido said. “We desperately need the help and leadership of Congress and the White House.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/biden-us-mexico-visit-border;guardian;politics;4552
5330;5330;Flutes, synths, a human voice – how should electric vehicles sound?;2023-01-04T14:00:03Z;['Jordyn Beazley'];['Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Transport', 'Australia news', 'Motoring', 'Environment', 'Travel and transport', 'Technology', 'Cities', 'Music'];;"Take a walk down any busy street and the noise can hit like a speaker accidentally left on full volume. The growls of engines accelerating when the traffic light turns green, motorbikes vying for position in the traffic, buses whizzing past and the odd rev-head all compete to be heard. The sound generated by the internal combustion engine has shaped urban life for a century but that is gradually going to change: by 2050, 90% of cars in Australia will be electric. Australia is developing noise standards for electric cars that may follow similar rules set by the UN or US, industry experts say. But what exactly an electric car, and ultimately our cities, will sound like is under the creative control of carmakers. And each is doing something different.
When an electric car travels above 30km/h, it sounds much the same as a petrol-driven vehicle, as the noise is emitted from the tyres vibrating against the road rather than the engine, says Lex Brown, an urban sounds expert at Griffith University. But below that speed, it becomes barely audible. This spells danger for pedestrians, particularly people who are vision impaired. One survey by Vision Australia and Monash University found 35% of respondents who were blind or had low vision had experienced a collision or near-collision with a hybrid or electric car. So, if noise is to be added artificially, what should an EV sound like? ‘Like something out of Star Wars’ Ashley Sanders, the technical director at the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, says Australia is likely to mirror Europe’s UN regulation or follow similar rules to the US. Both require electric cars to emit a sound – amplified by exterior speakers – that changes in frequency according to speed. But while carmakers say safety is the main objective of creating an EV noise, it’s also an opportunity to shed the confines of engine sounds and come up with a whole new sonic character. What each manufacturer thinks that sound should be varies wildly.
Some are employing the most accomplished musical minds in the world to create it. BMW hired Hans Zimmer to help score their electric car sound, the inspiration for one model supposedly starting with a chord from a Beatles song. Jaguar has employed the US electronic musician Richard Devine, and Volkswagen hired Leslie Mándoki, a Hungarian-German drummer and music producer. When the musician and sound designer Danielle Venne, of Made Music Studio, was asked to lead the design on the acceleration sound of the Nissan Leaf, she experimented with layering samples of woodwind instruments, flutes, clarinets and synthesisers. “It ends up feeling like something out of Star Wars,” Venne says. Fiat was the first to sample a human voice in the sound of its electric car, which has been overlaid with a chord from Nino Rota’s soundtrack for the 1973 movie Amarcord – the end result sounds as though you are sitting at a theatre and the curtain has just been raised on a show. Sound designers at Renault took inspiration from sci-fi films, creating a sound for the Zoe model that has been compared to being chased by a heavenly choir of angels.
General Motors sampled a didgeridoo for its Cadillac Lyriq, while the base of the sound design for one Audi model started with some plastic tubes that in-house sound designer Rudolph Halbmeir found in his garden. “I took one of these tubes … and I bumped on it with my hand and it made a boom and I thought, well this sounds interesting,” Halbmeir says. He then placed the tube against an electric fan and recorded it. Some carmakers, such as Hyundai, are experimenting with recreating the sound of the petrol car. “You can rev it … and it even vibrates as well,” says Tim Rodgers, product development manager at Hyundai Australia. “So it feels like an internal combustion engine, for lack of a better term, but it’s an EV.” Also being considered is whether drivers should be able to choose the sound their cars make. Yuri Suzuki, a sound designer who has consulted for a number of carmakers, imagines drivers being able to select from a template instruments that have the same pitch, so as not to create a nuisance. But some initiatives have proved controversial. Tesla’s Boombox feature allowed drivers to play preset or custom sounds, resulting in choices such as fart noises or bleating goats that obscured its standard pedestrian alert system. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found it violated safety standards and 579,000 cars were recalled as a result. Elon Musk blamed the recall on the “fun police”. The US has since banned customisable sounds but it is not yet clear whether Australia will follow. The infrastructure department says no decisions have yet been made, and draft regulation will be released for consultation next year. Tyranny of dissonance The thought of disparate sounds overlaying one another as more and more electric cars take to the streets has left some concerned it will lead to a new kind of urban cacophony. Chris Edwards, director of government relations and advocacy at Vision Australia, which has campaigned for electric car noise standards, says he isn’t worried by carmakers choosing different sounds, as long as they clearly identify the source of the noise as a vehicle, and don’t aggravate the broader community. But sound designer Connor Moore, who has worked for a number of different car brands, says making a signature sound for each brand could create an environment that is dissonant and out of tune. “All of these brands are living in their own isolation and creating their own individual sounds, most of which are tonal,” he says. “But they’re not taking into consideration the harmonious aspect … what the soundscape will really sound like when all of those sounds come together.”
Moore thinks regulation on car sounds should go a step further, and may well do so in the next five to 10 years. “We could have in regulation that these things can’t be so tonal. To me that’s an easy fix. So it becomes less of a branded experience and more of a functional experience.” Suzuki, who shares Moore’s concerns, says a way should be found to make the sound of electric cars harmonise. “In an ideal world we’d be calculating the sound design based on psychoacoustic research,” he says, referring to the science of how humans perceive sound.
Regardless of the sound choice, experts agree urban life will be quieter once electric cars are the predominant mode of transport. “The amount of sound electric vehicles will make will pale in comparison to internal combustion engines,” Venne says. “We’re talking about a scenario where you might be in a quiet environment with no other sounds but electric cars going under 30km/h. Put me there, please. That sounds like a delightful environment to live in.” Edwards, who navigates the outside world with a seeing eye dog, says a quieter urban soundscape may amplify sounds that can’t compete with raucous engines. “When you’re blind, you are appreciating the world through your other senses – whether that’s sound or feel or smell,” he says. “If I walk through a park and hear the birds, and have that peace rather than hearing a nearby busy road, it’s going to be a much more pleasant environment.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/05/flutes-synths-a-human-voice-how-should-electric-vehicles-sound;guardian;science & technology;5330
5060;5060;Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow’s retirement sets up fierce 2024 Senate contest;2023-01-05T18:55:45Z;['Lauren Gambino'];['US politics', 'US news', 'Michigan', 'Democrats', 'US Congress', 'US Senate'];;"Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, a member of the Democratic leadership, announced on Thursday that she would not seek re-election in 2024, setting the stage for a fierce contest to claim an open seat in a critical midwestern battleground state.
Stabenow, 72, is the first Senate Democrat to announce her retirement ahead of 2024, when the party will try to defend its razor-thin majority by fending off challenges to incumbents in several states that former president Donald Trump won. But Democrats delivered a strong performance in Michigan last year and expressed confidence that the seat would remain in the party’s control. “Inspired by a new generation of leaders, I have decided to pass the torch in the US Senate,” Stabenow said in a statement on Thursday. “I am announcing today that I will not seek re-election and will leave the US Senate at the end of my term on 3 January 2025. “Under the cloud of unprecedented threats to our democracy and our basic freedoms, a record-breaking number of people voted last year in Michigan. Young people showed up like never before. This was a very hopeful sign for our future,” she said. Stabenow’s decision not to seek a fifth term after serving two decades in the chamber immediately turned the race for Michigan’s open Senate seat into one of the most competitive in the nation. Republicans welcomed the development as a sign that Democrats’ hopes of maintaining their one-seat majority were already fading. “We are going to aggressively target this seat in 2024,” said Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans. “This could be the first of many Senate Democrats who decide to retire rather than lose.” Senate Democrats face a punishing electoral map next year. They are defending nearly a quarter of the seats in the Senate, many of them in competitive states as well as in red states like Ohio, Montana and West Virginia. By contrast, no Senate Republican faces re-election in a state Joe Biden won. But their prospects have improved in Michigan since Trump won the state in 2016. Biden won the state in 2020. And two years later, fury over efforts to ban abortion in Michigan in the wake of the supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade propelled Democrats to victory up and down the ballot in the state. In a statement, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer praised Stabenow as the embodiment of the “true Michigan spirit” and thanked her for her years of service in Congress and her leadership within the caucus. “With Debbie’s help, and the strong Michigan Democratic party she helped build, Debbie and I are confident Democrats will retain the seat,” he said. Speculation began to swirl about who Democrats might nominate to replace Stabenow. Attention immediately turned to Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin who clinched a decisive victory in November in one of the most competitive House races that cycle. Other possible contenders included congresswoman Haley Stevens, transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who recently moved to Michigan to be closer to his husband’s family. In a statement, Buttigieg called Stabenow a “force in the Senate” but said he was “not seeking any other job”. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, who resoundingly won re-election in November, praised Stabenow as a “champion for Michigan” while indicating that she was not interested in running for the seat. “As governor of this great state for the next four years, I look forward to working with [Stabenow] through the end of her term and beyond in however she serves our state next,” Whitmer said in a statement, emphasizing her plans to serve a full four-year term. Other Michigan officials whose names have been raised include Lt governor Garlin Gilchrist, secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, attorney general Dana Nessel as well as state senator Mallory McMorrow, who drew interest after a forceful rejoinder to Republican accusations that Democrats want to “groom” children went viral. Stabenow first joined Congress in 1996 after serving in the Michigan state legislature. In 2000, she became the first woman to represent Michigan in the US Senate. Stabenow climbed through the ranks, becoming a member of Democratic leadership and chair of the agriculture committee. In 2018, she turned back a well-funded and closely-watched challenge from Republican John James, who is seen as a rising star on the right.
James was elected to the House in November and is considered a potential contender for the Republican Senate nomination. Other possible Republican candidates are former congressman Peter Meijer, a relative moderate who lost his seat last year as well as Tudor Dixon, a Trump loyalist who was defeated by Whitmer in the race for governor. In her statement, Stabenow reflected on the progress Michigan women had made in politics since she first ran for office in 1974, at the age of 24. “This began years of breaking barriers, blazing trails and being the ‘first’ woman to reach historic milestones as an elected official,” she said, adding: “But I have always believed it’s not enough to be the ‘first’ unless there is a ‘second’ and a ‘third’...”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/05/debbie-stabenow-retirement-michigan-open-seat-2024-election;guardian;politics;5060

2651;2651;Mental health racial bias in England and Wales is ‘inexcusable’, says report;2023-01-19T00:01:12Z;['Haroon Siddique'];['Mental health', 'Race', 'UK news', 'Health', 'Society', 'Law', 'World news'];;Ministers must use legislation to address an “unacceptable and inexcusable” failure to address racial disparity in the use of the Mental Health Act, MPs and peers have said. The joint committee on the draft mental health bill says the bill does not go far enough to tackle failures that were identified in a landmark independent review five years ago, but which still persist and may even be getting worse. Black people are four times more likely than white people to be detained under the Mental Health Act (MHA), and more than 11 times more likely – up from eight times higher in 2018 – to be given a community treatment order (CTO) in England, according to NHS statistics for 2021-22. Some minorities are also more likely to spend longer in detention, experience multiple detentions, and be detained through contact with emergency departments or the criminal justice system. The committee says the landmark 2018 review of the MHA by Prof Simon Wessely – which the bill is a response to – was intended to address racial and ethnic inequalities, but that those problems have not improved since then “and, on some key metrics, are getting rapidly worse”. Lady Buscombe, the committee chair, said: “We believe stronger measures are needed to bring about change, in particular to tackle racial disparity in the use of the MHA. The failure to date is unacceptable and inexcusable. “The government should strengthen its proposal on advanced choice and give patients a statutory right to request an advance choice document setting out their preferences for future care and treatment, thereby strengthening both patient choice and their voice.” The report, published on Thursday, says that because CTOs represent “the starkest racial disparity in use of the act”, and due to evidence of their overuse as an alternative to discharge and doubts about their effectiveness, the orders should be abolished for most people. The proposed exceptions are for those involved in criminal proceedings or under sentence, where their continued use should be reviewed. Other key recommendations include explicitly including a requirement to respect racial equality in the bill, and mandating that health organisations appoint a responsible person to collect and monitor data on detentions under the MHA, broken down by ethnicity. These should feed into annual figures published by the government and policies that reduce inequalities. The committee heard evidence that showed it was difficult to legislate to directly affect racial discrimination, especially where legislation already existed, such as the Equality Act and public sector equality duty. The report states: “Whilst it is difficult to legislate for unconscious bias, or for clinicians to consider the experience of minority groups, the code of practice may guide those using the MHA to consider these factors – that ‘anti-racism be enshrined in the act as a guiding principle.’” The committee also recommended stronger duties on commissioning bodies to ensure adequate supply of community services in order to end the inappropriate long-term detention of people with learning disabilities and autistic people. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are taking action to address the unequal treatment of people from Black and other ethnic minority backgrounds with mental illness – including by tightening the criteria under which people can be detained and subject to community treatment orders. “The government will now review the committee’s recommendations and respond in due course.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/19/mental-health-racial-bias-in-england-and-wales-is-inexcusable-says-report;guardian;health;2651

1992;1992;The Sleeping Beauty review – a vintage production rises and shines;2023-01-22T09:00:32Z;['Sarah Crompton'];['Royal Ballet', 'Ballet', 'Dance', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Royal Opera House'];;"When choreographers want to refresh their belief in the possibilities of classical dance, they return to The Sleeping Beauty. From Frederick Ashton to Alexei Ratmansky, from Kenneth MacMillan to George Balanchine and on to William Forsythe and Christopher Wheeldon, Marius Petipa’s 19th-century masterpiece has been a guide. It has influenced other things, too. I always wonder how much the horned hat worn by evil fairy Maleficent in Disney’s 1959 cartoon was inspired by Oliver Messel’s designs for Carabosse in the Royal Ballet’s 1946 production, which launched Ninette de Valois’s baby ballet company on its path to world fame. It’s a version of that production, created by Monica Mason and Christopher Newton, with designs faithfully reproduced, that the Royal Ballet dances today, and a strong whiff of history emanates from the stage. Given that there really is no story to speak of (princess is born, has a birthday party, falls asleep for 100 years, wakes up when kissed by prince and has another party) and precious little subtext, whether you succumb to its magic depends entirely on how much you enjoy seeing today’s dancers grapple with the intricacies of the choreography. On opening night I happily held both views. The retro nature of the staging bothers me (all those painted backdrops and courtiers in baggy satin britches), but from the moment Thomas Whitehead’s fussy master of ceremonies walked on to the stage and started to roll his eyes as he checked the fairy guest list, I was entranced. This is part of what the Royal Ballet brings to these traditional ballets: a sense of drama, an etching of character in gesture and attitude. It’s on display, too, when Kristen McNally’s Carabosse sweeps in, eyes flashing, imperious foot stamping. Behind the pantomime villainy there’s just a hint of humanity, a sense that she’s right to feel spurned. Someone has also taken time to help the dancers with the mime. It’s an alien language, yet it is so emphatically performed – particularly by Fumi Kaneko’s radiant Lilac Fairy – that it seems clear.
In general, the company passes the tests the ballet sets. After an uncertain start, all the fairies rose to the occasion, with Sophie Allnatt and Annette Buvoli particularly eye-catching – and the entire cast creating filigree shapes, vistas of arms and legs. In the final act, Calvin Richardson’s elegant Florestan, Joseph Sissens’s musical, high-flying Bluebird and Mica Bradbury’s petulant White Cat shone brightest, but everyone played their part beautifully. Yet every performance of The Sleeping Beauty – and this production runs off and on with various casts until June – is ultimately judged on its leading couple. Marianela Nuñez serenely finds a way of shaping Aurora’s journey: she is innocently joyful in the famous held poses of the Rose Adagio, poetic and mysterious in the vision scene and triumphant in the glory of the wedding pas de deux. Vadim Muntagirov matches her secure brilliance every step of the way. He only appears in Act 2, but from that moment on his presence deepens the ballet, whether in the way his head follows Nuñez’s movements when she first appears, or the panache he lends to his partnering. Their dancing is full of truth and a deep understanding of the tradition in which they follow. The Sleeping Beauty is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London, until 6 June";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/22/the-sleeping-beauty-review-royal-opera-house-london-marianela-nunez-vadim-muntagirov;guardian;entertainment & culture;1992

The Tory MP was prime minister when the bishop of Liverpool published recommendations five years ago - aimed at ""ensuring the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated"".

Ninety-seven football fans died as a result of a crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, with police failures covered up in the aftermath.

Politics live: Rishi Sunak doubles down over handling of Tory controversies

An official police apology was published on Tuesday, however the lack of response from the government has been heavily criticised by the report's author, families of victims, and politicians.

During a debate on the issue on Wednesday, the policing minister Chris Philp said that a government response is expected to be published in spring.

But Mrs May responded: ""Can I say first to my right honourable friend, saying vaguely that the government's response will be available this spring, I do not think is good enough. Five years on, the government must publish its response.""

The Maidenhead MP added that while the apology from the police is welcome, ""frankly, it would have been far better for them to have done their job properly on that fateful April day, 34 years ago"".

She pressed Mr Philp on the introduction of an independent public advocate, whose role would be to help the bereaved in the event of major future tragedies.

Hillsborough campaigners say this would help build trust in the legal system and Mrs May promised the introduction of one in her 2017 manifesto.

The former Conservative minister Kevin Foster also raised this issue as he criticised the government's delayed response.

""The Hillsborough disaster was a tragedy. The lies, smears and cover-ups that followed were an absolute disgrace ... so the extended delay in getting this response out just makes it even worse,"" he said.

""Would he at least today commit to the principle of the independent public advocate to ensure that in future families would be on a level playing field?""

Mr Philp refused to commit in principle but pointed to a consultation on the measure which he said is ""under active consideration at the moment"".

""It is for the Ministry of Justice to publicly respond,"" he added.

Suella Braverman branded 'an absolute disgrace'

The debate was held in response to an urgent question from Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby in Liverpool, who asked when the Home Office will set out its response.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman was branded an ""absolute disgrace"" for not attending the debate after being sat in the chamber for Prime Minister's Questions earlier.

On Tuesday she said the government had not yet responded to the report because of active criminal proceedings relating to the tragedy, but her Labour counterpart Yvette Cooper said ""those finished 18 months ago and the work could have taken place even while those proceedings were ongoing"".

Ms Cooper said: ""Where is she [Suella Braverman] today, because previous home secretaries have shown the respect to the families and to the appalling ways in which they have been wronged by being here to respond and it is a devastating failure of responsibility and respect to them not to be here to respond"".

Calls for Hillsborough Law

An inquest jury ruled in 2016 that the Hillsborough victims were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.

The government has long faced calls to implement a ""Hillsborough Law"" which campaigners say would ensure fairer treatment of bereaved families after major tragedies.

In its response to the report on Tuesday, The National Police Chief Council (NPCC) committed to a new ""duty of candour"" but campaigners want this to be legally binding.

Mr Byrne, who was in attendance at the game in 1989 and witnessed Liverpool fans being crushed to death, said recommendations from the police ""did not go anywhere near far enough to change the culture we came up against in our quest for justice"".

""So I ask the minister, will this government do the right thing for future generations of our nation and implement a Hillsborough Law, containing Bishop Jones's recommendations with immediate effect?""

1013;1013;Law has lagged behind trends towards casual dressing for too long;2023-01-26T19:35:38Z;['Lauren Cochrane'];['Fashion', 'UK news', 'Law', 'Life and style'];;News that the head of law firm Vardags has instructed staff to ditch the suits and channel Annabel’s, the exclusive Mayfair nightclub, when selecting their outfits has raised some eyebrows. But transferring the dress code of a members’ club to a workplace has some sense behind it. As with Annabel’s, hotpants or dirty trainers would probably not feature in most people’s idea of a professional outfit, and “smart, elegant attire” – the aim of the dress code for the Mayfair club – works as an overarching rule of thumb for work too. Annabel’s say linen is OK if pressed, jeans are permitted if “a solid colour” and a round-neck T-shirt can be worn if with a tailored jacket. They also ban “gym wear” and flip-flops. These all seem fairly reasonable for a place of work – especially in a conservative sector like law. The details of the dress code is where it is perhaps less transferrable. A ban on a “excessive displays of skin” feels a bit subjective, and could lead to employees being singled out for what they wear. Men being banned from wearing shorts in the office feels a bit unfair for the summer months, ditto the specification that they must wear a jacket after 6pm. And the rules around hats – trilby allowed, caps banned – are frankly unfashionable in a moment where the baseball cap is the statement accessory. It’s cheering to hear Ayesha Vardag, the firm’s founder and president, encouraging her staff to “bring their personality to work”, and to “be as wildly fabulous as you feel”. For too long, sectors like law and finance have lagged behind wider trends towards a more casual way of dressing, with suits and shirts still dominating. If the rise of the tech industry over the last 20 years has popularised an equally dull uniform of nondescript hoodies and jeans, the idea of staff members being encouraged to express themselves through clothes feels progressive. “If you fancy an electric-blue sequined jacket and gold leather trousers, if you want pink hair or scarlet DMs, if you want a purple velvet jacket, that’s all good,” the memo reads. It also specifies that, tech staff aside, a “hoody-techy” look is not allowed. Whether or not Vardag’s employees will actually take her up on the offer remains to be seen. Most lawyers probably remain hardwired to adhere to a formalwear dress code. The fact that Vardag’s email comes with the caveat that suits are still required for days in court suggests we’re still a while away from a completely “anything goes” approach to fashion at work.;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/26/law-has-lagged-behind-trends-towards-casual-dressing-for-too-long;guardian;entertainment & culture;1013
3497;3497;Revealed: ministers sought Charles’s consent to pass conservation laws affecting his business ;2023-01-14T17:00:14Z;['Helena Horton'];['Environment', 'King Charles III', 'Monarchy', 'UK news', 'Land ownership', 'Politics', 'Queen Elizabeth II'];;The government asked King Charles for permission to pass its post-Brexit “world-leading” Environment Act because laws requiring landowners to enhance conservation could affect his business interests. Environment minister Rebecca Pow wrote to the then Prince of Wales in 2019 to ask if he would accept section seven of the environment bill, which became law in November 2021. It refers to the need “to conserve the setting of land with a natural environment or natural resources or which is a place of archaeological, architectural, artistic, cultural or historic interest”. Those who breach the conservation covenant agreements could be subject to fines. When the act became law, ministers lauded it as a benefit of post-Brexit Britain. Then environment secretary George Eustace declared: “We are setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.” However, the government then missed its own legal deadline for setting what it termed as “ambitious” Environment Act targets. When they did emerge, months late, conservation charities said the targets for nature, clean air and water were underwhelming and would not deliver the promised environmental benefits by 2030. In the letters, revealed on Saturday and sent in October 2019, Pow informs Charles: “This bill contains measures on conservation covenants which affect the interests of the crown, the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall. Part 7 (conservation covenants) of the bill applies to crown land as it applies to any other land.” These conservation covenants are new agreements between the government and landowners in certain biodiverse and nationally significant areas requiring the landowner not to undertake certain environmentally destructive or polluting activities. The letters show that the prince’s private secretary, Clive Alderton, responded to Pow, giving his consent for the law, confirming that he was “content with the bill”. The Duchy of Cornwall brings in about £21m a year for the duke and his family. Revenues from the estate are passed to the Prince of Wales, now Charles’s son William, who uses them to fund his public, charitable and private activities. The duchy consists of approximately 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of land in 23 counties, mostly in south-west England, and in many areas of natural beauty and significance that are affected by environment targets. Charles has previously interfered in government affairs when it threatened to affect his businesses. Last year, the Guardian revealed that he exploited a controversial procedure to compel ministers in John Major’s government in 1992 to secretly change a proposed law to benefit his landed estate. Under the procedure, the late Queen and her eldest son were given copies of draft laws in advance so they could examine whether the legislation affected their public powers or private assets, such as his Duchy of Cornwall estate or the privately owned estate at Sandringham. This procedure is different from the better-known royal assent – a formality that makes a bill become law. The Guardian’s Queen’s consent investigations found that procedure had been used by the late monarch in recent decades to privately lobby for changes. During her reign, ministers were required to secure approval from her or her son for more than 1,000 parliamentary acts before they were implemented. They include leasehold reform legislation that became law in 1993, when there was evidence of Charles applying pressure on elected ministers to ensure an exemption to prevent his own tenants from having the right to buy their own homes. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declined to comment. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/14/ministers-sought-king-charles-consent-pass-conservation-laws;guardian;environment;3497

4816;4816;Western Australia’s ‘worst’ flood reveals vulnerability of supply chains as 100 residents airlifted out;2023-01-07T06:19:18Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Western Australia', 'Australia news', 'Business', 'Extreme weather'];;"Western Australia’s “worst ever” flood has further highlighted the vulnerability of Australia’s supply chains, experts say. On Saturday, record levels of water were pouring down the Fitzroy River, which had created a 50km-wide inland sea. The water across the Kimberley region had shut down parts of the crucial Great Northern Highway, damaged the bridge at Fitzroy Crossing and inundated the airstrip. And 105 people had been relocated from the region, with more expected to be airlifted out in the coming days. In the afternoon, the state government said better weather had finally allowed planes to land at Fitzroy Crossing, carrying thousands of kilograms of food into the communities. Over the past few years, the coronavirus pandemic caused global shortages of many crucial items – particularly when China shut many of its factories. Covid-related staff shortages in Australia worsened the problem, as did floods and bushfires. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also interrupted energy supplies, pushing up prices. And China’s Covid wave is now threatening more chaos. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But in WA, as the flood waters shut down main access routes in the Kimberley, they forced a swift shift to triple road trains that will now travel enormous distances to get food and medical supplies to vulnerable communities. Curtin University supply chain expert Associate Professor Elizabeth Jackson said the decision to allow the triple road trains was a good example of a rapid response and that the pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and now the floods were examples of the need for supply chains to become more nimble. “One of the things Australians have become so tired of in the last three years is how slowly things have moved, with the significant disruptions we have encountered,” she said.
“The speed at which the national trucking association and the state government worked together so rapidly to provide for the ability of triple road trains to access routes that could get supplies – and big quantities of supplies – to where helicopters and light aircraft can land is just extraordinary.” Floods and fires disrupting freight delivery was going to become the “new normal”, she said, adding that a multidisciplinary approach was needed to solve it. “We need biologists, engineers, local people with local knowledge,” she said. “We’re not alone in this. The strategies that supply chains are employing is essentially going against the grain of usual supply chain strategy, which is to find a quick and reliable supplier and lock in massive quantities of the product you want for years to come. “Now, we need things like having multiple suppliers, ordering in small quantities, being nimble and agile, pivoting quickly when something goes wrong.” Governments collaborating with industry was one lesson to take out of the flood response, she said. When the pandemic began, Australia’s first noticeable shortages included items such as toilet paper, as people stripped shelves of necessities. Then international flights slowed and there was a shortage of shipping containers and pallets, which slowed the movement of freight around the world. More specific shortages, such as semiconductors out of China, led to long waits for phones and cars. Last year, the pandemic, fertiliser shortages and natural disasters pushed grocery prices up. Jackson said that in recent decades supply chains became so efficient that it had “completely slipped our minds how hard it is to put things together” until it all broke down. By Saturday, 3,000kg of food had been flown into flood-affected WA communities as authorities headed to Fitzroy Crossing to listen to people’s “frustrations” at a community meeting. The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, said Australian Defence Force planes and other aircraft were now able to use the airstrip at Fitzroy Crossing as the weather had improved. He also warned that record water levels, the fallout from ex-tropical cyclone Ellie, which has been dumping water in the region for days, were set to hit Looma and Pandanas Park. Evacuations have continued, and Dawson said while there had been a “reticence” by some people to leave their homes, those attitudes had changed, while the authorities were taking food to those who chose to stay. “It’s really an opportunity for us to listen and hear their frustration. I know they’re frustrated,” Dawson said.
“I am aware though, having spoken to people this morning, there is a sense of relief now as planes have started to fly in and land and drop off food supplies.” The ADF planes will be joined by other aircraft including Chinooks to continue the resupply effort, while barges will be used to take supplies into Broome. The fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, said that effort will “really ramp up today and in the days ahead” as the weather has improved. The WA government also announced $3m for a distress fund set up by the Perth lord mayor, Basil Zempilas. The Western Roads Federation chief executive, Cam Dumesny, said Australia needed to “move away from the ‘just in time’ to ‘just in case’”. As the head of the peak body for the road transport industry in WA, he has seen first-hand how swiftly natural disasters such as floods can sever critical parts of Australia’s freight network. “We need to look at hardening the supply chains,” he said. “They’re so disrupted, so vulnerable. And those climate-related disruptions will keep occurring.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/07/western-australias-worst-flood-reveals-vulnerability-of-supply-chains-as-100-residents-airlifted-out;guardian;environment;4816
3560;3560;‘Family is the place for madness’: Constance Debré on the book that has shocked France ;2023-01-14T10:00:05Z;['Angelique Chrisafis'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Fiction in translation', 'France', 'Europe'];;"“There’s always a price to pay for freedom,” says Constance Debré, running a hand over her shaved head and her neck tattoo that reads “plutôt crêver” (“rather die”). The 50-year-old author, who faced a fierce custody battle over her young son after coming out as gay in her mid 40s, adds: “To me, that’s a happier, livelier way to see things: rather than saying there are injustices or blows raining down on you, you realise it’s all because you’re living life in the way you want, seeking out an existence … trying to give life some shape. That’s why life and literature are so connected: it’s the quest for form.” Debré tore up the rule book of French writing with a bestselling trilogy based on the dramatic turn her life took after she came out. The darkly comic, first-person account of a separated mother’s Don Juan-style conquests of women is interwoven with scenes of her “taking an automatic rifle” to her bourgeois life as a criminal defence barrister from a famous French political dynasty. More than a coming-out saga, Debré likens it to a Saint Augustine-style conversion, a total transformation. The protagonist and narrator, who is not named, is clearly Debré herself, following in a long French tradition of creative writers who draw closely on real-life events – the most notable being last year’s Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux. Yet though the events are real, Debré firmly considers her work fiction rather than autobiography or memoir, because it relies on the literary art of constructing a narrative, creating a relationship between a character and events. “What makes a novel is its form,” she says.
Just as Debré did, the narrator leaves the smart neighbourhoods of Paris where she grew up, abandons her job and possessions, and lives nomadically while reflecting on the arc of her life – from the opium and heroin addictions of her aristocratic parents, and her mother’s sudden death when Debré was 16, to her work in court defending drug dealers, murderers, rapists. The first book of the trilogy, Play Boy, won the Prix de la Coupole in 2018, and since then, every Debré publication has been a major literary event. Love Me Tender, the second novel, is so raw and fast‑paced that it stands alone. It is Debré’s first book to be published in the UK, in a translation by Holly James, and draws on her estranged husband’s attempts to stop her seeing her young son, arguing in court that her new life as a lesbian and a provocative writer made her unsuitable as a mother. The court eventually finds in her favour, but not before years tick by in which she is allowed only sporadic supervised visits with her son at a family contact centre. The battle against the family court system reads like a thriller, a race against time to stop the mother‑child relationship fading out. There is an absurdity at the heart of all this – that Debré had to pay such a price for coming out as a lesbian in well-heeled Paris. When she “switched” to female partners it was a few years after same-sex marriages were legalised in France. “We all think we live in an extremely free society,” she says. “But the events in this book show that when someones changes category, it’s not always easy.”
We meet in Belleville, northern Paris. In Love Me Tender, Debré describes her protagonist’s imposing presence – tall frame, leather jacket, tattoos, icy stare – as a cross between Marcel Proust’s Baron de Charlus and the Sex Pistols’ Sid Vicious. She is extremely polite, and hates the fact that she has never been able to shake that part of her upbringing. She’s just back from a writer’s residency in Los Angeles and says she has fallen in love with the city. “There’s a melancholy in LA which isn’t at all the same as the melancholy of Paris. Paris melancholy is sad and dark. In LA, the melancholy has a kind of softness.” For Debré, style is what counts. Hailed by French critics for her slap-in-the-face narration, she strips the French language back to its most crude and colloquial, subverts punctuation and deliberately goes against the current trend in French writing for plunging into psychological explanation. “I wanted a style that would be the least verbose, very direct, fat-free, efficient – with as little psychology as possible because I absolutely detest that. I had in mind that well-known photograph by William Eggleston, a naked bulb on a ceiling – just a bulb and three white cables in a red room. It’s banal and it has an incredible strength. I wanted to get back to that concept, which we’ve had in music, art, photography for 50 years. You find it less in literature, at least in French writing, which is deliberately delicate. I wanted to grab events and grab the reader.” She is relieved that English-language readers might come to her unencumbered by the baggage of her famous surname – the final novel of her trilogy, Nom (Name), is about the need to escape that legacy. She was born into a French political dynasty labelled the “French Kennedys”. Her grandfather, Michel Debré, was Charles de Gaulle’s prime minister and wrote the modern French constitution. Her great-grandfather, Robert Debré, is seen as the founder of modern pediatrics and has a Paris hospital named after him. Her uncles were ministers. Her father, François Debré, was an award-winning war reporter who returned from his assignments in Asia with an opium habit. Her mother, a fashion model, came from an eccentric aristocratic family which had fallen on hard times, but whose women were tough, liked hunting and driving fast. She gave Debré her first rifle at 15. If the famous Debré men wrote the laws of France, Constance, as a criminal lawyer, defended those who broke them. Criminal law, she feels, is where you can find “all the most violent truth of existence”. Her next novel, Offenses (Offences), out in France in February, traces the story of a murderer and is also drawn from real events.
Love Me Tender is at its heart a book about injustice. But for Debré, the ideal of justice is very different from the working judicial system itself, which she sees as skewed towards the powerful and rich. “The justice system is a fiction … it’s about designating what’s ‘bad’ in order to place the society we live in on the side of ‘good’. There was something amusing in the not-at-all amusing fact of having worked in that justice system and now finding myself put in the role of accused ... But all forms of role-reversal are interesting.” The novel, in all its punk rebelliousness, picks at notions of motherhood and unconditional love. Debré feels that people talk of love in families as if it’s fixed, never changing. She wanted to ask: what if it all falls apart? “Just the expression ‘unconditional love’ is very interesting, it’s a way to totally close the box as if saying: ‘Ah, that’s unconditional love, it’s all worked out, no need to talk about it,’” she says. “All of us have a tendency to not know what we’re feeling, so the first reflex is generally to take up society’s discourse ... When you go to the park, you often see mothers – fathers too – who are speaking slightly falsely to their children, as if they’re speaking to an audience, performing. It’s terrible, it reveals a great anxiety. There’s a violence to this discourse that turns people crazy, parents and kids. Family is the place for madness, that’s for certain.” She is matter-of-fact about childhood, in particular her own. In the trilogy, her parents openly get high on opium, saying not to tell her teachers. They progress to heroin, which makes them pass out and “burn their sheets with their cigarettes”, and, when they can’t afford drugs, whisky. It leads to her mother’s early death and her father’s continual failed attempts to detox. Debré feels it was “formative” and she was lucky to have “bourgeois addict” parents. “I’ve always been very surprised about the way that other people talked about my childhood, because I was very happy to have the parents I had, there were a lot of sad stories in all of that, but I owe them a lot.”
If she likes flipping things around, seeing the positives, it’s “not just for the sake of contradiction or to be provocative,” she says. “But because there’s truth to be found in looking at things upside down.” The difficult story of her relationship with her son could have positive elements in it too, she says, perhaps for him. The eight-year-old boy – named Paul in the novel – is stopped from seeing his mother for months. He goes from hiding under the duvet at his father’s flat and refusing to acknowledge her, to the unexpected tenderness of their initially shy supervised meetings, in matching plastic armchairs, where they hug and “exchange news from afar like bad actors”. The court-appointed psychiatrist declares, “Of course you love Paul, of course Paul loves you, of course you’re not crazy,” but shrugs as he says this sort of legal battle “happens all the time” when one parent comes out as gay, usually the father, and can take years to make it through the court system. She hints that her real-life relationship with her son is better now, and that he is doing OK. “It’s very rare that things are only negative, or only painful,” she says. “Freedom is how you choose to view events, at least as much as the events themselves … Everything is intertwined, that’s what existence is – it’s not just blocks of sadness or blocks of happiness.” In Love Me Tender, the fact of losing her mother young is mentioned in passing. “Loss is everywhere in existence,” she shrugs. “And maybe the way to take the drama out of loss is just by saying it’s there. Like ‘Oh, there it is,’ and just go on to something different in the next phrase.” Her writing is also about her body: never taking drugs, compulsively swimming every day in public pools, just as the criminals she once defended pumped iron in jail. She gets tattoos that, she writes in her first novel, shouldn’t be about beauty but like “graffiti on a toilet door”. She writes of having “Son of a Bitch” inked on her stomach. Tattoos “are something about prisoners, sailors, people who have had hard lives and who have nothing else to count on,” she says. “They have no home, not much else. So they have to cling on to the only material thing left – the body.” Debré’s depictions of sexual encounters are also key. In Play Boy, these explore the discovery of gay sex. In Love Me Tender, they serve a different purpose, she says. The sexual encounters are placed against the backdrop of the family court battle, where the expectation is that the narrator will resume her respectable lawyer’s life. Instead, she behaves like a promiscuous “lonesome cowboy”, doing whatever she pleases, like a man could.
“It was about how this character would react to being accused,” Debré says. “The character’s answer to the judges, and to a society that condemns her for her choices, is to put her foot on the accelerator. She continues to write, whatever the consequences ... and she continues being homosexual, even in a way that is not seen to be OK. Because – and this is the accusation that I make in the book – it seems today that there is a type of homosexual who is OK if they stick to the bourgeois rules of the 19th and 20th century, stays within the family model, within a relationship. And what was interesting to me was the transgressive. The narrator uses homosexuality to contest that bourgeois model, she piles up sexual encounters which aren’t love stories, aren’t relationships. Ultimately she takes on the role – which isn’t loved at the moment – of a Don Juan.” She adds: “And I don’t think it’s a way of depicting lesbians that lesbians will necessarily like, because it’s a very masculine way to behave. This character takes on a certain virility, even by writing in the first person. It’s a way of saying, ‘Fine, I’m homosexual, so I too can have mistresses, and lots of them ... We live in a free world, so why is it bothering you?’ And yet it does bother people. All that is an answer to a society which is so-called liberal but in reality is still very bourgeois. She is condemned by that society, or at least placed under suspicion and shunned.” Debré says the book is not about revenge – “that always makes for very bad literature”. She sees her central character as like a Greek hero, taking on the challenges of the angry gods. “I clearly could have told this story by saying it’s disgusting, it’s misogyny, homophobia, the violence of the patriarchy. I could have presented this poor woman as a victim of a terrible world,” she says. “But I didn’t want that, because I don’t believe in a world of guilt or innocence. It’s much more interesting to present a character who refuses the role of victim – but at the same time doesn’t deny the suffering.” • Love Me Tender by Constance Debré, translated by Holly James, is published by Tuskar Rock.

3502;3502;Wolves heap pressure on David Moyes after Podence sinks West Ham;2023-01-14T16:59:42Z;['Ben Fisher'];['Premier League', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers', 'West Ham United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"It was a very lonely walk down the tunnel at full time for David Moyes, the West Ham manager determined to put on a brave face amid an alarming run that has culminated in them dropping into the relegation zone at the halfway point of the Premier League season. Defeat at Wolves means West Ham have taken one point from the last possible 21 and won one of their past 10 league matches, at home to Bournemouth in October. Moyes faced – and undoubtedly – heard the music as he applauded the away fans after the final whistle. West Ham invested almost £170m in the squad last summer after again qualifying for European competition but the hierarchy did not envisage dicing with the prospect of playing in the Championship next season. West Ham’s superior goal difference is the sole reason they are not bottom of the pile and the board’s patience and commitment to Moyes, who plainly acknowledged he is under pressure, is being seriously tested. West Ham’s next match, at home to Everton on Saturday, has taken on great significance – for both clubs and both of their managers. “What we’ve given West Ham supporters in the last few years, I hope they can give us back,” Moyes said, aware of how volatile the mood may be at the London Stadium. “We are in a difficult period. If they give us back everything the staff and the players have given the club in the last couple of years then I’m sure that will help us. You always want the backing of your home support and we’ve always had it. Let’s hope that continues.”
Wolves jumped out of the relegation zone at West Ham’s expense after Daniel Podence struck the only goal in a game light on quality. Wolves went for the jugular as the game ticked towards the final whistle, with the again impressive Rúben Neves clattering the upright with a delicious right-foot strike, though Wolves had to withstand some late West Ham pressure. The substitutes Gianluca Scamacca and Saïd Benrahma combined but the latter’s shot dribbled towards José Sá in the Wolves goal and then the West Ham captain, Declan Rice, shot off target. There were gasps as the fourth official, Craig Pawson, indicated six minutes of second-half stoppage time but the glum expressions on the faces of those of a West Ham persuasion at full time said everything.
Moyes conceded his team were not clean nor clinical in the final third but the West Ham manager was not interested in making excuses. Moyes must have been tempted to stress the absence of the defender Craig Dawson, omitted from his squad amid an offer from Wolves, and while Moyes acknowledged the situation has been unsettling, he knows his team are lacking quality across the pitch. “We have probably risen expectations greatly in the last few years, being in Europe, 6th and 7th in the Premier League in the last two years,” Moyes said. “I can understand disappointment and understand frustration and maybe they [fans] cannot quite understand why it is quite like this.” Wolves are only two points above the bottom three but appear rejuvenated, in a good place under Julen Lopetegui, who cherished the importance of his first league clean sheet. The reality is the Wolves goal was never put under any great strain, something that irked Moyes. Wolves’s uplift under Lopetegui continues but things do not get any easier. They host Liverpool in a FA Cup replay on Tuesday before a trip to Manchester City and another Liverpool visit in the league. “We celebrate for two hours and tomorrow we are thinking about how to play Liverpool,” Lopetegui said. A season ticket at Molineux has offered little value for money this season – only Gillingham, bottom of the Football League, have scored fewer league goals than Wolves – but the sight of Podence striking a sweet winner, his third goal in five games, will have made amends for some of the more painful days. Podence’s goal was Wolves’s sixth at home this season and it was one that will eat away at Moyes given it stemmed from a West Ham corner. Aaron Cresswell cut out Matheus Nunes’s pass but his clearance fell kindly for Podence to rattle in a first-time shot. “You’ve got to win games in this industry and I’m not winning enough games,” Moyes said. “I’m not stupid.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/14/wolves-west-ham-premier-league-match-report;guardian;sports;3502
1357;1357;Rory McIlroy defends blanking Patrick Reed in Dubai tee-throwing incident;2023-01-25T11:24:12Z;['Ewan Murray'];['Rory McIlroy', 'Golf', 'LIV Golf Series', 'Sport'];;"Rory McIlroy has insisted he was well within his rights to ignore Patrick Reed on a Dubai driving range after reports surfaced that the American had tossed a golf tee at the world No 1 in disgust. McIlroy revealed he was served court papers by Reed at his Florida home on Christmas Eve. Reed approached McIlroy on Monday at the Dubai Desert Classic but was blanked by the Northern Irishman. McIlroy was unaware of any subsequent object-throwing but used his pre-tournament press conference to explain his stance towards Reed. “Patrick came up to say hello and I didn’t really want him to,” McIlroy said. “From my recollection, that was it. I didn’t see a tee. I didn’t feel a tee. Obviously someone else saw that. But it’s definitely a storm in a teacup. I can’t believe it’s actually turned into a story, it’s nothing.
“I was subpoenaed by his lawyer on Christmas Eve. Trying to have a nice time with my family and someone shows up on your doorstep and delivers that, you’re not going to take that well. “I’m living in reality, I don’t know where he’s living. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t expect a hello or a handshake.” Reed has launched a defamation case against the Golf Channel and its analyst, Brandel Chamblee, whom he alleges conspired with the PGA Tour’s commissioner, Jay Monahan, to defame him. Reed now plays the majority of his golf on the rebel LIV tour. The 2018 Masters champion’s lawyer Larry Klayman has also alleged that McIlroy, Davis Love III and Tiger Woods are co-conspirators in the PGA Tour’s antitrust scheme to destroy LIV. McIlroy added: “I was down by my bag and he came up to me. I was busy working and sort of doing my practise. I didn’t feel the need to acknowledge him.
“I didn’t see a tee coming my direction at all, but apparently that’s what happened. And if roles were reversed and I’d have thrown that tee at him, I’d be expecting a lawsuit.” Speaking after McIlroy, Reed said: “We all know where it came from, being part of LIV. Since my tees are Team Aces LIV tees I flicked him one. It was kind of a funny shot back. Funny how a small little flick has turned into basically me stabbing him and throwing a tee at him. “It’s unfortunate because we’ve always had a good relationship. But it is one of those things, if you’re going to act like an immature little child then you might as well be treated like one.” This bizarre affair dominated discussion before McIlroy’s first competitive start of 2023. There was, naturally, also chat about LIV after it emerged the circuit’s commissioner, Greg Norman, is to be handed extra powers. LIV has been hit by two high-profile resignations since its maiden season ended in October. “If the chief executive doesn’t have an executive team, I don’t know how strong that is,” McIlroy said. “He can’t do it himself. He needs to rely on a team just like all of us rely on teams to do things. If you are sort of operating solo, it starts to get pretty difficult.” Last year saw McIlroy emerge as the regular, unofficial spokesperson for golf’s traditional tours as LIV attempted to coax players towards Saudi Arabian millions. “There’s no point in just being a mouthpiece when you can’t back that up by playing good golf and showing people the rewards people can have out here if they are playing well,” said the 33-year-old. “It’s a merit-based system. That’s the thing that I’ve always struggled with: if a five-year-old boy or girl know that they work hard and they shoot the scores, there’s a merit-based system in golf all the way through junior golf, amateur golf, all the way up to the professional level and they can make it to the top levels of the game. “This is the one thing that’s come into the game that has disrupted that. It’s not a merit-based system.”
Two wins in as many PGA Tour tournaments for Jon Rahm has reignited discussion over the validity of golf’s ranking system. Rahm is currently the world No 3. Rather than stoke the debate, McIlroy heaped praise on the Spaniard. “We all know Jon is one of the best players in the world,” said McIlroy. “Whether there’s a one beside his name or a two beside his name, it doesn’t really matter. He’s won four of his last six events. He’s playing some of the best golf he’s played in his career. He’s not had a long career but all of his career, he’s played consistently at a very, very high level. It has been an amazing start to the year.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/25/rory-mcilroy-defends-blanking-patrick-reed-dubai-tee-throwing-incident-golf;guardian;sports;1357
8018;8018;Latest Johnson scandal may not damage former PM - but what will the fallout be for Rishi Sunak?;Monday 23 January 2023 02:54, UK;['rob powell', '@robpowellnews'];['boris johnson'];['prime', 'given', 'mr', 'boris', 'minister', 'johnson', 'westminster', 'tax', 'fallout', 'sunak', 'latest', 'zahawi', 'damage', 'scandal', 'rishi'];"At the height of the partygate saga, a joke went round Westminster that every time the sense of crisis began to escalate, Boris Johnson would get on the phone to the Ukrainian President to arrange another trip to Kyiv.

Perhaps old habits die hard, as this weekend saw the classic Johnson double-header of a Sunday newspaper scandal combined with a dash to the war-torn country.

The optics of the former prime minister sitting next to a union flag at the president's table are likely to warm the cockles of his allies in Westminster though - some of whom have already been floating the idea that he could return before the next election.

But anyone searching for a reminder of the downsides of the Johnson era needn't look far.

The curious case of the £800,000 loan, the prime minister and the BBC chairman taps into all the trappings of a textbook Westminster controversy.

This may prove to be just a precursor to the Privileges Committee partygate investigation though - potentially the moment where many more gory details are churned up and laid out for all to see.

Combine all this with polling showing Mr Johnson is a good deal less popular across the country than he is with his loyalists in parliament, and a return to power anytime soon seems unlikely.

But how damaging are these stories to Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party more generally?

Answering this question is always difficult given the tendency of Westminster scandal to lower the public's opinion of all politicians, rather than those of one specific party.

Mr Sunak may also find himself protected from some of the splatter of the Johnson controversies given his role in bringing down his former cabinet colleague.

That said, having kept the Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi in government, revelations that he had to repay tax from the sale of shares by an offshore trust are unfortunate for Mr Sunak given his wife's previous non-dom status.

Rishi Sunak branded 'total liability' as he faces backlash from MPs

Setting this all in perspective though, it's unlikely to rival NHS pressure and cost of living as issues that will influence the next election and determine how rough a ride the prime minister has with his MPs in the months ahead.

With that in mind, the most problematic moment of the last week for Mr Sunak could turn out to be when he told an audience in Lancashire that they were ""not idiots"" and so understood why he couldn't cut tax straight away.

That may easily be viewed as a direct barb by the many backbenchers who do want the tax burden reduced immediately.

Most of them are still keeping their counsel, but as inflation eases and the election grows ever nearer, that will likely change.

Then it could be Mr Sunak scrambling for a trip to Kyiv.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123033226/http://news.sky.com/story/latest-johnson-scandal-may-not-damage-former-pm-but-what-will-the-fallout-be-for-rishi-sunak-12793232;skynews;politics;2109
3122;3122;Gina Lollobrigida obituary;2023-01-16T17:24:57Z;['John Francis Lane'];['Film', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'Culture'];;"The actor Gina Lollobrigida, who has died aged 95, was one of the great film stars of the 1950s and 60s, and an icon of Italian cinema who became known as “the most beautiful woman in the world”. The movie that launched her as a sex symbol was Altri Tempi (Infidelity, 1952), an anthology film directed by Alessandro Blasetti, in which Vittorio De Sica was the lawyer who defends the honour of a woman (Lollobrigida) accused of being too sexy. She was signed up the following year to play opposite Errol Flynn in Crossed Swords and in what was to become a cult movie, John Huston’s tongue-in-cheek adventure yarn Beat the Devil, in which she co-starred with Humphrey Bogart and Jennifer Jones. The film that immortalised her sultry qualities more than any other was Luigi Comencini’s Pane, Amore e Fantasia (Bread, Love and Dreams, 1953). Her character La Bersagliera’s sincere love for the shy but honest young cop in preference to the extrovert sergeant major played with panache by De Sica made her popular with audiences everywhere, and a pin-up around the world, although the film was panned by most critics. In October 1954, it was the hit of Italian film week in London, where Lollobrigida was presented to the Queen. The Guardian critic described the film as “a charming piece”. Lollobrigida was upstaged a bit at the premiere by a new rival, Sophia Loren, who wore a daringly lowcut neckline in the royal presence. Comencini directed Lollobrigida again as La Bersagliera in Bread, Love and Jealousy, a sequel that was as successful as the first film, but both she and Comencini declined to make a third film, and Loren eagerly took her place. The “rivalry” between the two stars was to last for decades.
One of four daughters of Giovanni, a furniture maker, and his wife, Giuseppina (nee Mercuri), Lollobrigida was born in a mountain village, Subiaco, about 40 miles from Rome, famous for its Benedictine abbey. The family moved to Rome after the second world war and lived six in a room. Gina got a job as an artist’s model and, as she needed money to pay for singing lessons, accepted work as a film extra. Later, when she played the singer Lina Cavalieri, a famous beauty of the early years of the century, in La Donna Più Bella del Mondo (The Most Beautiful Woman in the World), she proved the singing lessons had not been wasted, and herself sang an aria from Tosca. Her first Italian film role was in 1946 in Aquila Nera (Black Eagle) made by one of the best commercial directors and star-scouts of those years, Riccardo Freda. In 1947 she came third in the Miss Italy beauty contest. An opera film, Pagliacci (1948), in which she played opposite Tito Gobbi, was seen by Hollywood talent scouts and the film magnate Howard Hughes invited her to the US. In 1949 she married Milko Skofic, a Yugoslav medical student who later became her manager, but he could not get an American visa, so Lollobrigida had to go to the US alone. Hughes did not want to see her European films. “Her career starts now she’s in Hollywood,” he declared. She was given a chauffeured Cadillac and villa with a pool, as well as teachers of English and elocution. And Hughes began his courtship.
When he heard that Hughes had taken her to Las Vegas and proposed that she get a divorce before signing a contract, Milko sent her a cable: “Either sign or come home.” She went home, and Milko found her a part in a film about the Resistance, Achtung! Banditi! (1951), by one of his communist friends, Carlo Lizzani. The “new” ltalian cinema seemed to be on the brink of discovering her at last, but the French got in first. Christian-Jacque cast her as the gypsy girl in Fanfan la Tulipe (1951) and René Clair chose her as one of the stars of Les Belles de Nuit (1952), in both of which the leading man was the new French idol Gérard Philipe. Lollobrigida won the best actress award at the newly established Italian Golden Goblet awards for her 1953 performance in La Provinciale (The Provincial Girl), based on an Alberto Moravia story. Although she was disappointed that her performance in the title role of La Romana (The Woman of Rome), the film of Moravia’s famous novel about a Roman sex worker who falls in love with an antifascist militant, failed to get her the best actress award at the Venice festival in 1954, she was, however, mobbed by the crowds and the media. Lollobrigida was to star opposite great leading men including Burt Lancaster (in Trapeze, 1956), Anthony Quinn (in Jean Delannoy’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 1956), Yul Brynner (in Solomon and Sheba, 1959) and Sean Connery (in Woman of Straw, 1964), but she continued to appear in European films, such as the elegant historical epic Venere Imperiale (Imperial Venus, 1963), in which she played Napoleon’s sister Paolina. In Buona Sera, Mrs Campbell (1968), she played on her early peasant image, as an Italian woman who convinces each of three former American GIs (Phil Silvers, Peter Lawford and Telly Savalas) that he is the father of her daughter, and won best actress at the David di Donatello awards for her performance.
In 1972 she was much appreciated in a rare TV appearance as the Blue Fairy in an adaptation of Pinocchio for Italian television by Comencini. In 1981 she appeared in an episode of Falcon Crest and in 1988 agreed to appear in a remake for TV of The Woman of Rome, this time playing the sex worker’s mother. But as her acting roles became fewer, she dedicated most of her time to photography, art and sculpture. In 1997 she appeared in the French comedy XXL. In 2011 she was a guest artist in a film directed by an Italian TV comedian, Ezio Greggio, called Box Office 3D, about the excesses of American cinema. She also appeared for the first time in a film with Loren, a documentary about the fashion stylist of the Dolce Vita years Emilio Schuberth, of whom both had been customers. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1971. In 2006 she announced that she was to marry Javier Rigau y Rafols, but there was doubt about the legality of the ceremony. Lollobrigida is survived by her son, Milko Jr, and a grandson, Dimitri. • Gina (Luigina) Lollobrigida, actor, born 4 July 1927; died 16 January 2023 • John Francis Lane died in 2018";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/gina-lollobrigida-obituary;guardian;entertainment & culture;3122

Shadow trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds was asked for his view by Kay Burley.

He said: ""It really does now raise serious questions about the Conservative Party's ability to keep our country safe.

""Now what would Labour do?

""Labour on our first day in office would order a full defence and security review because our position is that the armed services have to be at a size to have a capability that matches the nature of the threats we face.""

Keith Brown’s statement to MSPs on Tuesday afternoon followed his announcement on Sunday that no transgender prisoner with a history of violence against women will be accommodated in a women’s prison pending an urgent review of all transgender inmates, and after heavy criticism from opposition parties of the government’s “botched” and “chaotic” handling of the case. On Monday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her government has nothing to apologise for in its handling of the developing controversy that began a week ago when Isla Bryson was transferred to Scotland’s sole female-only prison, Cornton Vale, for initial assessment in segregation. It was later reported that Tiffany Scott, who is subject to an order for lifelong restriction – reserved for Scotland’s most violent and dangerous offenders – after admitting stalking a 13-year-old girl by sending letters from jail while living as a man had been granted a transfer to the female estate. Questions were also raised over the decision to transfer another transgender woman, Katie Dolatowski, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl, to Cornton Vale last year. Last week, it emerged that the Scottish Prison Service had overruled an initial decision by the court service to take Bryson to Barlinnie, a men’s prison, after the offender was remanded in custody to await sentencing at the end of February.
After Brown defended the SPS decision to MSPs last Wednesday, Sturgeon announced at first minister’s questions on Thursday that Bryson would be moved to a male facility. It later emerged that she had made a rare intervention during a meeting involving Brown, although her official spokesperson said the first minister had not ordered the Prison Service to move Bryson, a point Brown reiterated on Tuesday. Brown told MSPs on Tuesday that he was “very conscious of the importance of maintaining public confidence in the justice system”, but added: “We must not allow the legitimate questions that have been asked to fuel the view that trans women suddenly pose an inherent threat to women when that is not the case”. He said that the temporary ban was “not dissimilar” to the recent tightening of policy announced by Dominic Raab, the UK’s justice secretary for England and Wales, but said there would still be “exceptional circumstances” where Scottish National party ministers would formally intervene.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/31/scottish-ministers-say-they-did-not-know-rapist-isla-bryson-was-put-in-womens-prison;guardian;entertainment & culture;31
8435;8435;NHS crisis: How is the health service in your local area performing this winter?;Thursday 26 January 2023 15:43, UK;[];['data and forensics'];['service', 'area', 'local', 'data', 'bed', 'hours', 'waiting', 'minutes', '12', 'patients', 'winter', 'care', 'times', 'health', 'crisis', 'performing', 'nhs'];"New data shows that GP waiting times fell in December for the second consecutive month, with the share of people managing to secure an urgent appointment on the same day rising from 69% to 74%.

That's precious good news for the NHS, which is currently enduring its most difficult winter on record. The health service only began publishing data on GP appointments in September, so it's not possible to say how the current waiting times compare to previous winters.

Any improvement, however, will ease the burden on patients currently facing record waiting times elsewhere in the health service.

You can see how your health service is performing using the tool below.

The national picture

After securing a referral from their GP, many patients in England are being left waiting months to see a consultant.

As of November, 40% of patients seeking a diagnostic test were being forced to wait more than four weeks, with 13% waiting for over 12 weeks. Such long waits were practically unheard of before the COVID pandemic.

Diagnostic waiting times are longest in Lincolnshire, where nearly two in five patients (37%) wait more than 12 weeks for a test in November. That includes 81% who waited more than 12 weeks for a bone density scan, and 78% who waited over 12 weeks for an echocardiogram.

It is in emergency departments, however, that the crisis in the NHS is most visible.

Most critical incidents

Ambulances are supposed to reach the most critical incidents, which require immediate intervention or resuscitation, within seven minutes. That target has not been met since April 2021.

In December, it took ambulances in England an average of 11 minutes to reach such calls - a minute longer than the previous record, set in October.

Response times were slowest in the South West, where ambulances took 13 minutes on average to reach such cases, nearly twice the target.

Less urgent situations

Waiting times are even worse for slightly less urgent, but still life-threatening, situations such as heart attacks and strokes.

Ambulances are supposed to reach such calls within 18 minutes. As of December the average response time stood at 93 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting more than three hours and 42 minutes to be picked up.

In the South West, the average waiting time for such cases stood two hours and 39 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting over six hours and 39 minutes to be seen.

A spokesperson for the South Western Ambulance Service told Sky News that health and social care services are ""under enormous pressure"".

""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to deliver their best care for patients, but our performance has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments,"" the spokesperson said.

'Handover times over three hours'

Ambulances in England spent 143,000 hours waiting outside hospitals in November, with 11,391 handovers taking more than three hours, according to data from the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives.

Those delays have improved in recent weeks, but remain at record levels for this time of year. One in five ambulance handovers (20.2%) took more than 30 minutes during the week to 22 January, compared to 18.3% during the same week in 2022 and 11.7% in 2020.

Lengthy handover delays are the result of backlogs within emergency departments themselves.

The time it takes to get through England's Type 1 A&E; departments, which treat the most severe cases, has never been longer.

The chart below shows the share of A&E; attendances lasting more than four hours each month. Every month in 2022 saw a new record broken, with more than half of attendances taking over four hours for the first time ever in December.

Other nations in the UK collect data for all A&E; departments together, including minor injury units and specialist services. In Scotland's Forth Valley, 62% of attendances lasted more than four hours - twice the British average.

That data includes people who attended A&E; but didn't need to be admitted. For those who do need a bed, the waits are far longer.

One in every three people admitted to England's A&E; departments this December (33%) had to wait at least four hours between the point at which a clinician decided to admit them, and the point at which they actually got to a bed, with 11% waiting for over 12 hours.

In 2015, by comparison, just 8% of patients endured ""trolley waits"" of more than four hours, with fewer than 0.01% waiting more than 12 hours.

As of December, three of the five NHS trusts with the longest trolley waits were in London, with Croydon and North Middlesex trusts both seeing more than a third of patients wait over 12 hours. By far the longest waiting times, however, were in East Cheshire NHS Trust, where more than half of people admitted (52%) waited more than 12 hours for a bed.

Bed shortages

The government has previously identified bed shortages as a key cause of long A&E; waiting times. The UK has long been unusual by international standards in how full its hospitals are, but in recent years the situation has become critical.

Every winter, the share of beds occupied has been rising: from 87% in 2020, to 90% in 2021, to 94% in 2022.

According to the National Audit Office, bed occupancy above 85% ""can lead to regular bed shortages, periodic bed crises and increased numbers of hospital-acquired infections"".

As of December, 92% of trusts had occupancy rates above this threshold - up from 64% in December 2020.

That includes the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Nuneaton, which has been at 100% occupancy for general and acute beds since April. The trust's chief operating officer told Sky News that demand had been ""exceptionally high"" in recent months.

For other trusts, bed shortages are concentrated in particular types of care. Manchester University hospitals have been at full capacity for paediatric critical care since October, while neonatal critical care beds have been fully occupied in Oxford University hospitals for more than a year.

The total number of NHS beds has halved since 1987, as successive governments sought to cut costs and improve outcomes by moving certain types of care out of hospitals and into the community.

That strategy has been undermined in recent years by large cuts to local authority budgets. Over the past decade, the number of care home beds per person aged over 75 has fallen by 17%, according to government data.

With analysis from the King's Fund and the Health Foundation, Sky News is launching a new year-long project to examine the NHS at 75, the problems it faces and the potential solutions.

3634;3634;ECB’s Mo Bobat happy for Steve Smith to gear up for Ashes in county cricket;2023-01-13T18:00:21Z;['Simon Burnton'];['England cricket team', 'Steve Smith', 'ECB', 'Australia cricket team', 'Cricket', 'Sport', 'Australia sport'];;"Mo Bobat, the performance director for men’s cricket at the ECB, has cautiously welcomed the possibility of Australia’s Steve Smith honing his skills with Sussex in the County Championship before the start of this summer’s Ashes series, suggesting the benefits of the move would outweigh any disadvantages. Discussions between Smith and Sussex are said to be advanced, and though Ben Stokes, England’s Test captain, reacted coolly to the idea Bobat was considerably more enthusiastic. “Any good player coming over to our domestic system, he’s going to raise the standard of it,” Bobat said. “In many ways it’s good – it’s good for our bowlers to bowl at Steve Smith, and it’s good for the young batters to see him play and get a chance to bat with him. “You could argue that it helps him prep and that might represent a disadvantage to England. I don’t spend too much time thinking about that. We tend to just worry about what we can control. If we play to potential we’re a match for anyone and we can challenge anyone.”
Bobat also proposed an extensive shake-up of the central contract system to reflect the changing face of the modern game and in particular the number of players now representing England in various formats. England have used more than 40 players in full men’s internationals in only two of the last 90 years: 2021 and 2022, with the number reaching 50 for the first time last year.
“A few of us need to get our heads together and really think about what central contracts look like moving forward,” he said. “We need to think about the value of Test contracts, relative to other opportunities out there; we need to think about white-ball being contracted. We need to think about the balance between retainers and fees and what that looks like; we need to think about the volume and number of players that we need to contract because we’re using so many more of them. “We need to be very cognisant of the earning opportunities of players and how we best manage their workload and their schedules. We’ve got pace-bowling development contracts and we’ve seen real value in those, and it might be that we can do something like that with disciplines that aren’t just pace bowling. Why couldn’t we be doing that with the young spinners or young batters? But we haven’t really started that piece of work.” The coaching team for the forthcoming Lions tour of Sri Lanka has been finalised, with the head coach Neil Killeen – who was named men’s elite pace bowling coach this week – leading a group that also includes Ian Bell and Min Patel. Graeme Swann will again join the squad as a mentor, having performed a similar role on the trip to the UAE last November. “When [director of elite men’s cricket] Rob Key first started, he and I spoke about trying to get some of the right personalities around our players, people who really embody the type of cricket we’re trying to play, and he was someone that certainly came to mind,” Bobat said. “He was always aggressive, had an impact with the way he batted and approached things in the field. It’s infectious. He brings great energy as well and you want to have that in the environment.” Nottinghamshire’s Haseeb Hameed will captain the side in their two Tests against Sri Lanka A, while Somerset’s Tom Abell will lead them through the three-game ODI series.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/13/ecbs-mo-bobat-happy-for-steve-smith-to-gear-up-for-ashes-in-county-cricket;guardian;sports;3634

7616;7616;UK renewables generate more power than gas since September, new analysis claims;Wednesday 18 January 2023 13:43, UK;[];['energy', 'renewable energy'];['energy', 'warned', 'demand', 'grid', 'climate', 'claims', 'analysis', 'power', 'uk', 'generate', 'electricity', 'wind', 'renewables', 'winter', 'gas'];"British-based renewable energy sources have overtaken gas as the primary generator of electricity so far this winter, according to new analysis.

Since the start of October, domestic wind, hydro and solar together produced 34TWh (terawatt hours), 2TWh more than the 32 generated by gas.

The conclusion counters claims that the transition to clean power in order to meet climate targets is to blame for current energy security problems.

In fact the analysis finds that domestic renewables have, in just over three months, displaced 16% of the UK's entire annual gas imports.

The energy sector defines winter as the six month period of October to the end of March.

Adding renewable power to the grid reduces the amount of gas needed for power generation, freeing it up for thing like heating homes instead, the energy and climate think tank ECIU said.

It also allows Britain to become a net exporter of electricity when demand is high and the UK has a power surplus, it added.

But it warned that as the UK relies on gas for around 40% of power generation and some 85% of home heating, it is more dependent on the fossil fuel than any other country in Europe.

Jess Ralston, head of energy at ECIU, said: ""Wind has chosen a good year to overtake gas given how expensive gas has become and questions around its security of supply.

""As the wind industry expands alongside the rapid growth of battery storage, ever more of the electricity we use is homegrown but also plentiful enough to export.""

But the analysis warned that demand for electricity will soar in the coming years. While major new wind farms in the pipeline will help meet the increased demand, many in the energy industry are warning that the grid infrastructure needs a major update in order to keep up.

""Speeding up investment in our power grid will enable more of this cheap, natural energy to flow to homes, so bringing down bills,"" added Ms Ralston.

EU and UK negotiators need to throw out the rule book and find the spirit of 1998

I wish I had £5 for every time someone claimed to be acting in the best interests of the Good Friday Agreement.

The European Union claims the Northern Ireland Protocol protects the historic accord from the consequences of Brexit.

The President of the United States agrees.

But the UK government claims the trading arrangement, which it coincidentally co-brokered, drives a coach and horses through the 1998 deal.

And unionists in Northern Ireland agree.

The Northern Ireland Protocol avoids the need for customs or regulatory checks at a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

It established a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain instead, much to the angst of unionists who fear the union has been compromised.

They have boycotted power-sharing at Stormont for the best part of a year.

That is not going to change until EU and UK negotiators stop simply citing the Good Friday Agreement and tap into the spirit of it.

In 1998, they had the courage to throw out the rule book and recognise that the greater good does not require there to be a winner and a loser.

The rule book said those convicted of murder must serve life.

Dozens were released from prison early under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

The rule book said the Republic must retain its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland.

It dropped that claim and accepted the principle of consent.

Negotiations between the EU and the UK seem interminable because they are largely technical, the rule book providing a basis for them.

That might produce a result but it is unlikely to be one that brings the Democratic Unionists back into the power-sharing government at Stormont.

Tony Blair, co-signatory of the agreement, has repeatedly said that a solution will not be ""a matter of technical work but political will and leadership"".

2952;2952;Airbnb feels like staying with a cheap, uptight friend – then paying for the privilege | Arwa Mahdawi;2023-01-17T16:09:03Z;['Arwa Mahdawi'];['Airbnb', 'Technology', 'Hotels', 'Travel'];;"Some people call it “wasting time on Twitter”. I call it “qualitative research”. Having engaged in a lot of qualitative research recently, I’ve discovered the following: everyone is sick of Airbnb. In its early years, Airbnb was a more economical and adventurous alternative to a hotel. Nowadays, it costs a small fortune to rent a shack on Airbnb and, when you get there, you are forced to abide by a long list of rules and buy your own toilet paper. It’s become a bit like staying with your cheapest, most uptight friend – and paying them for the privilege. I’m not the only person to have made this observation. Every few weeks a tweet dunking on Airbnb seems to go viral. The latest example comes courtesy of a writer called Jeremy Gordon, who got more than 100,000 likes for tweeting the following: “Decided to stay in a Holiday Inn instead of an Airbnb for an overnight trip and strongly feel, one hour after check-in, that there has never been a more luxurious experience in all of human history.” Let me be clear that I’m not being sponsored by big hotel when I say this (if big hotel would like to sponsor me then please get in contact!), but I’m not sure I’ll ever stay in an Airbnb again. To be fair, this is partly because Airbnbs are now obscenely priced and I can’t afford to. Sometimes I look at Airbnbs for fun and then, when I find one that seems reasonable, I realise it’s actually a tent. Someone has put a bed in a tent in a field and is renting it out for more than $100 a night. The last time I stayed at an Airbnb was in 2021, before childcare ate all my disposable income. We had a new baby and wanted a relaxing few weeks away from the city, so we booked a riverside cottage in the Catskill mountains. As it turns out, “relaxing” and “three-month-old baby” don’t really mix. Being greeted with a long list of rules when we arrived didn’t help matters. Some of these rules were reasonable, some were not. Do not put drinks on the coffee table! I’m sorry, what? It’s a coffee table. The clue is in the name. You put coffee on it. If you have furniture that you don’t want people to put drinks on, then don’t rent out your place on Airbnb for a ridiculous amount of money. There were a few other hiccups with this Airbnb. The hair that had been left in the sink, for example. (The host gave us a refund on the $300 cleaning fee.) The broken dishwasher. (The host grumbled, then sent a plumber.) And the snake. The first time I went to the basement to use the washing machine, I almost stepped on a snake. “Just thought you might want to know a snake lives in your basement!” I messaged the host, who was thoroughly sick of us by now. The curt response: “Well, it’s the countryside.” That put me in my place, didn’t it? I didn’t realise that everyone in the countryside has a snake in their basement. While it may have been no big deal to the owners, it made doing the laundry eventful. First I’d pop my head into the staircase and yell: “Hello snake!” to make sure it knew I was coming. Then I had to locate the bloody thing. One day it would be hanging out on the staircase, then it would be by the dryer, then it would be hiding behind a box. I’m not snakephobic, I want to be clear, I just don’t want to pay a small fortune to stay somewhere and then have to worry about limbless reptiles slithering over me in the night.
I’m not saying Airbnb is irredeemably awful, by the way. I know that being able to let out a room on Airbnb helps some people pay their rent. It helped a couple of my friends in New York pay their rent, actually. And then one day a woman arrived and started giving birth on their kitchen floor.

1829;1829;The latest hot potato? Gas stoves. Will the culture wars never end? | Emma Beddington;2023-01-23T07:00:16Z;['Emma Beddington'];['Gas', 'Utilities', 'Food', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Coal seam gas', 'Gas', 'Ronny Jackson'];;Have you taken a side in the great stove debate? And if not, what are you waiting for? How are we supposed to keep the culture wars stoked if you won’t man the cooking-appliance barricades? For the slackers, this is a US squabble, but probably on its way to the UK. The consumer safety commissioner, Richard Trumka Jr, suggested in a recent interview that gas stoves are a “hidden hazard”, saying: “Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.” Not, at first sight, the most inflammatory (sorry) statement, particularly given that the only concrete proposal is an as-yet unlaunched consultation into their health implications. However, dedicated umbrage-takers and cooking-method libertarians heated things up nicely. One chef tweeted: “I will stay taped to this stove until the idea is completely eliminated from everybody’s minds.” Observant watchers remarked that his video showed he had taped himself facing away from the stove, rendering him unable to use it. Oven gloves came off as Republican politicians got involved: Ronny Jackson tweeted the classic promise that if “maniacs in the White House” came for his stove, they would have to “pry it out of my cold, dead hands”. Jim Jordan went for “God. Guns. Gas stoves.” Surely cooking over an oil drum barbecue with wood felled with their bare hands would be more in keeping with the pioneer spirit they fetishise, but full marks for online flame-fanning. Although research has demonstrated gas stoves do emit significant amounts of atmospheric pollutants, the White House has confirmed there is no plan to ban them. But let’s not let facts get in the way of enjoying this silliness. It’s a low or no-stakes spat almost on a par with ketchup: fridge v cupboard. So come on: where does your cooking loyalty lie? Predictably, I’m firmly in the wok-erati camp: induction all the way. The last place I lived had one, a sleek, speedy beast that crisped tofu in seconds, while Fairtrade organic rice steamed to perfection on the faintest whisper of heat. Now I’m grumpily back to gas – basically the stove equivalent of a Maga hat at this point. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/23/the-latest-hot-potato-gas-stoves-will-the-culture-wars-never-end;guardian;entertainment & culture;1829
1142;1142;The one change that didn’t work: every dog is an emotional support animal – except mine;2023-01-26T11:00:07Z;['Zoe Williams'];['Dogs', 'Life and style', 'Animals', 'Pets', 'World news'];;"There are so many benefits to having a dog, really life-altering ones: dogs give you structure, force you to exercise, help you to forge casual but, over time, meaningful bonds with the owners of other dogs, offer companionship. But more than any of that, they love you above all others. They love you to reaches you don’t even understand; one might say they teach you what love is. Every dog is an emotional support animal. But you know what? Not my dog. Romeo is an emotional drain animal. “Was he a rescue?” people always ask, which is code for: “Did you choose this bald, psychopathic wrecking ball because you are a kind but fundamentally witless person?” No, we got him off Gumtree. We met the parents multiple times. Were there any red flags? Yes, yes, there were. His mother was called Rebel and his father was called Rogue. If I’d known these descriptions were literal, that’s not what I’d have wanted in staffordshire bull terriers. I’d have wanted them to be called Patience and Elric. Rogue was always behind a baby gate when we visited, but this was because he was just too pleased to see us, and that suited me fine. I love an enthusiast; I didn’t think about what it signified, which was: “This dog, who we’ve lived with for seven years, we cannot control.”
Romeo was bold as a puppy but exhibited no real dog-on-dog aggression until he was about 11 months old, when he got into a ruck with a French bulldog. But that was fine. I picked up the frenchie, which bit me, but at least no animals were harmed. That was obviously a cracking wheeze from Romeo’s point of view, because, after that, we got into scrapes everywhere: a great dane, a ridgeback – I was constantly having to get between him and a massive great unit, who could have eaten him alive if only they’d had a fraction of his raw, tenacious savagery. Now, I only take him out on a lead, and we have these long, desultory walks that suit neither of us – he wants to move fast and kill things; I want to chat to people. All I ever get to say is “sorry”. If a walk concludes with only one incident – a sudden surge forward after a fox, for example, or a “come over here and say that” barking match with a husky across an A road – that’s a good day. The worst of it is, he really loves people, all people, an equal amount. It’s quite asymmetrical: I’m just one of potentially limitless love objects to him, while he is my One True Dog.

2137;2137;Top Tennessee pair fired after damning review of state’s execution protocol ;2023-01-21T11:00:07Z;['Maya Yang'];['Tennessee', 'US news', 'World news', 'Capital punishment'];;"Two top Tennessee officials have been fired by the corrections department after an independent report revealed striking errors in the state’s lethal injection execution protocol. According to official documents reviewed by the Tennessean newspaper, the deputy commissioner and general counsel, Debra Inglis, was fired, as well as inspector general Kelly Young, on 27 December.
The firings came a day before Governor Bill Lee publicized the report, which found that multiple executions were carried out in recent years without proper testing of the drugs used in the lethal injection death penalty process. Specifically, the report revealed that when Tennessee revised its lethal injection protocol in 2018, there was no evidence of the state ever providing the pharmacy in charge of testing the drugs with a copy of its lethal injection protocol. The report also found that the three drugs used in the state’s protocol – midazolam to sedate the person, vecuronium bromide to paralyze the person and potassium chloride to stop their heart – were not properly tested for endotoxins, a type of contaminant. Since 2018, seven prisoners have been executed in Tennessee following a nearly decade-long hiatus in executions. Five chose to die in the electric chair while two were administered lethal injections. Last April the state called off the execution of inmate Oscar Smith an hour before his scheduled execution after Lee acknowledged the state’s failure to properly adhere to its lethal injection protocol. According to the report released in December, in all seven executions since 2018, none of the lethal injections – some of which were prepared in case the person to be put to death changed their mind and opted to be executed by lethal injection instead of electrocution – were tested for endotoxins. In the case of one person who was executed by lethal injection, the report also found that the midazolam used during his execution was not tested for potency. The report revealed that in 2017, a pharmacist warned state correction officials that midazolam “‘does not elicit strong analgesic effects’, meaning ‘[t]he subjects may be able to feel pain from the administration of the second and third drugs’”. According to inmates’ expert witnesses, midazolam has been said to cause sensations of doom, panic, drowning and asphyxiation.

488;488;Roger Sawtell obituary;2023-01-29T17:38:44Z;['N/A'];['Alternative Business Structures', 'Business', 'Northampton', 'Housing', 'Engineering', 'Sheffield', 'Entrepreneurs'];;My grandfather Roger Sawtell, who has died aged 95, was a proponent of employee-owned businesses and spent much of his life either working for such enterprises or helping to set them up. Roger was born in Sheffield, the middle of three children of Horace Sawtell, a steelworks engineer, and Barbara (nee Leslie). He won scholarships to Bedford school and then the University of Cambridge, where he studied mechanical sciences, leaving with his degree in 1948 to work as an engineer at English Electric in Rugby in Warwickshire, and then Spear & Jackson in Sheffield. After 16 years at Spear & Jackson he was offered the role of managing director, but turned the offer down, as he had decided that his future should lie in working for a company with a more egalitarian business structure. He was guided on that path by his Christian beliefs, but also by a meeting he had in 1967 with the economist EF Schumacher, developer of the concept that “small is beautiful”, which affected him deeply and helped to shape the rest of his working life. In 1968 he joined Trylon, an employee-owned company in the Northamptonshire village of Wollaston that made fibreglass canoes. Throughout the 1970s he also served as chair of the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (now Co-operatives UK), and he wrote a book, How to Change to Common Ownership, which was published in 1975. In 1980, with a group of friends, Roger opened the Daily Bread Co-operative, a wholefood shop in Northampton. He worked with the business full-time until retirement in 1987, although he carried on after that as a part-time worker until 1995. Both Trylon and Daily Bread continue to trade today, owned and run by their workers. In 1984 Roger and his wife, Susan (nee Flint), whom he had married in 1957, joined up with others to combine two houses on a street in Northampton to create a Christian community of households living under one roof. Known as the Neighbours Community, it grew to encompass four other houses and was home to more than 50 people over the course of 23 years. Roger and Susan lived there from 1984 to 2007, when they moved into a retirement apartment just round the corner, at which point the project came to a natural end. In 2015, Roger’s book about life in the community, Under One Roof, was published, and the following year his autobiography, A Somewhat Upside-Down Life, also touched on his years living there. In 2019 Co-operatives UK awarded Roger their inaugural lifetime achievement award for his work in the movement. Throughout their 70s and 80s, Roger and Susan regularly visited the Greek island of Amorgos, where they loved to walk and swim. On Amorgos, as in all areas of his life, Roger made many friends, always finding time to listen to and support others. He is survived by Susan, by their three children, Ruth, Mary and Peter, and eight grandchildren.

2084;2084;Andy Murray rolled back the years, but even heroes have their limits;2023-01-21T17:13:43Z;['Andrew Anthony'];['Andy Murray', 'Australian Open 2023', 'Australian Open', 'Sport', 'Tennis'];;"Over the past week at the Australian Open in Melbourne Sir Andy Murray has often seemed more like a medieval knight than a tennis player, undergoing the kinds of physical trials and feats of endurance that were the stuff of chivalric romances. He’s even carried a war wound from previous campaigns, a metal plate that supports a damaged hip. But in the end, despite a heroic effort on Saturday, he couldn’t quite slay the dragon – or at least his third-round opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut. To have done so, he would have had to rewrite not just courtly literature but the record books. No one had ever played more than nine hours in the first two matches of a tennis tournament and gone on to win their third match. Murray played for a combined 10 hours and 34 minutes to beat Matteo Berrettini and Thanasi Kokkinakis in two epic five-setters. You could fly to LA in that time or watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy and still have room spare for an episode of Break Point, the new Netflix series that follows the next generation of tennis players. It’s full of slick images and hot-looking people that seem more attuned to the world of selfies and social media than the dogged old-school ways of Murray. Never can he have felt as old as he must have done on Saturday. Although he was running on fumes, the one defining characteristic of the Scotsman’s phenomenal career is that he doesn’t know when he’s defeated. He holds the record for the most comebacks from two sets down – a feat he’s achieved a remarkable 11 times. And no other tennis player has ever returned to the top flight after the hip resurfacing operation that he underwent in 2019.
After the match, he tweeted: “2 days ago I randomly bumped into the doctor who in 2017 told me ‘the good news is the problem you have in your hip can be fixed but you won’t be able to play professional sport again.’ I think we dispelled that myth the last 5 days.” But even heroes have their limits. Before a ball was hit Murray looked very much like anyone else who had finished their previous shift at 4am: shattered. It was no surprise that Bautista Agut ran away with the first set 6-1. The logic-defying thing is that Murray claimed the second. Despite his many successes, the Scotsman has always divided opinion. One reason is his sporting demeanour. He tends to look sluggish between points, dragging his feet around the baseline like a teenager told to clean his room. But on Saturday he also appeared stiff and hobbled, like a man who’d been force-marched across the Sahara in the wrong-sized shoes. It’s during points, though, that Murray undergoes some kind of miraculous transformation, turning from a broken shell into an elite athlete capable of the most breathtaking tennis shots. He has a well-earned reputation as one of the great returners in the game, but more than that he is arguably the best ever retriever of the ball, someone who comes explosively alive when the cause is all but lost.
A sequence he played against Kokkinakis has already become a social media sensation – somehow, dashing about so deep in the court he was almost an audience member, he managed to fend off three overhead smashes to snatch a point he had absolutely no right to win. Last week he said that while he often looks fed up on court, it’s actually when he is at his happiest “inside”. The Dunblane survivor who left home at 16 to play tennis in Barcelona has long found emotional release in a game he has been desperate to keep playing. Four years ago he was in tears at the Australian Open when it seemed as if he’d completed his last professional match, another epic five-setter, in a defeat, once again, to Bautista Agut. So he wasn’t prepared to leave the stage this time round any sooner than strictly necessary. Murray knew that he had to bust a gut to best Agut. The last thing he needed was extended rallies, but that’s exactly what he got, with scarcely a point being settled before 15, 20 or 25 shots had been played. The more it hurt, the deeper Murray dug. As he chased down the Spaniard’s clinically placed shots, he emitted yelps of alarm, like a man who rushes into the kitchen to put out a fire, only to realise that the loft is ablaze. But put out the fires he did and, playing some of the finest tennis he’s played in years, he almost took the match to five sets, before losing in four.
That might sound like a familiar story of a plucky British defeat. But Murray is a born winner and to do what he’s done in the past few days stands alongside some of his greatest achievements – and remember he has won three grand slams, two Olympic golds and become world number one in an era that boasted the three greatest men’s players who have ever picked up a tennis racket. It’s unlikely he’ll ever return to those heights again, but he has given his fans many imperishable memories – not least in the extraordinary swan song of the past week.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/21/andy-murray-rolled-back-years-but-even-heroes-have-limits;guardian;sports;2084

The estimable Vicky Krieps plays Hélène, who is dying of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a rare lung disease) and her partner is becoming her carer: this is Matthieu, played by Gaspard Ulliel – who died in a skiing accident shortly after this film was completed. Director Emily Atef dedicates the movie to him in the closing credits. The agonising, debilitating nature of the disease takes its toll on the couple and their friends and family who have no way of talking about it or coming to terms with it. Hélène is also oppressed by the way she is supposed to be joyful and grateful at being on a lung transplant list which might mean unpleasant and, if the organ is rejected, possibly futile surgery. She broods on various blogs by people from around the world with the same condition and is entranced by one from a Norwegian guy with the handle Mister (Bjørn Floberg); he is without the usual platitudes, witty and down-to-earth about his mortality.
After Mister and Hélène correspond via DM, Matthieu is deeply hurt at her announcement that she wants to go and be in Norway for a while on her own, claiming to be staying at a hotel whereas in fact she will be at Mister’s idyllic cabin by the fjord. It becomes clear that this man can understand Hélène in a way Matthieu can’t. Mister is of her tribe, the tribe of terminal illness, and she must in any case make her final journey alone. There are some false notes here: Mister does not seem to be in any way ill the way Hélène is, in fact he seems to be (bafflingly) in pretty robust health, and his home being a breathtakingly beautiful place – as opposed to, say, a nasty rented flat near a motorway – shows that he is in fact imagined with just that sentimentality that his character is supposed to reject. Matthieu’s arguments that she should at this time be with her friends and family are surely reasonable, though the film comes close to suggesting that they are just symptomatic of his failure to understand. Yet Krieps and Ulliel deliver their performances with unflinching conviction and intelligence, and it is deeply sad to think of Ulliel leaving us far too early. • More Than Ever is released on 20 January in cinemas.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/more-than-ever-review-fine-acting-end-of-life-drama-vicky-krieps-gaspard-ulliel;guardian;entertainment & culture;2804

606;606;‘Hostile takeover’: the tiny Florida university targeted by Ron DeSantis;2023-01-29T07:00:43Z;['N/A'];['Ron DeSantis', 'Florida', 'US news', 'Higher education', 'Republicans'];;"New College of Florida started making history from the day it opened its doors to its first incoming class of 101 undergraduate students in 1964. It was the first institution of higher education in Florida – which was once part of the slave-owning Confederacy – to pioneer an open admissions policy committing the school not to discriminate based on “race, creed, national origin, or cultural status”. The founding principles of the college emphasized freedom of inquiry and the eminent historian and philosopher Arnold Toynbee was lured out of retirement to join the fledgling institution’s charter faculty. New College – which became a public institution when it joined Florida’s state university system in 1975 – soon established itself as one of America’s premier liberal arts schools.
Now New College may again be on the verge of making history – but of a very different sort. Its picturesque seaside campus in the city of Sarasota, Florida, finds itself in the crosshairs of rightwing Republican state governor Ron DeSantis’s latest culture wars crusade, in this instance to destroy its unofficial reputation as a haven for approximately 650 generally progressive-leaning students, about half of whom identify themselves as non-heterosexual. Widely expected to challenge Donald Trump for the Republican party’s presidential nomination for the 2024 election, DeSantis famously declared “to the woke mob” on the night of his re-election victory last November that “Florida is where woke goes to die.” To that end, he has taken on Disney for its chief executive officer’s announcement last March that the corporation would pause all political donations within Florida after the state legislature enacted a so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill that banned the teaching of lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity to public school students in the third grade or younger. The 44-year-old DeSantis has also lately focused increasing attention on educational issues. Last year he unsuccessfully tried to bar University of Florida faculty members from testifying in criminal court trials as expert witnesses for defense attorneys. Earlier this month, he banned the teaching of an advanced placement African Studies course in all public high schools in the state because some of the course material allegedly used Black history to push a political agenda that he said was tantamount to “indoctrination”. And New College is also firmly in his sights. DeSantis’s office issued a statement on the first Friday of the new year announcing six gubernatorial appointments to New College’s 13-member board of trustees, and some of the names stunned students and faculty members alike. They included Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who has spearheaded the ongoing attack on the supposed teaching of critical race theory in primary and secondary schools; Matthew Spalding, a professor and dean at a private, conservative Christian school in Michigan called Hillsdale College that was often touted by the late Rush Limbaugh on his popular radio talk show as the kind of university his listeners should send their teenagers to; and Charles Kesler, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in southern California and editor of the conservative publication the Claremont Review of Books. Almost no one at the campus saw that one coming. “I was completely blindsided,” said Steven Shipman, a professor of physical chemistry and president of the college’s faculty union. “I basically thought that we’re such a small institution that the governor would have other priorities.”
Rufo, a senior fellow at a conservative thinktank called the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, all but declared war on New College in a barrage of tweets and press interviews in the initial days of 2023. In an interview with a New York Times columnist, the 38-year-old alumnus of Georgetown University set out his goals and those of his fellow DeSantis-appointed trustees in unequivocal language: “We want to provide an alternative for conservative families in the state of Florida to say there is a public university that reflects your values.” Rufo gleefully invoked military metaphors on Twitter to describe his tactical plans as a future trustee of New College. He announced plans to tour the campus soon with “our landing team”, and on 6 January when DeSantis’s office issued the bolt-from-the-blue statement about the future membership of the College’s board of trustees, Rufo tweeted that “we are over the walls and ready to transform higher education from within”. Some academics specializing in issues related to higher education say they have never seen a scorched-earth assault on a college or university for apparently political reasons that remotely approaches what is facing New College today. In his first campaign for the governorship of California in 1966, Ronald Reagan reserved some of his ire for the University of California’s flagship campus, which he described as “that mess at Berkeley” where the radical free speech movement had flourished. He fired the president of the University of California’s board of regents at the first meeting of the panel Reagan attended in 1967 as the state’s freshly inaugurated governor. But Berkeley survived that episode with its reputation intact, and the events of 56 years ago are small beer compared to what is currently unfolding in the Sunshine State, according to one scholar. “DeSantis makes Reagan look like an advocate for academic freedom,” said Brian Rosenberg, a visiting professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and president emeritus of Minnesota’s Macalester College. “I’ve never seen a case of a governor, who is building a political platform around being a social warrior, send in a team with a mandate to change everything from the school’s curriculum to its departments and its faculty.” Some New College alumni are among its biggest boosters. X González, who uses they/them pronouns, graduated in May 2022 with a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts, and cherished the school’s tolerance of diverse gender identities and the freedom to design their own area of concentration if none of the more than 50 existing majors on offer suited their academic curiosity and ambition. González also really liked the fact that instead of giving students a grade, faculty members produce detailed evaluations in writing of each student under their supervision. “It was so dynamically better than any other situation I could have encountered,” said the 23-year-old survivor of the Parkland school shooting, which killed three staff members and 14 students. “New College is such a transparently trans and queer school, and that’s one of the reasons why DeSantis decided to stage this hostile takeover.” The starkly contrasting views of what New College should stand for came to a head on campus last Wednesday when Rufo and another DeSantis-appointed trustee met with faculty members and students in separate sessions. Dressed in a well-tailored blue business suit and sporting a neatly trimmed beard, Rufo drastically toned down his rhetoric and cast himself as a lifelong apostle for a liberal arts education.
“I don’t want my views to be the new stifling orthodoxy on campus,” he told faculty members amid some audible snickering in the auditorium. “We want to create space for conservative students, liberal students, Marxist students. We have to have the courage to disagree with each other and live out the democratic process.” But some faculty members and students indicated they weren’t going to be drinking that Kool-Aid anytime soon. “Their rhetoric focuses on pushing their Christian and anti-science agendas while pretending to be fighting for free speech and diversity of opinions,” said Riley Wood, 19, a second-year computer sciences student who posed a question to Rufo. Wood added: “Their belief in open debate is in fact just a convenient frame for the forcible introduction of rightwing ideology into the school – and it will be dropped as soon as it fails to serve that goal.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/ron-desantis-florida-university-new-college-woke-war;guardian;entertainment & culture;606

The first of these is that the food retailers have done well.

The figures today from Tesco and from Sainsbury's on Wednesday both point to a resilient performance. Ken Murphy, the Tesco chief executive, noted that 23 December was Tesco's biggest day for sales in its history.

The German-owned hard discounters, Aldi and Lidl, have also grown sales strongly over Christmas although it is worth noting that much of their growth is coming from new store openings.

Unlike their more established UK competitors, neither Aldi nor Lidl publish 'like-for-like' sales figures, which strip out the impact of new store openings and refurbishments.

How rail strikes helped supermarkets

There are a couple of reasons why the supermarkets will have been doing well.

One is that, during the run-up to Christmas, the hospitality sector was hit severely by the rail strikes.

People who would have normally gone to pubs and restaurants for events like their office Christmas party were deterred from travelling and it appears they spent the money they saved in the supermarket.

The supermarket bosses should be sending 'thank you' letters to rail union leaders like the RMT's Mick Lynch and Aslef's Mick Whelan for giving their sales such a boost.

That is not, however, to downplay the self-help measures that both Sainsbury's and Tesco have implemented.

Both have not passed on the full extent of the cost increases they have been seeing in food to customers but have taken the hit themselves in order to remain competitive.

Subtle language changes reflect price matching fixation

Both remain fixated on matching Aldi on the prices of many of their food lines. That is even borne out in the subtle change in language that both have used about their competitors, too, as has been noted by retail Kremlinologists.

Simon Roberts, the Sainsbury's chief executive, on Wednesday referred to raising his market share against ""full line competitors"" - in other words, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, but not Aldi and Lidl, who rivals refer to as ""limited assortment"" retailers because they do not stock as many products.

Mr Roberts also, in his investor presentation, highlighted how Sainsbury's had been raising its prices more slowly than the other members of the traditional 'big four' and, in particular, how Lidl and Aldi appear to have been raising their food prices more aggressively than competitors of late.

This was something that Ken Murphy, the Tesco chief executive, also did today.

His trading statement claimed Tesco was the ""only full-line grocer"" to increase its market share against pre-pandemic figures. This again is a reference to what used to be called the 'big four'.

Eyes on Morrisons

What sector watchers will be most keen to know is how Morrisons, in particular, fared over Christmas. It succumbed to a takeover bid just over a year ago and it has been suggested that the levels of debt it took on in the process have prevented it from competing as aggressively on price as once it did.

There is an expectation that it has been losing market share - although it is worth noting in passing that, according to the chart published this week by Sainsbury's, that Morrisons has been raising prices on its biggest lines far more slowly than most of its rivals, including Aldi and Lidl.

One last point to make on food is that Marks & Spencer appears to have enjoyed a very solid Christmas.

Its UK food sales were up by 10.2% during the 13 weeks to New Year's Eve and by a very creditable 6.3% on a like-for-like basis.

M&S; traditionally always sees its share of the food market increase in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers trade up.

That certainly appears to have happened again this year: Stuart Machin, on the back of his first Christmas as chief executive, will have been pleased to note today that M&S; had market leadership in turkeys for the third consecutive year.

Strong Christmas for clothes

The second big theme to highlight is that it has been a good Christmas for clothes sales, as has been borne out by strong trading updates from Next, JD Sports and today from M&S;, which pointed out that its market share in clothing and home sales - the most problematic part of the business for many years - was more than 10% during the period, its highest level since 2015.

There are a couple of reasons why clothing sales may have done well.

One is that the weather in December was very cold, which will have benefited sales of seasonal lines, such as coats and jumpers.

How lower inflation helped make clothes good value

The other is that clothing will have represented good value this year. As the British Retail Consortium figures published last week highlighted, non-food inflation in November was running at 4.8% and in December at 4.4%.

That is not only appreciably lower than the headline rate of inflation, it is also lower than the average rate at which pay has been growing. Clothes will have represented good value this year as Christmas presents.

This uptick in clothing sales appears to have been strongest among physical retailers.

More help from strikes

Some people appear to have been deterred by the strikes afflicting Royal Mail from shopping online, as borne out by the update today from Asos, the leading online-only fashion retailer, whose UK sales during the four weeks to New Year's Eve were down 8% on 2021.

The third over-riding theme is that, so far, Christmas for retailers has proved significantly better than had been feared.

Why a lot of people got air-fryers for Christmas

AO World, the online electrical goods retailer, lifted its full-year earnings forecast pretty dramatically earlier this week after enjoying a solid performance in the final three months of the year.

It and its rival Marks Electrical have both done well - which has raised hopes among investors that Currys, the market leader, also enjoyed a good Christmas.

Its shares are up by more than 17% since the start of the year.

What will be interesting to see, when Currys updates the market, is whether its sales mix continues to reflect the changes it and others have noted in recent months.

It does not look to have been a particularly strong Christmas for tech - reflecting in part a lacklustre line-up of new product releases from the industry's big guns - but sales of energy-saving products have been doing well.

A lot of people, it seems, will have received an air-fryer for Christmas.

Why so strong? The main reason appears to be that UK households are far from having burned through the billions of pounds worth of savings enforced on them during the pandemic when lockdowns prevented millions from going out or going on holiday.

Paying more for fewer goods

To that, though, must be added a couple of caveats. One is that inflation will have flattered sales numbers. As the BRC pointed out this week, retail sales values in December were up by nearly 7% in 2021, but the volume of goods was ""significantly down"".

In other words, people were paying more for fewer goods.

The other caveat is to note how cautious most of the trading updates have been about trade in coming months.

Lord Wolfson of Next said last week that he expects both sales and profits for the next financial year to be down on the one just ending, reflecting a series of pressures, including ongoing inflation in essential goods and particularly energy, as well as rising mortgage costs.

The Office for National Statistics pointed out this week that more than 1.4 million UK households will this year be coming off fixed-rate mortgages that, in the majority of cases, were set at below 2%.

Their new mortgages will be at significantly higher interest rates and that will reduce the disposable incomes of those households affected by several hundred pounds each month.

That is why, despite some strong Christmas showings in many cases, retailers remain exceptionally cautious.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230112181830/http://news.sky.com/story/high-street-sales-what-major-retailers-christmas-results-tell-us-about-the-economy-12785074;skynews;business & economy;1170

2816;2816;Dating burnout: meet the people who ditched the apps – and found love offline;2023-01-18T10:00:01Z;['Lizzie Cernik'];['Dating', 'Relationships', 'Online dating', 'Internet', 'Life and style', 'Technology'];;"When Georgie Thorogood’s date made a sleazy joke about “horsey girls carrying whips”, she knew it was time to make a hasty exit. After meeting Tom through a dating app in the summer of 2021, she had been hoping for some polite conversation over a few drinks, maybe some romantic chemistry if she was lucky. What she got was a two-hour rant about his ex-wife and some creepy innuendo. “I knew straight away he wasn’t for me. I politely told him I didn’t want to see him again, but he took the rejection really badly. I work in music communications and at the time I was setting up a festival. He started getting aggressive and telling me that I was destined to fail,” she says. “I don’t know how he could possibly know that, as he didn’t ask me a single question about myself all night.” Her bad experience, which came after months of mindless swiping, was the final straw for Georgie, 40. “Not only did I find dating apps soul-destroying, I was also happy with my single life, so I decided to quit them completely and focus on that instead,” she says. “I found so many of the men on apps had serious issues, too. Another guy became abusive when I turned down an offer to meet for a walk in a remote location because it didn’t feel safe. You never know who people are online.” While Georgie acknowledges that people with emotional baggage aren’t exclusive to dating sites, she feels the apps give them a chance to hide their bad behaviour. “The problem is that you don’t have to reflect or make changes when something goes wrong – you can just swipe to the next person.” By the autumn of 2021, Georgie, who lives in Essex, had thrown herself into work and was enjoying spending her free time with friends and family. Then, out of the blue, she met Mark Bamford, 50, who lives in London and owns a music tech company. “He was introduced to me at the British Country Music awards,” she says. “I was on the board of directors for the awards and someone suggested he might be a good sponsor for a festival I was working on.” The pair immediately hit it off and exchanged numbers. In January 2022, they went on their first date, in London, and a relationship soon developed. “When you meet someone in person, you know their vibe. He’s warm and engaging and we both like to talk a lot. He’s very easy to be with, but you don’t get that when you’re trying to communicate over an app,” she says.
Mark, who also dabbled in dating apps before meeting Georgie, feels the same way. “I didn’t have to worry that she was still on an app, swiping left and right for weeks, which made things more relaxed. Of course, people can multidate with or without an app, but I think that tech nudges you in the direction of temptation,” he says. “The scandal of apps is that the business model is the opposite of the stated goal. They need to get more users, not get people together. The more they attract people back, the more money they can make by selling data.” The apps offer users a potential army of attractive suitors at their fingertips, so it’s no surprise that they become more picky. Claire Davis, 43, a personal trainer from London, stopped using them in 2015 because she hated the “shopping lists” of demands, as well as the lack of boundaries. “One guy told me he wanted children on the first date, which was really intense,” she says. “It was like he was checking off things he wanted in a partner. I’d recently had an ectopic pregnancy and him mentioning children so soon was such an uncomfortable topic. Because the apps are so disposable, he could just swipe again if he didn’t find what he was looking for straight away.” She met her partner, James Davis, 50, also a personal trainer from London, in a pub, shortly after quitting the apps. “I had come out of a divorce and was a bit broken,” she says. “I’d vaguely known James years before, but when we saw each other in 2015 through some mutual friends there was a spark.” He was based in Ibiza and she was in Surrey, but it didn’t stop them from connecting. “I wasn’t sure what I wanted after my divorce, but because we met in real life I had the chance to work that out over time,” Claire says. “On a dating app, you only really get one shot.” Six months later, they became a couple and they married in 2017. They now run a health and fitness business in London.
James, who divorced in his 40s, also found dating apps soulless. “I got very turned off by it,” he says. “I’d grown up meeting people in real life, so I found it too prescriptive. I would start a conversation and after two sentences of introduction someone would say they were only looking for a long-term relationship. I know they wanted to rule out hook-ups, but it felt very defensive as a starting point.” While dating apps encourage users to select their dates by criteria such as height, age or occupation, real-world encounters can bring us face to face with people we might not usually consider. Payal Sumaria, 41, says she never would have met her boyfriend, Sagar Patel, 29, through an app, due to the gap in their ages. “We met at the wedding of a mutual friend in May last year. When we started chatting, there was no intention – we were just two people having a conversation,” she says. They stayed in contact after the wedding and discovered a shared love for hiking. “We met up a few weeks later to go for a walk and there was no pressure at all,” says Sagar. “It was just two friends doing a fun activity we both enjoyed.” As a result, they found it easier to open up and be honest with each other. “I felt very comfortable in his presence. I didn’t feel the need to impress him. I could talk to him for hours and we laughed constantly,” says Payal. Before they met, Sagar had found it hard to get matches on dating apps. “When I did match with someone, I’d feel under a lot of pressure to make the conversation flow well and be my ‘best self’, because I knew there was a lot of competition,” he says. “You feel like you’re one of 100 candidates going for a job.”
Payal says she struggled with apps because they exacerbated her anxiety. “My mum died when I was young, which left me with some issues around abandonment. I’ve done a lot of work in the past few years to build my self-esteem, but apps made it worse.” In 2020, she met a man who was particularly cruel. “He came on really strong for a few dates and then panicked. He was avoidant and sent mixed messages. When he got back in contact, he became very abusive in his messages,” she says. “On dating apps, there is a navigation period while you work out who someone is and what their intentions are. As well as wasting your time, it can really knock your confidence when someone isn’t what you expected.” April Ashby, 58, a dating expert from Surrey, runs a traditional matchmaking service, but recently gave apps a go herself, to see what the competition had to offer. “I was only on them for a few weeks before giving up,” she says. “It felt exhausting, like a full-time job. I had one guy who wanted me to start sending sexts to him before we’d even had a conversation.” Lying was common, she discovered, while people often shared old pictures or appeared very different from their profiles. “Why bother lying and saying you’re 10 years younger? People will find out eventually.” Many of her own clients have told her they have been frightened off dating apps after becoming targets or victims of financial fraud. “Organised crime groups are now following scripts and they can pick out the most vulnerable people based on things they write in their profiles,” she says. Like Payal and April, Rebecca Oliver, 32, a marketing manager from Cheshire, has encountered a lot of dishonest men online. “In 2021, I went out with a guy who seemed really nice for a couple of months,” she says. “Then, one day, he had something wrong with his car and disagreed with the man who was helping to fix it. He started getting really angry and the police were called. He was kicking wheelie bins and all sorts,” she says. “When the police arrived, he switched back into charming mode and I realised he’d been hiding his real self. I felt like he’d pulled the wool over my eyes.” Another date “kicked off” when she offered to buy him an ice-cream. “He thought I was insinuating that he couldn’t afford to buy one himself. It was completely bizarre,” she says. “It made me realise there’s a lot less accountability online. People can’t keep up a facade if you meet them through your local community. But through an app, you get to know people as a solo entity, rather than with their friends or family.”
During the summer of 2021, she threw in the towel on apps and began to focus on herself. “I spent a lot of time getting fit instead,” she says. “Then, later that year, my trainer asked if I’d like to be introduced to a friend of his who I might like.” She was set up on a blind date with Javier Ojeda, 45, who owns a property development business and also lives in Cheshire. “I had more trust in the relationship straight away, because it felt like he came with a seal of approval,” she says. Javier, who has never tried internet dating, says the concept seems too contrived. “It’s all well and good swiping, but I like introducing myself to someone in person,” he says. “As soon as I met Rebecca, it was obvious that it was going to have some legs.” Within six weeks, they were using a shared calendar; they soon met each other’s friends and family. “We got a puppy together five months later and Rebecca moved in last year. It grew really quickly, but in a very organic way,” he says. She also believes that meeting through a friend meant they were less inhibited by dating rules. “On apps, people are dating lots of others, so you feel as though you have to follow a certain schedule before you can have a conversation about exclusivity. That didn’t happen offline.” For Payal, leaving dating apps behind had a positive impact on her mental wellbeing. “Apps do help you to meet people, but they can be exhausting, because you’re answering the same questions over again,” she says. “I felt like I was trying to explain my existence to strangers. Trying to maintain conversations [in writing] was difficult, too, especially as I have dyslexia. Sometimes I would ask a friend to help me with my replies.” Like Georgie, she believes that apps make it easier for people to hide their real selves, even after you have met in real life. “The hardest part about dating is working out what someone really wants. I met some nice people, but lots of them were not emotionally capable of being in a real relationship. Often, people don’t even realise that and they just jump from date to date. Meeting someone offline eliminates some of that, as you can get a better picture of who someone is from the start.” Some names have been changed";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/18/dating-burnout-meet-the-people-who-ditched-the-apps-and-found-love-offline;guardian;entertainment & culture;2816
1026;1026;Former MP Jared O’Mara owed thousands to drug dealer, court hears;2023-01-26T18:42:20Z;['Mark Brown'];['UK news'];;A former Labour MP accused of expenses fraud was thousands of pounds in debt to a drug dealer and regularly took up to five grams of cocaine a day, a court has heard. Jared O’Mara also once drank a litre of vodka before a television interview with BBC Look North and believed “a shadowy government cabal” was out to get him, his former chief of staff Gareth Arnold said in messages and police interviews read to jurors at Leeds crown court. O’Mara, 41, was MP for Sheffield Hallam after he defeated the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg at the 2017 election. He is on trial at Leeds crown court accused of making fraudulent parliamentary expense claims amounting to nearly £30,000. Prosecutors allege he was living beyond his means and was in dire need of cash to fund a substantial cocaine habit. On Thursday jurors heard details of dozens of WhatsApp and text messages exchanged between O’Mara and Arnold The prosecution has said the mobile messages contain references to money-making schemes, rule bending, deleting records and demanding money from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). On Thursday, the prosecutor James Bourne-Arton read a number of messages to the court. One was from April 2019, with Arnold messaging a friend saying: “He’s a few k in debt with a dealer.” The friend replied: “That’s a very dangerous game that. He wants to be careful no bad lads come for him. He’s on 80k a year ffs.” In another message from Arnold to O’Mara in July 2019, he says he has seen the MP’s mental health deteriorate over a number of years and his drug abuse spiral into something “quite strange”, saying he is “definitely no longer the great, motivated person I once knew”. In a message from O’Mara to Arnold, the former MP talks about being “three days clean in a couple of hours and that’s the longest I’ve gone in longer than I can remember”. A message from Arnold to O’Mara reads: “Jared I’ve tried but you got shit-faced before Look North TV interview and then harassed a young female member of staff.” In police interviews Arnold said O’Mara’s parents would bring their son a litre of vodka if not every day, then every other day, “along with 60 fags and bottles of Mountain Dew”. On the Look North incident, Arnold said: “He drank a litre of vodka before the interview and then denies it … I even asked his parents about it and they’re like, ‘he wasn’t drunk, he was hammered’.” The court was played audio of the phone call Arnold made to police in July 2019 in which he accused O’Mara of making false expense claims. Arnold tells the call handler that O’Mara has delusions of a conspiracy. “He’s started to entertain the idea that some kind of shadowy government cabal is trying to bring him down and loads of other absolutely irrational beliefs.” DI Andrew Shields, now retired, was the South Yorkshire police officer in charge of the investigation. He said he met Arnold on 2 July 2019. “He appeared to be agitated, quite stressed, possibly at the end of his tether a little bit.” There were three strands to Arnold’s claims, Shields said. The first was around O’Mara’s mental health and wellbeing. “He believed him to be in crisis.” The second was around the submission of invoices to Ipsa. The third was around O’Mara’s use of cocaine, “anything up to five grams a day”. O’Mara is accused of making four fraudulent claims to Ipsa between June and August 2019 from a “fictitious” organisation called Confident About Autism SY, and submitting two invoices from Arnold for media and PR work that prosecutors say was never carried out. It is also claimed that O’Mara submitted a false contract of employment for a friend, John Woodliff, “pretending” that he worked as a constituency support officer. O’Mara is charged with eight counts of fraud by false representation, with Arnold jointly charged with six of the offences, and Woodliff jointly charged with one. All three men deny all charges. O’Mara was MP between 2017 and 2019, resigning from Labour in 2018 and serving as an independent. He appeared at Leeds crown court via video link from his home in Sheffield.

1663;1663;Everyone Else Burns review – a comedy to become religiously devoted to;2023-01-23T22:35:16Z;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Simon Bird', 'TV comedy'];;"What do we come to British comedy for if not to be wholly charmed by tales of suburban doomsday cults? It’s so perfect a setup that I am surprised it didn’t become a staple of the genre long before Dillon Mapletoft and Oliver Taylor’s venture, Everyone Else Burns (Channel 4), came along. But if historically someone has been slacking, this new comedy is worth the wait. Simon Bird – youthful star of The Inbetweeners and Friday Night Dinner, now disconcertingly all grown up – is David, the fanatical head of a family who are members of an evangelical, doomsday-awaiting sect, the Order of the Divine Rod. We meet him rousing his wife and children in the middle of the night to gather their prepper bags and hike out of the city because the apocalypse is imminent. His son, Aaron (Harry Connor), is delighted – “Finally!” – while his daughter, Rachel (Amy James-Kelly), is terrified; Fiona (Kate O’Flynn), his wife, is stoic. It turns out to be a test, but you do what you have to do when you are a Christian patriarch bent on securing your loved ones’ places in heaven and on being promoted to church elder over your rival, the smug but popular Andrew (Kadiff Kirwan). The jokes come thick, fast and funny. Some take aim at targets you might expect when your premise centres on a religious cult: another family is shunned for “drug dealing”, which soft-hearted Rachel thinks is harsh, but “they knew what they were doing when they opened that cafe,” Fiona tells her firmly. Others venture into more bizarre, yet still logical, territory. There is a running gag involving David’s proficiency at the sorting office where he works, specifically his ability to weigh parcels by hand and lob them unseeing over his shoulder into exactly the right basket – the world’s most perfectly suburban God-given gift. Another running gag is Aaron’s artwork – mostly violent depictions of his father suffering in the afterlife – as the boy attempts to work through his rage at being cheated of the apocalypse he was promised. “The suburbs should be a crater by now!”
The heart of the show, however, pumping life into its veins and giving us some more relatable people to root for, is the women. Fiona is doing her best to be the faithful and obedient wife that David and the Order demand, but you can see it is an increasing struggle. She longs for a new television to replace the one David poured a jug of water over and, against all teachings, she begins to assert her independence by starting up her own business, with the help of her magnificent secular neighbour, Melissa (the magnificent Morgana Robinson). “But the Bible says women will be fulfilled by making the home their work,” an uncertain Fiona says. “And have you, personally, found that?” enquires Melissa. “No,” says Fiona. “But I’ve only been doing it 17 years.” “I’d ask more,” says her friend, “but I don’t want to be sad.” Rachel is the epitome of a painfully uncool teenager, alienated from her peers by her plain clothes, lack of phone and inability to go out unless it is to knock on doors to proselytise. Her growing friendship with a former Order member called Joshua (Ali Khan) – he even smuggles her a phone – is genuinely touching and, I fear, may break my heart at some point. On top of denying her a social life, her parents also intend to stop Rachel going to university. They condemn her for getting good grades – a clear sign that she has been spending time revising instead of spreading God’s word. Her teacher, Miss Simmonds (Lolly Adefope, still not being given enough to do, but hitting what she is given out of the park every time), encourages Rachel not to abandon her efforts. “I’ve got a lot of goodwill riding on this. And actual money.” Although, unfortunately, “my local betting shop has banned me online and in person”. The hyper-religiosity is used to look anew at family dynamics and dysfunction; how blind you can be to abnormalities if they are all you know; and the need to break free. Mapletoft and Taylor do this without mocking faith itself. David’s unwitting hypocrisy and unshakeable selfishness (pushing a mother and her sick baby behind him in the Elders’ advice queue) are the butt of the jokes; the extremity and perversion of Christianity by the Order is what they have in their sights. Beyond that, it’s simply very, very funny, all the way.

3794;3794;National Science and Media museum in Bradford to close for £6m refurb;2023-01-13T06:00:09Z;['Mark Brown'];['Museums', 'Culture', 'Bradford', 'North of England', 'Yorkshire', 'UK news'];;"The National Science and Media museum is to close for a year for a “radical, once-in-a-generation” revamp that will allow more visitors to attend and provide the ability to tell stories in a more dynamic way, bosses say. The museum in Bradford has a vast, dizzyingly diverse collection of more than 3.2m objects, from the first photographic negative to the original puppet of Zippy from Rainbow. On Friday it announced details of a £6m capital project that will create two new “object-rich” galleries and bring changes such as improvements to the main entrance. It will mean closure from June this year until the summer of 2024, with the revamped museum open in time for Bradford’s stint in 2025 as the UK capital of culture. The museum’s director, Jo Quinton-Tulloch, said it was an exciting, once-in-a-generation opportunity. “It is a fantastic moment for the museum. We are going to be transforming the visitor offer and it will be here for decades to come, I can’t stress that enough,” she said. She explained it was partly about telling stories that were more relevant and meaningful to people and their lives today. One of the galleries will have a storytelling theme and include a Dalek that draws people into the story of the BBC radiophonic workshop. Later on, visitors will be able to see the fangs worn by Christopher Lee in the 1958 Hammer horror film Dracula. Also on display will be the cameras used by two girls to take fake photographs of the Cottingley fairies a century ago. “Some people might think manipulation of images is only a thing of our current period, with Photoshop and cut and paste,” said Quinton-Tulloch. “But, actually, there has been manipulation almost from the beginning of photography.” She said the aim was to show how all areas of the collection, from photography to gaming, “are embedded in every aspect of our lives”. Curators hope the museum will inspire the next generation of “creatives, inventors and scientists”. The last refurbishment on a similar scale was in 1999, when a sharp-suited Pierce Brosnan, as James Bond, arrived in a helicopter to reopen the-then National Media Museum after a £16m refresh. This revamp is pegged to Bradford’s city of culture year in 2025, when the museum hopes to be one of the star attractions and the city hopes to attract a million extra visitors. The refurbishment will include remodelling two floors, opening up unused spaces and “reimagining the display and interpretation of the core collections”. The ground floor will be reconfigured; the entrance improved and an additional lift installed – all of which will allow the museum to “welcome many more visitors”. From February, before the closure, the displays on levels 3 and 5 will be gradually removed so the coming weeks are the time, a spokesperson said, for people to visit to say a temporary farewell to their favourite objects. The museum is a much-loved institution, remembered by generations of schoolchildren as the place where they read news from an Autocue or flew, like a character from Jason and the Argonauts, on a magic carpet.
But it has often had identity issues and suffered fears of imminent closure. It opened as the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in 1983 but became more than that, and was renamed the National Media Museum in 2006. Many people had no idea what that really meant. In 2016 there was fury in some quarters when custody of its world-famous photography collection was moved to the V&A. The next year it opened its new interactive Wonderlab gallery and was renamed again, this time becoming the National Science and Media Museum.

1294;1294;‘I buckled when I saw her remains’ – the biopic about ‘Europe’s first female suicide bomber’;2023-01-25T16:19:12Z;['Steve Rose'];"['Film', 'Paris attacks', 'Drama films', 'Culture', 'France', 'Islamic State', ""Women's rights and gender equality""]";;"‘I believe stories choose people,” says Dina Amer, explaining why she spent six difficult years making a film about the woman dubbed “Europe’s first female suicide bomber”. She adds: “I never would have chosen this story in a million years.” It later transpired that the woman, Hasna Aït Boulahcen, did not, in fact, blow herself up. She was in an apartment raided by French police in November 2015, shortly after the Islamist terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub, the Stade de France and other Paris locations that killed 137 people. Also in the apartment was Boulahcen’s cousin, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who had masterminded the attacks and persuaded Boulahcen to join Islamic State. With the apartment surrounded, another of the terrorists is thought to have detonated the explosives. Moments before, Boulahcen was heard screaming to police outside: “Please help! Let me jump! I want to leave!”
Amer, then an Egyptian-American journalist based in New York, was in Paris to cover the attacks for Vice News. “I reported that fake news headline just like everyone else,” she says, referring to the claim that Boulahcen was a suicide bomber. But unlike everyone else, Amer couldn’t let the story go – or maybe the story wouldn’t let her go. “I was completely possessed and obsessed with Hasna,” she says, speaking by video from the Sundance film festival. “I had no choice but to make the film.” Amer approached Boulahcen’s mother, a first-generation Moroccan immigrant, who let the director into her apartment on the outskirts of Paris. “She said, ‘You look like Hasna. You laugh like her. You walk like her.’ She said, ‘I feel like Hasna is the one who brought you to us. I think she’s inside of you.’ I realised this wasn’t a film about terrorism. This was a story about a dysfunctional family and a woman struggling with her sense of self. This was a film about a woman who resembled me.” Amer spent over 360 hours interviewing Boulahcen’s family, even accompanying them to the morgue to view her remains, five months after the attacks. “There was this glass casing,” says Amer. “She was like a mummy at the Louvre. I saw her, but for all my so-called courage, my body buckled. I couldn’t get close to that glass.” It was a surreal scene, she says, the mother praying, the sister hysterical.
The result, Amer’s first film, is You Resemble Me. Its title refers to the director’s own feelings, but also Boulahcen’s close bond with her younger sister, Mariam. At the start of the film, the two – played by real-life sisters Lorenza and Ilonna Grimaudo – are thick as thieves, escaping from their mother and living almost feral in the Paris suburbs. But they are rounded up by social services and cruelly farmed out to separate foster parents. As a grown woman, Boulahcen is something of a lost soul, drifting between jobs, friends’ apartments, nightclubs and, it is implied, sex work – just the type of misfit Islamic State preyed upon, although Amer’s film points to any number of causes for Boulahcen’s tragic life, including French society at large and her dysfunctional family. You Resemble Me is not a straightforward dramatisation, though. As a grownup, Boulahcen is portrayed by three different actors, including Amer herself. Immediately after her death, the media circulated images of three different women they identified as Boulahcen, Amer explains. The film also switches jarringly into documentary mode in its latter stages, as we meet Boulahcen’s real-life relatives. It is a fractured narrative for a fractured identity. “She had these broken pieces within her,” says Amer, “feeling like, ‘I don’t belong anywhere.’ And the toll of shapeshifting, finding connection and that fragility, I think it was the death of her. I felt her struggle, her contradiction, because I’m living it.” Amer’s own upbringing wasn’t quite as challenging. She grew up in the US, after her parents emigrated from Egypt. Her father is a doctor and her mother did development work. But she still faced challenges reconciling her Muslim and American identities. “There was pressure on me from my parents, bless them, to be this perfect Arab girl who was at the pinnacle of modernity and still abiding by all the rules of being a good Muslim girl.”
Like her idol, CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour, Amer became a journalist. She went undercover to document the sex-trafficking of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. She reported on tunnels under Gaza and was knocked unconscious during the Arab spring in Egypt. Now she describes herself as “a recovering journalist”. After covering Boulahcen’s story, she became disenchanted with the news model of “soaking it up and blasting it out and moving on to the next place where there’s grief and trauma and pain. There isn’t a space for intimacy and immersion and nuance – really travelling into the grey of a story. And I think the grey is sacred. That’s where we can all meet each other.” She got a scholarship to NYU film school, where Spike Lee was her professor. When she asked him if she should finish the course or drop out to make the film, he replied: “Pray on it.” She left, and got a multi-million dollar deal with Amazon, but they wanted her to make a straight documentary, while Amer wanted to tell the story her way. So she walked away and chose to make the film independently, which partly explains why it all took so long. In the end, though, the actual shoot lasted just two and a half weeks, especially impressive considering the natural performances she gets from her child actors. “Everything was hard,” she says, “so directing kids just felt like another aspect of what it took to make this film.” Fortunately, Amer had accumulated some film-maker allies along the way. You Resemble Me’s producers include Lee, Spike Jonze, Alma Har’el and Riz Ahmed. They gave her advice as the film slowly progressed. “All of them know what it feels like to be ‘the other’,” says Amer.
“I think we’ve all got a similar point of view on the world and the role of stories,” says Ahmed, who met Amer “randomly” 10 years ago. “We’ve all, over the last 20 years, lived through this troubling war on terror with its tendency to dehumanise and simplify. So it’s easy to double down on those narratives. Dina understands, both from her personal experience and her professional experience, the importance of rebalancing those two-dimensional portrayals with something truly empathic.” Har’el, whose films have also blended fiction and documentary, agrees: “It’s really hard to capture nuance when you practice film-making that is very generic and has to fall into festival categories and distribution categories, and all sorts of ideas society has imposed on films. Sometimes it takes an artist like Dina to step out of those binary ideas of film-making and identity.” In 2016, Har’el launched Free the Bid, which advocates for more women directors in cinema and advertising. Similarly, in 2021, Ahmed co-launched a Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion in the film industry. This is not just about inclusion being an inherently good thing; it is also about representation as a tool for resolving issues of integration and alienation. Ahmed has been outspoken on these matters. In 2017, he told the British parliament that a lack of diverse narratives could lead minority citizens to “switch off and retreat to fringe narratives, to bubbles online and sometimes even off to Syria”.
You Resemble Me, says Ahmed, is not a treatise about extremism or religion, though. “To me, this film is about women who are stuck between a rock and a hard place of competing forms of chauvinism or patriarchy. And how things can boil over when they aren’t allowed space – a safe place to express themselves, to just survive, let alone thrive.” Amer says she is “exhausted with identity politics” and would love to make a film that is “post-identity”. She mentions one interviewee for the film who backed out on discovering she was Muslim. “He said, ‘You’re part of the problem. You are creating a barrier between yourself and our society by putting that label on yourself. And we should all be leaving our religions and our roots at the door and living as equals.’ That’s a beautiful idea. But why do I have to scrub off where I come from in order to fit in to your vision of an equal society?” Like her mentors, Amer is striving to bring that post-identity world into being, by recognising the individuality and humanity of subjects who have often been stereotyped. She’s no longer a “recovering journalist” but a film-maker with a mission. “The risk is exhilarating and also quite taxing,” she says. “But I feel like I’ve fallen in love with it and have no choice but to carry on. Film is transformative. It can save people’s lives.” You Resemble Me is released in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 3 February.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/25/europes-first-female-suicide-bomber-hasna-ait-boulahcen-paris-attacks-dina-amer;guardian;entertainment & culture;1294
7582;7582;China 'more likely' to invade Taiwan - and attack could come in 2027, island's foreign minister Joseph Wu warns;Wednesday 18 January 2023 07:34, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];['china', 'taiwan'];['joseph', 'chinese', 'previous', 'minister', 'likely', 'wu', 'xi', 'situation', 'warns', 'foreign', 'islands', 'invade', 'china', 'military', 'taiwan', 'come', 'war'];"Taiwan's foreign minister has said he believes China is now ""more likely"" to invade Taiwan to distract from leader Xi Jinping's domestic problems.

Speaking exclusively to Sky News in his first sit-down interview of the year, Joseph Wu set 2027 as the key date such action will most likely happen.

His words come at a time when tensions across the Taiwan strait are the highest they've been for many years, with China now flying fighter jets towards Taiwanese airspace on a daily basis.

Mr Wu also said that the current ""status quo"" arrangement, in which Taiwan is self-governing but does not officially declare independence, ""might not last forever"", in a rare acknowledgement that the island might one day either be assimilated by China or become an independent country.

Taiwan is a democratic, self-governing island that China sees as its own.

Despite it having never been controlled by the governing Communist Party, bringing Taiwan under Chinese control has been described by President Xi Jinping as at the ""core of China's core interests"".

Mr Wu acknowledged that ""the situation in the last year compared to the two previous years is much worse"", but said: ""To me, 2027 is the year that we need to watch out for.""

""In 2027, Xi Jinping is likely to go into his fourth term, and, if in his previous three terms he cannot claim any achievement during his office, he might need to think about something else for him to claim as his achievement or his legacy.

""If you look at the Chinese situation right now, the economy is going down. People are not happy, the real estate business seems to be melting down.

""If Xi Jinping cannot change the situation domestically in China, you might want to resort to a use of force or creating a crisis externally to divert domestic attention or to show to the Chinese that he has accomplished something.

""We are concerned that Taiwan might become his scapegoat.""

'A tiny little accident might spark major war'

Chinese fighter jets are now flying towards Taiwanese airspace and crossing the so-called 'median line' – the unofficial maritime border – on a daily basis.

The number increased five-fold between 2020 and 2022 with the highest ever daily count recorded just three weeks ago.

Mr Wu said that the ""worst case scenario"" happening is now ""more likely"" than in previous years, and described how precarious the situation can be.

""Look at the proximity of the Chinese aircraft to our aircraft,"" he said.

""If they cross the 24 nautical miles zone, some of our weapons systems might have to target those Chinese aircraft, and that might spark an accident, even though it might not be intentional for the Chinese pilots to cross the 24 nautical miles.

""Very often, you see the sum of a tiny little accident might spark into a major war.

""We worry that might happen.""

The only thing to prevent that sudden escalation now, he added, is ""self-restraint"".

""Our pilots are very well-trained; they know they cannot fire the first shot,"" Mr Wu said.

Is Taiwan prepared for a war against China?

There have been suggestions from military experts that Taiwan is not well enough prepared if war did come to the island.

Taiwan only spends 2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, which is lower than countries like the United States and around half the amount spent by Israel.

According to analysis, it also does not have enough munitions, struggles to meet recruitment quotas within the armed forces and has not focused enough on the kind of asymmetric capabilities it would need to fight a war with China.

The foreign minister rejected the idea Taiwan is complacent, but acknowledged it has previously been slow to prepare.

""We understand that in previous years, we might not have acquired sufficient ammunition,"" he said.

""In previous years, we might not have sufficient training for our military personnel. And in previous years, we understand that the number of our soldiers in defending Taiwan might not be enough, but look at the reform measures the president has announced.""

Taiwan has recently extended compulsory military service from four months to a year, increased the defence budget and is attempting to kickstart domestic production of drones and missiles.

""We are trying everything we can to make Taiwan prepared, to make Taiwan capable of defending itself,"" Mr Wu said.

While he insisted Taiwan would be willing to negotiate with China, he was clear that it doesn't ""welcome political preconditions"".

""Accepting those Chinese preconditions means that we are submitting to China, and that is something that the people here in Taiwan would never accept, but our door is open,"" he said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118074726/http://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179;skynews;politics;1673
7777;7777;Transgender woman on trial in Glasgow accused of raping two women;Thursday 19 January 2023 18:07, UK;[];['glasgow', 'scotland'];['met', 'women', 'victim', 'telling', 'witness', 'transgender', 'court', 'sex', 'woman', 'glasgow', 'trial', 'raping', 'accused', 'alleged', 'told', 'going'];"A woman has told a court she repeatedly said ""no"" when she was allegedly raped by a man who now identifies as a transgender woman.

The alleged victim told the High Court in Glasgow she was ""so scared"" and ""just didn't know what was going on"".

Isla Bryson, 31, is on trial accused of raping two women, one in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, in 2016 and one in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019.

She is also accused of telling one alleged victim to wash the sheets and threatening her family in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice.

Bryson denies the charges and has lodged special defences claiming the sex was consensual.

She also denies a further charge of punching the second alleged victim.

In agreed evidence it was accepted that Bryson now identifies as a transgender woman and was previously known as Adam Graham.

'I felt sick to the stomach'

One alleged victim, 30, said she was raped while they were in bed at her mother's home in Clydebank.

She told the court: ""All I said was 'no' over and over and over again.

""At the time I was so scared. Sick to the stomach. I just didn't know what was going on.""

She said the accused later threatened her family with harm if she told anyone.

The witness said after the alleged rape they both fell asleep and did not speak until the morning as she was ""scared"".

She denied they spoke about redecorating her mother's kitchen immediately afterwards.

She also denied initiating sexual contact and kissing the accused goodnight following the alleged rape.

She said they spent the following day together and redecorated her mother's kitchen.

The witness said she spoke to police days later after telling her sister.

'I said to stop'

The second alleged victim told the court the accused continued to have sex with her after she said stop.

The 34-year-old said they met on the social media app Bigo, where the accused was named DJ Blade.

The day after first meeting in June 2019, they were at her home in Drumchapel watching soaps.

She told the court she suggested they watch TV in the bedroom and she asked the accused to wait while she changed into her pyjamas.

She said the accused took his clothes off and removed her pyjama bottoms to perform a sex act she consented to, but she told him to stop as he was biting her.

The court heard from her police statement that during sex she told him to stop as he was ""crushing"" her.

The statement said the accused told her to ""stay there"" because he ""wasn't finished"".

She told the court: ""I said to stop but he just kept on going, and that's when I just closed my eyes and I am doing what he wanted to do.""

The witness said that afterwards, she went to another room as she did not want to be in the same room as him.

She told the court that in the morning he accused her of looking at him in a funny way, punched her on the back, leaving bruises, and then left in a taxi.

Under cross-examination by defence advocate Edward Targowski KC, the witness said she had consensual sex with the accused the day before the alleged rape.

He put to her that she never had any sex that was not consensual and that she was not punched, both of which she denied.

She said: ""I'm not going to say at any given time there was no rape because I'm telling you he raped me on that Thursday night.""

She said she ""lied"" to the police about how she met the accused, saying they met at Clydebank Shopping Centre when he asked her for a light, but later said they met on Bigo.

She said she did this as she did not want a family member to find out they met on social media.

She also denied talking about ""sexuality issues"" with the accused.

According to various print and digital rags, David Moyes is keen to take Harry Maguire on loan to West Ham for the rest of the season. Until now Maguire has been unable to see the writing on the Old Trafford dressing-room wall, but he may change his mind if it’s only a loan move. While Maguire has been reluctant to leave Old Trafford, Leandro Trossard has apparently had his fill of living in the Guardian’s spiritual home. Chelsea and Spurs are both keen on buying Trossard a one-way ticket from Brighton to London. They might even pay for his Uber at the other end too.
Jürgen Klopp, meanwhile, has a dream. In it, Jude Bellingham and Matheus Nunes counter-press the bejesus out of quivering midfield opponents for the next decade, all the while sporting a Liverbird on their left breast. Money/takeover permitting, Liverpool will try to sign Bellingham and Nunes from Borussia Dortmund and Wolves, respectively. Manchester City have an obvious dearth of creative wide forwards, so Pep Guardiola is keen to sign Napoli’s bewitching maverick Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. If he joins, the 21-year-old will become the first Georgian to play for City. Please tell us you didn’t fall for that. It’s the season of Love Island, or so we’re told. And if you were in any doubt that opposites still attract, Barcelona reject Memphis Depay is reportedly about to jump into the loving arms of Diego Simeone. Should Depay join Atlético Madrid, Yannick Carrasco may move in the opposite direction. Barça – who spent last summer, well, spending – are now doing most of their shopping in La Tienda Bosman, and would like to pick up Manchester City’s Ilkay Gündogan. Nottingham Forest have devised a new system whereby each new arrival must be of an age that corresponds to their number on the list of new signings for 2022-23. (Look, it was clearer in our head.) So far they’ve bought 25 new players, and let’s be honest they’ve shut us all up with how well they’re doing. Newcastle striker Chris Wood, 31, and PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas, 36, are waiting patiently for them to fill in the gaps. Bournemouth are also keen on the Costa Rican. Moussa Dembélé has apparently been offered to Everton. Rumours that Frank Lampard barked “get it done” without asking which Dembélé it was, whether his first name has one S or two, and whether indeed it was the footballer or the Senegalese hurdler, are unconfirmed. Besides, it’s good news: this is the Lyon version, the one who plays up front and frequently scores actual goals. Talking of Moussa Ds, the burgeoning bro-sentment between Arsenal and Newcastle will gather pace when they go toe-to-toe and chequebook-to-chequebook for Bayer Leverkusen’s French winger Moussa Diaby. Juventus and Real Madrid are keeping an eye – several, if you believe some sources – on Alejandro Garnacho’s contract situation at Manchester United. It expires in 18 months, though United have the option to extend by another year. Leicester still want Fiorentina’s tricky Argentinian forward Nicolás González, and Southampton manager Nathan Jones has set his slightly scary eyes on Villarreal attacker Nicolas Jackson.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/18/football-transfer-rumours-west-ham-to-move-for-harry-maguire;guardian;sports;2818

Drivers at 15 rail companies are involved, and here is how commuters will be affected:

• Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern, Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and TransPennine Express will run no trains all day

• Rail links to the UK's two busiest airports will be cut, with Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express shutting down

• Trains will run in Wales, most of Scotland, and on parts of the South Western Railway network

• Services are also going to operate on the London Overground and Elizabeth Line

Overall, it's estimated that just 20% of normal services will run - with passengers facing a third consecutive day of extensive disruption during the first working week of 2023.

And further strikes are looming, with the RMT set to stage another 48-hour strike on Friday and Saturday.

Threatening that strike action could escalate even further, Mr Whelan said: ""The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress.""

He added: ""It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate.""

Rishi Sunak is considering measures that could allow employers to sue trade unions and sack workers, according to a report in The Times.

It's claimed that this new law would apply to six sectors: the health service, railways, education, fire services, border security and nuclear energy.

4237;4237;Tigray rebels start handing over weapons to Ethiopian army;2023-01-11T05:38:21Z;['N/A'];['Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Africa'];;"Tigrayan rebels have begun handing in heavy weapons, a key part of an agreement signed more than two months ago to end a deadly conflict in northern Ethiopia, a spokesperson for the rebel authorities said. The demobilisation of Tigray forces is seen as central to the 2 November ceasefire agreement, alongside the restoration of services, resumption of humanitarian aid and withdrawal of Eritrean troops, who fought alongside Ethiopia’s army but were not party to the truce. Fighting broke out in November 2020 when Ethiopia’s prime minister Abiy Ahmed deployed the army to arrest Tigrayan leaders who had been challenging his authority for months and whom he accused of attacking federal military bases. The conflict created famine-like conditions for hundreds of thousands of Tigray’s population, killed thousands and displaced millions across northern Ethiopia.
The handover in the town of Agulae, around 30km northeast of the regional capital Mekelle, was overseen by a monitoring team comprising members of the two sides and a regional body, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). “Tigray has handed over its heavy weapons as part of its commitment to implementing the #Pretoria agreement” that was signed between Ethiopia’s government and Tigrayan rebels, Tigray People’s Liberation Front spokesperson Getachew Reda tweeted Wednesday. “We hope & expect this will go a long way in expediting the full implementation of the agreement. We hope & expect!”
A deal on the implementation of the agreement signed on 12 November said the disarmament of heavy Tigrayan weapons would take place at the same time as the withdrawal of foreign and non-federal forces. Neighbouring Eritrea has supported the Ethiopian army in the region but did not participate in the Pretoria talks. Eritrean soldiers pulled out of several major towns in Tigray late last month but have not left Tigrayan territory, according to residents. Eritrea has declined to comment on whether troops will leave. An Ethiopian government delegation, including the prime minister’s national security adviser Redwan Hussein and several ministers, visited Tigray’s capital Mekelle on 26 December, marking a major step in the peace process. A few days later, on 29 December, Ethiopian federal police entered Mekelle for the first time in 18 months. The precise toll of the conflict, which was largely fought amid media restrictions, is unknown. The International Crisis Group thinktank and rights group Amnesty International have described it as “one of the deadliest in the world”. The fighting stopped after November’s peace deal and the rebels have claimed to have “disengaged” 65% of their fighters from the frontlines. But Tigrayans have denounced the “atrocities” they say have been committed by Eritrea’s army and the forces of Ethiopia’s neighbouring Amhara region. Humanitarian operations have been ramped up since the peace deal, but the amount of food and medical aid being delivered remains far below the enormous needs. Mekelle was connected to the national power grid on 6 December and Ethiopia’s main bank CBE said on 19 December that it was resuming operations in some towns. Telephone communications with the region have begun to be restored.

1644;1644;Penny Wong and Richard Marles to head to France in effort to heal Aukus rift;2023-01-24T03:52:01Z;['Daniel Hurst'];['Australian foreign policy', 'Richard Marles', 'Penny Wong', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'France', 'Aukus'];;"Two senior Australian ministers will fly to France next week to step up efforts to repair the diplomatic rift, with closer cooperation in the Pacific expected to be on the agenda. The defence minister, Richard Marles, and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will meet their French counterparts for what is known as a “2+2” meeting – the first in this format since the 2021 diplomatic rupture sparked by Aukus, sources said. Similar talks in late August 2021 became central to France’s accusations it was “betrayed” by the then Morrison government. That was because the joint statement agreed by the then ministers, Peter Dutton and Marise Payne, and their French counterparts, Florence Parly and Jean-Yves Le Drian, included a promise “to deepen defence industry cooperation” and “underlined the importance of the future submarine program”. Just two weeks later, the Morrison government killed off that $90bn French program in favour of seeking US and UK help to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. It led the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to make the infamous accusation “I don’t think; I know” Scott Morrison lied in the lead-up to the Aukus deal, a claim that Morrison denied. After visiting France next week, Wong and Marles will travel to the United Kingdom to participate in annual talks with their British counterparts, James Cleverly and Ben Wallace. The war in Ukraine is expected to be discussed in the Australian ministers’ meetings with both the French and British. Last week Australia farewelled up to 70 defence force personnel bound for the UK to join a multinational training mission for Ukrainian troops, but the ADF will not enter Ukraine itself.
The UK talks are also being held in the lead-up to the March deadline for key decisions on how the nuclear-powered submarines will be delivered and Australia’s broader defence strategy. Since coming to office in May, the Albanese government has recommitted to the Aukus submarine project but has placed a significant emphasis on rebuilding trust with France, which it sees as a key partner in the Pacific. The government quickly signed off on a settlement with France’s Naval Group over the scrapping of the contract, a negotiation that began under the former government, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Macron in Paris six months ago. Albanese said after a further meeting with Macron on the sidelines of the G20 in Bali in November that they had discussed interim solutions to boost Australia’s defence capability. Albanese denied any rift when, days later, Macron said the Aukus plans risked “nuclear confrontation” with China. Both the Australian and French sides have cited climate action as an area in which the two sides can work together, after the new Labor government increased the 2030 emissions reduction target. They have been developing a “roadmap” for greater cooperation, not just in the area of climate change and energy but also in defence and security, along with cultural and education exchanges. These topics are likely to be the high-level themes of the meeting between Wong and Marles and French ministers Catherine Colonna and Sébastien Lecornu. The looming visit to France has not been derailed by the Australian government’s announcement last week that it was scrapping the European-backed Taipan MRH90 helicopters early, probably because it can be seen as rubber-stamping a Morrison government-era decision.

You’d certainly recognise him if you saw him: from his first walk-on TV part as a video store clerk in an episode of Seinfeld, Oswalt has appeared on nearly every comedy show from Flight of the Conchords to Futurama, Bob’s Burgers to Parks and Recreation. He played comic book nerd Spence in The King of Queens, Agent Koenig (and his brothers) in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and serial sex harasser Teddy Sykes in Veep.
But who cares about TV, right? Film is the big dog, and Oswalt has got plenty of points up on the board. He has done quite a bit of animation voice work – most notably Remy the rat-chef in the hit Pixar comedy Ratatouille, plus Max the jack russell in The Secret Life of Pets 2 – as well as classics like A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas and Balls of Fury. I jest of course: he was robbed of an Oscar nomination for his role in Young Adult (as Charlize Theron’s old school pal), and played the “world’s biggest New York Giants fan” in the aptly named Big Fan. One really surprising off-piste detail: Oswalt played a role in nailing the Golden State Killer, completing his wife Michelle McNamara’s book, I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, after her sudden death in 2016. It was eventually published in 2018, raising awareness of the case, just two months before the arrest of serial murderer Joseph James DeAngelo.
Now he’s got a new film on the way: I Love My Dad, where he plays a confused dad who catfishes his own son (all based on a real-life incident, we are led to believe, that happened to writer/director/co-star James Morosini). Oswalt is as great as ever, and there’s plenty to ask him, so get typing and post your questions below by noon on 13 January – and we’ll print the best answers on Friday 20 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/12/post-your-questions-for-patton-oswalt;guardian;entertainment & culture;3881
4596;4596;AFL partner Crypto.com accused of ‘misleading’ advertising practices in UK;2023-01-08T14:00:51Z;['Henry Belot', 'Josh Taylor'];['Cryptocurrencies', 'AFL', 'Australia news', 'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)', 'Australian rules football', 'Advertising'];;"The AFL’s crypto exchange partner, Crypto.com, has breached UK advertising standards on multiple occasions and been accused of “misleading” and “irresponsible” behaviour. The UK Advertising Standards Authority rulings may invite further scrutiny of Crypto.com promotions in Australia. A five-year partnership between the AFL and the Singapore-based exchange was announced in January 2022. Since then, Crypto.com has been promoted around AFL stadiums. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In December the ASA ruled that a local Crypto.com advertisement “failed to illustrate the risk of investing in non-fungible tokens”. It also found the ad did not make it clear that fees would apply. In response, Crypto.com disputed the ruling and said the need to mention fees in the ad was not relevant and would “only confuse consumers”. Earlier in 2022 the regulator upheld rulings on two other ads that were accused of exploiting the “inexperience or credulity” of consumers. One said “buy bitcoin with credit card instantly”, which the regulator said “took advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity by not making clear tax could be paid on cryptocurrency profits and by irresponsibly encouraging investing in cryptocurrency on a credit card”.
Another told consumers they could “earn up to 8.5%”, which the ASA considered misleading “because the basis for calculating the earning forecast had not been made clear”. Crypto.com told the regulator these adverts were deleted as soon as concerns were raised and that its oversight process had been strengthened. It is not known whether any of these ads ran in the Australian market. A Crypto.com spokesperson said the company was “trusted by more than 70 million customers worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security and privacy certifications”. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has called for a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and crypto assets like NFTs in order to better protect consumers. While that is being developed, a spokesperson said rules around misleading and deceptive conduct still apply to any kind of crypto asset. “Any firm that is misleading or deceptive in its advertising is breaking the law,” the Asic spokesperson said. The regulator took BPS Financial to federal court in October over what Asic alleges is misleading and deceptive claims about the Qoin crypto asset, and Block Earner in November for allegedly offering financial products without an Australian financial services licence. The matters remain before the court. BPS is set to file its defence next month. Dr Paul Mazzola, a cryptocurrency expert at the University of Wollongong, said the AFL partnerships with Crypto.com presented a reputational risk for the sporting code. Mazzola said Asic could potentially take action if any similar advertisements were published in Australia. “Ultimately Asic would need to make the case that the crypto asset being advertised clearly fits within the definitions provided under [Asic rules], which it probably does,” he said. Mazzola recommended that the rules be changed to explicitly include cryptocurrencies and NFTs. “This would clearly send a message to the market and especially crypto exchanges like Crypto.com that they need to be careful when framing their advertising and especially include all the warnings relating to the risks associated with investing in crypto markets.” The AFL was contacted for comment but referred back to a previous statement in November when it said it stood by its partnership with Crypto.com after the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Crypto.com’s chief executive, Kris Marszalek, has rejected comparisons to FTX and said his company had a “tremendously strong balance sheet”.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/09/afl-partner-cryptocom-accused-of-misleading-advertising-practices-in-uk;guardian;science & technology;4596
8631;8631;What is Scorpion, the police unit at the centre of Tyre Nichols' death?;Saturday 28 January 2023 18:18, UK;['reemul balla', '@reemul_b'];['tyre nichols'];['officers', 'tyre', 'scorpion', 'death', 'smith', 'pic', 'unit', 'centre', 'department', 'specialised', 'nichols', 'memphis', 'units'];"When Memphis, a city in southwest Tennessee, had a record number of homicides in 2021 for the second year in a row, many were calling for action.

Attention turned to the Memphis Police Department to tackle the murder rate, which led to the creation of the Scorpion Unit in October 2021.

""MPD's New SCORPION UNIT Launched!"" read a post on the department's Facebook page, along with a video clip showing a group of officers in tactical vests at a roll call.

The name stands for the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace In Our Neighborhoods - yet officers from that same unit were responsible for the brutal assault of Tyre Nichols this month during a traffic stop for alleged reckless driving.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:33 Memphis authorities have released video footage of Tyre Nichols being held down by officers and struck repeatedly as he screamed for his mother.

""The Scorpion unit was involved,"" Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney for Shelby County, Tennessee, confirmed on Thursday when he announced the murder charges against five officers.

Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, who has called the attack ""heinous, reckless and inhumane"", has announced a review of all of the police department's specialised units, including Scorpion, in response to Mr Nichols' death.

A unit designed for 'crime suppression'

The Scorpion unit was created in October 2021 under the police department's Organised Crime Unit after a record 346 homicides were reported in 2021 - up from 332 the previous year.

Made up of 40 officers divided into four 10-member teams, the unit was tasked with addressing violent crime and investigating car thefts and gangs.

In January last year, Mayor Jim Strickland promoted the unit as part of the solution to the high homicide rate, stating that in its first three months, it had made hundreds of arrests and seized hundreds of cars and weapons.

Its operations were flaunted on the police department's Facebook page: arrests that began with traffic stops, escalated into more serious confrontations and ended with arrests of people for drugs and guns.

'Police do what they can to arrest people'

Mark LeSure, a former Memphis police sergeant who retired in 2021, said he had begun to see a large number of relatively inexperienced officers being put on specialised units as other members of the force quit.

Mr LeSure added that the units did not have enough senior staff members training the new officers.

""Rookies were getting put on specialised units where they had no business being,"" he said.

Two of the five officers involved in the assault on Mr Nicols, who are aged between 24 and 32-years-old, had been on the job for a couple of years, and the others no more than six years.

Mr LeSure said some of his former colleagues who are still at the department have told him that the Scorpion unit, which launched after he retired, is known for having a ""zero tolerance"" policy on crime - which he said meant the officers ""do what they can to arrest people"".

Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped for reckless driving on 7 January and that a ""confrontation"" occurred in an effort to detain him.

However, Ms Davis said a review of the incident could not ""substantiate"" the reckless driving claim.

He died three days after the assault.

'Unit is an excuse to harass everyday residents'

E. Winslow Chapman, the director of the police department from 1976 to 1983, said that when he was leading the force officers were not considered for specialised units without at least seven years on the job.

Mr Chapman said: ""You're using officers to send a message that we're here and we're not going to tolerate criminal activity anymore ... and it can very easily go overboard, which it obviously did in this case.""

Chelsea Glass, a community organiser in Memphis who is an advocate for criminal justice reform, called Scorpion a street crime-fighting team relying on traffic stops as excuses to find violent criminals and weapons.

""They harass everyday residents, and they're calling this high-level policing,"" he said.

""But it's really just stop-and-frisk on wheels. It doesn't matter what name you slap on it.""

What do we know about the officers?

The five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, official misconduct, aggravated kidnapping, official oppression and aggravated assault.

Here is what is known about each one.

Demetrius Haley, 30

Haley joined the Memphis Police Department in August 2020.

He previously worked as a corrections officer for the Shelby County Corrections Department and was accused of assaulting an inmate.

The lawsuit against him was dismissed as the inmate failed to complete all the paperwork.

Bean was also hired in August 2020 having previously worked at a fast food restaurant and a telecoms company AT&T;, according to his LinkedIn profile.

It says he studied criminal justice and law enforcement at the University of Mississippi from 2016 until 2020, and did an internship with the campus police department.

Emmitt Martin III, 30

Martin was hired by the Memphis Police Department in March 2018.

Joshua Harper, a pastor in Memphis, said he followed Martin on social media and that the man depicted in court papers ""is not the person that I know"".

""I was shocked only for a second because I understood that he was a police officer and I know behind the badge that anything can happen when anyone has power and authority,"" Harper said.

Mills was hired by the Memphis Police Department in March 2017.

He was nicknamed ""Box"" when he played American football for West Virginia State University.

One of his former coaches, Kip Shaw, said: ""When I saw the news, I was just shocked. I've been coaching a long time and you just never know. I told my wife, 'That man played for us at West Virginia State'.""

4593;4593;Undergraduates to be catch-up tutors for disadvantaged pupils in England;2023-01-08T14:49:58Z;['Sally Weale'];['Education', 'Teaching', 'UK news', 'England'];;"University undergraduates are being trained to tutor disadvantaged pupils who have fallen behind as a result of the Covid pandemic, in a new pilot set up to boost education recovery efforts in England’s schools. Student volunteers are given training, including a series of lectures, before being assigned to a school where they teach small groups of up to three children once a week to try to plug learning gaps.
The trial, which is currently focused on boosting literacy, has been set up by the University of Exeter and is still in its early stages, but the team behind it hope it will be replicated at other universities and rolled out in schools across the country. The project is independent of the National Tutoring Programme (NTP), the government’s flagship education recovery policy, which offers subsidised tutoring to children who are struggling to catch up after the disruption of Covid and lockdown. After a troubled start, the NTP met its pledge to deliver 2 million tutoring courses last year, but still fell short of its target to reach disadvantaged pupils who were more severely affected by the Covid disruption. There are also concerns about future uptake once the subsidy paid by the government is cut from 60% to 25% in 2023. Meanwhile, the attainment gap between wealthier pupils and their poorer classmates is getting wider since the pandemic and more needs to be done to help disadvantaged young people catch up, according to Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at Exeter, who has helped develop the undergraduate tutoring programme with local headteacher Lindsay Skinner. “This is part of our efforts to recover in terms of education post-pandemic, to address some of the stark learning gaps that have emerged,” he said. “One of the issues the NTP has struggled with is supply of high-quality tutors. All these universities have lots of young, highly qualified people.” The scheme would also help universities to fulfil government expectations that they should be working with local schools to raise attainment, particularly among disadvantaged pupils. For the undergraduates involved in the Exeter scheme, the training and tutoring constitutes a credit towards their degree. Exeter is also looking to trial an alternative model, under which students are paid for their services. Currently the Exeter undergraduates are working with students aged 11 and 12 at St Jamessecondary school in the city, but the aim is to involve more pupils and undergraduates next year, focusing on different subjects and skills. Sophie Errington, who is studying Spanish at Exeter, has just completed a term of tutoring at St James’s, and enjoyed it so much, she is now considering training to become a teacher. “It’s been a really, really rewarding experience,” she said. “It’s been so good to interact with these kids. Seeing them grow in confidence has been really, really good. It’s also been really good for my English.” The children’s attainment will be compared before and after tuition to measure its impact. The minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, Robert Halfon, said: “This is a fantastic initiative, and I am hugely grateful to the University of Exeter for their proactive support to help catch up children in their community. “Tutoring is a key component to our catch-up strategy, and this is a great example of how students can help to play their part.”";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/08/undergraduates-to-be-catch-up-tutors-for-disadvantaged-pupils-in-england;guardian;entertainment & culture;4593
7674;7674;Woman who reported police officer ex-husband for rape found investigation 'more traumatic than incident';Wednesday 18 January 2023 23:31, UK;['jason farrell', '@jasonfarrellsky'];['police'];['incident', 'happened', 'husband', 'investigation', 'feel', 'allegations', 'case', 'woman', 'reported', 'pc', 'wouldnt', 'exhusband', 'traumatic', 'sally', 'officer', 'rape'];"A woman who reported her police officer ex-husband for rape says detectives mishandled the case and their investigation ""was more traumatic than the actual incident"".

The woman, who we will refer to as ""Sally"" as she cannot be identified for legal reasons, has said those running the investigation into her allegation had been colleagues or old friends of the accused.

Sally, who was also a police officer in the north of England, says the first person she confided in waited for her to finish her story, before telling her he'd known her husband since school and had been on a team tour with him.

Sally said: ""He let me tell him everything that had happened from start to finish, and then at the end of it said, right let me tell you that I grew up with him.""

She added: ""The detective sergeant who was leading the investigation, she told me that my partner had worked for her as well, which shocked me.""

It had taken eight years for Sally to come forward since the rape, and she only found the courage after learning that her ex-partner was also alleged to have been violent towards his new wife.

Separately, she later discovered a neighbour had raised the alarm about loud, potentially violent behaviour in the early hours of the morning.

The man had written: ""The worrying thing is he works for the police and I thought he'd know better.""

Sally said the alleged victim was never formally interviewed.

Following her allegations, Sally's husband faced both a criminal investigation and a probe by Police Professional Standards. She said that when the criminal investigation was dropped, that seemed to be the cue to drop the internal review.

She said: ""I just don't feel believed. I feel like it's all been brushed under the carpet.""

Image: Sally claimed she was raped by her ex-husband

Her husband kept his job until retirement and at one point it was suggested he would be working in the same building as Sally.

After a subject access request, Sally discovered that the file passed to the Crown Prosecution Service included what she said were false allegations against her, claiming she had repeatedly accessed files on her husband.

Overall, she felt she was unsupported and was made to feel ""needy"" by asking for updates on the case. And she said, as a police officer herself, she ""wasn't allowed to be a victim"".

'If it happened again, I wouldn't report it'

With great reluctance, Sally admits she has lost trust in her own force.

She said: ""If it happened to me again, I wouldn't report it. I found the investigation was more traumatic than the actual incident.""

In the wake of serial rapist PC David Carrick's conviction, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, revealed that more than 1,000 of his officers remain in service despite allegations of sexual or domestic abuse.

The Home Office has asked all police forces to check their officers and staff against national police databases.

Sally said the police need to take complaints against its own more seriously. And she believes the police would have acted differently if her ex-husband was not an officer.

That is the big concern - that the police have a blind spot for its own bad apples.

Sky News contacted the police force that Sally worked for, but it declined to comment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230118234805/http://news.sky.com/story/woman-who-reported-police-officer-ex-husband-for-rape-found-investigation-more-traumatic-than-incident-12789771;skynews;entertainment & culture;1765
151;151;The biblical Eve shows us what we need to do in this time of female bravery and vicious misogyny;2023-01-31T11:00:01Z;['V (formerly Eve Ensler)'];['US news', 'The Bible', 'Feminism'];;I am nearly 70 years old, and I have been looking back on my life in activism and art for my new book, Reckoning. As I pored over my previously unpublished diaries, monologues, plays and poems, I realised that all my life I have been haunted by one woman – a woman I believe has the power to show us what we need to do now, in this time of unparalleled female bravery and vicious misogynistic backlash. So let’s go back to Eve, the first woman, Adam, serpent, apple, garden, God. I have been obsessed with Eve my whole life. First of course, it was once my name, and for a six-year-old it seemed ridiculously impossible to be named Eve. She was responsible for not only the downfall of paradise, expulsion, sin, shame but death itself. Names, like myths, determine a lot, and this story was like a tectonic plate at the bedrock of my consciousness, engendering how I saw myself and how I behaved in the world. I am only one part of a much bigger tale: her story has shaped a great deal of humanity’s story. How many of us feel as if we are fallen women/people out of the gate – that our inherent credibility or value is erased upon birth? How many of us are controlled by the debilitating terror that any form of disobedience or independence will lead to social exclusion and damnation? How many of us feel cursed for our curiosity, forbidden to know what we know, living amid a culture constantly manifesting a pathological and patronizing disdain for our instincts? The myth of Eve has served as an eternal warning, an electric fence around our psyches zapping our impulses to revolt or question. I don’t know about you, but the serpent has figured highly in my life, in the form of lovers, sex, drugs, rock’n’roll. I think many of us have been constantly ingesting things that are stand-ins for apples but always with a sense of being wrong. Our life force or hunger to be, our erotic Reckoning impulses, have been distorted through this cellular shame and distrust. So I would like to present you with another story about Eve. I believe Eve ate the apple because, like many of us, she was trying to remember the other story, the story before the trauma of brainwashing and massacres. The story before they shoved things into our sacred holes and cut the tips of our clitorises where divinity lives. Before they shaved our furry nests and choked the throat of our songs. Before they called us hysterical and intense and emotional, before they beat boys for crying and wanting to wear dresses. Before they stoned us for uttering the words of our mothers and drilled down into us to rob us of our moist and fertile secrets. Before Eve was made to believe she was taken from a rib, before she was forced to be obedient. Before she stopped dancing, before she buried her powers to heal with touch and see the future and become one with earth. Before she knew how to pleasure herself over and over and over forever and men knew they were there to serve that pleasure because as she was pleasured they and the world were pleasured over and over forever. Before she was embarrassed by joy. Before she apologized for her heart and stopped respecting the size of its brain, before she disqualified her opinions and apologized for her insatiable curiosity. Before childbirth became punishment and love and service to a man became mandatory. Before she swallowed her rage and choked her voice. Before men established God the father at the top. Before there was a top. Before the earth was treated as the wretched wild. Before when it was life generating life in all directions. Eve ate the apple to regain her powers, to know what she knew before she was held hostage in the wrong garden. The Bible tells us that God said to Adam and Eve: “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” Eve defied the Father and ate the apple, and came into her full independent erotic self and heart – then generously offered this transformation to Adam and immediately punishment, shame, guilt and oppression descended upon them. They were expelled and have been wandering inside us and outside us trying to remember ever since. Eve was cast out as she opened the door to the deeper knowing – and we must all be OK outside our father’s garden, outside his house, outside the world of disembodied intelligence, we must all be visionary nomads, exiled from the hierarchy and ready to find one another and create the new world, which is really just remembering the world from which we came. Eve ate the apple to remember the time before our souls were militarized and straitjacketed by religions that rendered us defeated, guilty, sinful, waiting for someone or something usually a father god or consumer god coming to rescue us or redeem us or protect us when in fact there was never anything to be rescued from except those who in our name were committing wars and violence protecting us. Eve knew a true paradise was not constructed on hierarchy and competition and domination and greed but on connection and mutual cooperation. Eve asked neither Adam nor God for permission. She knew what she had to do, and I believe she must have known at least instinctively what could follow. She knew she risked their disapproval and somewhere in her she must have known her legacy, legitimacy, and name could be ruined, and she could be expelled from the comforting mirage and garden of patriarchy. But this didn’t stop her. She was our whistleblower, knowing she was in the wrong garden. She ate the apple because her hunger for justice, ecstasy, connection, pleasure, equality and love was massively alive in her. Eve is alive in us now. We are on the brink of the remembering. To do this, we must openly, unashamedly eat the apple. This involves ingesting all that catalyzes and provokes vision and imagination. It means educating ourselves and looking deeper into the stories and myths designed and sustained by the powers that be. We are Eve’s children. Daughter of our Black African mother, Eve. Revolutionary, Eve, who ate the apple that unearthed the first garden under the imposed and constructed garden. Eve who ate the apple as her hunger for truth was our actual path and now, we must fulfill her legacy. Eve, mother of our freedom, ate the apple to liberate us into this world, our world. This is our time. Eat the fucking apple.

8692;8692;Julian Sands: 'Something has gone wrong,' says friend of missing British actor;Sunday 29 January 2023 18:14, UK;[];['california', 'julian sands'];['hiker', 'tricky', 'baldy', 'added', 'gone', 'starred', 'advanced', 'actor', 'missing', 'weather', 'im', 'friend', 'wrong', 'julian', 'sands', 'drama', 'british'];"A man who goes hiking with the missing British actor Julian Sands has said it is obvious ""something has gone wrong"".

Sands, 65, went missing in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel mountains in southern California on 13 January.

Efforts to find him have been hampered by bad weather, the authorities have said. Helicopters were grounded on Thursday because of strong winds.

Fellow actor Kevin Ryan said Sands had embarked on a ""tricky, dangerous hike"" but is the ""most advanced hiker I know"".

However, he added that each day brings ""more pressure"" and ""a lot of doubt"".

Ryan, who has climbed Mount Baldy a number of times, met Sands on the set of 2014 US drama series Crossbones.

They became friends and started walking together.

""Julian is such an advanced hiker,"" Ryan, 38, said. ""It's what he did. His whole life he was climbing mountains. It was a true passion of his.

""He is beyond experienced and I'm hoping that he's tucked away somewhere and can pull through.""

Ryan warned, however, that Mount Baldy is a ""different mountain"" in the winter, ""especially with how heavy weather has hit that area - that's a whole new trail"".

He added: ""But that is something that Julian would have seen as a challenge, to go up in those conditions. He likes to push himself and he's done that.

""And, like anything, that makes you better, to push yourself in life. But in this situation, it's a very tricky, dangerous hike with these weather conditions.

""And obviously something has gone wrong. Hopefully with time we'll find out and hopefully it'll be the best result.""

Ryan added: ""The only reason I'm not out there joining the search party is because I'm filming right now in Ireland, otherwise I would be out there to give my support.""

Sands was born in Yorkshire and moved to Los Angeles in 2020.

His breakout role came as the free-spirited George in the period drama A Room With A View, in which he starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter.

More recently, in 2021 he played a chief medical officer in Jack Lowden and starred in the drama Benediction with Peter Capaldi.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129183228/http://news.sky.com/story/julian-sands-something-has-gone-wrong-says-friend-of-missing-british-actor-12798647;skynews;entertainment & culture;2783
2761;2761;Betty Can Jump at the Pram Factory: the radical 1970s play that built a scene – and changed Australia;2023-01-18T14:00:42Z;['N/A'];['Stage', 'Arts funding', 'Australia news', 'Theatre', 'Culture', 'Australian books', 'Helen Garner'];;"On federal election day last year in Australia, I found myself handing out how-to-vote flyers on a marginal seat booth with the film and TV actor Bruce Spence. We were one of many working to oust a government that punished the unemployed, excluded arts workers from Covid relief and responded to the climate crisis by waving lumps of coal in parliament. I’d recently finished writing a book about the women at Carlton’s Pram Factory theatre, where Spence was a member of the Australian Performing Group (APG) in the 1970s. When I told him, he pulled out his phone and showed me a photo from the federal election campaign 50 years ago. It was Gough Whitlam, looking across a car park driveway, at performers holding up a sign: “The APG”.
Whitlam was one of the few who could measure up to Spence in height. In the foreground is actor and singer Jane Clifton and, behind her, Claire Dobbin, one of the actors who starred in Betty Can Jump, the groundbreaking women’s play that inspired my book.
Whitlam gave the arts a starring role in his campaign launch. He promised to legislate for lending rights for writers, to introduce higher quotas for Australian television and cinema and to bring all existing arts boards under a single statutory council. A new kind of Australian culture was already emerging, but Whitlam created an environment where it could experiment and grow. And as we look forward to the first comprehensive federal cultural policy in decades – which already has shades of Whitlam’s agenda – it’s worth remembering what Australian arts can look like when it’s encouraged to thrive. ‘Everyone wanted to be part of it’: the Pram Factory and Betty Can Jump Founded in 1970, the APG made a home at the Pram Factory: a two-storey brick building that had variously been a livery stable, a coke den and a panel beater (the site now hosts a Woolworths and the Lygon Court car park). Helen Garner’s first novel Monkey Grip (1977) is set against the backdrop of the Pram Factory and the Tower, the building where some of the APG members lived. The Pram had “a big energy,” Garner told me. “You would come home just sore from laughing. Everyone wanted to be a part of it.”
There was “a certain kind of ‘Pram person’ and you just knew”, APG co-founder Kerry Dwyer told me. Another Betty cast member, Yvonne Marini, once joked that failing her first year at the National Institute of Dramatic Art made her acceptable to the APG. But while the APG was informed by leftist and anti-war politics, in its earliest days there were limited roles for women: directors and writers were men, and many of the group’s plays celebrated the ocker male. Dwyer, already bristling at playing bimbo girlfriend Susan in Don’s Party, was enraged at the few roles for women in an early production, Marvellous Melbourne. Helen Garner would host consciousness-raising meetings at her share house in Fitzroy; she’d recently separated from her husband, Bill Garner. It was there that Dwyer, Garner and other women began to talk about putting on a women’s show. They rehearsed in a back room at the Pram Factory for five months before Betty Can Jump opened in January 1972.
The show mixed scenes improvised from consciousness-raising sessions with stories uncovered by the collective’s two researchers, Laurel Frank and Kay Hamilton. The cast wore jockstraps and fake penises to mock Aussie men brawling in a bar; they talked about their bodies and sex in a scene played in the dark. When some of the group’s earlier shows had been shut down by police for obscenity, hearing actors saying words such as “cunt”, “slut” and “fuck” must have been electrifying. Betty sold out, the season was extended, and critics praised it as a breath of fresh air; the Bulletin’s Leonard Glickfeld favourably compared it to the establishment “Melbourne Theatrical Club blowing old tobacco-smoke”. The play was raw and amateurish, but it was also powerful. Every night women came up to cast members in tears after seeing their lives reflected on stage – and it gave the cast and crew the confidence to become arts workers in their own right.
The Whitlam government’s reforms, meanwhile, were about to create an environment where they could flourish. How funding made a scene – and helped it thrive Plans for a National Gallery of Australia and Australian Film and Television School were languishing under previous governments, but Whitlam brought them to fruition. Whitlam doubled the Australia Council’s funding in the 73/74 budget and increased it by a further 50% in the following year. Artists and practitioners were appointed to its various boards to avoid political interference and ensure grants were truly peer-reviewed. Basic funding from the Australian Council for the Arts helped the APG to stage 10 shows by Australian writers at the Pram Factory in 1972, including Betty Can Jump. But when Whitlam expanded arts funding over the following years, the company benefited and thrived, bolstering its program of shows, acting workshops and tours. Meanwhile, Whitlam’s women’s adviser, Elizabeth Reid, prioritised funding for cultural activities during International Women’s Year in 1975, and a women’s theatre group which joined the Pram Factory in 1974 received funding for plays and a women’s festival. The scene that emerged would go on to change the face of Australian screen and stage. In the Betty cast, for instance, was a young actor called Evelyn Krape – now one of Australia’s greatest stage actors – and another named Jude Kuring, who played the long-running role of Noeline Bourke in the TV series Prisoner. Claire Dobbin became the APG’s first female chair, and more recently chair of the Melbourne International film festival. Kerry Dwyer went on to direct shows in Australia’s leading theatres. Micky Allan, who created the show’s set and backdrop of slides, is now one of Australia’s most celebrated visual artists: her works are held by galleries around the world. By 1977, Laurel Frank had co-founded Circus Oz. Helen Garner performed in Betty Can Jump too, and one scene she wrote brought the audience to stunned silence: “The unadorned woman speaking directly to the audience was a very new thing and very powerful,” Laurel told me. In a 1972 article, Helen wrote about answering her high school students’ questions about sex – and subsequently lost her teaching job. The Whitlam government’s new Supporting Mother’s Benefit saved her from working nights as a taxi driver. That income now famously allowed her to ride her bike each day to the State Library to write her then-revolutionary novel Monkey Grip: a story that didn’t conform to narrative conventions or political ideologies, and that drew from life to make art.
The Pram Factory survived for 11 years, with a healthy mix of government grants and box office takings giving many APG members a guaranteed wage and a chance to experiment. At its best, the APG acted more like a research laboratory rather than a factory turning out made-to-order products modelled on the latest hit shows.
It’s a period of Australia’s arts history we could learn from. A new generation of artists is now emerging that is so much more diverse and reflective of Australia today – but they are in ever greater competition for grants, in a system that expects artists to already know what the outcomes of their experiments will be, to list outputs and describe products before they even begin the work. As we count down to 30 January, when the Albanese government will unveil its full cultural policy, it’s worth remembering the life-changing power of unfettered funding: giving our artists the confidence to experiment and even fail, so that Australian culture can ultimately succeed.

2540;2540;Frost renews call to exclude medicines from Northern Ireland Brexit rules  ;2023-01-19T12:29:26Z;"[""Lisa O'Carroll""]";['Brexit', 'Northern Ireland', 'David Frost', 'Pharmaceuticals industry', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'Foreign policy', 'Trade policy', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Business', 'Northern Irish politics', 'Health policy', 'Healthcare industry'];;David Frost has renewed calls for medicines to be excluded from Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland amid claims that supplies could be threatened in December when regulation of pharmaceuticals in the UK further diverges from the EU. He described the much-praised fix put in place by the EU last year to ensure the continued long term supply of medicine supplies as “Heath Robinson” and said the issue needed addressing further. The former Brexit minister was speaking after leading pharmaceutical figures told a House of Lords committee that supplies were “OK” following the EU change in legislation but that a change in regulations in December threatened a “cliff edge”. The head of an organisation that represents medicines wholesalers said supplies to Northern Ireland were already made complex by Brexit, which requires Northern Ireland to observe EU rules on goods. “Distributing medicines into Northern Ireland is challenging, problematic, inefficient, and a sort of slow strangulation by a thousand cuts if you like,” said Martin Sawer, the executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association (HDA), which supplies 90% of high street chemists and the NHS with prescription drugs twice a day. His members “feel that the UK and the EU has done its best to interpret regulations sympathetically” but “most” of the HDA’s concerns related to the future, he told a Lords committee examining the protocol. In December, new British rules come into play which may require separate licences and separate packaging for medicines in Northern Ireland, which may deter some suppliers from continuing to deliver to the region. “The tectonic plates between GB and NI are slowly moving apart and all the regulations have been stuck on top like sticking plasters,” Sawer told peers. “Medicines need to be available universally to all citizens of the UK equally. And we believe the divergence will make will put that under threat.” Lord Frost said in a tweet: “We told the EU repeatedly during 2021 this would happen if they insisted on imposing their Heath Robinson solution unilaterally. It would have been much simpler for all to take pharma out of the protocol but the EU ruled this out a priori.” Paul Williams, a senior corporate affairs director at the medicines manufacturer Teva UK, said he had “grave concerns” about the future. “The only issue that keeps me awake at night, and I say this not as a metaphor, but as a reality, is a thought of a patient not getting a medicine they need,” he said. Some of the medicines that were covered by EU centralised procedure rules included innovative drugs for treating migraine and cancer pain, he said. He commended staff at the Department of Health and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as being “unfailingly courteous” and helpful over the issue but said it was not the same as talking to the decision-makers. The committee heard that the discontinuation of at least 1,000 drugs at the end of 2021 in Northern Ireland had been averted by the EU change in legislation on medicines going into the region, but that it was only a temporary fix. “We still don’t have that stability and certainty over the coming years. It feels like we steered away from one cliff edge but there’s still more to come,” Williams said in reference to the divergence of regulations between the EU and the UK in December. The Department of Health said changes to UK and EU legislation havd meant that “medicine supply to Northern Ireland is stable”. However, it confirmed there were “medium- to long-term risks to supply created by the protocol”. A government spokesperson said: “Patients in Northern Ireland have access to the medicines they need, just as those in Great Britain do, and our priority is to safeguard the continued supply of medicines to patients in Northern Ireland and help ensure equity of access for patients across the UK.” The EU has been approached for comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/19/frost-renews-exclude-medicines-northern-ireland-brexit-rules;guardian;politics;2540
5832;5832;Allan Brockbank obituary;2023-01-01T12:15:31Z;['N/A'];['Lake District', 'Windermere', 'Water transport'];;"My father, Allan Brockbank, who has died aged 94, worked as a boatbuilder at Windermere in the Lake District from the age of 15 until his retirement in 1998. He became one of the founding directors of Bowness Bay Boating Company, now Windermere Lake Cruises. Allan was born in Windermere, then in the county of Westmorland, to James Brockbank, who delivered groceries on a horse and cart, and his wife, Annie (nee Judd). He went to St Mary’s boys’ school in the town, leaving at 14. His career was punctuated by national service, from 1947 to 1949, in Bielefeld and Göttingen, Germany, where he was put in charge of the joinery workshop. His demobilisation was delayed by the Russian blockade of Berlin, and during this extended stay he took a sign-writing course. In a bar in Bowness, Allan met Ethel Armer, a waitress from Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire; they married in 1951 and had three children. During the 1950s he worked at Anchorage Ltd, where he made clinker-built mahogany speed boats, and the family made several backpacking and camping trips around the Lake District using local buses.
Allan broke his leg while using his homemade skis on a hill above Windermere. During his time off work, he decided to try his hand at boat design, and realised he would need CSE maths. Many calculations were needed in boat design; for instance, the centre of buoyancy must be above the centre of gravity for the vessel to float. So, aged 29, he studied at night school at Kendal Technical College, achieving 98% in the exam. In 1966, he designed and built the Venture, a motor launch that runs on Windermere to this day, though now the engine is electric. With a group of independent boat men in 1968, Allan formed Bowness Bay Boating Company (which in 1993 became Windermere Lake Cruises). There he designed and built a fleet of fibreglass, six-berth cabin cruisers for leisure hire. In the early 1990s, the company acquired the three historic Windermere steamers MV Teal, MV Tern and MV Swift. He remained on the board of directors until 2015. Allan’s other passions were archaeology and hill-walking. He spent a holiday in 1990 on a dig at Castell Henllys, an iron age village in north Pembrokeshire, Wales. With his son, John, in 1975, he climbed Napes Needle, a pinnacle on the side of Great Gable in the Lake District, inspiring his children and grandchildren with a love of the hills and adventure. He was a volunteer fireman from 1956 to 1974, and in the winter of 1963 rescued a man who had fallen through the ice on Windermere. As the shortest and lightest member of the crew, it was Allan who was chosen to crawl across the ice on a ladder, roped round his middle. Ethel died in 1979. Allan is survived by his children, John, Helen and me, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/01/allan-brockbank-obituary;guardian;entertainment & culture;5832

It was then that she realised her interest in music-making was more than just a childhood pleasure. She began religiously attending open mic nights and dabbling in theatre – but also got a degree in finance. Just in case. (“This degree is definitely a backup plan,” she told Rolling Stone). Thankfully for Debbie, her break came quickly. By the time she was 22 she had signed to the same label as Stormzy – 0207 Def Jam. She co-wrote a few songs on his latest album, This Is What I Mean, as well as lending her hearty vocals to his love song Firebabe. Their recording session is one the rapper said “he would never forget for the rest of my life”. Debbie’s debut single, Is This Real Love?, written in her bedroom, is a delicate track on which she remixes the lyrics from J Hus’s Did You See, layering them with ethereal harmonies. The lyrics are inquisitive and suspicious, asking questions about love that only a Gen Z-er could: “Is it for the ’gram … Are we setting the goals?” Her latest single, Cousin’s Car, featuring Berwyn, is a subtly fervent duet about escapism – equally intimate and relatable. Debbie’s ascendance is one that feels imminent and worthy.

4524;4524;Children face multiple safeguarding risks at out-of-school settings in England;2023-01-09T06:00:10Z;['Sally Weale'];['Education', 'Child protection', 'Department for Education', 'Education policy', 'Ofsted', 'Children', 'Schools', 'UK news'];;A government report has identified multiple safeguarding risks at “out-of-school settings” (OOSS), which include sports clubs, tuition centres and uniformed youth groups attended by millions of children across England every week, prompting calls for better oversight of the sector. Some children were judged to be in “immediate danger” due to unsafe premises, unchecked staff and inappropriate practices, including verbal abuse, physical chastisement, inappropriate sexual behaviour, grooming and reports of child sexual abuse. The report raised concerns about the risk of convicted sex offenders working in out-of-school settings as well as the risk of radicalisation through the sharing of extremist material with children. It also highlighted inappropriate use of social media, with staff befriending children and sending them private messages. The findings follow an 18-month pilot study in 16 council areas, commissioned and funded by the Department for Education (DfE), to look into safeguarding risks in the OOSS sector and the effectiveness of the powers available to local authorities to deal with them. It concluded there was “significant potential for safeguarding harm”. In some of the cases uncovered during the course of the research, either the police or the education watchdog, Ofsted, were contacted. Others did not meet thresholds or lacked the necessary evidence. “Whilst the data is far too limited to make any estimation of scale nationally, the issues raised by the pilot suggest that the government should take more action to improve safeguarding in OOSS since the number of children who attend them and therefore who are at potential risk is high,” the report said. The DfE has since acknowledged the seriousness of the findings and promised to take action to improve safeguarding. The OOSS sector is vast and complex, making efforts to oversee safeguarding challenging. It includes a wide range of provision from uniformed organisations such as cubs and scouts to sports, arts and leisure clubs, faith-based organisations, tuition centres and supplementary schools. The report, which was published in November but has escaped attention until now, says these kinds of settings have no obligation to notify anyone of their existence. There is no formal register and, unlike other educational settings and childcare services, the OOSS sector is unregulated under education and childcare law. The Local Government Association is calling for councils to be given greater powers to oversee and regulate these kinds of settings, including being able to shut down illegal schools. Louise Gittins, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said most out-of-school settings provide “safe, positive and enjoyable environments for children” and play a key role in advancing their learning and development. “However, parents and carers sending their children to an OOSS will rightly expect that they are subject to the appropriate regulation as seen in schools or childcare providers. Current laws make it difficult for councils to act, and at present OOSS are flying under the radar without being required to comply with any safeguarding checks.” She added: “The fact an independent report commissioned by the government has presented these findings is yet further evidence of why it is essential that councils are given oversight of such settings, requiring them to register and work with the local authority, while also ensuring the DfE gives councils the powers and resources they need to intervene where necessary.” Abigail Gill, the associate head of policy and public affairs at the NSPCC children’s charity, said all children should be able to enjoy extracurricular activities with the same degree of safety they have in school or childcare settings. “Unfortunately, this report demonstrates a clear disconnect in terms of safeguarding between educational services and out-of-school settings,” she said. “The government must now work with local authorities to give them the powers and resources to ensure out-of-school settings meet safeguarding standards. Improving information sharing between educational and law enforcement agencies and local government would be a critical first step in identifying safeguarding risks to children and preventing future abuse.” A DfE spokesperson said: “After-school clubs and other out-of-school settings provide a range of stimulating and enriching opportunities for children, and the vast majority take place in a safe environment. However, we recognise the seriousness of the research findings, which is why we are taking forward work to raise standards and help parents.” The DfE said it would work with the children’s commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, safeguarding partners and parent groups to draw up initial proposals to improve safeguarding. A consultation will be launched later this year, guidance for parents will be refreshed, and councils will be supported to help them make full use of their existing legal powers.;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/09/children-multiple-safeguarding-risks-out-of-school-settings-england;guardian;entertainment & culture;4524

Although police investigated and took away his gun at the time, Davison was not charged with assault in September 2020. Instead, a detective sergeant referred him to a restorative justice programme as an alternative to prosecution, and his weapon was later returned.

Davison reacted angrily when a teenager called him a ""fat c***"" and ran off, the court heard.

The 22-year-old responded with a burst of violence so extreme his blameless victim suffered injuries to his eyebrow, nose and lip.

CCTV of the incident in a Plymouth park showed Davison punching the boy at least five times, the inquest into the deaths of Davison's victims was told.

When a 15-year-old girl went to her friend's aid - as he lay on the floor not resisting the volley of blows - she was slapped by Davison.

Davison's legally held pump-action shotgun and certificate were seized by Devon and Cornwall Police following the attack but returned to him in July 2021.

In August 2021, Davison shot dead five people, including his mother Maxine, with his firearm.

The details of Davison assaulting two teenagers came out today at the inquest into the deaths of Davison's five victims.

Davison blamed innocent teenagers

Davison lashed out at a young boy and girl in Central Park, Plymouth, in September 2020.

Although the boy who shouted at him ran away, the inquest heard he took out his anger out on two of the teenager's friends - considering them ""guilty by association"".

Bridget Dolan KC, counsel to the inquest, said: ""The CCTV shows more than five punches to the young man, maybe between seven and nine.

""The boy was hit so hard there was a two-inch cut above his eyebrow, and bleeding to his nose, eyebrow and lip.""

The boy required superficial stitches to his eyebrow and the girl was left with no visible injuries.

Davison later handed himself into the police after a public appeal was made and CCTV images of a suspect were issued.

The parents of the boy wanted Davison charged but he was instead enrolled on the Pathfinder ""voluntary intervention programme"" - which the Devon and Cornwall Police website insists is not a ""soft option"" and can reduce reoffending.

'Shocked by the ferocity of the assault'

After being alerted by staff from the project, Davison's certificate and weapon were seized by firearms inquiry officer David Rees but later returned.

Mr Rees told the inquest: ""Having seen the CCTV last week I was quite shocked by the ferocity of the assault. I wish I had queried the decision-making process of the gatekeeper [the detective sergeant].

""I should have questioned it.""

The inquest has previously heard Davison was so angry following the incident he wanted to kill the teenagers and went home to get his shotgun.

Shakira and Piqué, who played football for Barcelona, Manchester United and the Spanish national team, separated last year after more than a decade and have two children. The former centre-back, 35, has since begun a relationship with a 23-year-old woman, Clara Chía. In the diss track, a collaboration with the Argentinian producer and DJ Bizarrap, Shakira, 45, sings: “I’m worth two 22-year-olds,” adding: “You swapped a Ferrari for a [Renault] Twingo/You swapped a Rolex for a Casio.” The singer also notes: “a she-wolf like me isn’t for rookies” … “I was out of your league, which is why you’re with someone just like you”, and she suggests her gym-loving ex should spend a little time training his brain, too.
As well as punning references to Piqué and his new girlfriend, Shakira mentions her mother-in-law, the media and her ongoing problems with the Spanish revenue authorities, who claim she failed to pay €14.5m in taxes. “You left me with my mother-in-law as a neighbour, with the press at my door and a debt to the taxman,” she sings.
According to Spanish prosecutors, Shakira and her family lived in Barcelona between 2012 and 2014, meaning she should have paid tax in Spain on her worldwide income for those years. They are seeking an eight-year prison sentence and a fine of more than €23m if she is convicted. The singer, however, has accused the country’s fiscal authorities of waging “a salacious press campaign” against her and insisted she owes them nothing. By Friday morning, the song had racked up more than 63.5m views on YouTube, becoming the most watched new Latin music video in the platform’s history and making headlines around the world. It also came to the attention of the Venezuelan singer Briella, who pointed out similarities between it and a song she released last June titled Solo Tú (Only You). “Does that Shakira session sound like Solo Tú to you too?” she wrote on Twitter. “I can’t believe it.” Briella said she was a fan of both Shakira and Bizarrap but felt the song had been “inspired” by her earlier composition and that she would like to be given a credit. She posted clips of the two songs side by side on Twitter and asked her followers: “What do you think?”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/13/shakira-gerard-pique-song-breaks-youtube-record;guardian;entertainment & culture;3721
5096;5096;Kimmel on House Republicans: ‘It’s fun to watch these animals stab each other in the back’;2023-01-05T16:09:37Z;['N/A'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'Seth Meyers', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];;"Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel mocked Republicans in the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening, as they failed for the second day to elect a new speaker. “They’ve been in power for two days, and so far putting Republicans in charge of the House has been like putting woodchucks in charge of your lawn,” he joked.
The presumed next speaker, the California representative Kevin McCarthy, failed to reach the required number of votes six times in two days – “who would’ve guessed that a bunch of insurrection apologists would have trouble certifying a vote?” Kimmel joked. “The last time Kevin felt this abandoned in his house was the movie Home Alone.” McCarthy, a longtime Trump supporter, has been “caucus-blocked” by the Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right Republicans who view him as not far-right enough. Nevertheless, McCarthy already moved his stuff into the speaker’s office before the failed vote, “which is like showing up for a Tinder date with a toothbrush”, Kimmel said.
“The last time something like this happened was 100 years ago,” Kimmel explained. “And I’ll tell you something – Joe Biden solved it then, and he can solve it again now.” Donald Trump offered tepid support for McCarthy on Wednesday, posting on Truth Social that he “will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB”. “He gave a more forceful endorsement to stuffed crust pizza than to Kevin McCarthy,” Kimmel laughed. “I have to admit, it’s fun to watch these animals stabbing each other in the back,” he added. “It’s like the House of Cards, but everyone is Kevin Spacey.” Stephen Colbert
On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert relished the debacle in the House. “McCarthy still hasn’t given up. His speaker battle has become seemingly an endless gripping drama and an epic spectacle,” he said, referring to the saga as “Sad-atar: The Way of Loser”. And the drama could continue – Bob Good, an opponent of McCarthy’s, said it’s worth taking “a few days or a few weeks” to register their dissatisfaction with the presumed speaker. “They’re going to keep voting like this for a few weeks?!” Colbert marveled. “It’s going to be like groundhog’s day, and not just because McCarthy looks like a groundhog. “So far, McCarthy has put a brave face on his historic, once-in-a-century curb stomp,” Colbert continued. As McCarthy told reporters following the votes: “Was it the day I wanted to have? No.” “That’s a pretty mild way to assess the worst day of his political career,” said Colbert. “But despite having no apparent path to victory, McCarthy has said he will not back down.” In an interview following his defeats, McCarthy assured reporters that there was no way he’d consider not trying to become speaker. “Oh, Kevin. Let it go,” Colbert advised. “Don’t you know that one of the most important things about dreams is sometimes they die? Except for my dream where you keep losing over and over again.” Meanwhile, Matt Gaetz, one of the Republicans who have opposed McCarthy’s speakership, released a statement criticizing McCarthy’s pre-emptive move into the office: “What is the basis in law, House rule, or precedent to allow someone who has placed second in three successive speaker elections to occupy the Speaker of the House Office?” “I can’t believe I’m actually going to say this, but … Matt Gaetz is right,” said Colbert. “Well, I mean, that’s weird, but you know what they say: even a broken clock would be a much better congressman than Matt Gaetz.” Seth Meyers
And on Late Night, Seth Meyers enjoyed another day of Republican chaos in the House. “God, you guys can’t even have a red wave amongst yourselves,” he joked. Joe Biden reportedly has no plans to intervene in the speaker vote – “at least not until it stops being hilarious,” Meyers assumed. In Florida, newly re-elected governor and Trump rival Ron DeSantis said in his swearing-in speech that Florida “is where woke goes to die”. Meyers responded that “in fact, it’s where everything goes to die”. Meyers also touched on the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty in federal court on Wednesday to numerous charges including money laundering – “which from the looks of him, maybe the only thing he’s ever laundered,” Meyers joked.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/05/jimmy-kimmel-house-republicans-late-night-tv;guardian;entertainment & culture;5096

While the loan guarantee was itself given by Sam Blyth, a Canadian businessman and distant cousin of Johnson, the report said Sharp had helped with the arrangement, including having a conversation with Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. While Sharp has not commented, a spokesperson for Johnson rejected any wrongdoing. Johnson was visiting Ukraine on Sunday, holding talks in Kyiv with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who Johnson said had invited him. He also visited the towns of Borodianka and Bucha. “The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long,” said Johnson, who as prime minister left domestic political turmoils to travel to Ukraine several times. “The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win – and to win as fast as possible.” Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, has written to William Shawcross, the commissioner for public appointments, to request he examine how Sharp was appointed, saying it was “vital” for the public to know the process had been fair and transparent. Sharp’s reported involvement in securing the loan guarantee was seemingly not declared to the culture department’s appointment panel, to the BBC, or mentioned during a pre-appointment hearing before the culture, media and sport select committee, Powell wrote. “The BBC derives its public trust and national standing from its independence and impartiality, something we hear a lot about from the government about the BBC,” she said. “It is vital that the public and parliament can have trust in this process and it is free from any real or perceived conflict of interest.” A spokesperson for Johnson confirmed that the then-PM did have a dinner with Blyth and Sharp in November 2020, as reported by the Sunday Times, saying Johnson had known Sharp for almost 20 years. The spokesperson added: “So what? Big deal.” Sharp had “never given any financial advice to Boris Johnson, nor has Mr Johnson sought any financial advice from him”, the spokesperson said, saying all Johnson’s financial arrangements “have been properly declared and registered on the advice of officials.” James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, the minister sent out for media interviews on Sunday, said he had not inquired about whether the Sunday Times’ version of events was accurate. “I’ve not had a conversation with either of those parties about that,” Cleverly said told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Asked why he had not sought to find out any information before appearing, Cleverly said: “You’re the journalist, not me.” In a subsequent interview on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cleverly said Sharp was an “incredibly accomplished, incredibly successful individual who brings a wealth of experience with him”, and that he had “absolutely no doubt he was appointed on merit”. A government spokesperson said Sharp was appointed “following a rigorous appointments process including assessment by a panel of experts, constituted according to the public appointments code”. They added: “The recruitment process is set out clearly and transparently in the governance code on public appointments and overseen by the commissioner for public appointments.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/22/johnson-denies-conflict-of-interest-in-appointment-of-bbc-chairman;guardian;politics;1895

Around 30% of Ukraine is covered in landmines and explosives, and failing to remove them could spark a ""domino effect"" in Europe and Africa, a Ukrainian deputy has said.

In a speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Lesia Vasylenko said the devices are now spread over areas of farmland and woodland as well as cities, towns and villages.

""Recently de-occupied areas are the areas which pose the most risks to the livelihood of humans,"" she said.

""Men, women and especially children are admitted every day with wounds from explosives.""

She added that the problem of demining Ukraine is now a global issue, and if equipment is not procured and personnel are not trained, fields will not be ready for farmers to plant their crops in spring.

""This will lead to a domino effect of massive, massive problems, extending far beyond the territory of Ukraine, far beyond the territory of Europe, but over to Africa and the Middle East, and boomeranging back into Europe,"" Ms Vasylenko said.

3130;3130;‘I look like a hot mama in my catsuit!’ – Spice Girl Mel C leaps into modern dance;2023-01-16T16:40:16Z;['Lyndsey Winship'];"['Dance', 'Melanie C', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Stage', ""Sadler's Wells""]";;"In a quiet studio at Sadler’s Wells theatre, three dancers in black leggings are making purposeful angles with their bodies in some pretty leftfield contemporary dance moves. One looks familiar: lean and muscular, a tattoo of a flaming phoenix between her shoulder blades, a Celtic band around her arm. She bends forward and one leg sweeps high into the air behind her. It’s Melanie Chisholm, AKA Mel C, AKA Sporty Spice, rehearsing with the choreographer Jules Cunningham. Chisholm is known for conquering the world with girl power and karate kicks in the late 1990s. She has ridden the giddy highs of global superstardom (as part of the bestselling girl group of all time) and the lows (media pillorying, band breakup, anorexia, depression). Meanwhile, Cunningham is known for unshowy, uncommercial choreography that draws keen but modest audiences. Yet here they are together, with dancer Harry Alexander, rehearsing for a new show called How Did We Get Here?
It’s a good question. Why did Cunningham want to work with Chisholm? “Ooh, I don’t know this, I’m all ears,” says Chisholm with a wicked grin, pulling up a chair in the dressing room next to the others. “Um…” says Cunningham, almost in a whisper, the mood somewhere between embarrassment and hilarity. “Me and Harry used to talk about it a lot, for a couple of years, in a dreamy way.” Cunningham looks at Chisholm. “You were always the best dancer.” The idea then popped out of Cunningham’s mouth during a chat with Sadler’s Wells director Alistair Spalding. “And the next thing you know,” says Chisholm, “we were having a cup of tea.” Dance was Chisholm’s first passion; she won competitions around Merseyside long before she picked up a microphone. The three performers in How Did We Get Here? bonded over their similar backgrounds: going to local dance schools, learning the same steps. Alexander trained at the same performing arts school as Chisholm, Bird College. Cunningham, who at 43 is six years younger than Chisholm, grew up less than half an hour away: “When I was 16, it was inspiring that somebody who grew up near me was doing what she was doing. I could imagine myself beyond where I was.”
They took very different paths, but they’ve all landed here. The piece grew from noticing what was happening in the studio says Cunningham. “Not just how we were dancing but how we were being together. I think all of us had a really hard year and we’re letting all that be in the piece: when we had a cry, when we picked someone up saying, ‘It’s going to be OK.’” The choreography I watch is built on stark lines and slow, fiendish balances, but sometimes the trio lean into or hold on to each other, as if saying, “I’ve got you.” It’s all a subtle but touching demonstration of trust and support. “This piece is so fucking moving,” says Chisholm. “When you work with the body it can be quite intense,” adds Cunningham. “It brings things up. Everything in your life is present in your body – the body keeps the score – all of us have a really unique experience.” Instead of pushing that away to put on an idealised front, Cunningham advises, just be with it. “That’s what people can connect to – you don’t want to be a robot.” It’s interesting Cunningham uses the word robot, because in Chisholm’s autobiography, Who I Am, going into “robot mode” is how she describes her coping strategy at the height of Spicemania, struggling with disordered eating, obsessing over thinness and exercise, constant criticism in the press and a crazy work schedule. She talks eloquently about the links between body and mind, how dance offered an escape when her parents split up, trying to feel invincible physically in order to feel the same emotionally. “There are so many things we don’t have the courage to talk about, face to face. I’m quite quiet. I’m easygoing. I’m a people pleaser. So for me to have a physical outlet to express those emotions was a really healthy thing.”
There’s no dramatic emoting in Cunningham’s choreography: it’s more restrained, but when you look closer it’s full of tenderness. Chisholm is incredulous about the level of detail. “Every production I do has an incredible amount of thought, but this is literally – wow! – about why every finger moves. I’ve had to become more patient. In the commercial world I inhabit, everything has to be done quickly. This has been a good exercise for me and it’s really paid off.” She goes on: “I’m new to contemporary dance and I shied away from even coming to watch it, because I thought it would be intimidating and I wouldn’t understand what was going on. But it’s like when I write a song: people get different things from it. You make it relevant to your own life. Just come with an open mind and it will make you think. And hopefully shed a few tears.” It’s going to be an intimate experience: stage set up in the round, the audience close up, nowhere to hide. That’s a lot of pressure. “There’s been times throughout this where I’ve felt, ‘What am I doing? I don’t need to be putting myself through this!’” But Chisholm is proud to be repping for middle-aged women everywhere. “In the media and entertainment, women of a certain age were hidden away. But now it’s like, ‘Check me out!’ It’s really liberating. I want to inspire other people.”
Chisholm is glowing: she seems very together, very in control. As Cunningham says, “Mel has such a strong physical presence” and she’s sportier than ever, whether that is triathlon or weight training. “For the Spice shows in 2019,” she says, “I wanted to look like a superhero. I wanted to be uber-Sporty. I’ve made so much peace with my body.” Chisholm has been doing the promo rounds for this show, encouraging people to take a punt on contemporary dance, but it turns out all anyone wants to ask is whether the Spice Girls are going to reform for Glastonbury this summer. So has Emily Eavis called yet? “It’s the question I hate the most, because the answer is as disappointing to me as it is to Spice Girls fans,” she says. “We would love to do Glasto. It just doesn’t fit with the current plan with the girls. We do want to get back on stage – everything is up in the air.”
When the band last reformed it was without Victoria Beckham, AKA Posh Spice, who decided she’d had enough of dealing with the pressure of performing. What would it take to persuade her? “She hung up her dancing shoes after the Olympics in 2012,” says Chisholm. “Of course we had incredible stadium shows in 2019.” This was the Spice World tour. “And you know, there’s definitely a bit of fomo for her, so I’m a big optimist. We were all at Geri’s 50th a couple of months back and Victoria was the first one on the dance floor requesting Spice Girls songs.” The other reason Chisholm’s been in the news recently is because she pulled out of a gig in Poland on New Year’s Eve when social media brought to her attention the country’s poor record on LGBTQ+ rights. Chisholm’s a vocal ally of the community and was Attitude magazine’s “Honorary Gay” of 2022. “I’ve never seen myself as an outspoken political artist,” she says. “This is the first time I’ve felt I have to stand up and say my piece. Great strides are being taken forwards in so many places. Unfortunately, in some places it feels like things are going backwards.”
Of course, it’s been pointed out that she has played plenty of gigs in places that don’t have a great record on human rights. “I was actually criticised by an MEP on Twitter for playing in Russia 22 years ago!” she says. But politics just wasn’t on her radar back then. So is this a turning point? “I think it is, for all of us. I’m not always going to get it right, but part of being an ally is that you ask questions and you make mistakes and you learn from them. And I’m sure I will make more mistakes.” Chisholm has to dash out for a costume fitting. “Just tried on my catsuit. I look like a hot mama,” she says, then adds: “I talk too much anyway. I’m hogging the limelight.” She eyes her fellow dancers and, referring to our chat, says: “Just getting you back for next week when you two pull focus.” They all giggle. Cunningham and Alexander are indeed impressive to watch, but there’ll be a lot of eyes on Sporty, from her fans and her friends. “I’ve got to do my guest list this weekend,” she says. “There’s been big interest.” Hooting with laughter, she adds: “Oi Ginger! You can buy your own tickets!” • How Did We Get Here? is at Sadler’s Wells, London, from 19-29 January";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/16/hot-mama-catsuit-spice-girl-mel-c-sporty-modern-dance-ginger;guardian;entertainment & culture;3130
2047;2047;Pep Guardiola warns faltering City not to expect ‘caviar’ of successive titles;2023-01-21T22:30:18Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Manchester City', 'Pep Guardiola', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Pep Guardiola has warned Manchester City not to be sucked in by the “caviar” of being serial Premier League champions as he was after winning four successive Spanish titles as a Barcelona midfielder in the 90s. The manager was unhappy with his players – “a happy flowers team” – after Thursday’s 4-2 comeback win over Tottenham, his side having trailed 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. He identified a complacency that caused them to lack the desire to press and fight for each other.
Between 1990 and 94 Guardiola was a part of the Barça team that claimed consecutive La Liga titles but he felt this sated his desire. “I won four Liga titles in Spain when I was a player, four in a row, and the fifth [season] was not the same and the sixth was not the same. I was not starving enough. [Too much] caviar, [Real] Madrid beat me,” he said. “I understand [the players] but I am here to [motivate them]. The chairman knows that. “I want to be here but if I lose the team, I cannot be here. We are second in the table, we are not 25 points behind Arsenal, still we are there – 57 points still to play [for].” Of his side’s prospects of claiming another title on current form, he said: “In this way – how we played – no chance.” City have dropped eight points from their last six games and are five behind Arsenal before Wolves’s visit on Sunday. Guardiola cited the concession of goals in last Saturday’s 2-1 loss to Manchester United and the 3-2 Carabao Cup win over Liverpool in Christmas week. “The club has to move [back in the right direction],” he said. “These goals we gave them – unacceptable against Liverpool, unacceptable against United. We don’t have [that certain] something.” Guardiola had praise for Jack Grealish, Nathan Aké and Manuel Akanji for their display against Spurs. “Have you seen Jack Grealish, to go down and tackle and every time do it? Nathan, for example, or Manu to win the duels there? Every game has to be like that,” he said. “That is how we did 15 wins in a row, 18 wins in a row [in previous seasons].
“Sorry for the haters, we will be in the history books for the Premier League, for what we have done. It is undeniable how good we have done, the consistency of playing at that good level. But that is the past, now it is here.” Guardiola was asked if he will cheer on City’s local rivals United when they play Arsenal later on Sunday. “It is not about that,” he said. “If they lose against United, [it doesn’t matter] because if we play like this we are not going to catch them. We have to change ourselves. ” He pointed to Mikel Arteta’s team as an example of what City are lacking. “They have everything, all the pieces. They defend 10 players in the box, five in the back, six in the back, good transitions, win duels and look at how they celebrate a goal, how they talk, look at each other, communicate. This is football. We don’t have it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/21/pep-guardiola-warns-manchester-city-not-to-expect-caviar-successive-titles;guardian;sports;2047
1229;1229;Six lifestyle choices to slow memory decline named in 10-year study;2023-01-25T23:30:42Z;['Andrew Gregory'];"['Memory', 'Ageing', 'Dementia', 'Health', 'Science', 'UK news', 'World news', ""Alzheimer's"", 'Diets and dieting', 'Life and style', 'Mental health', 'Alcohol', 'Smoking', 'Research', 'China', 'Society']";;"A combination of healthy lifestyle choices such as eating well, regularly exercising, playing cards and socialising at least twice a week may help slow the rate of memory decline and reduce the risk of dementia, a decade-long study suggests. Memory is a fundamental function of daily life that continuously declines as people age, impairing quality of life and productivity, and increasing the risk of dementia. Evidence from previous research has been insufficient to evaluate the effect of healthy lifestyle on memory trajectory, but now a study suggests that combining multiple healthy lifestyle choices – the more the better – is linked with softening the speed of memory decline. “A combination of positive healthy behaviours is associated with a slower rate of memory decline in cognitively normal older adults,” researchers from the National Center for Neurological Disorders in Beijing, China, wrote in the BMJ. Practising multiple healthy lifestyle choices together “was associated with a lower probability of progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia”, they added. Researchers analysed 29,000 adults aged over 60 with normal cognitive function who were part of the China Cognition and Aging Study. At the start of the study in 2009, memory function was measured using tests and people were checked for the APOE gene, which is the strongest risk-factor gene for Alzheimer’s disease. The subjects were then monitored for 10 years with periodic assessments. A healthy lifestyle score combining six factors was calculated: a healthy diet; regular exercise; active social contact; cognitive activity; non-smoking; and not drinking alcohol. Based on their score, ranging from zero to six, participants were put into lifestyle groups – favourable (four to six healthy factors), average (two to three healthy factors), or unfavourable (0 to 1 healthy factors) – and into APOE-carrier and non-carrier groups. A healthy diet was deemed as eating the recommended intake of at least seven out of 12 food groups: fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, dairy, salt, oil, eggs, cereals, legumes, nuts and tea. Writing, reading, playing cards or other games at least twice a week was the second area of healthy behaviour. Other areas included drinking no alcohol, exercising for more than 150 minutes a week at moderate intensity or more than 75 at vigorous intensity, and never having smoked or being an ex-smoker. Social contact at least twice a week was the sixth healthy behaviour, including activities such as visiting family and friends, attending meetings or going to parties. After accounting for factors likely to affect the results, the researchers found that each individual healthy behaviour was associated with a slower-than-average decline in memory over 10 years. A healthy diet had the strongest effect on slowing memory decline, followed by cognitive activity and then physical exercise. People with the APOE gene who had healthy lives on the whole also experienced a slower rate of memory decline than those with APOE who were the least healthy. Overall, people with four to six healthy behaviours or two to three were almost 90% and almost 30% respectively less likely to develop dementia or mild cognitive impairment relative to those who were the least healthy, the BMJ reported. Dr Susan Mitchell, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “This is a well-conducted study, which followed people over a long period of time, and adds to the substantial evidence that a healthy lifestyle can help to support memory and thinking skills as we age. “Too few of us know that there are steps we can all take to reduce our chances of dementia in later life.” • This article was amended on 26 January 2023 to include the words “recommended intake of” in relation to eating at least seven out of 12 food groups.";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/25/six-lifestyle-choices-to-slow-memory-decline-named-in-10-year-study;guardian;health;1229
2237;2237;‘Blessed’ Jürgen Klopp set to reach 1,000 games as a manager;2023-01-20T17:11:29Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Jürgen Klopp has said he feels blessed to have reached 1,000 games as a manager but believes his illustrious career would have been over before it had really started had he lost one more game at Mainz. The Liverpool manager will reach the milestone against Chelsea on Saturday. Klopp has won 548 of his 999 matches, having managed 270 games for Mainz, 319 for Borussia Dortmund and 410 for Liverpool. “It is a massive thing, a crazy number – I feel really blessed,” he said. “The beard is really grey now, and that was not the case when I arrived here. I’m not sure if that is because of the age or because of Liverpool. I did the job I loved for the clubs I loved so I am blessed.”
Klopp’s managerial career began almost 22 years ago when he was placed in temporary charge of relegation-threatened Mainz, where he spent most of his playing career, and tasked with keeping the club in Bundesliga 2. They survived by three points thanks to six wins in the final seven games but Klopp believes he would not have landed the job permanently had the club gone down. “If we lost one more I think we would have been relegated,” he said. “To win five from the first seven would have been an outstanding number but no one would have recognised it; you just go down to the third league and a promising coaching career would be finished before it really started. I was lucky that didn’t happen. “The job I do today is completely different but my advice would be: be open, work hard, be curious, nosey, look around the corners and try to find solutions for the problems you don’t have in the moment but will have in the future. The most important thing is be busy, learn the game. “Coaching is like golf: when you think you have got it the game will tell you differently. You always have to develop and that is what I like most about it. It was not for one second boring – that is the best thing you can say about your working life and the best thing I can imagine to do.” Liverpool supporters’ union Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association and Football Supporters Europe, meanwhile, have condemned the reduced ticket allocation for Liverpool’s Champions League tie at Real Madrid in March. Liverpool fans have been given only four wheelchair tickets – located in the home section – and a reduced allocation of 1,800 for the last-16 second leg because of the redevelopment of the Bernabéu. Uefa regulations state that host clubs must provide 5% of their capacity as an away allocation but Liverpool have been offered 3%. In a joint statement, the supporters’ groups said: “It is entirely unacceptable for a club to openly disregard Uefa regulations as well as its responsibility to supporters in this manner. The reduced away allocation, if left unchanged, risks setting a worrying precedent for clubs to tamper with Uefa’s regulations and bend them to their own preference as they see appropriate. Real Madrid must abide by Uefa’s regulations on away allocations.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/20/blessed-jurgen-klopp-1000-games-as-manager-liverpool-borussia-dortmund-mainz;guardian;sports;2237
6351;6351;TV writer Jack Thorne reveals how Desert Island Discs interview led to autism diagnosis;Wednesday 4 January 2023 17:52, UK;[];['autism'];['reveals', 'diagnosis', 'thorne', 'island', 'jack', 'started', 'tv', 'listener', 'writer', 'help', 'discs', 'im', 'diagnosed', 'understand', 'know', 'led', 'interview', 'told'];"BAFTA-winning screenwriter and playwright Jack Thorne has revealed he sought advice and was subsequently diagnosed with autism after a listener got in touch about his interview on Desert Island Discs.

Thorne, whose work includes the acclaimed This Is England series, pandemic drama Help, and The Virtues - all starring Stephen Graham - as well as His Dark Materials, the Enola Holmes films and the script for the Harry Potter And The Cursed Child theatre production, appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme in December 2021.

Writing on Twitter, the 44-year-old told his followers he was diagnosed just before Christmas, following a ""long journey"" that started with a listener reaching out about his interview with host Lauren Laverne.

The listener asked if he had considered whether he might be on the autistic spectrum, he said.

""Some personal news: just before Christmas I was diagnosed autistic,"" he wrote. ""A long journey but one I'm very very happy to have gone on. Makes sense of stuff before, hopefully will help with stuff to come. I don't understand it all yet, but I'm getting there.

""Bizarrely it started with doing Desert Island Discs - a very kind listener reached out and asked whether I'd considered the idea I might be autistic. My lovely agent, who got the note, thought there might be truth to it. My wife did too. So I started digging in.

""It's a complicated process, getting diagnosed, but I found lots of kindness along the way. I'm very very very pleased to have done it, and I'm very very very pleased to know this about myself.""

In his Desert Island Discs interview, while choosing eight songs or recordings he would choose to be cast away with, Thorne told Laverne how he liked working on more than one project at a time as ""I stop sleeping if I'm working on one project because I become obsessed with it, and not in a healthy way... sometimes having something to swap to - that you go, oh, I can still do this, I'm not terrible, I can sleep, I can turn my brain off - is very good"".

When asked about his time studying at the University of Cambridge, he told how he felt like he didn't fit in well with other students.

""I'm really awkward and I don't quite know how other people work and I'm constantly sort of on the outside, looking at them and going, I understand how you're talking, I understand why you're talking, but I don't quite know how to get involved in the conversation.""

Thorne, who delivered the MacTaggart lecture at the 2021 Edinburgh TV Festival, calling for the industry to do more for disabled people, also spoke about being diagnosed with the skin condition cholinergic urticaria, or chronic hives - which can be caused by stress - at the age of 20.

And speaking about his inspiration for Help, he said it came from reading about COVID-19 devastating care homes in a local newspaper.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230104180228/http://news.sky.com/story/tv-writer-jack-thorne-reveals-how-desert-island-discs-interview-led-to-autism-diagnosis-12779840;skynews;health;442
1349;1349;Top 10 novels about office jobs | Caroline Corcoran;2023-01-25T12:00:20Z;['Caroline Corcoran'];['Books', 'Fiction', 'Culture', 'Muriel Spark', 'Dave Eggers'];;"Identifiable by the bright front doors on their covers, domestic noir novels have become an established genre in recent years. But we don’t yet have a term for their office counterpart. And yet there is just as much power in this setting. Much the same extremes of human experience play out there. Colleagues take on the emotional heft normally absorbed by family members; swathes of our most personal belongings often lurk under desks and in drawers. There are few in-jokes as potent as the office in-joke, but the mood can shift quickly with the pressure of an angry boss or a missed deadline. The office is a place of extremes, intense with the buzz of industry and the threat of failure, and that’s a perfect starting point for fiction. As a writer who finds it useful to anchor fictional plot and characters to a place or setting I know, I started mulling over the idea of using the office environment for my fourth book. While I work from home now, for years I burrowed daily into the anonymous armpits of fellow commuters and headed into the office. What Happened on Floor 34? puts the workplace front and central to the action, and here, I’ve chosen other books that do the same. 1. The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger I was lucky enough not to have encountered a truly awful boss when I first read this, meaning that I could enjoy it solely as the sharp and funny novel it is, about a young woman who goes to work for tyrannical fashion editor Miranda Priestly. By the time I came back to it for a re-read, I had worked in more offices and the Miranda Priestlys of my own life made it resonate in a different way, Priestly stark in her reign of terror. I went freelance shortly afterwards. 2. Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris Offices are places where great comedy can be found. Booker-shortlisted Joshua Ferris pins this humour down in this character-driven novel with a huge cast of eccentric characters; it is in equal turn tender and tragic. 3. The Circle by Dave Eggers Published almost 10 years ago, this novel – based in a Silicon Valley social media giant – was incredibly prescient. Shining a light on the way we give our whole selves to jobs we love, The Circle sees Mae land the gig of her dreams. Before long, work is her life. A cautionary reminder to pay attention to your work-life balance. 4. Not Working by Lisa Owens I don’t tend to laugh out loud at books; this is still one of only a handful of novels that have forced an audible cackle from me. Not Working gets into this list on a technicality – it’s actually set around leaving an office – but I would argue that the workplace and its role in shaping our identity lies at the heart of this novel by virtue of its absence, as Claire struggles to find her feet without the marketing job she has quit. 5. A Far Cry from Kensington by Muriel Spark It’s perhaps unsurprising that many novels set in offices choose publishing as their industry of choice. In Spark’s tale, we travel back to the postwar book business of London, where the blunt, no-nonsense Mrs Hawkins (favourite phrase for a terrible writer: a “pisseur de copie”) manages to lose not one but two jobs in these, her witty reminiscences from 30 years later.
6. The Best of Everything by Rona Jaffe Jaffe’s excellent novel (shown to be reading material for Mad Men’s Don Draper) charts women’s arrival in the office in 50s New York. It tells the story of three young women, Caroline, April and Gregg, who work in a New York typing pool, balancing their jobs with the different pressures of their lives. The book delves deep – Jaffe interviewed 50 women about the most private parts of their lives for her research – while delivering a lightness that makes it feel more modern than it is. Glorious. 7. There’s No Such Thing As An Easy Job by Kikuko Tsumura This novel – translated from Japanese by Polly Barton – came at a pertinent time. Published in 2020, it is about an unnamed thirtysomething woman who walks into an employment agency and asks for a job that involves minimal thinking. The book took a close look at the workplace and its role in our lives at the exact moment that many had just left it behind and were settling into Zoom calls and elasticated waistbands. Quietly hilarious. Absurd. Absolutely worth a read. 8. The Other Black Girl by Zakiya Dalila Harris An important book which delves into race and class inside the publishing industry. When Nella joins Wagner Books, she is part of a new generation of editors in a predominantly white industry. Then along comes Hazel-May, the “other black girl”, and before we know it the book changes tack and we’re in the sphere of a thriller. 9. Careering by Daisy Buchanan I’m a huge fan of Buchanan’s writing and would read an instruction manual if that was what she wanted to publish next, but the description of this 2022 novel particularly intrigued me. Examining our relationships with our jobs in the careful detail we often reserve for romance, Buchanan tells the tale of two women at crossroads in their magazine journalism careers. Bursting with empathy and wit, this book will send your heart soaring and crashing.
10. Small Pleasures by Clare Chambers I was lent this while I was working on What Happened on Floor 34?, at a point when I usually seek out books that are removed from what I am writing. I didn’t realise until I opened Clare Chambers’ gargantuan word-of-mouth hit that it was also set in a newspaper office and by then it was too late to put this beautiful book down. I was hooked. Chambers uses the germ of journalist Jean’s story – a woman contacting her with a claim that her daughter was the result of a virgin birth – to form the novel’s own narrative. A beautifully crafted gift of a book. • Caroline Corcoran is the author of four books. Her latest, What Happened on Floor 34?, is published by Avon.

5896;5896;How sweet the sound: new orchestral piece to celebrate 250 years of Amazing Grace;2023-01-01T06:00:39Z;['Vanessa Thorpe'];['Music', 'Christianity', 'Milton Keynes', 'Religion', 'Culture', 'Roderick Williams', 'Evangelical Christianity', 'Slavery'];;"A declaration of gratitude and humility, the Christian anthem Amazing Grace is sung around the world at significant moments. The stirring lyric sometimes expresses a sense of loss, yet equally often a shared hope for the future. The song, familiar as the soundtrack to social protest, is also closely associated with the arrival of the new year, and its verses were first heard in public 250 years ago on 1 January in the small Buckinghamshire town of Olney, near Milton Keynes. The lyric, thanking God for enlightening a sinner, was originally part of a sermon written for New Year’s Day 1773 by the Rev John Newton, a repentant former slave trader who presided over the congregation at the Olney church of St Peter and St Paul. Now a major new orchestral and choral piece entitled Forever will be performed in recognition of the landmark anniversary. The collaborative project, being created by leading black and ethnically diverse British talent, aims to celebrate the international resonance of Amazing Grace. In the 20th century, the hymn earned a special role in the American civil rights movement, despite Newton’s links to slavery. Now the award-winning poet Rommi Smith is writing the libretto for music composed by the leading operatic baritone Roderick Williams. Their piece will be premiered this summer by Britain’s much-garlanded Chineke! Orchestra as part of the Milton Keynes International Festival. “It is a hymn that seems to always have been there, but it has special resonance for me because I have specialised in writing about civil rights,” said Smith.
Newton worked on a series of hymns in Olney with the poet William Cowper, and the duo are a key part of the cultural heritage of the area. The town’s Cowper & Newton Museum has helped Smith with her research following her commission last summer, when The Stables, Milton Keynes’ theatre and music venue, approached her to write the libretto. Smith plans to explain the wider impact of Amazing Grace, which is still such a standard in America that it accompanied the 2020 funeral of George Floyd, the victim of police violence whose death sparked worldwide protests. It was also sung by US President Barack Obama at the 2015 funeral for one of the victims of a mass shooting at a Charleston church. “Our new musical piece will reflect on all that,” said Smith. “I want to look at the song’s enduring properties and its reach, as well as at the puzzle of Newton’s slave trading past.” The tune that most people know, arranged in 1909 by the American music publisher and composer EO Excell, is one of several the lyric was first set to. Today, the many versions of the popular tune, whether sung in the gospel style, in a rowdy pub, or by a great soul diva, have given it a layered series of meanings.
“Black Americans have claimed it, with versions by Aretha Franklin, Mahalia Jackson and Whitney Houston, each re-authoring it with their singing,” said Smith. “These performances, particularly the live ones in front of an audience, often have ad-libbed lines, or added jazz scatting, about issues of the moment.” Newton’s own life story certainly lives up to the emotional rollercoaster of his powerful lyric. Born in Wapping, east London in 1725, his unhappy childhood at home and boarding school was followed by a career on the high seas. Press-ganged into the navy, he survived hardships at sea and also built up a reputation among shipmates for writing obscene rhymes. Then came an enforced period as the crew of slave ship and the beginning of a lucrative career investing in the trade. Newton even briefly suffered a period of a slavery himself, held in bonded service to a high-ranking member of the Sherbro people in what is now Sierra Leone. His religious conversion came in 1748 at the end of a stormy voyage back to England via Ireland. The level of his evangelical conviction then prompted friends to suggest he join the English clergy.
Piecing together all the implications of this backstory, Smith has focused on the responses to a succession of interviews with refugees, activists, members of the clergy, asylum seekers, church-goers and some of the black residents now living in the area around Olney, as well as with contacts in Sierra Leone. What was clear, Smith said, is that the hymn is seen as a kind of musical sanctuary in turbulent times. “It is regarded as a comfort, which is an idea I have used in the first stanzas I have written, using the imagery of a warm coat, after speaking to some refugees from Ukraine.” Responses from people aware of Newton’s past in the slave trade came in one of two kinds. Some felt they owned a new, rewritten version of the hymn after hearing modern renditions by artists such as Judy Collins, Jackson or Franklin, while others felt conflicted but hoped that Newton’s eventual rejection of the slave trade meant he had been redeemed. “Those who look to their faith for redemption saw hope in Newton’s later life, when he gave testimony against slavery in London and became friendly with the abolitionist William Wilberforce,” said Smith. Even for interviewees with no religious belief, the song seemed to represent both comfort and hope at uncertain moments. “It is a song that holds you steadfast,” concluded Smith. “It is passionate and reassuring at the same time. And we all need reassurance and an answer to the question, ‘Am I on the right path?’” • The subheading of this article was amended on 3 January 2023. An earlier version incorrectly referred to the Chineke! Orchestra as a “black orchestra”; in fact it is comprised of majority black and ethnically diverse musicians. Also Roderick Williams was described as a tenor, when he is a baritone.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/01/how-sweet-the-sound-new-orchestral-piece-to-celebrate-250-years-of-amazing-grace;guardian;entertainment & culture;5896
5179;5179;Tech grifters out, Abercrombie in: what the ‘vibe shift’ will bring in 2023;2023-01-05T10:00:17Z;['Alaina Demopoulos'];['Life and style', 'Fashion', 'Technology', 'Sam Bankman-Fried', 'US news', 'Culture'];;"You may not need to be a trend-forecaster to know this but “2023 is going to be a bad year”. So says Sean Monahan, who writes the substack 8Ball, and last year correctly predicted the “vibe shift” popularized in a widely shared essay in the Cut by Allison P Davis. “It’s hard for me to predict or have a strong intuition on 2023, because the economy is behaving very strangely now,” Monahan tells the Guardian. Still, some trends are already coming into view. Enjoy the Sam Bankman-Fried crypto drama while you still can, because scammers are out, he says. Tech is no longer “the last good career”. Music faces a grim future, too. And don’t be surprised if 2023 finds you seeing a show or partying in a converted office space. What do you think we’ll leave behind in 2023? One thing I’ve been making jokes about is how this is the end of zero-interest-rate culture. It’s been called the millennial lifestyle subsidy: things like Uber, Airbnb or delivery services were cheap and priced below what it costs to deliver that service, because there were low, low interest rates through the 2010s. As that changes, we’re going to see some of the shifts in the kinds of businesses that people build.
I can already tell that it’s going to be much harder to be a grifter in 2023 than it was in 2019. Five years ago, you could see people getting a lot of funding, and it was hard to understand where they got that money. They clearly had no business experience, no tech competency and no capacity to build any products. There’s a reason we had so many con artists and grifters in the past decade: there was more money searching for a place to make a profit. That’s going away, and I think that’s a good thing. There was this millennial idea that tech was the last good career, and that seems over. From a cultural standpoint, it has no aura. Who’s due for a comeback this year? Lindsay Lohan, but that’s kind of in the works. Cobrasnake had his comeback, and so did the Strokes. Abercrombie has had a slow-boil comeback. I think people want the old Abercrombie. There was that documentary on Netflix, which laid bare all of their terrible and racist business practices.
Despite the brand’s moral misgivings, the branding was very strong and on-point, all that Bruce Weber photography, homoeroticism, and relaxed north-eastern vibes. I see people wearing those old Abercrombie and Fitch briefs with the band of underwear just peeking out above jeans, so that people can see it. What did you make of Balenciaga’s recent campaign, featuring teddy bears in bondage gear and papers on child abuse law? It was supposed to be edgy or subversive, but it just ended up playing into QAnon’s hand. Maybe there are certain things where your ironic humor will get you into trouble, and Balenciaga certainly discovered a third rail here. Edginess is not going to go away; I think smaller brands will still do it. I don’t know if major brands will. I think Balenciaga’s biggest problem over the last couple of years is being too dominant for too long. Fashion is a system that relies on novelty and overturning the people who run the scoreboard. I think there’s a desire to reappoint Celine as the cool kid brand over Balenciaga. And that goes back to the 2010s: the rise of Celine happened then. So again, it’s cool kids who are looking just beyond the horizon of what everyone else is into. Indie sleaze came back during the pandemic, but now you see people who are peeking over the horizon of late hipster-dom and are going to revise minimalism.
You think minimalism is coming back after a year of over-the-top dopamine dressing? I don’t think it will come back immediately. The whole last decade was so minimalist. And it can be a problem for fashion: if brands become so minimalist, it’s hard to distinguish one from the other. When I think of minimalism, I think of the new aesthetic in tech products. Everything looks the same, and it has for a while. So there’s a burnout with minimalism. Everyone has the same phone. But suddenly we see young people going out and buying digital cameras when they already have their iPhones. They don’t want all of their photos to look the same. There’s a boredom in that. What else do you think we’ll be wearing in 2023? Some people have been asking about the return of normcore. And here’s the thing: millennials are becoming yuppies. They’ve grown up, and that’s part of what the vibe shift is. The original normcore dynamic was interesting, not necessarily because of the styles, but because of who was wearing it. There was something ironic, and maybe somewhat infuriating, to have cool downtown kids dressed like suburban moms. I don’t know if it’s as interesting to have suburban moms dressed as suburban moms. There certainly seems to be a rise of the preppy aesthetic, which seems like it will keep chugging upwards.
Gen Z and millennials showed up en masse to go vote in the midterms. How do you think people will engage with politics this year? There’s an exhaustion with politics, especially the hyper-politicization of social media. We’re all exhausted with what the late 2010s were like. And I think we’ll see an avoidance of political conflict online. Voting is different – that’s a tried-and-true method of political engagement. But the social justice movements of 2020 have been fully integrated in corporate marketing. Those things no longer feel punk or avant-garde because you see them in ads for soap. Arguing with people on the internet about the fact that you don’t agree with them feels over. Or at least it feels like old people’s behavior. A good parallel would be why millennials stopped using Facebook around the 2016 election, because they didn’t want to keep fighting with family members about Trump. Facebook has become one-note in that way. So people migrated to Instagram, but now Instagram has the same dynamic that people increasingly want to avoid. Making a political slideshow on Instagram is something I can only see a millennial doing. Why is 2000s nostalgia still so attractive right now? Well, periods of nostalgia are always reinterpretations of the periods they’re pointing towards. When I was young in the early 2000s, there was a lot of 80s nostalgia. And people who see themselves as avant-garde will kind of nudge up the nostalgia a little bit, to seem more original. You have kids now who say: “Oh no, I’m not interested in the mid-aughts, I’m interested in 2012.” But generally, I think it’s because when you have young people looking at parties from that era, they seem to be a lot wilder. And they were.
When I moved to New York in 2010, there were still abandoned industrial spaces in north Brooklyn. People were having parties there; it was the outgrowth of the early 2000s DIY movement and the accessibility of live/work studios. Now, it’s very hard to find a cheap live/work studio if you’re an underemployed 23-year-old. The amount of space that young people have available to themselves to socialize in is a lot lower. And that’s never going to come back. Where will young people gather and socialize if they’ve been priced out of most cities?
One thought is that maybe with the rise of remote work, that office space could be converted into clubs. But the arc of these cities like New York or London having industrial spaces kids can convert into housing, clubs, and art studios really isn’t coming back. And I don’t think people are as comfortable with teenagers having independent spaces any more. Your parents couldn’t put a tracker on your cellphone in 2003, but they can now. Still, people want to gather, and there are hard limits to what the digital socialization and communities we saw during lockdowns can achieve without an IRL component. Socialization has been made much more expensive, especially, again, compared to a decade ago when you could get $2 PBRs as opposed to a $30 martini. People are trying to find whatever way they can around that. Maybe video games, or spaces like Twitch, could become a substitution.
Music is going to have a hard time this year. The cheap, dingy venues are gone, so young people use video games as a social space. It’s like a phone call, but you’re also doing an activity together. What do you mean when you say that music is going to have a hard time this year? I don’t want to imply that people will stop making music and music scenes, but we have a shift where people are listening to more catalogue music than new music. Music used to be something that was relatively specialized, and part of the reason why people were interested in scenes was that it was something other people didn’t know about and it made them special. It doesn’t feel quite as special when Spotify and Apple Music are curating everything you’re listening to. It’s all about algorithmic recommendations, as opposed to a friend sending you something or you getting invited into a space. That’s made music feel much less special.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/05/vibe-shift-2023-trends-predictions;guardian;entertainment & culture;5179
726;726;Fears of escalating conflict as gunman injures two Israelis in East Jerusalem;2023-01-28T10:03:04Z;['Bethan McKernan'];['Israel', 'Palestinian territories', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news'];;Two Israelis have been shot in occupied East Jerusalem hours after a gunman killed seven people outside a synagogue, as the worst violence in years across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories continues to escalate. Israel’s ambulance service said a father and son, in their 50s and 20s, were badly hurt in the incident in a Jewish neighbourhood near the Old City on Saturday morning. Police said the assailant had been shot by an armed passerby. There were conflicting reports on his condition. Police identified the attacker as a 13-year-old boy and unconfirmed Arabic and Hebrew media reports said he was from the nearby Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan. Saturday’s shooting came after a Palestinian gunman killed seven people, including children, near a synagogue on the outskirts of East Jerusalem as they were leaving Shabbat prayers on Friday night. The attack in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov was the worst targeting Israelis in years. The 21-year-old suspect was shot and killed as he tried to flee, police said. Forty-two people, including members of the gunman’s family, were arrested overnight in connection with the attack. Israeli police and the army have been put on high alert and extra troops have been posted to Jerusalem and the West Bank in anticipation of more violence. The Neve Yaakov attack, in turn, came a day after the deadliest Israeli army raid in the West Bank in two decades, in which nine Palestinians were killed, including two civilians. Thursday morning’s operation targeted Islamic Jihad militants in the Jenin refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank, triggering tit-for-tat rocket fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel in the early hours of Friday and sparking fears of a conflagration in the decades-long conflict. The Palestinian Authority, which has limited control over parts of the West Bank, said it would suspend security cooperation with Israel in response to the Jenin raid. Last year was the bloodiest in Israel and the West Bank since 2004, with about 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis killed. Another 49 Palestinians died in the Gaza Strip in a surprise three-day Israeli bombing campaign in August. Thirty-two Palestinians have been killed so far this month. Illustrating the potential for further escalation, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday night that three Palestinians were taken to hospital after being shot by an Israeli settler in an incident near the northern West Bank city of Nablus. The US state department, along with the UN and other international mediators, has urged “utmost restraint” from both sides to de-escalate the situation. This week’s bloodshed comes just after the re-election of the longtime Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now at the helm of the most extremist government in Israeli history. Netanyahu’s coalition of religious and far-right parties has vowed stricter policies towards the Palestinians, including loosening the rules of engagement for soldiers and police, and the acceleration of Jewish settlement building in the West Bank. Netanyahu vowed on Saturday evening to take forceful and timely measures after the two attacks. “Our response will be strong, swift and accurate,” he said before a meeting of the security cabinet. “We’re not seeking an escalation but are prepared for any scenario.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/28/fears-of-escalating-conflict-as-gunman-injures-two-israelis-in-east-jerusalem;guardian;politics;726
8148;8148;Cough syrup deaths: WHO urges 'immediate action' after 300 child deaths last year;Tuesday 24 January 2023 10:01, UK;[];['gambia', 'india', 'indonesia', 'uzbekistan'];['child', 'urges', '300', 'suppliers', 'syrup', 'deaths', 'action', 'cough', 'medicines', 'pt', 'products', 'contaminated', 'manufacturers', 'immediate'];"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for ""immediate and concerted action"" after the deaths of more than 300 children were linked to contaminated cough syrup last year.

In 2022, more than 300 children in Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan - who were mostly under the age of five - died of acute kidney injury, in deaths associated with contaminated medicines, the WHO said.

The over-the-counter medicines contained high levels of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, the WHO warning added.

""These contaminants are toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents that can be fatal even taken in small amounts, and should never be found in medicines,"" the organisation said.

The Philippines, Timor Leste, Senegal and Cambodia also have the medicines on sale and could be impacted, Reuters reported.

The WHO called for action across its 194 member states to prevent more deaths.

""Since these are not isolated incidents, WHO calls on various key stakeholders engaged in the medical supply chain to take immediate and coordinated action,"" its experts said on Monday.

The WHO has already sent specific product alerts in October, November and January, requesting some ""substandard products"" are removed from circulation to ""prevent harm to patients"".

The alerts covered some cough syrups made by India's Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Marion Biotech, as well as similar medicines made by four Indonesian manufacturers - PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Universal Pharmaceutical, PT Konimex and PT AFI Pharma - that were sold domestically.

The companies involved have either denied that their products have been contaminated or declined to comment while investigations are ongoing.

But the WHO reiterated its call for the products to be removed from circulation, as well as urging countries to ensure that any medicines for sale are approved by competent authorities.

It also asked governments and regulators to assign resources to inspect manufacturers, increase market surveillance and take action where required.

While manufacturers should only buy raw ingredients from qualified suppliers, test their products more thoroughly and keep records of the process, the WHO added.

The WHO also said suppliers and distributors should check for signs of falsification and only distribute or sell medicines authorised for use.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124101913/http://news.sky.com/story/cough-syrup-deaths-who-urges-immediate-action-after-300-child-deaths-last-year-12794065;skynews;health;2239

Spoiler alert: maybe. Plants, it explained, “can sense the world around them, learn, remember and engage in complex communication with the species around them”. Research suggests that pea seedlings can learn to associate a sound with the light they need and choose to grow in a particular direction as a result. They can also eavesdrop on each other and protect themselves based on what they “hear”. Sagebrush plants communicate to each other the risk of being chomped by insects and trees share nutrients through what Prof Suzanne Simard pleasingly calls the “wood wide web”; they do so more with trees they are related to than with “strangers”. Do plants show intelligence? “Definitely, yes – I don’t see any problem with this,” replied one interviewee on the programme, putting me off my baked potato and raising fears about what the houseplants my son unwisely left in my care are saying about me behind my back. It is a head-spinning indication of how much we still have to learn about the world. The really knotty question, though, is what is left for a would-be ethical eater’s lunch? Ethical fruitarianism – eating only the parts of plants that detach harmlessly, causing no damage – might meet the standards of the Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology (which has ruled that plants have the right to be protected from undue harm). But what could we eat in the UK at this time of year under that regime: nuts? Wouldn’t we be depriving squirrels? Lab-created meat is still at the experimental stage and costs more than a Salt Bae gold-sprinkled steak, but is roadkill allowed? I would say breatharianism – only “eating” air – is due a revival, but it is mad, dangerous and probably a cult, so no. Alternatively, we could fly in the face of decades of medical advice and stick to stuff with no discernible relationship to anything living: the Irn-Bru diet? My last option: learn to photosynthesise.

Zahra Mansouri’s boxing ring stage is slowly pulled apart as the glittering career gives way to the second, darker act in Vanriel’s life when he sinks into depression and drug dependency. Worse still, he is refused re-entry to the UK after travelling to Jamaica, living in poverty and ill health for the next 13 years before David Lammy MP and the Guardian’s campaigning leads to his return home, and a landmark victory in the high court. It is jointly narrated by Mensah Bediako as Vanriel, alongside Amber James and Ashley D Gayle who play a chorus of broad-brush characters, from his mother to his managers. Directed by Anastasia Osei-Kuffour and written by Vanriel along with Dougie Blaxland, it is without doubt an extraordinary rags-to-riches-to-rags-again story but delivered in a production that is too faithfully focused on the chronology of events rather than their dramatic power. At two-and-a-half hours long, it becomes less and less light on its feet. Scenes around Vanriel’s depression and poverty are gut-wrenching but too often the play powers on to the next event without gathering emotional momentum or exploring the themes it raises, from the trauma of Vanriel’s mental health crisis (he is sectioned) to his outspokenness on the class and race disparities between boxers and managers.
James and Gayle bring lots of energy to the stage and sometimes seem to work harder than Bediako to bring the story to life. Narration is interspersed with songs, well sung and infectious (from Otis Redding’s Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay to UB40’s version of Red, Red Wine and Nina Simone’s To Be Young, Gifted and Black). They give the show a big heart but there are too many and they bear more than a touch of the karaoke bar.

2311;2311;Uber’s lobbying activities in France face inquiry after Guardian investigation ;2023-01-20T12:28:08Z;['David Pegg'];['UK news', 'France', 'Uber', 'Technology', 'Emmanuel Macron'];;Uber’s lobbying activities in France and its relationship with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are facing an official inquiry following an investigation led by the Guardian last year. A committee of French MPs will now investigate the ride-hailing company’s relationships with public officials, including with Macron, after journalists revealed extensive lobbying of politicians by the company. The Uber files project, which was published by the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), revealed that the company identified Macron as a key ally during his time as economy minister. Macron sought to assist Uber, at one point claiming that he had brokered a “deal” with its political opponents, the files indicated. The documents were provided to the Guardian by Mark MacGann, formerly Uber’s chief European lobbyist, who said he had come to believe the company was exploiting its drivers. In its response to the investigation, Uber admitted mistakes and said its new CEO had overhauled the company’s practices. Danielle Simonnet, the French MP who brought the motion calling for the inquiry, said that in addition to the economic consequences of the gig economy, the commission would examine the “role of public officials” and “relationships between public and private decision-makers”. The phrasing appears to be a euphemistic reference to Uber’s relationship with Macron. A previous motion by Simmonet was rejected last year on the grounds that it explicitly referred to the French president. The French inquiry is the second parliamentary investigation into Uber’s political relationships to commence launched as a result of the files. A two-month Belgian commission of inquiry into the Uber files was scheduled to begin on Thursday. Separately, on Wednesday the Uber files were debated at a session of the European parliament in Strasbourg. Several MEPs expressed concerns about last year’s reports, as well as ongoing lobbying of European parliamentarians by private interests generally. Others were severely critical of Uber’s business model and accused the company of exploiting drivers. “Workers can have flexibility while being employed,” said Kim van Sparrentak, a Dutch Green MEP. “People with difficulty finding work deserve a real job, with rights and fair wages, rather than a gig work app that follows their every step.” Agnes Jongerius, of the Dutch Labour party, said lobbying of MEPs had become even more intensive since the Uber files investigation and called on the parliament to “look at the influence exerted by large technology companies as well”. “If we don’t do this once and for all now, this [gig economy] model could be like an oil slick on the whole economy,” she said. Uber denies exploiting drivers. In response to the Uber files investigation it said the company had “moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration, demonstrating a willingness to come to the table and find common ground with former opponents, including labour unions and taxi companies”. The company said Uber was “now regulated in more than 10,000 cities around the world, working at all levels of government to improve the lives of those using our platform and the cities we serve”. Speaking on behalf of the European Commission, Ylva Johansson told the Strasbourg debate that the commission “attached great importance to the role of whistleblowers for the good functioning of our democracy and economy”. She added that the commission had sought further information from the former digital commissioner Neelie Kroes after the files suggested she had secretly helped Uber to lobby the Dutch government, and that the European anti-fraud office (OLAF) was currently examining the matter.;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/20/uber-lobbying-activities-in-france-face-inquiry-after-guardian-investigation;guardian;science & technology;2311

Indeed, a study issued this month found that more than a third of consumers have given up fitness memberships for money reasons. Generation Z and millennials were hardest hit, with half of 25- to 34-year-olds cancelling memberships, rising to 56% for 18- to 24-year-olds, according to the poll by the workspace firm IWG. But the appetite for getting fit and participating in activities is still there: in December, sports and outdoor retailers had their strongest month since last March, with sales of gear and equipment up 3.5%, according to Barclays data published this week. The Barclays report says almost a third of those seeking cost-effective ways to start new resolutions are looking to take up “free” forms of exercise, such as running or following YouTube workouts. Here, we look at how to get fit at no or low cost. Look to your council Councils offer people low-cost access to sports clubs and facilities. A lot of what’s available is not means-tested. Some of these services will be free, or have a minimal charge. For example, Southwark council in London allows residents to sign up for a free swim pass that can be used at many leisure centres in the borough on Fridays and at weekends. Sign-up is usually required before attending, as new members will have to provide proof of address. Certain groups will also be entitled to additional classes and clubs. For instance, in Northern Ireland, Mid Ulster’s “active lifestyle programme” is running £1 classes, including yoga, water aerobics and strength and balance. Some sessions are open to everyone but they primarily focus on children and young people with disabilities, new mothers and older people. Welsh councils, including Conwy, Swansea and Wrexham, have a 60+ active leisure scheme providing cheap access to local facilities for the over-60s. This includes a free initial period. Seek out initiatives If you are set on taking up a specific sport, it is worth searching for initiatives funded by Sport England, Sportscotland, Sport Wales and Sport Northern Ireland. Tennis clubs are particularly keen on helping new members into the sport. Tennis For Free offers sessions nationwide with all equipment provided (in most cases, classes will be starting up again in the spring). Clubs are also worth approaching directly. Meanwhile, Skate Nottingham runs free weekly skateboarding classes for those aged seven to 14.
Some commercial brands also run free sessions. Sweaty Betty offers classes in-store, including yoga, barre and Hiit (high-intensity interval training), although you will need to sign up for a free Sweaty Betty membership. Locations include Islington, Brighton, York and Bluewater in Kent. Brave the outdoors Wrap up warm and head to your local green space for some free, or low-cost, exercise. Keep an eye out for public table tennis setups and outdoor gyms, as well as basketball and tennis courts. These are often free to use, although with some there may be a small fee, usually via the council’s website. You will typically have to take your own equipment.
If you are bold enough to give open water swimming a go, you could save a fortune in swim passes all year. Swimming on the coast, or in swimming ponds, is largely free, although some of the famous ponds, such as Hampstead in north London, charge a small fee (£4.25 or £2.55 for concessions in the case of Hampstead). Outdoor swimming groups and free information can be found at the Outdoor Swimming Society. “Swimming is so cheap,” confirms Kate Rew, the society’s founder. “You don’t need any gear – it’s perfectly acceptable to jump in wearing a T-shirt and pants. You can move on to more gear – but none of it is necessary.” The not-for-profit sports organisation Our Parks is also offering free classes at various parks around the country. Sessions include yoga, dance, pilates and fitness. However, if you are not able to get to the park, they also have a variety of live online sessions.
Another option is parkrun, which hosts a free weekly 5km run on Saturday mornings at lots of UK parks. There’s also a 2km junior parkrun for children aged four to 14 on Sunday mornings. For those wanting to go at a slower pace, the Ramblers has hundreds of free walking routes across the country, and also hosts free Wellbeing Walks. Go virtual Virtual classes via apps, YouTube and fitness platforms are probably the most cost-efficient option, depending on how much space and self-motivation you have. The free NHS Couch to 5K running podcast is a popular option. NHS Fitness Studio also has free exercise videos for pilates and yoga, strength and resistance, and aerobics.
YouTube has a plethora of free-access sports coaching videos and exercise sessions to get involved in, regardless of whether you are hoping to take up boxercise, Hiit or Zumba. The Better at Home app also provides 600 virtual free exercise classes. Take up gym trials There is often increased interest in gyms in January, and, consequently, gyms often offer free trials at the start of the year. Use this time to think about whether you really will commit to regularly doing weight training and cardio, or attending classes. Some gyms also offer a free personal training session. If you can’t see a free trial advertised, contact the team and ask if you can try before buying. If that fails, ask friends if they have a referral, or a free pass to a nearby gym. If you do pursue a membership, check the contract carefully to ensure you are not locked into an unaffordable long-term commitment. Remember that local leisure centres will often be cheaper, although they may have fewer facilities. Meanwhile, if you have a health condition, you may be entitled to a free pass. For instance, Everyone Active offers a free gym pass to anyone with Parkinson’s. Get the gear Avoid investing in expensive gear if you feel that your commitment to a new fitness regime could waver. In the short-term, ask friends and family if they have old equipment, such as footballs, weights and badminton rackets, that you could borrow. The chances are someone you know invested in some, motivated by new year goals, and never used them again. The ball manufacturer Alive and Kicking has scores of “football libraries” across the country that enable locals to borrow footballs for free. Sites such as eBay, Vinted and Preloved Sports offer secondhand sportswear and equipment. In many cases the items will have never been worn.
However, be cautious about buying certain items. For instance, it may be dangerous to buy a secondhand horse-riding helmet or other protective gear. If you are in Scotland, your child could be entitled to sports gear via the nationwide Kit for All scheme. In Aberdeen, for example, you can apply for sportswear via Aberdeen city schools. For those after bigger purchases, such as a bike or an e-bike, there may be payment schemes to help. The nationwide salary sacrifice scheme Bike2Work saves on tax by enabling you to pay via your employer. There’s a calculator on its website to work out how much you could save. Certain people may also be entitled to an equipment grant.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/21/gym-fees-get-fit-no-cost-free-parkruns-youtube-videos-apps;guardian;health;2166

The accident happened about 3pm on Saturday at Montgomery Regional Airport after American Airlines Flight 3408 had arrived from Dallas.

The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the ground crew worker was ""ingested into the engine"" of an aircraft while it was parked at the gate, CBS News reported.

The worker - who was an employee of Piedmont Airlines, a regional subsidiary of American Airlines - has not yet been named.

The Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB are investigating the incident.

An American Airlines spokesperson said: ""We are devastated by the accident involving a team member of Piedmont Airlines, an American Airlines regional carrier, at Montgomery Regional Airport.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and our local team members.

""We are focused on ensuring that all involved have the support they need during this difficult time.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230102130240/http://news.sky.com/story/airport-worker-dies-after-being-ingested-into-plane-engine-in-alabama-12778307;skynews;entertainment & culture;218
4644;4644;"The week in TV: Happy Valley; Stonehouse; The Rig; Ukraine: The People’s Fight";2023-01-08T09:30:44Z;['Barbara Ellen'];['Drama', 'Documentary', 'Factual TV', 'Sarah Lancashire', 'Matthew Macfadyen', 'Keeley Hawes', 'Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];;"Happy Valley (BBC One) | iPlayer Stonehouse (ITV) | ITVX The Rig (Prime Video) Ukraine: The People’s Fight (BBC Two) | iPlayer And, lo, nearly seven years on, Catherine Cawood returns for the third and final series of Sally Wainwright’s West Yorkshire magnum opus Happy Valley (BBC One). As played by Sarah Lancashire, Cawood is equal parts West Yorkshire police sergeant, grieving matriarch, avenging angel and grimly humorous revenge for every small-screen female character that’s ever been badly or underwritten. In the spirit of “limbering up”, I’d rewatched the first two series: were they really that good? (Yes.) Had we all overreacted? (No.) This one opens with Cawood stamping through the glutinous, chocolate-hued mud of a drained reservoir to identify a dissected, rotted corpse by its teeth, thus shutting up smirking detective colleagues. “Twats!” she barks, almost affectionately, as she marches away. Six months on, it’s the 16th birthday of Cawood’s fawn-eyed grandson Ryan (still well played by Rhys Connah). They’re surrounded by family and “family”, including Cawood’s nervy former addict sister, Clare, who is so flawlessly characterised by Siobhan Finneran that you want to enfold her in a permanent bear hug. Even as Cawood plans her imminent retirement (a driving holiday in the Himalayas; get her!), trouble is spitting up from the mudflats. Gangsters. Prescription drugs. A pharmacist (Amit Shah) on the make and out of his depth. A PE teacher/coercive abuser (Mark Stanley) with a diazepam-addicted wife who has fingerprint bruises on her arms. And Cawood’s nemesis, Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), now in a Sheffield prison, with fresh forehead scars and greasy, dangling “cult leader” hair (a bargain bin Charles Manson). Turns out that the man who nearly kicked her to death, and is her dead daughter’s rapist and Ryan’s probable father, is connected to the reservoir corpse. Oh, and someone is secretly taking Ryan to visit him too. So that was the singular opening episode of six (no full series straight to streaming malarkey here). Once again, there’s a clean, pithy script (“God, you’re hard work”), all-round naturalistic performances, strong themes (family, community, humour, grief, betrayal), and the promise of another full-throated, Old Testament-style battle between good and evil, with the whole topped by that watershed lead performance. As Cawood, Lancashire isn’t just a police officer, or even a woman – she’s the embodiment of strong, chin-out, boots-first femininity itself. It doesn’t matter how old you are: we’d all like to be “more Catherine” when we grow up. There may come a time when our current crop of dysfunctional politicos start to seem cuddly and amusing. (May I be so bold as to pitch Ministers Behaving Badly, styled around Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, with Nadine Dorries sighing indulgently at their jolly scrapes.) Until then, for those who enjoyed Hugh Grant’s rascally Jeremy Thorpe in A Very English Scandal, there’s the three-part miniseries Stonehouse, all on ITVX. Written by John Preston (who wrote the book on which A Very English Scandal was based), it stars Matthew Macfadyen as John Stonehouse, the Labour politician and real-life Reggie Perrin who in 1974 faked his own death, leaving his clothes on Miami Beach.
In a tale played for aghast giggles, Macfadyen portrays Stonehouse as a male casualty of his time: purring with unearned self-belief and entitlement, with Jerry Leadbetter hair, a honking laugh and (presumably) a soul made of crimplene. Macfadyen’s real-life wife, Keeley Hawes, plays Stonehouse’s spouse, Barbara, as an adoring, unquestioning trolley hostess of a woman, until she finds her bite. The sense of absurdity mounts as Stonehouse becomes an incompetent paid spy for the Czechs, has an affair with his secretary (Emer Heatley), and makes trouble for prime minister Harold Wilson (Kevin McNally). After his faked death, Stonehouse is apprehended by Australian police, who think he’s Lord Lucan. There’s a winning, Pink Panther-esque lightness to this relentless farce, but it didn’t engage me as much as the Thorpe drama. Despite sterling efforts to infuse Stonehouse with bumbling sweetness, he still registers as a shabby chancer; a high-placed grifter who gets caught – and we’ve all had our fill of that. Don’t mistake Prime Video’s six-parter The Rig for a straightforward thriller. Created by David Macpherson, it’s an eco-horror disaster movie – fossil fuel Armageddon! – set on a Scottish oil rig. The Kinloch Bravo itself – rough, rusting, all rattling walkways and claustrophobic warrens – could be a metaphor for the state of the planet. The crew, including Iain Glen, Martin Compston, Rochenda Sandall, Mark Bonnar and Calvin Demba, are embattled and confused as (spoiler alert) they find themselves engulfed in billowing clouds of ash, containing a parasite that kills some people while accelerating healing in others.
By episode three I thought: what madness is this? With the isolation and the threat, there are times when The Rig plays as a seabound Alien. Other times, the eco/oil theme, while worthy (see also State of Happiness and the latest series of Borgen), skews the script, with clunky asides about sustainable fishing, the Earth’s crust and an extinction event (“The great dying”). For all that, like that other macabre watery tale The Terror, The Rig knows how to build a suffocating atmosphere (sweeping cameras; a background pounding like a heartbeat) and remembers to be exciting: smogs; fireballs; Glen doing his growly “Don’t mess with me, I’m an alpha” thing. I’m minded to stay the course. Documentarian Olly Lambert won a Bafta for 2013’s Syria: Across the Lines. To make Ukraine: The People’s Fight (BBC Two), he spent two months embedded with Ukraine volunteer special forces near the frontline as they fought to recover the crucial port city of Kherson. Lambert’s film shows the debilitating reality of a fighting force running on limited ammunition and ever blurring military-civilian lines. A derelict factory stands in for a war room. Troops live rough in ditches for weeks. An architect, an MP and a rug salesman are among the fighters. Thus, Hummer, a seasoned unit commander, must deal with rookie troops who aren’t used to obeying orders. Resentments surge, tempers fray – but still they manage to pull together, while tiny kittens gambol among the soldiers: poignant symbols of innocence and domesticity amid rolling chaos. This is a candid documentary about ordinary people stumbling through a war zone, whose heroism is no less valuable because it has been forced upon them.

472;472;‘We’re on permanent catch-up’: how Covid has changed young Britons’ lives;2023-01-29T19:00:03Z;['Amelia Hill'];['Young people', 'Students', 'Secondary schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Mental health', 'Long Covid', 'Education', 'Higher education', 'Schools', 'Society', 'UK news'];;"In the next phase of the Guardian’s Covid Generation series, young people from across the UK continue to analyse how the pandemic is still affecting their lives and their plans for the future, 18 months after the end of the third national lockdown. Marcel Charowski, 13 Marcel Charowski lives in London with his parents and sister. He struggled to return to school after the Christmas holidays but has recently gone back with an adjusted schedule
Covid affected me because after spending all that time on my own, I have become very distant to my social life and friends, and forgotten, really, how to make friends or be with children my own age. It was OK when I first went back to school but in recent months I have stopped wanting to interact with people. I have realised that, after the peace of lockdown, I have built a barrier in my mind: I don’t even want to step on school grounds because the noise is too much and I feel people have changed – they seem cruel and dishonest. Recently, my parents and school suspected that I have a spectrum autism. I think the problems I’ve had since my return to school have helped us realise this: I always did not like the noise of school, but going back after staying peacefully at home for so long has been so bad for me that I feel I can’t stay there. I don’t think that’s unreasonable. After giving up so much for lockdown then trying my hardest – but failing – to go back to school, I also have this thought that I should be getting what I want now with no compromise. I’ve tried school again but I realise that being at home is really good for my mental health, so I would like to stay here and not go back any more. Also, in the time since lockdown ended, I’ve looked back at my time isolated at home and realised that I really enjoyed getting closer to nature. I want to take that further now, and move away from the city environment entirely. The other thing that I’ve realised even more strongly since lockdown ended is that family comes, but that it goes too. During lockdown I thought the urgency of that truth would end when lockdown ended. But people are still dying, from Covid and from other diseases. I’ve realised that I need to acknowledge who is there and connect with them. I’ve realised I want to be closer to my loving family and my old grandad in Poland. I really miss him. Eva Yacobi, 14 Eva Yacobi lives in the south of England and is taking her GCSEs next year
When lockdown hit, I was a little girl who had never gone anywhere alone. By the time lockdown finished, I was a teenager and my parents were really keen to give me a lot of freedom straight away. Because I didn’t have the gradual exposure to independence I would have had in normal times, being out alone or with friends still feels – a year and a half later – both amazing and scary: there are so many things to do that we’re still overwhelmed by the choice. Lockdown ended ages ago but I’m definitely still grabbing everything life has to offer me with a sense of urgency. Not only have I got so much to catch up on but I’ve got in the back of my mind that it could all be taken away from me again. Covid is still causing me problems at school: the online lessons I did during lockdown don’t seem to have stuck in my brain. In science, for example, the teachers keep talking about stuff that I have no idea about. They say we did it in year 8 but I have no memory of it. Catching up means a lot of extra work, and being constantly told that I should already know all this stuff isn’t great for my self-esteem. I also worry that lockdown has affected my memory span in two ways: during lockdown, I got into the habit of binge-watching TV, TikTok, YouTube etc. I also got into the habit of doing two things at once: fiddling with my phone while watching TV or during online lessons. Both habits seem to have stuck. I can still watch stuff online for hours each day, and I find that even now I’m back in a real classroom, I can’t listen to my teachers for very long before I get distracted or just zone out. On the positive side, a lockdown lesson that has stuck with me is that things that look difficult – like starting my lockdown, online jewellery-making business – actually aren’t that hard if you get into it. I was thinking the other day about what I wanted to do in life and realised that I can try for one career but if it doesn’t work out, there are always other options, other opportunities. Zubaydah Abdi, 20 Zubaydah Abdi lives in Tottenham with her parents – a cab driver and a special needs teacher – and her five siblings. She is in her first year of a medicine degree at King’s College London
The impact of lockdown has been a slow boil for me. I thought I knew how it had affected me but I’ve very recently realised that my brain has been churning my experiences in the background, because I’ve only just surfaced the realisation that I’m still not being true to myself: that my self-worth is still entirely tied to my academic success and I see every experience I have as only being worthwhile if it has some sort of academic validation. I’ve also only very recently realised that I was probably quite depressed during the lockdown year. As a consequence, I recently decided to consciously widen my horizons: make new friends, maybe take up a hobby and be kinder, to myself and to others. Covid has changed me a lot. When I was 10, I wrote a 15-year plan for my life. Going into Covid, I’d never deviated from that plan. But looking back now, 18 months after lockdown ended, I’m beginning to wonder if being so focused was such a good idea. The question of whether I’m wasting my time has become a constant anxiety to me. I’ve realised how finite time is and I’ve thought about all the time I’ve spent revising. I used to literally spend 8-10 hours a day in the library. Very recently, I’ve begun thinking: “Is this really how I want to spend the life I’ve been gifted with?” I still do want to be a doctor but I also want to put as much experience as I can into my life and live as much as I possibly can. Another thing I’ve recently accepted is that after the peace of lockdown, life is often just too fast-paced for me nowadays. Covid gave me the time to focus and think deeply for the first time, and now I’m beginning to think that I need to slow my life down again so I can really think deeply about the new choices I’m making and where life’s momentum is taking me. I feel I’m at at quite an exciting moment, actually; like I’m on the brink of finding an answer to how I want to live my life. But then I worry I won’t practically apply any realisation I come to, to my life. I worry I’m one of those people who doesn’t change the course of their lives, no matter what wisdom they pick up along the way. I wonder if I’m like Sisyphus, rolling a rock up a mountain only to have it roll back down again. Then again, if that is really who I am, I need to find joy in the effort I make rolling that boulder to the top of the mountain every single day of my life. I need to incorporate all of this into my life. Lily Smith, 19 Lily Smith comes from Manchester and is in her final year of a musical theatre degree at Anglia Ruskin University
I still have the fear that life can be put on hold at the drop of a hat. It’s stressful, thinking that all this hard work I’m putting into my degree could be thrown out of the window. It’s also kind of demeaning because it shows how small and insignificant I am in this world; my life could be closed down and I’d have no control over that. That powerlessness feeds through to many other feelings. My mental health has definitely been affected by the lingering effects of lockdown. I’d say that what I’m feeling is almost like PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. Most people might have moved on but Covid isn’t over for everyone. I’ve not yet seen my grandmother in her new care home because they still have limited visiting times because of Covid. I feel guilty about that but then again, should I even be visiting if there’s a risk I’ll infect her? If the home is still so worried, maybe I should just stay away. But for how long? When do I get a chance to see her again? I used to take an active interest in politics but since Covid, I’ve had enough of politicians, experts and authority. I just do what’s best for me. I think a lot of other young people are doing that as well, because we sacrificed so much and we got nothing back to make up for what we lost. They’ve shown no compassion for us. I’ve become more aware of the importance of compassion though. I want to be nice to everyone, essentially because you never know what’s going to happen to them. They could get Covid tomorrow and be very ill. Looking back at lockdown, it’s made me think that when I’m the older generation, I want to support young people as much I can. I don’t want any other generation to feel like mine does: looked down on for sacrificing everything to essentially try to solve other people’s problems. Eoin O’Loughlin, 21 Eoin O’Loughlin moved from Dublin to Dundee during the pandemic. He is now in his second year at the Scottish School for Contemporary Dance
Most of my generation have been affected in deep, developmental ways by Covid and that’s going to affect us forever in unpredictable ways. Taking dance as a metaphor, I missed my first year of training, so my body simply isn’t strong enough to do what it should be able to do and I’ll never catch up – I can’t magic up a year’s worth of muscle. This means I’ll leave uni never having achieved the creative and physical strength that graduates did before me. I’m sure it’s the same for academic students; if you lose a year of your course, you can’t necessarily catch up. Work experience, internships, a year studying abroad – some academic experiences have to be had at a specific time, otherwise you’re left less equipped forever as a result. It’s scary. It’s the same emotionally. My generation missed milestones that were vital to our development. We can’t go back, those experiences are gone – and so is our chance of learning from them. My generation has had no social respite. We grew up amid the financial crisis, recession and austerity – and then Covid hit. Now we’re having to work non-stop to afford a basic level of living because of the cost of living crisis. I’m too young to be this exhausted, this burnt out. I should be bursting with energy. I can’t afford to be burnt out; life is too expensive. Basically, my generation will never know what it’s like to be hedonistic. As a result, I think we’ve got quite a sombre, jaded outlook. And “jaded” isn’t a word you should use for 20-year-olds. One thing that my generation does have, though, is a clearer perspective to rebel against. To put it baldly, we’re frankly not prepared to take shit any more. But while I say we’ll be revolutionary, I think the aim of our revolution will be pretty modest: simply to make life tolerable for everyone. Simply for us all to have decent living standards. Michael Nesi-Pio, 21 Michael Nesi-Pio was in his final year of A-levels when Covid hit and has retaken his first year of university three times
Covid happened such a long time ago but it continues to affect everyone my age. It’s shaped us in fundamental ways. I’d planned to take a year out before uni to work out what I wanted to do but because of Covid, I panicked and grabbed the first course I could. That turned out to be a bad mistake and so I moved to a new university. But because I was still in a state of panic, I made another mistake. I’ve now changed again: same university, different course. I’ve finally got it right this time but I’ve racked up debts I don’t even want to think about and wasted two years. I should be in my final year of uni right now, not my first. But you know what? It’s OK. And I know it is because Covid taught me that it’s OK to stop and restart – to take a step back and see the bigger picture – that being strong is about being flexible. I think I’ve been fortunate that Covid has taught me that lesson: it’s helped me chill out and value my happiness when planning my life. Covid has reshuffled everything. The conventional structure of authority has disappeared for me and my peers. Mistakes were made at all levels of authority – not just the government but exam boards, universities, employers, police and so on. My peers have become quite disillusioned with the idea of authority as a result. There’s even contempt there. We’ve realised there’s not this black and white picture – there’s a discourse to be had about the “why” of every rule. That’s given my generation a confidence in ourselves that was lacking before Covid, when we didn’t really reflect on our own wishes and fell in with the decisions that were being made for us. I’m amazed at the stuff I’ve just accepted in the past. I take everything apart now and think about it. Because we feel there are no immutable rules any more, my generation is 100% more entrepreneurial than we would have been had Covid not happened. We want to make stuff happen for ourselves. Individualism is a massive thing for us. It’s not the Thatcher sort of individualism: it’s about finding out what makes you unique and special, and through that, being accepting of others being themselves too. Once we understand ourselves and accept others, we can create our own job roles and then fit them together in genuinely collaborative teams where people work harmoniously and to their full potential. Kate Nichols, 20 Kate Nichols, from Newcastle upon Tyne, is in her final year at Cardiff University and still has long Covid, which she developed in December 2021
My long Covid is still casting a long shadow over my life. I’ve finally got an appointment at the chronic fatigue clinic later this month – after waiting almost a year – but I’m not massively optimistic they’ll be able to help. I’ve done loads of research and I think that even though my symptoms are still pretty dreadful, I’m already doing everything possible in terms of restricting my lifestyle – to the point where I pretty much don’t have any fun at all. I’m in exam season at the minute and even though I’m so incredibly careful about my health, I’m terrified that I’m going to fall ill yet again. I know from bitter experience that if I stay up later than midnight, for example, or if I drink any alcohol at all, I’ll have to write off at least half the next day to total exhaustion and probably get tonsillitis and a chest infection too. It’s not a normal life. I go to pilates classes and see people twice my age with more energy and better fitness than me. It’s upsetting to have to be so restrained, disciplined and to have such low energy levels at an age where I should be carefree. Covid probably feels a long time ago to older people but for my generation, I feel we’ve probably been permanently disadvantaged by it. I missed out on my entire first year of learning thanks to lockdown, which means I didn’t learn the basics of my course as well as I would have done, or get any work experience or internships. When everything opened up again in our second year, I was flat out with long Covid. I could barely manage my university work, much less do anything extra. I should have spent part of my second year studying abroad but couldn’t. That broke my heart – and robbed me of even more experiences and opportunities that I can never get back. I do panic and put a lot of pressure on myself to make up for those two lost years. My brain is constantly churning over what I could do to become successful in life. I sometimes feel it’s my fault. I even blame myself for getting long Covid. But even if it’s not my fault, it’s still up to me to pick up the pieces. One big difference between before and after Covid for me is that I 100% do not trust the government. They were just terrible towards us students during Covid. They either acted like we didn’t exist or they criticised and blamed us for how we were supposedly behaving, even though they didn’t even follow the rules themselves. I definitely feel the politicians took advantage of my generation. They used us as scapegoats. I feel betrayed by them. Eliza Niblett, 21 Eliza Niblett is from Leicestershire and is coming to the end of her three-year degree in experimental psychology at the University of Oxford
When Covid hit, I was devastated because I’d been looking forward to my first experience of freedom at university: to be out as a lesbian, to have my first kiss, go to my first nightclub, go on a pub crawl. I’d worked so hard to get into uni that I wanted to experience all the things I’d missed. But when lockdown ended and it was all theoretically available to me again, my degree had kicked in and I didn’t have the time. It seems there are sometimes specific slivers of life when certain experiences are available – and if you miss that sliver of time, that’s an experience you’ll never have. That’s what’s happened to me for all the fun, young stuff I’ll now never do. As a result, I don’t feel I really know who I am or what I’m fully capable of. The more serious impact of Covid is that it’s given me acute macular neuroretinopathy in one eye. It basically means I have blind spots. The original spot developed when I had Covid in April – then in October, two more appeared out of nowhere. It’s incredibly rare and no one really understands why it happens. There’s no treatment and they have no idea if I’ll get any more. It’s really stressful: if it starts happening in my other eye, or I develop more spots closer to my central vision, I might start having serious functional problems. Covid made it crystal clear that the Conservative government don’t care about young people. As a reaction, I think some of my generation are going to be more community-minded because of Covid, but others will be more selfish because of what they had to give up – they now think the world owes them something. The further away Covid slips into the past, the harder it gets to articulate how it’s still affecting us. But Covid totally disrupted my generation’s transition to adulthood. Our lives got stuck at the point where we were supposed to be becoming independent. It was such a key developmental stage of our lives, both academically and socially, and I’m very interested to see how it continues to affect us as we age. I think my generation will still be processing the impact it’s had on us 10 years down the line. I don’t think it’s possible to understand it fully yet.

Covid is still changing me. During lockdown, I became aware that I might be autistic. I’m certainly neurodiverse. Since lockdown ended, I’ve put a lot of thought into what my limits are and how I need to work within them across my career and life. For example, my dream to work in mainstream teaching would chip away at me so I’ve turned towards quieter teaching jobs, like museum education; I’m currently doing a placement in the British Schools Museum in Hitchin. Thanks to Covid, politics are no longer theoretical for me; the issues are very real. So many people made a profit at others’ expense during Covid, and social justice went by the way-side. I don’t know how this will affect my future but it’s become a central part of myself that I feel powerfully about. I realised in lockdown that my life was very small and that I didn’t want it to be that way. Another good thing about lockdown is that I’ve managed to hold on to [life’s] simplicity. I feel like I’ve gone back to the joy of being a child – taking walks, enjoying the sun on my face – but in a mature way. Those layers that peeled off during lockdown haven’t built back up. I’ve also allowed myself to feel pain and sadness about things in my life, like living without my dad, and allowed that to be part of me. I’ve learnt that pain can be a good thing because it proves that you love something. Before, I was always trying to be happy and just make everything good, but now I realise that pain is part of being alive. So I can feel happy – but I feel pain as well. These feelings have taken a long time to unfold. These feelings didn’t start straight away. I consciously help myself go back to lockdown and what I learnt during it by sometimes re-imagining the world as rubble after Covid and imagining that I’d been razed too, and have to be rebuilt. Jess Paine, 23 Jess Paine works with refugees in Nottingham
Covid changed the whole context of my life. I discovered religion during lockdown and realised that I wanted to work in the charity sector. I went to Greece for six weeks last autumn and volunteered with refugees. I’m about to go back again for three months and in the meantime, am volunteering with a local charity. Had I not found faith during lockdown I wouldn’t have the heart for this sort of work. I wouldn’t have become politically active. But Covid was a paradigm shift for me because of the space it gave me to open up all these different avenues of thought and space. We were all courageous in our own way during Covid. We all needed different sorts of courage to get through it. We’ve taken that courage into the post-Covid world and in my generation, that’s taken the post-Covid form of a massive call to arms. The aftershocks of Covid have united my generation in ongoing political engagement. The government has continued to lose so much power, respect, trust and faith as all their mistakes, errors and lies keep trickling out. Covid was a leveller because we all had to find our way through it and that made us more aware and open to discussion. I think that’s meant we’re all a lot more engaged with the world – it feels like a prerequisite for my generation that we have to know what’s going on in the world and to have an informed opinion on it. We’re a lot more hungry for wisdom and information as a result. I feel that my generation is still emerging from a collective identity crisis. We were so young when Covid hit that we didn’t have clear identities. When all our routines were taken away, we were left to explore who we were in a vacuum, and [think about] what we were supposed to be doing in a world where suddenly there was no clear right and wrong, where there had been certainty before. But I also think my generation is exhausted. Just trying to gather ourselves together is exhausting. Picking up the pieces in this economic and social climate is exhausting.

1107;1107;In the clamour and confusion around the Indigenous voice, the media has a special responsibility | Lenore Taylor;2023-01-26T14:00:23Z;['Lenore Taylor'];['Indigenous voice to parliament', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Indigenous recognition', 'Lidia Thorpe'];;"For years Australians have acknowledged the obviously inappropriate date of our national day, but enjoyed the late summer day off anyway. The Invasion Day rallies have grown over time, the Triple J Hottest 100 has shifted, corporations and councils have changed policies and practices, but the unanswered question at the heart of our national identity was never going to be addressed only by “changing the date”. The protesters on the first Day of Mourning back in 1938 knew that, as Wesley Enoch discussed with Laura Murphy-Oates in this episode of Full Story. But this 26 January came around just as Australia began to finally, belatedly, have that foundational conversation, and it has started with more confusion than calm.
The Albanese government, poised to announce details of the referendum on constitutional recognition and the Indigenous voice to parliament that the prime minister promised with such passion at Garma last year, used the day to frame the referendum as an opportunity for the nation to seize a unifying and historic moment. But Indigenous opponents of the voice sought to use the traditional Invasion Day rallies as a de facto launch of a no campaign, arguing that justice can only be achieved via a treaty. It was deeply confusing for many accustomed to attending the gatherings with a unity of purpose, and infuriating for those who felt the events had been co-opted. Marcus Stewart, a member of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, said the rallies had been “sabotaged” and he felt unable to attend.
This is a complex discussion, weighted by being 235 years overdue. It demands, but all too often lacks, perspective and nuance. Opposing voices are coming from both the far left and the right. For many voters, reaching a considered decision will require far more backstory and context than can fit neatly into a “he said/she said” version of the news. The television grabs show the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, demanding “detail”, suggesting the prime minister hadn’t “decided on it” yet and implying Labor was hiding something. But as the Indigenous leader Noel Pearson pointed out on ABC Radio National breakfast this week, the actual details will be decided by the parliament, including by Dutton and his colleagues. Australians are not being asked to vote on a specific model, but on an “in principle” constitutional question. Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, described the clamour for early detail as being “designed to sow doubt and confusion”. Pearson described it as a “spoiling game”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And as Prof Megan Davis explained to Guardian Australia recently, the design principles are already clear, including that the voice was intended to give Indigenous Australians a say in matters affecting them, that it would not be responsible for program delivery, would not have a veto power, would be chosen by First Nations people and would be representative, accountable and transparent. The National party says it is opposed because the voice won’t “close the gap”, setting up the false dilemma that constitutional recognition and “better services on the ground” are somehow an either-or proposition, with the crime wave in Alice Springs providing a useful hook for the argument. It’s impossible to prove the counterfactual put by the Indigenous affairs minister, Linda Burney, this week, that an Indigenous voice might have prevented the situation in Alice from escalating into a crisis, but do the critics really contend that having clear advice from the community would not have helped the situation, or that Indigenous communities have to somehow choose between being heard and being helped?
And the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has hardened her opposition to the voice on the basis that it would amount to “ceding sovereignty”, amounting to setting up “an advisory body to the colonial system”. The assertion regarding sovereignty does not withstand scrutiny, as Canberra reporter Paul Karp explains. As the debate kicks off, polls still show a majority in favour of the voice, but support softening, and many respondents, unsurprisingly, not sure they grasp the detail. This is a discussion where different views need to be heard, not just from politicians and pundits but in particular from the Indigenous communities who have the most at stake. In this discussion the media has a particular responsibility to help readers understand the facts and the historical, political and legal context, to call out falsehoods and to avoid fuelling an ideological outrage cycle. It’s just too important for that. Every Australian needs to engage with the details over the next six months, and it’s our job to help them.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/26/in-the-clamour-and-confusion-around-the-indigenous-voice-the-media-has-a-special-responsibility;guardian;politics;1107
624;624;Make new friends with old-vine wines;2023-01-29T06:00:41Z;['David Williams'];['Food', 'Life and style'];;"Alain Grignon Carignan Vieilles Vignes, IGP Pays de l’Herault, France 2021 (£8.99, or £6.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) Old vines have become something of a cause célèbre in the wine business in recent years. In part, it’s a conservation issue: older plants, some of which are about 100 years old or more, represent an important part of wine’s heritage. They’re also more efficient when it comes to water, or rather, its absence (increasingly useful as the climate crisis brings more frequent and severe droughts to many parts of the wine world). Happily, in many cases there’s a quality angle, too: more often than not, old vines deliver more concentrated but better-balanced fruit than younger vines, albeit in much smaller quantities. What’s more, rather curiously, age seems to have a positive effect on even the most unfashionable grape varieties. Old-vine versions of carignan, for example, such as the vividly blackberry juicy version from Alain Grignon, show a completely different side to this often-derided Mediterranean red grape. Viña Bisquertt Crazy Rows Carignan, Maule Valley, Chile 2020 (£7.90, revl.co.uk) Carignan was the most widely planted grape variety in France up until the end of the 20th century, although its popularity in the Midi had more to do with fecundity (it was capable of enormous yields in the southern sun) than quality (high-yielding young vines tended to bring wines with fearsome tannins and acidity and very little in the way of fruit flavour). Recent years have seen a lot of carignan uprooted in the Languedoc-Roussillon, while at the same time growers have learned to treasure the oldest vines (in the case of Alain Grignon, that’s 50 to 100 years old). Something very similar has happened in Chile’s Maule Valley, and today old-vine carignan is responsible for some of the country’s most deliciously individualistic wines, such as muscular succulence and squirt of fresh black fruit and liquorice in Viña Bisquertt’s Crazy Rows, the herby-earthy quality and berries of Viña Morande Adventure Vigno Carignan 2019 (£18.79, allaboutwine.co.uk); and the chunky intensity of Torres Vigno Carignan 2016 (£13.99, Waitrose). Cal Batllet 5 Partides, Gratallops, Priorat, Spain 2016 (£59.95, alliancewine.com) Back in the Mediterranean, a trail marked with rewarding old-vine carignan can be traced through the southern fringes of France and across the Pyrenees into Catalonia in northern Spain, starting with the bloody-meaty minerals and dark fruit of Le Clos de Gravillas Lo Vielh Carignan 2019 (£26.50, noblegreenwines.co.uk) and the garrigue-fragrant Domaine Jones Vineyard Collection Carignan Old Vines 2018 (£18.99, farehamwinecellar.co.uk) in Tuchan in the Corbières and working down to the shimmering brambly intensity and sun-baked earthiness of 5 Partides, winemaker Marc Ripoll’s glorious red from southern Catalonia’s Priorat. It’s also a significant player in Sardinia, in rugged, liquorice-filled bottlings such as Sa Raja Carignano del Sulcis 2019 (£14.99, allaboutwine.co.uk). And this late-ripening, sun-loving grape also crops up in some of California’s best Rhône-inspired wines, such as the admirably adventurous Birichino’s dusky, savoury and compellingly slinky Scylla 2019 from Santa Cruz (£23.95, ndjohn.co.uk), where it is blended, as it often is in the Med, with a little grenache and Mourvèdre.

The rules vary across the country, so research your local authority’s rules to find out if you can apply. Some individuals will assume they would never be eligible for a flat or house you rent from a housing association or council, or that even if they are, they may have to sit on a waiting list for years, but as with all these things, there is an element of postcode lottery, so for some, this is definitely an option to explore. https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/28/low-cost-housing-rent-housing-co-ops-homeshares Rents for these homes are typically significantly lower than for private accommodation. Last month, in an opinion piece for the Guardian, Nicholas Fearn told how he and his partner had moved out of his parents’ council house and into a flat owned by a housing association.
“Given that I work part-time and I’m freelance, we assumed we wouldn’t be eligible for social housing,” he wrote. “But deciding we had nothing to lose, we applied to get on the waiting list of one of the local housing associations. To our surprise, we got on it within weeks and began bidding on properties. A few months later, we were offered a two-bedroom flat.” Fearn wrote that while those with the highest needs are prioritised first by law, “others might be eligible, too, depending on availability of housing – and it turned out we qualified”. The charity Shelter says social homes are the only type of housing where rents are linked to local incomes, “making these the most affordable homes in most areas across the country”. It adds: “Councils have lots of flexibility on who qualifies locally.”";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/28/social-housing-council-property-local-authority-housing-association;guardian;business & economy;721
468;468;Dykes scores hat-trick on league debut as London Irish power past Harlequins;2023-01-29T19:26:57Z;['Robert Kitson'];['Premiership', 'London Irish', 'Harlequins', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];;"London Irish already have an impressive roster of exciting young English-qualified talent and another name can now be added to the list. Michael Dykes has plenty of good rugby ahead of him but an alert hat-trick of tries on his Premiership debut ensured he overshadowed even the fit-again Henry Arundell on a highly encouraging day for the Exiles. There are fruit machines that revolve slower than the helter-skelter games in which Irish specialise but here there was also a decent pay-out to enjoy as they bolstered their chances of a top-four finish with a convincing bonus-point victory. If a first-half red card for the Quins captain, Stephan Lewies, significantly shaped the contest, the hosts fully deserved their six-try success.
Along with the energy of the 21-year-old Dykes, who is from Berkshire and has already represented England at age-group level, the sight of Arundell back on a rugby field for the first time since late October was another clear plus for the Exiles in a season which has too often involved narrow defeats and red cards. England, with Henry Slade now out with a hip injury, have recalled Leicester’s Anthony Watson to their Six Nations squad but the Irish head coach, Les Kiss, suggested Arundell would also be ready if and when he is required. “I wouldn’t be afraid to throw him in,” Kiss said. “The boy’s got something special.” Here, too, was a glimpse of what might yet be possible this season for Irish, who have now won four of their past five Premiership games. If a nasty-looking shoulder injury for the unlucky Adam Coleman was a blow, the obvious talent of the the Kiwi-reared Chandler Cunningham-South, still just 19 and part of England’s under-20 squad, Tom Pearson and their Argentinian replacement Juan Martin González bodes well for their play-off prospects. This was the Exiles’ biggest attendance of the season and once the grounds harden up in spring their attacking brand of rugby should be even more watchable. There was also the satisfaction of atoning for their last-gasp defeat against Quins at the end of October with the third-placed Exeter now only three points above them. As well as underlining the competitiveness of this year’s Premiership it also raised further questions about how Quins will fare over the Six Nations period without Marcus Smith and Alex Dombrandt to steer them around the field. “We’re a mid-table side, that’s the brutal reality,” the Quins director of rugby, Tabai Matson, said. Matson also did not dispute the 22nd-minute red card against Lewies, who on the face of it could have no complaints under the laws. His shoulder to the head of a stooping Cunningham-South looked worse with every slow-motion replay and there was no attempt to wrap the arm. Then again, tacklers are not technically supposed to have their heads below waist level, leaving the Quins captain with no real legal target at which to aim. So what was he meant to do? Matson is among those who believe this is the biggest conundrum now facing rugby’s beleaguered guardians. Dykes’s triple whammy, meanwhile, made him only the third player after Gloucester’s Lesley Vainokolo and Northampton’s Courtnal Skosan to score a hat-trick on his Premiership debut. Swift, elusive and with an eye for the line, Dykes had his first try on the board after just seven minutes, courtesy of some slick work inside him, as Quins went 14-0 down quicker than you could say “Not another slow start”. In addition to Cunningham-South’s early score, James Stokes was first to react to a loose ball to register Irish’s third before Dykes, having also served 10 minutes in the sin-bin for failing to intercept a looping ball which also led to a penalty try being awarded, underlined the promise he had shown previously with a hat-trick in a Premiership Cup game against Saracens. Even before Joe Marler departed to the sin-bin, leaving Quins with just 13 players for the final 10 minutes, it was a green day to savour.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report;guardian;sports;468

The ""national right to strike day"" will be held on 1 February with events taking place across the country, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said.

It comes after a bill was introduced to parliament on Monday afternoon that will mean unions representing key workers will have to agree to minimum levels of safety and service when their members go on strike.

If you are an NHS worker and would like to share your experiences with us anonymously, please email NHSstories@sky.uk

The TUC, which represents all unions, called the measures ""draconian"" and vowed to fight them ""every step of the way"".

TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""The right to strike is a fundamental British liberty - but the government is attacking it in broad daylight.

""These draconian new curbs will tilt the balance of power even more in favour of bad bosses and make it harder for people to win better pay and conditions.

""On February the 1st will we hold events across the country against this spiteful new bill - which is unworkable and almost certainly illegal.

""We will call on the general public to show support for workers taking action to defend their pay and conditions, to defend our public services and to protect the fundamental right to strike.""

The protest was agreed following a meeting with union leaders on Monday afternoon.

The bill, if it gets made into law, will mean some trade union members would be required to continue working during a strike - which the TUC says could be in breach of international law.

""Nobody should lose their job if they take lawful action to win a better deal. But ministers have gone from clapping our key workers to threatening them with the sack,"" Mr Nowak said.

""Unions will fights these plans every step of the way - including through parliament and through the courts.""

The legislation puts trade unions and ministers on course for a fresh showdown after months of strikes impacting the public sector.

Steve Barclay, the heath secretary, failed to avert upcoming industrial action in the NHS after talks with union bosses broke down yesterday.

When have industries previously gone on strike and what has it achieved?

Unison said there were no ""tangible concessions"" on pay which would enable Wednesday's ambulance strikes to be called off while The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said ministers ""have a distance to travel"" to avert its second-ever set of strikes on 18 and 19 January.

Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was ""absolutely ludicrous"" and physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks.

The action comes as the NHS buckles under greater pressure than ever, with ministers insisting the laws are required to ensure patient safety.

Tory MP brands strike legislation 'shameful'

Grant Shapps, the business secretary, has claimed ambulance unions placed people's lives at risk when they refused to introduce countrywide minimum levels of service during strikes last month, saying the local-level agreements led to a ""postcode lottery"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:42 Business Secretary Grant Shapps says the anti-strikes bill he will introduce to parliament today will ensure there is no longer a 'postcode lottery' as workers take action.

The Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto already promised a minimum service law for public transport, but the new legislation would extend that requirement to five other areas - the NHS, education, fire and rescue, border security and nuclear decommissioning.

Details of the minimum service levels which will need to be maintained during strikes have yet to be set out.

Downing Street said it was hopeful of passing the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill this year - but the legalisation is expected to face tough opposition.

A Conservative MP and former minister has already broken ranks to condemn the plan. Stevenage MP Stephen McPartland tweeted it was ""shameful, shameful, shameful to target individual workers & order them to walk past their mates on picket line or be sacked"".

Labour has said it would repeal the bill, with deputy leader Angela Rayner telling the Commons the proposal will lead to nurses being sacked and is an ""outright attack on the fundamental freedom of British people"".

The TUC said the legislation ""will succeed only in escalating disputes and driving workers away from wanting to work in our public services"" - as it repeated calls for the government to negotiate a fair pay deal to end the strikes.

Greg Lynn, a former airline pilot, is charged with murdering Russell Hill, 74, and Carol Clay, 73, who went missing in March 2020 while camping in the Wonnangatta Valley, north-east of Melbourne. Lynn, 56, faced the Melbourne magistrates court this week for a committal hearing, which will determine whether there is enough evidence for him to stand trial. At a hearing on Friday, Lynn’s lawyer, Dermot Dann KC, argued for an order which would suppress the contents of all interviews given by Lynn to police. The order was not opposed by the prosecution, but lawyers for multiple media outlets argued against it.
Dann said it was likely the media would view the contents of the interviews as “explosive”, but reporting on their contents could prejudice future proceedings against Lynn. Dann told the court earlier this week that a legal challenge to the admissibility of the police interviews was likely.

However, a 75-year-old hiker who was lost on the same snow-covered mountain has been brought to safety.

NBC LA captured images of Jin Chung, of North Hollywood, being loaded into an ambulance on Tuesday afternoon.

He had hurt his leg and suffered some weather-related injuries but was able to walk with assistance and was taken to hospital, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said.

His condition was not immediately known.

The Sheriff's Department launched the search after Chung didn't return from a hike Sunday on 10,064-foot Mount Baldy.

Chung carpooled to the mountain with two others and made plans to meet them at the vehicle at 2pm, but failed to return.

The sheriff's department said rescuers unsuccessfully continued searching for Sands on Mount Baldy over the weekend.

""Helicopters and drones continued to use infrared devices during the search however, all were negative for any signs of Sands,"" the department's statement added.

Sands, 65, was reported missing on 13 January while hiking.

Search and rescue crews began looking for him on the highest peak in the San Gabriel Mountains, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.

""No evidence of his current location has been discovered. The search will continue, weather and ground conditions permitting,"" a sheriff's department statement said.

Storms have coated the mountain with heavy snow and ice and searches have been thwarted by the threat of avalanches and foul weather, including powerful winds.

Authorities describe the mountain conditions as extremely dangerous with two hikers dying in recent weeks. One fell at least 152m (500ft) down an icy slope.

1432;1432;Washington Circle K shooter apparently kills self as police close in;2023-01-25T01:50:42Z;['N/A'];['US news', 'Washington state', 'US crime', 'Gun crime', 'US gun control'];;"A 21-year-old man wanted in connection with the random killing of three people at a convenience store in Yakima, Washington, early Tuesday shot and killed himself as officers approached him behind some warehouses several hours later, authorities said. Yakima police chief Matt Murray said in a video message posted online that a woman called 911 on Tuesday afternoon. The caller reported that the man had used her phone to make a call. “The suspect had borrowed a woman’s phone. He then called his mother and he made several incriminating statements including, ‘I killed those people,’” Murray said. As officers approached the suspect’s location, they heard gunshots, and paramedics responded to treat him. The man was later declared dead. Police did not use force and no officers were wounded during the incident, Murray said. “The suspect did have a large amount of ammunition and a weapon” when he was found, he added. “This does appear to bring this case to a conclusion.” Earlier in the day authorities closed portions of several roads as they searched for the suspect, identified as Jarid Haddock, of Yakima county.
No information was immediately provided about the victims, who were found dead at the Circle K convenience store at about 3.30am. Murray said police have security camera video and there are eyewitnesses from the store. The police chief told reporters early on Tuesday that a gunman entered a Circle K store in the city 150 miles south-east of Seattle in the early hours and opened fire on people inside. “It appears to be a random situation. There was no apparent conflict between the parties. The male just walked in and started shooting,” Murray told a press conference, which was posted on Tuesday morning to Facebook. The suspect drove away in a gray or silver sedan, possibly a Chrysler 200, heading toward the suburban community of Moxee on Highway 24, Murray said. “This is a dangerous person, so there is a danger to the community,” he said. “We don’t have a motive.” The attack is yet another outbreak of violence in the early weeks of 2023 as the US suffers a wave of mass killings that has claimed dozens of lives. Police converged on a home across a road from a storage facility on the outskirts of the city of nearly 100,000 residents, about 140 miles (225km) south-east of Seattle. Court records listed a home in the area as a previously known address for Haddock. Haddock appeared to have little criminal history. He was arrested in March 2020 after police saw him in a car that had been stolen from a woman who had left it running; he ran from officers who pulled him over, according to charging documents filed in Yakima county superior court, and he reported being homeless. He successfully completed a diversion program, despite twice violating its terms by using methamphetamine or heroin, and the charges were dismissed in December 2021. At Yakima Riverside Storage, across the street from the Swat response, receptionist Tabitha Johnson said she was taking the unusual precaution of locking the doors, which she can monitor through windows and security cameras. “It’s quite scary, but Yakima isn’t new to shootings,” the 39-year-old said. A Yakima police department spokesperson did not immediately return a message from the Associated Press seeking additional information. When officers responded to the Circle K, they also found a second shooting scene at an ampm convenience store across the street, Murray said. Police initially believed that the shooter fired into a nearby car, possibly injuring a person inside before stealing the vehicle and fleeing, but the police department later said it appeared the gunman had fired into his own car, possibly after being locked out of it.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/24/washington-state-shooter-circle-k-store;guardian;politics;1432
2542;2542;Millions of UK mobile and broadband users face 14% bill rises from April;2023-01-19T12:17:21Z;['Miles Brignall'];['Mobile phones', 'Broadband', 'Money', 'Broadband', 'Internet', 'Technology', 'UK news', 'UK cost of living crisis', 'Telecommunications industry', 'Business'];;"As if household budgets were not already under enough pressure, millions of broadband and mobile phone customers look set to face rises of more than 14% in their monthly bills from April. BT, TalkTalk, Three and Vodafone are among the big telecoms suppliers that are contractually allowed to increase their bills in line with the previous year’s inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) in December – plus a further 3%-3.9% on top. If the increases are passed on in full, as many experts expect, it would result in home broadband customers typically paying about £50 a year more, while mobile phone customers on expensive contracts could face rises of more than £100.
On Wednesday the Office for National Statistics said the CPI rate fell back slightly to 10.5%. It means there is nothing to stop the telecoms providers from increasing bills by 13%-14.4%. Ernest Doku, a telecoms expert at Uswitch.com, said millions of mobile and broadband customers would now know the scale of the bill increases they were likely to face this spring. Only those on social tariffs look set to be spared the increases. He said BT, EE, Plusnet and Vodafone broadband contracts allowed prices to go up by CPI plus 3.9%. At TalkTalk, it was CPI plus 3.7%, while Shell Energy can add CPI plus 3%. Sky and Virgin Media contracts allow mid-contract price increases but they do not stipulate a pricing formula in the same way as rivals. Although suppliers could surprise customers and withhold part of the increase, consumers can start looking forward to a flurry of announcements before April. Companies have to give customers 30 days’ notice of price increases but have so far been tight-lipped as to whether bills will rise by the maximum. Consumer groups are calling on households who are out of contract to use this as a catalyst to move to a new deal. Uswitch said broadband customers could save £162 a year on average by switching to a new provider, while hagglers typically saved more than £85 a year, according to the consumer group Which?.
A recent MoneySavingExpert poll revealed a success rate of more than 75% when haggling with TalkTalk, Virgin and Sky, plus “high success rates” at other broadband providers. The UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, is already facing calls to reduce the amount that Openreach can charge suppliers for wholesale broadband lines that in turn is passed on to customers. “There is still time for Ofcom to act and reduce the wholesale price increases that lead to these price rises. These are exceptional circumstances, and families and businesses across the UK need the regulator to act,” a TalkTalk spokesperson said. They added that the formula was agreed in 2021 when inflation was running at 1.5%. An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Our rules are clear: everyone must be told upfront about any future price rises before they sign up, and we’re investigating whether phone and broadband firms are sticking to this. “We’re also concerned about the transparency of inflation-linked price rises in contracts, and how well they are understood. We’re examining this issue to ensure customers’ interests are protected.”";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/19/uk-mobile-broadband-users-bill-rises-bt-ee-talktalk-three-vodafone-monthly-charges;guardian;science & technology;2542

5160;5160;Golden Goal: Peter Beardsley for Newcastle v Nottingham Forest (1996);2023-01-05T12:00:20Z;['Sachin Nakrani'];['Newcastle United', 'Nottingham Forest', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Of all the iconic moments that have come to define the Premier League era, few stick in the mind quite like that which occurred at Elland Road on Monday 29 April 1996. Title-chasing Newcastle had just beaten Leeds 1-0 and interviewed after the game, their manager, Kevin Keegan, had a few things to get off his chest. He started agitated, got increasingly angry and by the end had turned the volume up to 11. For many, the I will love it rant was pure Keegan, exposing him as a man too emotional for his own good and signalling the precise point that the destiny of the 1995-96 Premier League title race swung away from Newcastle and towards Manchester United.
Keegan had allowed Alex Ferguson to get inside his head, rising to the Scot’s bait after he had suggested during the final stage of an epic campaign that Leeds and Nottingham Forest, Newcastle’s third- and second-from-last opponents, would try less hard to beat the north-east side than they had his own. Ever the stirrer, Ferguson claimed Forest in particular would go easy on Newcastle given they were taking part in Stuart Pearce’s testimonial later that year. A favour for a favour, and all that. “You can tell him now, we’re still fighting for this title and he’s got to go to Middlesbrough and get something,” Keegan said, his temperature rising, his finger jabbing. “And I’ll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it!” United did get something at Middlesbrough; a 3-0 victory that sealed a third championship in four seasons. And really it was a formality given what occurred at the City Ground three days earlier – Newcastle’s 1-1 draw at Forest as the visitors dropped two points having taken a first-half lead. It was a mathematical blow following on from the psychological one Ferguson had landed prior to the Leeds game. The result was a sickener for Newcastle, leaving them two points behind United going into the final day of the season, when as Ferguson’s side toasted glory at the Riverside Stadium, Newcastle were left to stew on what might have been following a 1-1 draw with Tottenham. A 12-point lead frittered away. Geordie dreams ripped at the seams. On that night in the east Midlands, however, Newcastle’s followers at least had something to savour – a goal, one that spoke to the thrilling football they had delivered that season and which fittingly came from the boot of Newcastle’s most creative player during their most creative era. The Entertainers’ best entertainer: Peter Beardsley. It’s difficult to write about Beardsley in light of the 32-week ban from football he received in 2019 after being found guilty of using racist and abusive language towards Newcastle Under-23 players during his time as their coach. It was an upsetting and disgraceful episode and has come to overshadow the fact Beardsley was one hell of a footballer; a technically gifted, highly creative forward who has never truly received the credit he deserved. There are several reasons for that and undoubtedly among them are his appearance and demeanour. That shuffling running style, that pudding-bowl haircut, that thick, lispy Geordie accent; Beardsley is far from the sexiest player this country has ever produced but he is arguably its most talented.
A No 10 who rarely played with No 10 on his back, Beardsley’s mastery of a football was beguiling. It rarely left his foot, even as he pulled off his trademark move of dribbling through one challenge after another, often in tight spaces and at speed. As is the case with most talented players, that came from an allying of natural ability with constant practice, which in Beardsley’s case involved running with a ball from his home in Forest Hall to Wallsend Boys Club, the Tyneside youth setup that had a hand in launching not only Beardsley’s career but also those of Steve Bruce, Alan Shearer and Michael Carrick. The ball Beardsley used to dribble with was a penny floater, which for younger readers was made of plastic and had a mind of its own. It was a pain to play with but that was the point as far as Beardsley was concerned: learn to get to grips with one of those and the leather version would be a doddle in comparison. It worked. Beardsley grew up to not only be someone capable of manoeuvring in tight spaces and at speed but also with either foot and from awkward angles. He also had excellent spatial awareness and an often under-appreciated vicious finish. Beardsley may have come across as a dozy dope but there was bloody-mindedness to go with all that talent. And all those gifts were on show at the City Ground on Thursday 2 May 1996 as Newcastle went for title broke against Forest. A little over half an hour had been played when David Batty, standing just inside Forest’s half, fired a pass towards Beardsley, who was lurking outside the area but side-on and with the opposition back four in front of him. Matters were not helped by the ball bouncing as it reached Beardsley, but Newcastle’s captain did not panic. Instead, and in one movement, he seized possession and turned so he was facing towards goal. The ball was high and there were two Forest players, Scott Gemmill and Steve Chettle, moving towards Beardsley as he looked to progress. Again there was no panic as he waited for the ball to drop and, after it had, drove from right to left, brushing off Gemmill and Chettle with ease before poking the ball through Alf-Inge Haaland’s legs and surging into the area. There was still work to do given Haaland’s attempt at a last-ditch tackle, not to mention the fact Beardsley was running away from goal. Once again – no panic. Instead he took a touch to bring the ball under control before lashing a soaring, unstoppable drive past Mark Crossley and into the top corner. “A gem of a goal by a gem of a player,” exclaimed Martin Tyler in commentary, and he wasn’t wrong. The strike was voted Match of the Day’s goal of the month and in the space of five seconds and half a dozen touches, with left and right foot, captured Beardsley at best. Liverpool and Everton supporters may disagree with that assessment given the high-quality displays Beardsley delivered for the Merseyside clubs between the late 80s and the early 90s, while some Newcastle fans would perhaps argue he performed better for their club during his first spell at St James’ Park, from 1983-87. That may all be true but there is no denying that, in the years after he returned to the north-east, Beardsley was a consistently dazzling member of one of the most thrilling teams this country has seen. And what made his contribution to Keegan’s Newcastle especially remarkable was that he was way into his 30s – 35 on the night of the goal against Forest and going on to perform strongly for his boyhood team for a further 15 months.
It should also be remembered that as well as being a talented forward in his own right, Beardsley was an excellent foil for others. John Aldridge, Ian Rush, Andy Cole and Les Ferdinand are just some of the strikers who thrived alongside him at club level while with England there was Gary Lineker. “The person that helped me the most was Peter Beardsley,” said the Match of the Day presenter. “Phenomenal player. Unbelievably unselfish. My goalscoring record when Peter was in the England side was pretty much a goal a game and I owe that to him.” Resounding praise for a man whose life has slid into ignominy but who once lit up grounds around the country. None more so than the City Ground in 1996, scoring a goal of technical and brutal beauty amid the crash and burn of his team’s title aspirations.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/golden-goal-peter-beardsley-for-newcastle-v-nottingham-forest-1996;guardian;sports;5160

Russian citizens who have left the country and who criticise the war and the Kremlin should have their properties confiscated, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin has said.

In a statement on Telegram, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Duma's lower house of parliament, said those who had fled Russia were trying to ""maintain their wellbeing abroad"".

His proposal was clearly aimed at opposition figures - many already designated as ""foreign agents"" - who have condemned the Ukraine war after fleeing the country to avoid arrest.



""Recently, some of our fellow citizens consider it possible to insult Russia, its inhabitants, soldiers and officers, and openly support villains, Nazis and murderers,"" Mr Volodin said.

""Their goal is clear - to curry favour and try to maintain their wellbeing abroad.""

Mr Volodin said the existing legal responses to combat extremism, ""rehabilitation of Nazism"" or discrediting the armed forces - which is already punishable in Russia with fines and jail terms - were not sufficient to deal with these foreign-based ""reprobates"".

He added: ""While abroad, they rent out real estate, continue to receive royalties at the expense of Russian citizens. At the same time, they allow themselves to publicly pour dirt on Russia, insult our soldiers and officers. They feel their impunity, believing that justice cannot reach them.

""In this situation, it would be correct to supplement the relevant articles of the criminal code with a clause on confiscation of property from scoundrels in the Russian Federation, which they have enough to compensate for the damage.

""But this, of course, will not return their conscience. What do you think?""

Mr Volodin has been speaker of the lower house, the State Duma, since 2016, having previously held a senior role in the presidential administration.

As a member of Vladimir Putin's security council, he has regular access to the president.

As Duma speaker, he has ensured that key Kremlin policies move efficiently through the legislature, including laws penalising criticism of the war, placing the economy on a war footing and annexing occupied regions of Ukraine.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230114121711/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-explosions-in-kyiv-and-kharkiv-as-massive-attack-expected-scoundrels-who-fled-russia-should-have-properties-seized-putin-ally-says-12541713;skynews;politics;1349

The US music website Pitchfork originally reported that the musician would perform for the unofficial opening of the Atlantis the Royal hotel on 21 January, and had invited select guests to “a weekend where your dreams become your destination”. The invitation mentioned a “once-in-a-lifetime performance” but did not specify by which artist. That turned out to be Beyoncé, who played a 19-song set, including a collaboration with her oldest daughter, 11-year-old Blue Ivy, on the live debut of Brown Skin Girl, from Beyoncé’s soundtrack to Disney’s 2019 photorealistic remake of The Lion King. While the performance included similar live debuts for songs from that album, Stereogum reported, it did not contain any material from Beyoncé’s highly acclaimed 2022 album Renaissance. That album purported to be a love letter to Black and queer dance music pioneers and communities. As many fans have noted, homosexuality is illegal in the United Arab Emirates and considered a crime punishable by death. It is not always enforced: researchers at the London School of Economics have found that western gay men in the UAE are able to “use their economic, social and cultural privileges to create communities where they can meet and socialise”.
Fans have long lobbied artists to cancel concerts in the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the countries’ respective serious human rights violations. In 2019, Nicki Minaj pulled out of playing Jeddah World Fest in Saudi Arabia after the Human Rights Foundation asked that she withdraw. In 2021, Justin Bieber performed at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix despite campaigners and activists calling on him to cancel. The Guardian has contacted representatives of Beyoncé about her decision to perform in the country. People at the concert were asked to put their phones in locked pouches to prevent footage from the event circulating. Nevertheless, footage is appearing online and shows the musician backed by the Lebanese dance all-female troupe the Mayyas. Following the show, a publicist for Beyoncé circulated professional footage of the show. A press release said there was “more to come”. General access live dates for Renaissance are yet to be announced. Billed as Act 1, the album is expected to be the first in a duo or trilogy. • This article was amended on 22 January 2023 to make it clear that the Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber performances mentioned were in Saudi Arabia.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/22/beyonce-makes-controversial-live-return-at-exclusive-dubai-concert;guardian;entertainment & culture;1899

McDonald’s fired Easterbrook in 2019 after directors discovered he had been having a secret relationship with a senior female employee, which it said showed “poor judgment” and “violated company policy”. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Monday it had “charged” Easterbrook, who is British, with making “false and misleading statements to investors about the circumstances leading to his termination”. The regulator said Easterbrook and McDonald’s were not honest with investors about the reason that led to Easterbrook’s termination, and this “allowed him to retain substantial equity compensation that otherwise would have been forfeited”. Easterbrook, who is 55 and from Watford, walked away from McDonald’s with more than $40m in a “separation agreement”, the SEC said. “In making this conclusion, McDonald’s exercised discretion that was not disclosed to investors,” it added. Gurbir Grewal, the director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said: “When corporate officers corrupt internal processes to manage their personal reputations or line their own pockets, they breach their fundamental duties to shareholders, who are entitled to transparency and fair dealing from executives. “By allegedly concealing the extent of his misconduct during the company’s internal investigation, Easterbrook broke that trust with – and ultimately misled – shareholders.” The SEC said it found that Easterbrook violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. “Without admitting or denying its findings, Easterbrook has consented to entry of the SEC’s cease-and-desist order, which imposes a five-year officer and director bar and a $400,000 civil penalty,” it said. The SEC’s order also found that McDonald’s violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act rule 14a-3, and the company has consented to the SEC’s cease-and-desist order. The commission said it did not fine McDonald’s “in light of the substantial cooperation it provided to SEC staff during the course of its investigation, including voluntarily providing information not otherwise required to be produced in response to the staff’s requests, as well as the remedial measures undertaken by McDonald’s, including seeking and ultimately recovering the compensation Easterbrook received pursuant to the separation agreement”.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/09/former-mcdonalds-boss-steve-easterbrook-fined-400000-over-employee-relationship;guardian;entertainment & culture;4417
2684;2684;Health Canada recommends limiting alcohol to just 2 drinks per week;2023-01-18T18:26:56Z;['Leyland Cecco'];['Canada', 'US news', 'World news', 'Americas', 'Alcohol', 'Society'];;"New alcohol guidelines recommending that Canadians limit themselves to just two drinks a week – and ideally cut alcohol altogether – have prompted intense debate over risk versus enjoyment in a country where the vast majority of adults regularly consume alcohol.
The Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) this week called for a substantial reduction in consumption, warning that seemingly moderate drinking poses a number of serious health risks, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. The new guidelines, funded by Health Canada, represent a dramatic shift from previous recommendations issued in 2011, when Canadians were told that low-risk consumption meant no more than 10 drinks a week for women and 15 drinks a week for men. “We wanted to simply to present the evidence to the Canadian public, so they could reflect on their drinking and make informed decisions,” said Peter Butt, a professor of family medicine at the University of Saskatchewan and a member of the panel that drafted the guidelines. “It’s fundamentally based on the right to know.” In its measurements, the CCSA considers a standard drink to be a 12oz (355ml) serving of 5%-alcohol beer, a 5oz (148ml) glass of 12%-alcohol wine or a shot glass of 40% spirits. In the UK, the NHS recommends no more than six 6oz glasses of wine or six pints of 4% beer per week – ideally spread across three days or more. Health officials in the United States recommend no more than two drinks per day for men and only one for women. But Canadian experts say that new research suggests three to six drinks a week should be considered moderate risk for both men and women, and seven or more drinks a week is high risk. In addition to elevated risk of colon and breast cancer, as well as heart disease and strokes, the CCSA also identified both injuries and violence as negative outcomes from drinking alcohol. “This isn’t about prohibition. This is simply about reducing the amount one drinks,” said Butt. The guidelines also warn that no amount of alcohol is safe when pregnant or trying to get pregnant. While abstinence during breastfeeding is the safest option, a standard drink occasionally does not significantly elevate risk. The new guidelines were met with skepticism by some health experts. “This type of research often marginalizes other considerations of health and wellbeing from alcohol,” said Dan Malleck, a professor of health sciences at Brock University. “With their job as the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse and Addiction, there’s no space in there for considering there might be benefits. Their job is to find harm.” Malleck described the guidelines as “irresponsible”, and said they risk creating “anxiety and stress” among Canadians who once saw themselves as moderate drinkers but now occupy a “high-risk” category. “The research they’re using also ignores the enjoyment and pleasure and stress relief and collegiality associated with alcohol. None of those things are in the calculation whatsoever,” he said. “We aren’t just machines with inputs and output of chemicals or nutrition. We actually exist in a social space. And that has a significant impact on our health.” Others, however, see the guidelines as an attempt to help Canadians better understand the realities of alcohol consumption. “Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. Occasional use isn’t going to have really significant effects. Even if you occasionally use something like heroin, you probably wouldn’t see significant effects on your life. But that’s the thing: people aren’t using alcohol occasionally – they’re using it every day,” said Taryn Grieder, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. “The hope is that people will moderate their usage and not drink every day, because we’ve seen research that has shown that alcohol is a carcinogen.” Grieder says that there are components in alcohol that can be beneficial, but are typically only found in certain drinks. “A glass of red wine a day might have some benefits. But not beer, not a shot of hard alcohol. I think people took this idea of alcohol possibly having health benefits and really ran with it.” The CCSA also suggested there could be benefits in mandatory labelling of alcoholic beverages – warning of possible health risks and including guidance on consumption standards. “It might help change the perception for people, with labels showing cirrhosis of the liver and the possible long-term effects that drinking can have,” said Grieder. “Everyone is different and some people metabolize alcohol differently. “But these guidelines are for the average person, and the hope is that people will recognize the risks associated with use – and especially long-term use.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/18/canada-alcohol-drinks-guidelines-health;guardian;health;2684

2898;2898;Know Your Sh!t review – a cheery odyssey into other people’s poo;2023-01-17T21:00:26Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Life and style', 'Digestive disorders'];;"British television is going down the pan. Literally, in the case of Know Your Sh!t (Channel 4), a likable new pop-science odyssey exploring the hot-right-now subject of gut health and what we can all do to improve our gut microbiomes. Don’t be put off by the title, even though it has been softened by a P!nk-style quirk of punctuation. This show makes a point about how needlessly squeamish Britons can be about this subject matter, and what that could mean for people who might otherwise be helped to better health by confronting their poo. This will not put you off your dinner, they promise, and it’s true that there is no Gillian McKeith-style use of a lollipop stick to prod around in whatever the subject has left in a tub. It’s also true that there is a lot of poo and fart chat, in the required level of detail for a semi-medical programme, so it does rather depend on when you had your dinner, and what it was. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend watching Know Your Sh!t with a tray on your knee. Identical twins Lisa and Alana MacFarlane host this cheerful combo of Embarrassing Bodies and You Are What You Eat, arriving in a powder-pink VW Beetle, and announcing that they are setting up a clinic for excrement-related issues, called Poo HQ. This is also mostly pink, and I am troubled to find that the colour scheme is almost identical to my living room. At Poo HQ, they meet people with gut health problems and queries, who do interviews from a snazzy bathroom while sitting on the loo, fully clothed, before a team of experts, including the nutritionist Sophie Medlin and gastroenterologist Dr Rabia Topan. For the most part, it’s genuinely fascinating stuff. Prof Tim Spector, now well-known for his books on eating and nutrition as well as the Zoe health study, explains why gut health is such an exciting field. The science is only just starting to catch up with what scientists have long suspected about how much the health of our gut is connected to the rest of our body and mind. Later in the series, Lisa and Alana will get tested by him to see what they can learn about themselves and their own microbiomes.
But this first episode is about regular folk trying to work out why they don’t poo very often (model Emerald), why they poo too often (the fabulous 69-year-old Jan), and why milk can mess you up (gym instructor Marcus). While I sometimes wonder if TV shows promising medical attention are a depressing sign of a system that is failing those who need it, it is undeniably cheering to see people addressing problems they have ignored for years. Jan’s story, in particular, is wonderful. After suffering from incontinence and limiting her life in all sorts of ways, she ends the episode able to wear white trousers. Her life story is moving and her get-up-and-go is just lovely. I didn’t expect to find such warmth in a programme about poo, but here we are. The show is self-aware enough to know that you can’t say things such as: “What brings you to Poo HQ today?” with an entirely straight face, and parts come across like outtakes from an early 00s Radiohead album. “We are more microbe than we are human,” apparently; it sounds like a lyric that would fit right in on side A of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation. Actually, FMT is the curious field of giving one person’s so-called perfect poo – that is, from someone known as a “super-pooper” whose quality gut microbiome is in the top 1% of the population – to someone else, freeze-dried, in a capsule, winningly referred to here as a “crapsule”. Again, it may not put you off your dinner, but I wouldn’t want to watch that part while having chocolate ice-cream. There is a lot of terminology to digest here, from “transit time”, which can be measured by eating a dyed muffin and seeing how long it takes for your poo to turn blue, to “optimal toileting position”, which explains why so many people struggle to do what they need to do. I am a sucker for breezy medical telly, which takes a conversational approach and has a personable light touch. Next week, we’re promised a man who used to find his farts funny, but solemnly declares that he doesn’t think they’re funny any more. I can’t wait to see what Poo HQ makes of him.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/17/know-your-sht-review-a-cheery-odyssey-into-other-peoples-poo;guardian;entertainment & culture;2898
6575;6575;More than 1,000 babies born dependent on substances in Scotland since 2017;Saturday 7 January 2023 00:49, UK;[];['scotland'];['scottish', 'nas', 'local', 'babies', 'pregnancy', 'support', 'national', 'drug', 'substances', 'scotland', 'dependent', '1000', 'misuse', 'born', '2017', 'nhs'];"More than 1,100 babies who are dependent on substances have been born since 2017 in Scotland, data shows.

It has prompted calls for investment in supporting babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) from the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

NAS is when children show signs of addictions, due to the mother's use of legal, or illegal, substances during pregnancy.

Symptoms of NAS, which is often the result of blood being passed from the mother to the foetus during pregnancy, includes trembling, blotchy skin and hyperactivity,

The Scottish Liberal Democrats obtained the data through a freedom of information request, that showed 1,123 babies have been born with the condition in the last five years in Scotland, with a total of 147 such births in 2022/2023 to date.

That's down from 209 the year before, while 161 were recorded in 2020/2021, 164 in 2019/20, 199 in 2018/19 and 243 in 2017/18.

Some 609 NAS cases were recorded by NHS Lothian, followed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with 183, and NHS Grampian with 156.

Ministers must take more action, according to the party's leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, who adds the Scottish Drug Death Taskforce's report noted funding to be ""woefully inadequate"" in the area.

Mr Cole-Hamilton said: ""These figures are utterly heartbreaking. There is perhaps no worse possible start in life for a newborn baby.

""[Last] year, independent experts described the government's current funding for drugs and alcohol as woefully inadequate for this level of public emergency.

""Years of underfunding saw vulnerable local facilities shut their doors and critical expertise lost.

""Nicola Sturgeon has admitted her government wasn't paying attention while Scotland's situation became many times worse than anywhere else in Europe.

""It is time for radical action, not just to help people struggling with drug misuse today, but for future generations too.

""That means investing in local services which are best placed to intervene to stop lives from being lost and new lives starting dependent on substances.

""Drug misuse should always be treated as a health issue, not a criminal justice matter. Anything else will condemn many more children to be born into these awful circumstances.""

The Scottish government has earmarked £250m to support its national scheme on tackling drug misuse, which will be spent on increasing and improving access to treatment and recovery services.

A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""No newborn baby should be dependent on substances, and we are increasing investment in local services and providing support to women and families as part of our national mission to tackle the drug death emergency.

""We are funding a national specialist residential family service run by the charity and housing association Phoenix Futures in Saltcoats, North Ayrshire, to support single parents or couples along with their children.

""The service, which opened in November, will also support women through their pregnancy and into motherhood.

""We are also committed to preventing the harm caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, of which there is no safe level, and to supporting those impacted by foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230107010418/http://news.sky.com/story/more-than-1-000-babies-born-dependent-on-substances-in-scotland-since-2017-12781464;skynews;entertainment & culture;666
4456;4456;Rishi Sunak restarts talks on London listing for UK tech firm Arm;2023-01-09T12:00:44Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Arm', 'Technology sector', 'Business', 'UK news'];;"Rishi Sunak has reportedly restarted efforts to persuade the Japanese investor SoftBank to list the computer chip designer Arm in London. SoftBank has been considering listing Arm, which has its headquarters in Cambridge, for months, with New York thought to be the lead candidate. Arm produces designs for the chips embedded within 95% of the world’s smartphones. Before it was bought by SoftBank in 2016 it was a member of London’s FTSE 100 index, and its central role in the smartphone economy means it is seen as the most important British tech company.
Sunak met the Arm chief executive, Rene Haas, and the chief legal officer, Spencer Collins, last month in Downing Street. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, Arm’s Japanese owner, joined via video, according to the Financial Times. The UK government has pushed repeatedly for Arm to return to the London Stock Exchange, a move that would be seen as a vote of confidence in the UK. However, the UK lobbying has taken place under three prime ministers over the course of the last year of political turmoil. Andrew Griffith, the UK’s City minister, and executives from the London Stock Exchange are also involved in the talks with SoftBank, the FT reported. John Glen, a Treasury minister, met Arm and Softbank in June “to discuss Arm listing”, according to government disclosures. The government and regulators have made changes to the UK’s listing rules in an effort to persuade fast-growing tech companies that London is a worthwhile place to list their shares. Government officials have reportedly discussed a dual listing for Arm, which would allow it to trade in London and New York. However, dual listings come with higher complexity and costs. SoftBank paid $32bn (£26bn) for Arm in 2016 three weeks after the UK’s vote to leave the EU, which pushed down the value of sterling. The Japanese investor then sought to sell it in 2021 to the American chipmaker Nvidia. However, the $40bn deal collapsed after regulators expressed concerns. SoftBank’s next option was to seek a stock market listing but its plans were again stymied, this time by the global slump in the value of tech companies as interest rates rose. Arm’s head of investor relations last year wrote to private shareholders informing them of a delay to the listing plans, saying it was unlikely to happen until at least March 2023 because of “current global economic uncertainty” and “the state of financial markets”. However, he said the company was “fully committed to an IPO sometime in 2023”. Arm declined to comment. No 10 was approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/09/rishi-sunak-london-listing-uk-arm-softbank-ipo;guardian;science & technology;4456
8617;8617;Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford's wife, Clare, dies;Saturday 28 January 2023 15:14, UK;[];['mark drakeford', 'wales'];['mr', 'minister', 'welsh', 'wales', 'leader', 'clare', 'drakeford', 'mark', 'dies', 'wife', 'family', 'thoughts', 'drakefords'];"Clare Drakeford, the wife of Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford, has died suddenly.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Welsh government said: ""It is with deep sadness that we confirm the sudden passing of Clare Drakeford, wife of the first minister.

""The thoughts of everyone in the Welsh government are with the family at this time and we ask that their privacy is respected.""

First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, responding to the news in a post on Twitter, said she was sending her Welsh counterpart ""love and strength"".

""My thoughts are with Mark and his family at this terribly sad time,"" Ms Sturgeon tweeted.

""On the occasions I met Clare, it was obvious how strong the bond between her and Mark was, and I can only imagine the depth of grief he is feeling.""

Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""My thoughts and prayers are with Mark Drakeford and his family at this exceptionally difficult time.

""On the occasions I met Clare, she was always a lovely lady and was very warm and kind. I'm shocked and deeply saddened to hear of her passing.""

Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said his heart was ""absolutely breaking"" for Mr Drakeford, who is also the leader of Welsh Labour, while Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""I extend our deepest condolences to Mark, his family and friends.""

Downing Street said that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had passed on his deepest condolences to Mr Drakeford privately.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also sent his and his party's condolences, saying: ""I know just how close they were as a couple, and I can only imagine the sense of loss Mark and the whole family are feeling.

""They are all in our thoughts and prayers.""

Mr Drakeford and his wife married in 1977 and have three children together.

The family have lived in the Pontcanna area of Cardiff for 30 years.

The couple lived apart during much of the COVID pandemic, with Mr Drakeford staying in a building at the end of the couple's garden to allow him to carry on work while his wife remained at the house with his elderly mother-in-law, who was shielding.

Mr Drakeford, who became first minister in 2018 and was reappointed to the post in May 2021, later described their reunion as ""a bit emotional"".

Speaking to the ITV Wales podcast in August 2021, he said: ""I've been married for a very long time and not to be in the house and to be at a physical distance, even though we saw each other every day and talked every day, it was a puzzling experience in that sort of way and for that to be over it is a bit emotional for everybody.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128164716/http://news.sky.com/story/clare-drakeford-the-wife-of-waless-first-minister-mark-drakeford-dies-12797531;skynews;entertainment & culture;2708
3332;3332;Republicans accuse Biden of hypocrisy over classified documents discoveries;2023-01-15T16:26:21Z;['Sam Levine'];['Joe Biden', 'Biden administration', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump administration', 'US politics', 'US national security', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'US Congress', 'House of Representatives', 'World news'];;"Republicans pounced on the discovery on Saturday of more classified documents at Joe Biden’s residence, accusing the president of hypocrisy and questioning why the records were not brought to light earlier.
Biden’s lawyers have discovered at least 20 classified documents at his residence outside Wilmington, Delaware, and at an office in Washington used after he left the Obama administration, in which he was vice-president. It is not yet clear what exactly the documents are, but lawyers for Biden have said they immediately turned over the documents to the National Archives. This week, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel, former US attorney Robert Hur, to look into the matter. The materials are already a political headache for Biden. When the FBI raided Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort to obtain classified material the former president kept, Biden said: “How could that possibly happen? How anyone could be that irresponsible?” On Sunday, Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told ABC’s This Week: “It just just reminds me of that old adage, ‘If you live in a glass house don’t throw stones.’ And I think President Biden was caught throwing stones.” James Comer of Kentucky, the new chair of the House oversight committee, told CNN’s State of the Union: “While he was doing this, he knew very well that he himself had possession of classified documents so the hypocrisy here is great.” There is no evidence Biden was aware he had the documents. His lawyers have said they were misplaced. Comer also noted Biden’s attorneys discovered the classified material on 2 November, days before the midterm elections, and questioned why the discovery hadn’t been made public earlier. “Why didn’t we hear about this on 2 November, when the first batch of classified documents were discovered?” he said. Comer has requested visitor logs for Biden’s Delaware residence from January 2021 to the present as well as additional communications about the search for documents, CNN reported. Marc Short, who was chief of staff to Mike Pence in the Trump administration, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Why’d they hold it? Why didn’t anybody talk about it? Is it because of the midterm elections they didn’t want to interfere with?” Even though two special counsels are looking into how both Trump and Biden handled classified material, there are key differences between the cases. Trump had hundreds of classified files and rebuffed government efforts to return them. The White House has said the 20 or so Biden documents were inadvertently misplaced and turned over as soon as they were discovered. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, told CNN: “We were delighted to learn that the president’s lawyers, the moment they found out about the documents that day, turned them over to the National Archives, and ultimately to the Department of Justice. “That is a very different posture than what we saw with Donald Trump. He was fighting for a period of more than eight months to not turn over hundreds of missing documents that the archives was asking about. “There are some people who are trying to compare having a government document that should no longer be in your possession to inciting a violent insurrection against the government of the United States,” Raskin added, referring to the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress Trump incited after losing the 2020 election to Biden. “And those are obviously completely different things. That’s apples and oranges.”
The California Democrat Adam Schiff, the former chair of the House intelligence committee, praised the appointment of a special counsel in the Biden matter and said he wanted Congress to do its own intelligence assessment of the Biden and Trump materials. But Debbie Stabenow, a Democratic senator from Michigan, acknowledged that the discovery of additional documents on Saturday was “certainly embarrassing” and that Republicans would use it as a distraction. “It’s embarrassing that you would find a small number of documents, certainly not on purpose,” she told NBC. Biden’s lawyers, she said “don’t think [this] is the right thing and they have been moving to correct it … it’s one of those moments that obviously they wish hadn’t happened. “But what I’m most concerned about, this is the kind of things that the Republicans love.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/15/biden-documents-discoveries-republicans-pressure;guardian;politics;3332
805;805;Jeremy Hunt says tax cuts will only come ‘when the time is right’;2023-01-27T18:00:03Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Jeremy Hunt', 'Economic policy', 'Tax and spending', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Budget'];;Jeremy Hunt has signalled tax cuts will only come “when the time is right” and be matched by “spending restraint”, as he sought to temper restive Conservative backbenchers’ expectations ahead of the budget in March. However, the chancellor said he hoped to inject what he described as much-needed optimism about the country’s future, saying he wanted Britain to “have nothing less than the most competitive tax regime of any major country”. He initially declined to comment on his own tax affairs, when asked if he had ever had to pay a penalty to HMRC after the Tory chair, Nadhim Zahawi, was reported to have done so. “I’m not going to talk about my personal tax affairs, but I don’t think there’s anything you’d find interesting to write about,” Hunt told journalists on Friday, adding that people were not “remotely interested in personal tax affairs”. But he went on to say in an interview shortly after: “For the record I haven’t paid an HMRC fine.” The confirmation came after a gruelling week for the government, when ministers’ tax affairs have come under increased scrutiny after the investigation launched into Zahawi’s finances. Zahawi has admitted to making a “careless but not deliberate” error, and not denied suggestions he paid a penalty as part of a roughly £5m settlement for non-payment of capital gains tax due after the sale of shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded. Though the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has permitted the former chancellor to continue serving as Conservative chair while his ethics advisers looks into the issue, several MPs have publicly said he should stand down. Hunt faced embarrassment when he was health secretary in the coalition government after it emerged the Hotcourses firm he co-founded breached company law and was restructured resulting in a tax saving of about £100,000, and so sought to draw attention back to the government’s pledge to boost the economy on Friday. In a speech at Bloomberg, the chancellor targeted economic inactivity and urged those who retired early after the Covid pandemic, or struggled to find a new job after the furlough scheme ended, to rejoin the workforce. “We need you, and we will look at the conditions necessary to make it worth your while,” the chancellor said. Hunt blamed Britain’s woes on “economic headwinds” that affected many countries, citing favourable growth statistics, and inflation remaining higher in 14 European Union countries. “Declinism about Britain is just wrong,” he said. However, after pressure from Tory MPs – including the Conservative Growth Group founded by allies of Liz Truss – Hunt stressed that investment would only follow financial stability, and gave little hope that his March budget would reduce the tax burden. “Confidence in the future starts with honesty about the present,” he said. Hunt said “we need lower taxes” and that high rates “affect the incentives” of businesses to invest, but stressed that “sound money must come first”. “Our ambition should be to have nothing less than the most competitive tax regime of every major country,” he said, but that would mean “restraint on spending”. The creation of “mini-Canary Wharfs” – how Hunt dubbed the plan to reinvent Truss’s low-regulation, low-tax “investment zones” – was promised, with details about where they would be located to be announced “shortly”. Hunt took aim at Labour, citing Keir Starmer’s pledge not to reopen the big government chequebook. The chancellor claimed the party had since made tens of billions of unfunded spending commitments. After a cabinet away-day at Chequers, where ministers discussed gloomy polling, Hunt signalled his ambitions would not be realised immediately – paving the way for further announcements in the run-up to the next election about ways to boost growth. “This is a project that is not going to happen in the next 18 months or the time span before the next election,” Hunt said. However, he still tried to provide hope to glum Tory MPs, adding: “Even in really difficult times, we can make incredible progress.” Labour said Hunt and Sunak had no plan to fix “13 years of Tory economic failure”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: “Britain has so much potential. From creating good, new jobs in the industries of the future, to making our country the best place to start and grow a business, Labour’s proper plan for growth will grasp those opportunities and make our economy stronger to face up to the challenges. “Thirteen years of Tory economic failure have left living standards and growth on the floor, crashed our economy, and driven up mortgages and bills. “The Tories have no plan for now, and no plan for the future. It’s time for a Labour government that will build a better Britain.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/27/jeremy-hunt-chancellor-speech-tax-cuts-budget;guardian;politics;805
7213;7213;'Come clean' and apologise to Meghan, Prince Harry tells Royal Family;Friday 13 January 2023 21:30, UK;['chris lockyer', '@_chrislockyer'];['prince harry'];['prince', 'trying', 'harry', 'meghan', 'tells', 'royal', 'apologise', 'saying', 'wanted', 'adding', 'family', 'wife', 'know', 'come', 'interview', 'clean'];"Prince Harry has demanded an apology from the Royal Family for his wife Meghan, saying: ""You know what you did, and I now know why you did it. And you’ve been caught out, so just come clean"".

The Duke of Sussex said ""if people had listened"" when he first spoke about his concerns, he and his wife would not have had a rift with his family, adding: ""That's the saddest part about it - it was all so avoidable. But they just couldn't help themselves.""

Prince Harry made the comments in an interview with the Daily Telegraph conducted before the launch of his autobiography Spare, which contained a number of controversial claims against his family.

It is not made clear what he is asking his family to apologise for, but Prince Harry has in the past spoken about royals who have been opposed to his relationship with his wife.

Prince Harry also said in the interview he was confused as to why it seemed so ""shocking and outrageous"" that he was trying to tell what he called the ""truthful"" side of his story, adding he wanted to continue ""the good fight"" by standing up for his wife, and encouraging other men to do the same.

""If you don't lead by example, what is the point in living?"" he asked.

In the interview, Prince Harry also said he felt some ""responsibility"" to try to reform the monarchy for the sake of his brother's children - George, 9, Charlotte, 7 and Louis, 4.

However, he revealed that sense of responsibility frustrated Prince William, saying: ""He has made it very clear to me that his kids are not my responsibility.""

Despite that, he told The Telegraph he wanted to ""fix"" things with ""long-term, strategic thinking"".

""This is not about trying to collapse the monarchy - this is about trying to save them from themselves,"" he said.

""I know that I will get crucified by numerous people saying that.""

Elsewhere, he explains he told his family that decision they were making would make them look bad, particularly when it came to Meghan, adding that while they may not like him now, they would thank him in the future for talking about his issues.

He also referenced his previous revelation that he didn't cry over his mother's death, saying it was only after taking ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic, that his mother just wanted him to be happy, and it did not matter that he hadn't cried.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230113215015/https://news.sky.com/story/come-clean-and-apologise-to-meghan-prince-harry-tells-royal-family-12786059;skynews;entertainment & culture;1304

2904;2904;John Colley obituary;2023-01-17T20:09:49Z;['N/A'];['Health', 'Hospitals', 'University of Bristol', 'World Health Organization', 'Medicine', 'London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine', 'Pollution', 'European Commission', 'NHS', 'Devon'];;"My colleague and friend John Colley, who has died aged 92, was a pioneering epidemiologist and professor of public health medicine at Bristol University. Born in Bath, John was the son of Alice (nee Nuttall), a nurse, and Richard Colley, an ophthalmic surgeon. From Kingswood school he went to St Thomas’ Hospital Medical School, London, graduating in 1955. He was among that early postwar cohort who expanded epidemiology to give it more dynamic clinical relevance. Their new measures of physical and mental function for use in population studies enabled research to show how illness and disease risk develop over long periods of life, and how ageing occurs. At the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1964-76) and as honorary consultant in clinical epidemiology at Great Ormond Street hospital (1971-76), John showed how childhood exposure to atmospheric pollution was a risk for adult onset of chronic respiratory disease. He was consultant to the European Commission and the World Health Organization on atmospheric pollution and respiratory disease in children. As professor at Bristol University (1976-93), John expanded the department of epidemiology and public health with a new focus on public health medicine. He made it a scientific resource for the NHS in the south west, and redesigned the teaching to emphasise the essentials of evidence-based medicine. In addition, he developed and encouraged new research, which included taking on, for five years, the honorary directorship of the Medical Research Council’s National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort study begun in 1946, as it became a resource for research into ageing. That study continues still. John was a rigorous medical scientist of great integrity, and a stimulating colleague. He was editor of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1985-92), and a visiting examiner in other medical schools. On his appointment to the Bristol professorship, John was coming home, close to where he had grown up in Bath and to where his father had practised. John met Lesley Fortt, a medical secretary, at Bath Tennis Club; they married in 1965. When he retired, the family, to which he was devoted, energetically ran a smallholding, which included sheep, a flock of 36 breeding ewes, ponies, foals and five dogs. He loved sailing, listening to classical music and reading; he was also a talented artist. In 2004, the family moved to Littlehempston, Devon, where he kept a boat on the Dart, making trips to Dartmouth with grandchildren and dogs. John is survived by Lesley, his daughters, Sarah and Charlotte, and granddaughters, Jasmine, Chloe and Imogen.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/17/john-colley-obituary;guardian;health;2904
2939;2939;Where does the Britishvolt collapse leave UK’s dream of an electric future?;2023-01-17T16:39:29Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Automotive industry', 'Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Environment', 'Motoring', 'Technology', 'Technology sector', 'Technology startups', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Greenhouse gas emissions'];;The battery startup Britishvolt eyed a big opportunity. With the looming UK ban on sales of internal combustion engine cars after 2035, big demand for batteries was guaranteed. The problem was actually building the batteries. The company’s efforts have now come to nothing. It collapsed into administration on Tuesday after funding talks failed, leaving a string of disappointed backers ranging from the FTSE 100 companies Glencore and Ashtead to the property investor Tritax, owned by investment group abrdn, which had committed to fund a battery “gigafactory” in Northumberland. Some of the investors are sanguine. Britishvolt – with no customers and no ready product – was always “something of a lottery ticket”, said one, who joined before the Guardian revealed a funding crunch that forced Britishvolt to put the project on “life support” last summer. The bigger investors have lost millions of pounds, but not enough to make a material impact on their balance sheets. It is the UK government that must now answer some big questions about the future of the British car industry. In January 2022 Boris Johnson hailed the “EV battery pioneer” for planning to create “thousands of jobs”. Less than a year later, Johnson is out of Downing Street, Britishvolt is bankrupt, and the future of the UK car industry is under serious threat. The British industry is painfully reliant on producing cars with petrol or diesel engines, but it still has a shot at retooling for the battery age. The one shining example is the Chinese-owned Envision AESC. It is working on a “gigafactory” in Sunderland, with 38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual output to supply the Japanese carmaker Nissan next door. Envision managers estimate that 100GWh would be enough to attract a full supply chain and its well-paid jobs to the UK. Britishvolt’s failure could give Tata group, the Indian owner of Jaguar Land Rover, a stronger hand in negotiations over where it builds its battery factory. Tata Motors’ chief financial officer, P.B. Balaji, last week said the company would make batteries in Europe – a disconcertingly vague promise for UK officials desperate for more gigafactories. Others will be considering the Britishvolt site with interest: the Slovakian outfit InoBat, chaired by the ex-Aston Martin boss Andy Palmer, is deciding between sites in the UK and mainland Europe – and seeing what government support is on offer. There is still a chance for the UK industry to be part of the electric car revolution, but every failure to build a British gigafactory leaves it more exposed.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/17/britishvolt-collapse-uk-electric-future;guardian;business & economy;2939
1204;1204;‘I want to live’: the Ukraine hotline encouraging Russians to surrender;2023-01-26T05:00:50Z;['Daniel Boffey'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'World news', 'Europe'];;"More than 6,500 Russian military personnel have sought to surrender through a bespoke “I want to live” hotline, Ukraine’s government has claimed, with the call centre said to have been recently moved to a secret location to avoid Moscow interference. Vitaly Matvienko, spokesperson at the department for prisoners of war, said those who had made contact through the service had been verified as serving in the Russian forces using their personal data and service number. Between 15 September, when the hotline launched, and 20 January, it is claimed that 6,543 Russian personnel contacted the Ukrainian government to surrender themselves into their custody, often from the frontline. The hotline, fielded by 10 operators, had been established following Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a mobilisation of 300,000 civilians with previous military experience to join the Russian war effort.
Matvienko declined to comment on the number of completed surrenders but described the service, which is staffed 24/7, as “totally successful”, with between 50 and 100 calls and messages to the service’s Telegram channel being received every day. The call centre was moved a month ago from the department’s Kyiv offices to a secret location due to fear of it being targeted by Russian attacks, he said. The propaganda value is clear for Ukraine’s government, with 2 million people having visited the I want to live website in December alone, of which 1.6 million were in Russia. Those who have handed themselves in are offered the opportunity to be part of prisoner swaps arranged between the Russian and Ukrainian governments or to stay in custody with the potential to remain in Ukraine later or to emigrate. A total of 1,646 Ukrainian personnel have been released by the Russian government as part of such swaps, Matvienko said. The most recent deal was completed on 8 January when 50 personnel on each side were exchanged, with negotiations on others continuing. Matvienko said there were two stages to surrendering. “The first stage is Russian soldiers who are mobilised, partly mobilised, not mobilised yet, call to this hotline to this chatbot and say: ‘I’m going to surrender,’” he said. “After that he is obligated to leave his personal data. After the soldier reaches Ukrainian territory, it’s obligated for him to call again and say, ‘I’m going to surrender’ and Ukrainian operators help him to reach a safe place where he meets Ukrainian special forces.”
He said that the levels of interest on the service depended on developments on the battlefield. “During the liberation of Kherson, we had calls from Russians and they told us: ‘Just save our souls because we got stuck somewhere in the mud, our battalion is totally crashed, we have 10 soldiers left, please take us from this mess.’”
Oksana, 25, one of the call centre handlers, said each call was different but that they all gave her hope that the Russian war effort was weakening. “Some people call and say, ‘I’m somewhere in the military. I want to surrender,’ others say, ‘I am afraid to be mobilised in Russia, what do I need to do’. And some of them tell me, ‘I’m on the territory or Ukraine, I want to surrender.’ They are afraid and they don’t know what to do.” Matvienko personally passes on “I want to live” business cards to the released prisoners as those who have been swapped have been found to have been later redeployed to the battlefield. The claims of the Ukrainian department for prisoners of war could not be independently verified.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/26/ukraine-hotline-encouraging-russians-to-surrender;guardian;politics;1204
3073;3073;Victoria to end public drunkenness laws with no new arrest powers for police;2023-01-17T00:01:44Z;['Benita Kolovos', 'Adeshola Ore'];['Victoria', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Australian police and policing', 'Alcohol', 'Australia news', 'Victorian politics'];;"The daughter of Tanya Day, who died in custody after being arrested for being drunk on a train, has welcomed a decision by the Victorian government not to replace the state’s public intoxication laws with new move-on powers, despite opposition from the police union. The government on Tuesday confirmed it would not give police any new powers to arrest people for being drunk in public once the existing offence is decriminalised in November 2023. The Police Association has argued it would be “negligent and reckless” to decriminalise public drunkenness without enacting other laws to “keep people safe”. However, Day’s daughter, Apryl Day, welcomed the government’s commitment not to replace public intoxication with police move-on powers.
“It’s the first time across the nation that a jurisdiction has made a commitment to true decriminalisation, which I think is a really powerful moment,” she said. The government committed to repealing public drunkenness as a crime in 2019, amid the coronial inquest into the death of Day, but the implementation of a health-based response to replace the offence was delayed 12 months due to Covid-19. The 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman had fallen asleep on a train from Bendigo to Melbourne when she was arrested for public drunkenness and taken to a police station in Castlemaine. She hit her head at least five times in a holding cell while unattended and died in hospital from a brain haemorrhage about three weeks later. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Victoria’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, on Tuesday said the reform would not be “perfect” but would provide the “best outcome for the most amount of people”. “The main reason to decriminalise public intoxication is to ensure that people who are drunk aren’t sobering up in police cells,” she said. “We know that there’s a disproportionate impact on our Aboriginal community. “We have Aboriginal people who are arrested for the sole offence of being drunk in public and that is causing immense trauma and in some instances we know has resulted in people dying.” The Police Association secretary, Wayne Gatt, said no other state or territory that has decriminalised public drunkenness has taken such a “cavalier approach with the safety of its community”. “Decriminalising public drunkenness, of itself, is not a dangerous reform,” Gatt said in a statement. “What is dangerous however, is to do so without maintaining the safety net that would provide police with a means to manage people in the community that do not consent to a health response or where a health response is simply not available.” The opposition spokesperson for police and criminal justice reform, Brad Battin, agreed police must retain move-on powers to protect community safety. “We’ve seen too often on the front page of the papers a coward punch, generally from someone who is intoxicated, and we hear about it in court after they were drunk at the time and didn’t know what they were doing,” he said. However, Symes stressed the reform would not dilute further police’s powers. “Police will still have the option of stepping in when somebody is disturbing the peace, causing a scene or concerns about violent behaviour,” she said. Day dismissed the police union’s comments, saying police were yet to acknowledge the role they played in her mother’s death.
The Victorian coroner in 2020 concluded police officers had failed to adequately check Tanya Day’s safety and wellbeing, finding an indictable offence may have been committed. No charges have been laid over the death. “They actually have more of a care factor around their police powers being stripped than they do the lives of Aboriginal people and the deaths in custody that are occurring within Victoria,” Day said. Victoria and Queensland are the only jurisdictions in Australia to still have a specific offence for public drunkenness, which the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody found had disproportionately affected Indigenous people, and recommended that it be abolished. Of the 99 deaths investigated in the commission, 35% involved Aboriginal people who were detained in relation to public intoxication. Public drunkenness laws were repealed in NSW in 1979, but were effectively rolled into the state’s move-on laws. Symes said Victoria had learned from other jurisdictions that creating backup powers “undermines the whole purpose of decriminalisation.” The chief executive at the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Nerita Waight, said about 30 to 40 Aboriginal people a month continue to be arrested in the state for being drunk in public. She said the government’s decision to ensure police will not have new powers to respond to public intoxication is the “right” one and will have “a huge positive impact for overpoliced Aboriginal communities as well as other vulnerable communities across Victoria”. Danny Hill, secretary of the Victorian ambulance union, welcomed the creation ofsobering-up centres with associated transport teams but said more clarity was needed on the responsibilities of paramedics when dealing with an intoxicated person in future.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/17/victoria-ignores-police-calls-for-offence-to-replace-public-drunkenness;guardian;entertainment & culture;3073
3391;3391;Avalon by Nell Zink – mad about the mansplainer;2023-01-15T11:30:11Z;['Abhrajyoti Chakraborty'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];;"You could say that Nell Zink writes archetypally bildungsroman novels, but you wouldn’t be quite right. Her free-spirited protagonists might end up getting what they want, but the plots are sardonic; you can always feel the author winking at you from a window somewhere above. In The Wallcreeper, Zink’s debut novel, Tiffany drops a bombshell about her husband in the opening sentence: “I was looking at the map when Stephen swerved, hit the rock and occasioned the miscarriage.” Fifteen pages later, however, the miscarriage has been forgotten,and we see Tiffany trying to get Stephen to sleep with her sister in their apartment. In Mislaid, a white lesbian college student, Peggy, marries her gay professor and they have two children together. But a couple of chapters in, Peggy runs away with her daughter and outlandishly reinvents herself as a black single mother in Virginia. Avalon, Zink’s latest novel, is about another misfit: Bran, a “twenty-first-century teenager” in her own words, growing up on an exotic plant nursery in south-western California. Her mother abandoned Bran when she was 10 and became a nun in a Buddhist monastery somewhere in the Sierras. The nursery is managed by Bran’s “common-law stepfather” and his family, the Hendersons, and they run a more or less Dickensian ship. Bran is allowed to stay because she “represented circa eight years of unpaid labour and a potential twenty thousand dollars in earned income tax credits, if the IRS played along”. Bran ends up spending most evenings trimming topiaries at the nursery or preparing an order of ferns for delivery, instead of hanging out with her only friend from school, Jay: “It took me until I was sixteen to figure out that he would never marry me.”
If the opening pages convey the impression that we’re reading a tale of 18th-century drudgery set at the turn of the millennium, the novel pivots into an effervescent meet-cute once Bran is introduced to Peter, a friend of Jay’s from college. Peter is one of those erudite mansplainers bursting irrepressibly with facts garnered from a lifetime of reading. Any moment he might launch into an Arthurian legend, mutter something casually condescending – “Woman artists traditionally shelter behind the mask of genre” – or worse, declare that the screenplay Bran is writing for Jay’s film school assignment is “fascist”. He is also a master at negging: for much of the novel, he claims to have a fiancee, Yasira, who “wants to be a housewife married to a professor like her dad.” This, of course, has the effect of making him seem even more intriguing to Bran: “I could feel that I was being fucked with and liked it a lot.” Those who’ve read The Wallcreeper will remember a particular intimate moment between Tiffany and Stephen, among the best-written accounts of bad sex in contemporary American fiction. In Avalon, Zink turns out to be a connoisseur at writing about characters who typically fail to get it on. Peter and Bran are both sexually ignorant and once Peter transfers to Harvard, their relationship peters out into a found poem of unanswered texts that Bran sends regularly from her bootlegged phone. (A sample of Peter’s erratic replies: “Don’t miss the oranges (of H. Bosch) ha never read it – not pr0n, only pr0n. Love you.”) And yet their will-they-won’t-they? dynamic sustains your interest for pages. Bran manages to escape the Hendersons and ends up working in coffee shops and applying for lucrative house-sitting gigs. There is a beautifully done moment where Peter flies to LA one morning to be her knight in shining armour. They book a hotel room together, but only exchange chaste kisses in bed. When they “shift positions”, it is to help Peter finish reading for a class: “My professor is a slave driver.” Bran, too, seems happy catching up with her copy of Theodor Adorno’s Minima Moralia, a gift from Peter.
Despite the hilarious set pieces, Avalon struck me as the most sincere of Zink’s novels. The slippery sensibility of Mislaid has morphed into a sentimental soft-focus stance. For large stretches, the book seems exclusively about Bran’s quest to get laid. I yearned for something like the disquisitions on birdwatching and ecological collapse in The Wallcreeper; the arguments on fascism and art between Bran and her friends seem no more than annoying distractions. In an interview 60 years ago, the late French film-maker Jean-Luc Godard asked his older German peer Fritz Lang about the necessity of making films in an increasingly capitalist world. “It has to be done,” Lang replied. “The romantic element.” With Avalon, Zink seems to be suggesting something similar about literary fiction, that perhaps a satirical novelist can occasionally write a slushy story about landing a guy. Every few pages, however, you run into passages that belong to a different, more philosophical, narrative. Glancing up at the California sky one night, Bran wonders about the stars blurring “with inexpressible happiness”: “Why would they do that? Is there any possible ethical justification?” These are questions that can be plausibly asked of Zink’s ambition in this otherwise absorbing novel. Avalon by Nell Zink is published by Faber (14.99).

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid candles at the Holocaust memorial at Babyn Yar, Kyiv.

The president released a message to mark the day, saying: ""Today, as always, Ukraine honours the memory of millions of Holocaust victims.

""We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only,"" he said.

""That is why it is so important that everyone who values ​​life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy.""

While in London, another 92-year-old - Vera Schaufeld - whose parents were murdered in a concentration camp, raised concerns about whether young people are learning enough about the atrocities of the past.

She said: ""Antisemitism is more prevalent than it has been in the past because I think young people are no longer learning about the Holocaust as much as they did.""

Ms Schaufeld, who was born in Prague in 1930 but came to England via the Kindertransport in 1938, added: ""Jewish people should be seen just as much as individuals, and not as a whole group, but understood that they have their own views and their own lives in the same way that every other minority has to be respected.

""And it has to be understood that their experiences and their lives are relevant to them and their families.""

2639;2639;Liberals jostle for Molan’s Senate seat with call for Tony Abbott to fill spot;2023-01-19T04:15:14Z;['Paul Karp'];['Liberal party', 'Tony Abbott', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics'];;"The death of Jim Molan has sparked a round of Liberal infighting in New South Wales, including a call for Tony Abbott to fill his Senate seat and a push for senior moderate Marise Payne to quit parliament. Molan died on Monday after a “sudden and rapid” decline in health after Christmas, vacating a Liberal Senate seat he was appointed to in 2019 when Arthur Sinodinos resigned, and which he was re-elected to in 2022 for a six-year term. Although Catholic Schools NSW chief executive, Dallas McInerney, was considered an early favourite for the vacancy, on Wednesday evening Michael Kroger, the former Victorian Liberal president, began the push for Abbott, the former prime minister, to take the seat. “Obviously this is a matter purely for the NSW party and no one likes getting advice from people outside their own state,” Kroger told Sky News Australia. “But I would think there’s a fairly obvious replacement for someone of Jim’s seniority and that would be Tony Abbott.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kroger credited Abbott, who won the 2013 election before being dumped by the Liberal partyroom in 2015 for Malcolm Turnbull and losing his seat to independent Zali Steggall in 2019, as one of the “most successful opposition leaders”. “He’s not going to be leader again but boy, what a powerhouse of knowledge and experience in putting someone like Abbott to mentor some of the newer people in the parliament,” Kroger reportedly said. “I don’t think you could find anyone better.” The Liberal party leader, Peter Dutton, on Thursday told the ABC there was “no question Tony Abbott would be an asset” but noted “there will be many other candidates who are very credible as well”. “I’m just not getting into who would be the best candidate or who you would endorse or all of that process – I think it’s all a bit tacky at the moment,” he said. Abbott has not confirmed if he will be a candidate, but Liberal sources told Guardian Australia he is keen to re-enter public life and they are taking the push seriously. On Thursday, Abbott penned an opinion piece for the Australian newspaper arguing the best way to honour the dead is “to take seriously the causes that mattered to them”, crediting Molan for warning that Australia is “sleepwalking through lotus-land instead of responding sensibly to Beijing’s drive for world domination”. “As Molan warns, wishful thinking about American invincibility is now as fanciful as assumptions about China’s likely evolution into a peaceful democracy,” Abbott wrote. “Like Molan, I am convinced that the only way to avoid a Chinese attack on Taiwan is to make its cost unacceptable to Beijing.” The prospect of Abbott’s return to the Senate alarmed Liberals keen to rejuvenate the party. One said it is “not what the party needs, not what Peter Dutton needs and it’s a bad idea – not just for the party but for him [Abbott] too”. One NSW Liberal said the party should “look to the future”, suggesting Abbott may not run given the weight of moderate votes against him. “Kroger should stick to the Victorian division which has enough problems of its own,” one senior New South Wales Liberal told Guardian Australia. “There is an element of distaste about this being discussed before Molan’s funeral. There is plenty of time, the preselection won’t be held before the March NSW election.”
The seat will be filled by the NSW Liberal party’s 750-member state council, but factions are yet to even agree which of them will take the vacancy. The party’s remaining senators from NSW are Payne and Andrew Bragg, both moderates, and Hollie Hughes, from the centre right. One view is that before the election all factions agreed that Molan’s position would go to the hard right. Hughes – who described the positioning of others as a “bit disrespectful” – put the case that her faction should get the vacancy on Sky News on Wednesday evening. “I did see that the hard right was claiming that this was their spot,” Hughes said. “Interestingly, they actually didn’t back Jim [Molan] the last couple times, it was actually the centre right. “I would like to see another strong centre-right conservative person go into the Senate, someone with that sort of measured sensible view.” Some view this as “rewriting history” and believe the moderates should respect a deal to elect a replacement from the hard right in return for selecting Payne’s replacement, while others believe they could support a rival candidate. Some moderates are also agitating for Payne, the former foreign minister and the longest serving female senator in Australian history, to quit, citing her light official duties. After the Coalition’s defeat at the May 2022 election, Payne accepted the appointment of shadow cabinet secretary rather than taking a substantive portfolio. The feeling is not universal in the faction, with senior leaders arguing Payne is highly respected and had earned the right to go at a time of her choosing, and others suggesting the push is counter-productive and more likely to prompt her to dig in and stay. A NSW Liberal spokesperson said: “The division will undertake a process to select a candidate to fill the casual vacancy in due course.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/liberals-jostle-for-molans-senate-seat-with-call-for-tony-abbott-to-fill-spot;guardian;politics;2639

Polly Toynbee’s article is excellent (Today, 17 people will likely die in unimaginable pain. Here’s how you can help stop that, 19 January). I spent the whole of my 50-year career in nursing, the first 20 years in the UK. In my career as a critical care/intensive care nurse, I often cared for individuals who could not live free from pain and suffering, often requiring an artificial ventilator or pharmacological support in order to survive even for a short period of time. The fear of the patients was palpable; the suffering of their loved ones immense. I also cared for two brothers who suffered long, prolonged dying due to ever increasing respiratory failure. The fear in their eyes is indelibly printed on my heart and my memory of them. One of them begged me to give him a handful of his morphine pills. Although I lovingly joined my family in caring for him for months, I couldn’t give him the peace he needed at the end of his life without fear of the legal ramifications. The stories of UK citizens going to Switzerland months early to get end-of-life support while the journey is still possible is devastating in so many ways. The right to end one’s suffering should not be a political or religious decision, but a decision made by individuals, with their physicians and loved ones. No one else. Hopefully, by the time my life journey nears it end, I will have the autonomy, with the support of my family, to go peacefully.

Yet they are “kept going”, whatever their health, whatever the personal cost and whatever their own wishes are. The “sanctity of life” must be preserved no matter what the circumstances – even when that life no longer holds any meaning or joy. Of course, I hope I can enjoy a long and healthy retirement, but I have seen my possible future and I don’t want that. I don’t want the suffering, the immobility, the pointlessness of it all. I would prefer an end that is of my choosing. One that has dignity and enables my family to remember me – to grieve and celebrate from a position of respect for my life and my contribution to their own lives. I would prefer a “good death”, where I can die with dignity and on my terms. We need the appropriate legal, social and healthcare frameworks in place to enable people like me to end our lives when we feel it is the right time. Nick Anderson Purton, Wiltshire • Polly Toynbee makes the case for assisted dying and assisted suicide to be made legal, citing the statistic that, on average, 17 people a day in the UK die an agonising death, when even the best palliative care doesn’t help. My heart goes out to the families who have to watch their loved one go through this. Having said that, we must accept that the alternative is far worse. Half a million elderly people are care home residents in the UK, and millions more are in the community, often supported by struggling family members. A change in the law will inevitably lead to far larger numbers of assisted suicides, not due to chronic end-of-life pain but due to the guilt of being a burden or watching inheritances deplete through the exorbitant cost of care. There’s also the clear danger of elderly people being pressured by greedy family members. These unwanted consequences are unavoidable. A survey has found that 84% of Britons support assisted suicide, but how many think beyond the simple question and consider the ramifications?

7232;7232;UK weather: Heavy snow warning as cold weather alert issued across England - but flooding may arrive first;Saturday 14 January 2023 03:37, UK;[];['weather'];['parts', 'warnings', 'risk', 'england', 'arrive', 'south', 'snow', 'weather', 'warning', 'issued', 'flooding', 'heavy', 'rain', 'cold', 'flood', 'uk'];"Heavy snow could fall in large parts of England within the next week as the UK braces for several days of unstable weather, with a cold weather alert coming into force and dozens of flood warnings already in place.

The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for rain for Wales and many areas in England, lasting from Friday night to Saturday lunchtime, and one for Northern Ireland from 2pm on Saturday until 3am on Sunday.

Between 20mm and 30mm of rain is likely to fall widely, with some seeing more than 50mm - including southwest England and the Brecon Beacons.

Strong winds are also expected, with gusts of 40-50mph and possibly 60mph on exposed coasts in the south.

As of the early hours of Saturday, there were 81 flood warnings in place across the UK, meaning flooding is expected, and more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible.

Forecasters are warning that bus and train services will probably be affected, while spray and flooding is set to make journey times longer by road too.

Out with the rain, in with the snow?

Once the wet and windy weekend is out of the way, snow could follow.

The level two cold weather alert runs from 6pm on Sunday to 9am on Thursday across the North, the Midlands, and central and eastern parts of England.

The Met Office says there is a 70% probability of severe cold weather, icy conditions and heavy snow, and advises people in those regions to stock up on food and medicines to reduce the need to go outside.

London, the South, and South West are covered by a level one alert - warning people to stay vigilant.

Sky News weather presenter Kirsty McCabe said it would be getting ""much colder"", as a jet stream ""plunges south, dragging cold air from the north across the UK"".

Expect ""significant wind chill"", she warned, with ""an increasing risk of winter hazards such as snow and ice"".

The unwelcome weather comes as parts of the country recover from already severe flooding this week, after heavy downpours left roads and fields underwater - and threatened homes.

In York, levels on the River Ouse were about 3.8m above normal and predicted to rise further overnight.

Shrewsbury in Shropshire saw flooding cause ""gridlock"" in the town centre, while people in Keynsham, Somerset, required rescuing from submerged vehicles in Old Bristol Road.

The town's local football club posted images of their pitches looking like swimming pools and joked about needing a water polo team instead.

The Environment Agency's Mark Garratt has advised people to check their local flood risk, to stay away from swollen rivers and not drive through floodwater.

""The Environment Agency is monitoring flood levels, operating flood gates and barriers at locations across the country, and ensuring debris screens are clear from blockages to ensure communities are better protected,"" he said.

Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said driving in floodwater was ""never worth the risk"" as it can endanger passengers and potentially ""cause catastrophic damage"" to vehicles.

4248;4248;Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 322 of the invasion;2023-01-11T00:35:26Z;['N/A'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'World news', 'Europe', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Vladimir Putin'];;The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has claimed his forces have completed the takeover of the Ukrainian town of Soledar, which if confirmed would mark Moscow’s first major battlefield success since last summer. “Wagner units have taken the whole territory of Soledar under control,” said Yevgeny Prigozhin in an audio message released on his Telegram channel late on Tuesday. Soledar, home to huge salt mines, has symbolic, military and commercial value for Russia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the “heroic” defenders of Soledar but gave no update on the military situation in his nightly address on Tuesday. Russian forces trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Avdiivka, Ukraine’s armed forces said, a second focus for Russia south of Bakhmut and not far from the city of Donetsk, held by Russian proxies since 2014. Russia’s artillery fire in Ukraine has gone down dramatically from its wartime high, in some places by as much as 75%, according to US and Ukrainian officials. The drop in shelling is further evidence of Russia’s increasingly weak position on the battlefield nearly a year into its invasion, officials have told CNN. The officials did not give a clear or single explanation behind the striking decline in artillery fire. Western officials have warned that Ukraine will not be able to take back a significant amount of territory from Russia without an increase in military capability, including tanks and armoured vehicles. Russian and Ukrainian forces are currently too closely matched for the Ukrainians to be able to mount a major offensive, a western official said on Tuesday. They said a reported Ukrainian call for 300 tanks was “not an unreasonable number” to create the force mass needed for them to go on the attack. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said his government would purchase a US air defence system to donate to Ukraine. The US-built air defence system was worth C$406m (US$302m), defence minister Anita Anand said. “Canada will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they fight against Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable invasion,” Anand said. Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the US as soon as next week, US officials said. The training programme will take place at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, with the programme expected to take “several months”, one said. During Zelenskiy’s visit to the US in December, Joe Biden announced $1.85bn (£1.54bn) in new military assistance to Kyiv, including the delivery of a Patriot missile battery system. The US is also reportedly considering sending Stryker armoured combat vehicles to Ukraine. The move could be announced next week, but no final decision has been made, Politico reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. Russia has appointed Colonel-General Alexander Lapin as chief of staff of the country’s ground forces, state-owned news agency TASS reported, despite criticism from hawks over his performance in Ukraine. The family of one of two British men missing in Ukraine have said they are “very worried and concerned” about his health. Chris Parry, 28, was last seen on Friday with fellow Briton Andrew Bagshaw, 48, heading to the town of Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. The men had been working as volunteers helping people evacuate from the frontline.

6891;6891;One man's gaffe, another man's gift? What we know about the Biden classified documents discovery;Tuesday 10 January 2023 21:01, UK;['mark stone', '@stone_skynews'];['donald trump', 'joe biden'];['center', 'mr', 'gift', 'questions', 'gaffe', 'biden', 'classified', 'office', 'personal', 'discovery', 'documents', 'mans', 'president', 'know', 'trump'];"It's quite the gift for Donald Trump - the news he wasn't the only one storing classified documents in unauthorised and insecure locations.

In a political climate where 'whataboutism' so often drives the discourse, former President Trump and the Republicans are making the most of the revelation President Biden has, it seems, been very careless with his own classified documents.

The current president certainly has lots of questions to answer.

So what do we know? And to what extent is there an equivalence between the case of Mr Trump and the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home and documents found belonging to President Biden?

What was found and when?

According to the president's special counsel, Richard Sauber, staff were clearing out an office once used by President Biden at his think-tank, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. The documents and office date from a time when Mr Biden was President Obama's vice-president.

During the clear-out, just before last November's midterm elections, boxes were found in a locked closet.

Most of the boxes contained paperwork relating to the Biden family - personal documents.

But among them was an envelope marked ""VP Personal"".

In all, about 10 documents were marked as ""classified"". They included intelligence memos and national security memos relating to Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. Their contents have not been revealed.

What have Trump and his allies said?

In a series of posts by Mr Trump on his social media site Truth Social, the former president said: ""When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?""

He went on to suggest, without providing evidence, that Chinese agents had seen the Biden documents.

Trump draws the China link because the University of Pennsylvania, under whose jurisdiction the Penn-Biden Center falls, has received Chinese donations.

Mr Trump's allies in congress are demanding answers, led by the newly-elected speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, who called the revelations ""very concerning"".

The key differences between the Trump documents and the Biden documents?

Firstly, quantity: Fewer than twelve documents were found at the Penn-Biden center. More than 160 were found at Mar-a-Lago. This excuse might not hold water. One document in the wrong hands could be one too many.

Secondly, location. A private office space is distinct from a personal home which doubles as a country club.

Thirdly, intent. It's not unusual when someone at the top of government leaves office to find cases where documents of a secret nature get mixed up with those of a personal nature.

Biden faces renewed question over contents of his son Hunter's laptop

Biden's team are arguing the discovery was reported immediately, and the documents were surrendered to the National Archives.

We're told Biden's ""personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives"".

In Mr Trump's case, the FBI, who raided his home, said his team pro-actively took them to Mar-a-Lago and that there was obstruction of attempts to get the documents returned to the National Archives - the case remains under investigation.

The questions unanswered?

There is still plenty for President Biden to explain. Did Mr Biden pro-actively take the documents to the Penn-Biden Center? If so, why? What role did he personally have in their placement in the office closet? Who else had access to them? How long had they been in the closet?

This is very awkward for President Biden. When it emerged President Trump had so many top secret documents in his possession, Biden asked: ""...how that could possibly happen? Why anyone can be that irresponsible? What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods?""

He must now apply those same questions to himself.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230110211720/http://news.sky.com/story/one-mans-gaffe-another-mans-gift-what-we-know-about-the-biden-classified-documents-discovery-12783928;skynews;politics;982

Reputations on the line over authenticity of artwork, 2 January). In 1940, it was judged a Vermeer on its “utmost delicacy of glaze and stipple”. You report that the paint has now been found (after two restorations by the museum) to be “heavy-handed” in a way that “pooled and almost dripped”. Distinct features on the painting were lost or weakened in each restoration. Before the first, the girl had a solid necklace, dark eyebrows and a strongly lit and shaded face. Those features were greatly weakened and the necklace was left much thinner with a small break in the first restoration. In the second, ahead of the previous travelling Vermeer blockbuster exhibitions of 1995-96, published photographs showed that all the features were further weakened and the necklace had lost its central section. After that cleaning, the remains of the necklace were almost, but not entirely, painted out by the restorer. ArtWatch first complained of these restorations in 1995 and, in 2001, we published photographs showing the succession of injuries. So far as we know, none of the art historians now squabbling over the attribution have discussed the restoration injuries.

2377;2377;‘That’s Africa, man’: how a young musician captured the music of Rwanda;2023-01-20T06:30:30Z;['Sarah Johnson'];['Global development', 'Rwanda', 'Music', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Culture'];;"In a studio in Kigali, Rwanda, Michael Makembe sits down at his laptop and starts playing some traditional vocals he recorded in the street. The music producer adds a layer of Afrobeat and drums, and mixes in some percussion, his own harmonies, and chords he plays on the keyboard. Then he listens back to what he’s done so far. “That’s the groove,” he says to the documentary maker from Rwandan media organisation IGIHE, as he sings along. “That’s Africa, man.” Makembe, 25, hasn’t always been interested in traditional Rwandan vocals and instruments. Growing up, he listened mostly to artists from abroad such as Michael Jackson and Bob Marley. It was when he attended music school that he felt an urge to connect with his roots.
“I never got a chance to connect with Rwandan tradition at a young age,” he says. “I realised I really needed to connect with my roots, and speak to my homeland through music.” In 2018, he decided to travel all around Rwanda, visiting communities in remote places to collect voices, poems, songs and recordings of traditional instruments. In five years Makembe has amassed nearly 1,000 different sounds. He is hoping to open an audio museum this year where people can go and listen to them. He also wants to launch Sounds of Rwanda, an online library for a global audience. “I had to connect with my home and have time to understand, discover and explore its traditions. Rwandan music is me, it’s who I am,” he adds. Makembe began by researching different communities and their musical traditions before travelling to meet these communities, sometimes living with them for a week or two. He takes equipment and a camera, and records singing, clapping or playing instruments, as well as any other sounds he finds interesting, like people cooking or digging.
He is often asked what he’s doing and where the vocals will end up. “It has been a journey to preach to people and tell them my idea. It is for my own use, but it’s also something for the next generation too,” he says. He pays for contributions. All his work so far has been self-funded by other creative work, gigs, music production and festival appearances. One of Makembe’s most treasured experiences was on Nkombo Island, on Lake Kivu, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. Most of its population eke out a living from fishing. They speak a language different from the Kinyarwanda spoken in the rest of the country.
Makembe recorded the fishers singing at work and found one whose voice stood out. “He was someone who was different. I had to understand him. I’ve always been trying to push his story. When he sings, it’s a true story and something he believes in. “He’s poor. In his community he doesn’t have much and so doesn’t have a voice. When you have no voice, you are nothing. He has no power. His way to tell his story is through a song.” Since then, Makembe has stayed in touch with the community and organised a concert for them to perform in Kigali in September last year.
He is due to release his own album this year, using some of the sounds he has collected. “I bring the influences I had in my childhood, and fuse modern sounds with tradition,” he says. Makembe has also collaborated with other Rwandan artists including Ish Kevin and Bushali, part of a burgeoning music scene in the country that uses elements of Rwandan and other African culture to create new genres. “The industry now is made up of a young generation who are creating styles influenced by tradition, like Kinyatrap and Afrobeat,” says Makembe. “It’s the beginning. It’s a growing movement. We are among the people bringing it to life, inspiring [our young people]. We bring them solutions in their own language. I wish I could have had this in childhood.” • Instagram: @michaelmakembe";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/20/how-michael-makembe-captured-the-music-of-rwanda;guardian;entertainment & culture;2377
1949;1949;People-smugglers ‘recruiting Russian captains for migrant boats to Italy’;2023-01-22T12:46:42Z;['Lorenzo Tondo'];['Italy', 'Russia', 'Turkey', 'Migration', 'Human trafficking', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'World news', 'European Union'];;"People-smugglers are recruiting dozens of Russian citizens to replace Ukrainian sailors captaining boats carrying migrants from Turkey to Italy, NGOs have claimed. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine at least 14 Russian nationals have been arrested by the Italian police on charges of illegally transporting asylum seekers. A report by the Italian non-governmental organisation Arci Porco Rosso and the nonprofit Borderline Europe “noted a doubling in the number of arrests of Russian citizens” accused of piloting the vessels compared with the previous year, as well as many more arrests of ‘‘Syrians, Bengalis, and even people from landlocked countries, such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan’’. The Turkey to Italy route was established by a criminal network of Turkish smugglers as an alternative to the long Balkans overland route to the EU, in part in response to pushbacks, typically using small fast yachts, most often stolen or rented. About 11,000 migrants arrived on the Italian coasts of Puglia, Calabria and Sicily in 2021 from the Turkish ports of Izmir, Bodrum and Çanakkale. Initially the smugglers almost exclusively recruited Ukrainian skippers, many of whom had fled the country to escape military service during the war against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas. But since the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the number of Ukrainians recruited by Turkish smugglers has been decreasing.
“Ukrainians have been fundamental for the arrival of people departing from Turkey, being expert sailors who know how to handle a boat,” the report says. “With the outbreak of the war, Ukrainian men have been blocked from leaving their country, which has undoubtedly been a determining factor in the diminished availability of Ukrainian skippers.” Turkish gangs have instead begun training asylum seekers to pilot boats, recruiting Turkish sailors and hiring ever-increasing numbers of Russian citizens and others from former Soviet republics. “In the past, some Russian citizens had been recruited by smugglers for this job, but these were mostly isolated cases,” said lawyer Giancarlo Liberati. “After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and actually a few months before the war, we noticed an increase of Russian citizens recruited to pilot these sailing boats carrying migrants, and their involvement has become almost systematic.” In May 2022, a sailboat carrying about 100 migrants crashed into an old wharf in Siderno, Calabria. Two people died in the incident: they were both Russian citizens believed to have piloted the vessel. The most recent arrest was in November, when three Russians brought about 100 migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq to the coast of Sicily. Sabrina Gambino, the head of the Sicilian prosecutor’s office in Syracuse, said “a well-organised Turkish criminal network that uses luxury boats, allegedly stolen or rented” was behind the sailings. If sentenced, the boat pilots risk up to 15 years in jail. Charities and lawyers say a majority of Russians held in Italian prisons claim they had to escape from their country to flee military service and had refused to fight in Ukraine. “A Russian citizen detained in a prison wrote a letter to us saying he had to flee Russia to escape the war, but that together with another refugee from Russia was arrested as a people-smuggler on arrival,” said Richard Braude, an activist with Arci Porco Rosso. A defence brief presented in court for a Russian citizen, Ilnar Sadrutdinov, a resident of the Tatarstan region arrested in early 2022 for piloting a boat carrying dozens of asylum seekers from Turkey to Calabria, said he had left Russia because he would not take up arms. “I am very sorry that Putin and the people who supported him have begun the seizure of Ukraine,” he said, according to a document seen by the Guardian. “Please don’t send me back to Russia, because now those who refuse to fight are imprisoned. My aunt is married to a Ukrainian, my sister is married to a Ukrainian. Ukraine is a sister nation for me.” He claimed he was unaware of the penalties for people-smuggling. “They told me that by accepting this job I could save people and earn money,” Sadrutdinov said. “If I had known I was going to prison, even for just a year, I never would have taken the job.” The Guardian could not independently verify his claims. The chief prosecutor of Crotone, Giuseppe Capoccia, said the skippers recruited by the Turkish networks “had been hired for this specific role” and that in some cases they “were in possession of a tourist visa”. “They are desperate sailors looking for any job to make some money,” he added. Despite the increase in Russian smugglers, the largest number of skippers arrested for this route come from Egypt and Turkey. In recent years, charities and human rights associations have highlighted how Italy has conducted a policy of criminalising boat drivers, filling its prisons with innocent men used as scapegoats. According to aid workers and lawyers, migrant boat skippers are very often also refugees or people with no job alternatives who have been deceived by smugglers. “Many of the arrests will have been of people who never steered a boat in their life,’’ said Sara Traylor, an activist for Arci Porco Rosso. “We have to remember how long and risky these journeys are – and they are made even more dangerous by attempts to criminalise them. If the people driving a boat don’t have any experience, this can lead to tragedies, as we are seeing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/22/people-smugglers-recruiting-russian-captains-for-migrant-boats-to-italy;guardian;entertainment & culture;1949

But Nadhim Zahawi's rise through the echelons of Westminster has been brought to an abrupt halt after he was sacked as Tory chairman over his tax affairs.

So how did the 55-year-old rise to be the toast of the Tories before being told by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak he had committed a ""serious breach of the ministerial code"".

Follow reaction to Nadhim Zahawi's sacking - live updates

Early years

Mr Zahawi was born in Bagdad, Iraq, and spent his early years growing up as part of an influential Kurdish family.

His father was a well-known businessman and his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq.

But after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the dictator began to target the Kurds.

""It was clear to my family Iraq would not be safe under his leadership and that is when we decided we had to flee to the UK,"" Mr Zahawi told his local newspaper, the Stratford Herald.

He arrived in the UK aged 11, unable to speak a word of English, and began his new life by going to Holland Park School in London.

Soon, his family moved him from a comprehensive education to private school, and he studied at both Ibstock Place School, Roehampton, and then King's College School, Wimbledon, both in southwest London.

However, as he was set to go off to university, an investment by his father went belly up and the family lost everything, except for their Vauxhall car.

Mr Zahawi used the vehicle to become a minicab driver to contribute to the family finances, but his mother insisted he carry on studying and pawned her jewellery to cover the costs.

So off he went to University College London to study chemical engineering.

Business endeavours

After graduating in 1988, it was the world of business he wanted to pursue and he sought to echo his father's example as an entrepreneur.

Like his father, it didn't always go right - his setting up of a firm that sold Teletubbies merchandise ended as a ""costly and painful mistake"", he later said.

But it did attract the attention and investment of Lord Jeffrey Archer - who once described him as a ""born organiser"" - and opened doors to the senior ranks of the Conservative Party.

Mr Zahawi became an aide to Lord Archer and in return, the peer helped with his own campaign to become a Tory councillor, winning a seat in the London borough of Wandsworth in 1994.

There was also a failed attempt to enter Parliament in 1997, when he competed for the new seat of Erith and Thamesmead amid a Labour landslide.

He helped with Lord Archer's London mayoral campaign in 1998 too, but it was brought to an early close when the peer pulled out of the race amid controversy.

It was the turn of the millennium that signalled another change in Mr Zahawi's fortunes when, alongside another former aide of Lord Archer's, Stephan Shakespeare, he founded polling company YouGov.

The business grew and grew, and within five years it was floated on the stock market valued at £18m.

He would later tell Sky News he was ""the beneficiary of the British dream"".

According to the Evening Standard, Mr Zahawi cashed in £1.2m of shares in 2005, and went on to work as the firm's CEO for a further five years.

But having made his fortune, he set his sights firmly back on the world of politics and, in 2010, he was elected as the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon.

Masters Of Nothing

A year later, with world still affected by the fallout from the 2008 recession, he co-authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock, titled Masters Of Nothing: How The Crash Will Happen Again Unless We Understand Human Nature.

He began to gain some recognition in the party, becoming part of the Number 10 policy unit advising the then prime minister David Cameron.

However, in this early part of his Commons career, he became more known to the public for his part in a 2013 expenses scandal, having claimed cash to power his horses' stables.

It wasn't until 2018 that Mr Zahawi was appointed into his first junior minister post - a parliamentary under secretary at the Department for Education - and a year later he was moved to the business department.

But he became a household name after COVID broke out in the UK and he was appointed by Boris Johnson to become the country's vaccine minister, receiving widespread praise for his work in the Department of Health and Social Care to tackle the pandemic.

'Do the right thing and go'

The performance propelled him to cabinet and in September 2021, he took his first secretary of state post, back in the Department for Education.

The chaos that ensued the following year as Mr Johnson's downfall played out in public saw him pushed up the ranks again, replacing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in Number 11 after his dramatic resignation.

But two days later, Mr Zahawi joined the growing horde of ministers calling for the PM to step down, telling Mr Johnson: ""You must do the right thing and go now.""

A vacancy was created at the top, and he threw his hat in the ring to become the next Tory leader and next prime minister.

Giving his first broadcast campaign interview to Sky News, Mr Zahawi promised that under his control, the government would reduce corporation tax, income tax and national insurance.

But the issue of his own finances was brought to the fore after reports his tax affairs had been investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency and HMRC.

'I was clearly being smeared'

""I was clearly being smeared,"" he told Kay Burley. ""I'm not aware of this. I've always declared my taxes - I've paid my taxes in the UK. I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.

""But I will go further. I will make a commitment today, that if I am prime minister the right thing to do is publish my accounts annually. That is the right thing to do because we need to take this issue off the table.""

Mr Zahawi didn't make it through the first round of balloting, and instead threw his backing behind Liz Truss.

He carried on in the Treasury until Ms Truss took the keys to Number 10, but was dealt a demotion in her cabinet, instead becoming Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, minister for intergovernmental relations and minister for equalities.

As we know, this premiership was not to last long, and weeks later - under Rishi Sunak - Mr Zahawi was made chairman of the Tory Party.

A seven-figure sum

But those questions raised over the summer regarding his taxes were soon to resurface again.

In January 2023, The Sun On Sunday published a report claiming Mr Zahawi had paid a seven-figure sum to settle a dispute with HMRC over the sales of his YouGov shares.

Sky News made several attempts in the following days to get Mr Zahawi to confirm or deny the story, but his team refused, instead saying his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"".

Mr Sunak stood by him during Prime Minister's Questions that week, but by the weekend, the swirl of questions was growing by the hour.

'Careless not deliberate error'

Mr Zahawi released a statement saying he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and didn't confirm if any penalty was also levied.

But Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty.

Mr Sunak had ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi to be conducted by the PM's new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.

But the prime minister initally resisted calls to sack Mr Zahawi, saying he retained ""confidence"" in his colleague.

But in a letter published on Sunday morning, Mr Sunak said an ethics inquiry into the handling of his tax affairs found a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code.

He added: ""As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's government.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129103250/http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-nadhim-zahawi-the-child-refugee-turned-multimillionaire-politician-sacked-over-his-tax-affairs-12791994;skynews;politics;2754
3996;3996;British players handed tough Australian Open draw as Draper faces Nadal;2023-01-12T06:31:14Z;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Australian Open 2023', 'Australian Open', 'Tennis', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];;"Great Britain’s men’s players have been handed a series of brutal first round draws at the Australian Open. In his first main draw appearance, Jack Draper will debut against defending champion and top seed Rafael Nadal on Rod Laver Arena. Meanwhile, Andy Murray has been drawn to face former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini in the opening round and Kyle Edmund, a former semi-finalist, will play the 15th seed Jannik Sinner.
In the women’s draw, Emma Raducanu was handed a fair opener against Germany’s Tamara Korpatsch. Should she advance, Raducanu potentially faces a highly anticipated second round match against seventh seed Coco Gauff. Nadal will be attempting to establish some rhythm in the opening rounds after a difficult few months on the court. The 22-time grand slam champion has struggled badly since being forced to withdraw before his Wimbledon semi-final against Nick Kyrgios with an abdominal strain last July. “It will be amazing to play on a big court against him, he is a great champion,” said Draper. “There are a lot of emotions, thinking about playing him, but I have to still got to do well in this week’s tournament. Whatever happens it will be a special occasion for me, still very young in my career, so it’s great to have these sort of experiences and exposure to playing Rafa on a big arena. I’ll just be trying to play well and do the best that I can.” After losing his first two matches of the year to Cameron Norrie and Alex de Minaur in the United Cup, Nadal has now lost six of his last seven matches and his only victory since the US Open in August was a dead rubber against Casper Ruud in the ATP Finals. Should Nadal survive Draper, one of the trickiest first-round opponents, there are more difficult opponents ahead in what is an extremely tough draw. The Spaniard faces a potential fourth round rematch with 16th seed Frances Tiafoe, who defeated him at the US Open. Last year’s finalist Daniil Medvedev, seeded seventh, could face Nadal in the quarter-final, while third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas looms in the second quarter. British No 1 Cameron Norrie is also a prominent figure in the top half after an excellent start to the year. Norrie will begin against French wildcard Luca van Assche, with a gruelling potential third-round match against Cincinnati champion Borna Coric. In the bottom half of the men’s draw, which is headed by second seed Ruud, Kyrgios will begin potentially the most important Australian Open of his career against Roman Safiullin, with a potential third-round match against 19-year-old Holger Rune, who is seeded ninth. Novak Djokovic, returning as the tournament favourite after being deported last year, has been dealt a pleasant draw as he chases his 10th Australian Open title on his return, with Roberto Carballes Baena his first round opponent. Dan Evans, seeded 25th, will begin his Australian Open against Facundo Baginis.
Despite a heavy loss to Jessica Pegula in the United Cup last week, Iga Świątek will again begin as the heavy favourite in the women’s draw. Świątek faces a tough opening round against Germany’s Jule Niemeier, who pushed her to three sets at the US Open last year. Świątek could potentially face former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, who will open against 25th seed Marie Bouzkova, in what would be one of the most highly anticipated third-round matches. Pegula, the in-form third seed who led USA to victory in the United Cup, heads the second section of the women’s draw. The only two former Australian Open champions in the women’s draw – 2012 and 2013 champion Victoria Azarenka and 2020 winner Sofia Kenin – will face each other in the first round. After two finals in her last three grand slam tournaments, Ons Jabeur will resume her pursuit of her first grand slam title as the second seed against Tamara Zidanšek of Slovenia. Fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka, who begins against Czech Republic’s Tereza Martincová, looms in the bottom quarter, while WTA Finals champion and fourth seed Caroline Garcia begins against a qualifier. Meanwhile, Britain’s Harriet Dart will face 32nd seed Jil Teichmann in the opening round.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/12/british-players-handed-tough-australian-open-draw-as-jack-draper-pitted-against-nadal;guardian;sports;3996
1664;1664;Labour will reconnect ‘tarnished UK’ with European allies, says Lammy;2023-01-23T22:30:16Z;['Patrick Wintour'];['Labour', 'Foreign policy', 'David Lammy', 'Brexit', 'UK news', 'European Union', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'World news'];;Labour will make closer cooperation with Europe across security, trade and foreign policy a central plank of a plan to reconnect “a tarnished UK” with its closest allies, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, will say in a landmark speech designed to mark out the diplomatic mission of a future Labour government. Addressing the thinktank Chatham House on Tuesday, he will say the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has not been given a clear set of goals post-Brexit. “Ideological leadership and reckless choices have left Britain increasingly disconnected from its closest allies, an economy in crisis, and a tarnished international reputation.” His guiding aim in office, he will say, will be to create “a Britain reconnected, for security and prosperity at home”. Lammy will propose intensive regular bilateral meetings between the UK and the EU and a renewed focus on negotiating a defence security pact with the bloc. The regular summits would allow a structured dialogue to tackle Europe’s shared threats in areas such as cybersecurity, energy security and organised crime. The bilateral summits would be additional to the European Political Community initiative bringing together a large range of non-EU states with Brussels, and first held last October. He will suggest that a scheduled review of the trade and cooperation agreement with the EU in 2025 will offer a chance to iron out many of the difficulties in current mutual recognition agreements, so “reducing friction on food, agricultural, medical and veterinary goods, strengthening recognition”. He is also promising to unblock participation in the Horizon scheme and improve links between British and European students and universities. But he will stress Labour has no intention of returning either to the EU single market or the customs union, regarded by Labour as issues that were settled irrevocably by the 2016 referendum. Labour expects the negotiations around the Northern Ireland protocol to be settled by the next election, even though there are signs the Democratic Unionist party and the Conservative European Research Group faction have formed a new alliance in an effort to prevent Rishi Sunak endorsing a deal that gives the European court of justice an overarching judicial role in policing a renegotiated agreement. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called the protocol dispute the achilles heel in the relationship between the UK and Europe. Some EU experts believe Labour is underestimating the difficulties it will face in forging a new relationship with Europe, or the determination of Brussels to protect the integrity of the single market. But Lammy has been investing heavily in building personal relationships in Germany and France, to create a well of personal goodwill that has been lacking during 15 years of a Tory government. More broadly, Lammy will argue relations with Europe are only one sign of how “poor leadership, bad choices and institutional dysfunction” disconnected Britain from the allies and partners it needs at a time of unprecedented geopolitical competition. On China he will call for greater consistency in the British approach. He will not give a commitment to rebuild a fully separate Department for International Development, even though he believes the merger engineered by Boris Johnson was an error that has destroyed the UK’s reputation as an aid superpower. Nor will he set a date by which Labour will meet the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. The Conservatives have cut the target to 0.5%. Labour is waiting to see if the current development minister, Andrew Mitchell, achieves his ambition of creating a development policy hub at the heart of the Foreign Office. In other measures, Lammy will back calls made by US senators and the Atlantic Council thinktank for the US, Britain and the EU to join forces to create a Transatlantic Anti-Corruption Council, saying the current sanctions policy against kleptocrats is poorly coordinated. He will also promise to publish a strategy on global supply chains within the first parliamentary session and forming a “clean power alliance”, describing it as an “inverse Opec” of developed and developing countries committed to 100% clean energy by 2030.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/23/labour-reconnect-tarnished-uk-european-allies-david-lammy;guardian;politics;1664

5181;5181;Prince Harry claims physical attack by brother in new book | First Thing;2023-01-05T09:51:56Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['US news'];;"Good morning. In his highly anticipated autobiography, Spare, Prince Harry recounts what he says was a physical attack by his brother, William, now Prince of Wales, as their relationship fell apart over the younger prince’s marriage to the actor Meghan Markle. Describing a confrontation at his London home in 2019, Harry says William called Meghan “difficult”, “rude” and “abrasive”, which Harry calls a “parrot[ing of] the press narrative” about his American wife. The confrontation escalated, Harry claims, until William “grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and … knocked me to the floor”. The extraordinary scene, which Harry claims resulted in visible injury to his back, is one of many in Spare, which will be published worldwide next week and is likely to spark a serious furore for the British royal family. Amid stringent pre-launch security around the book, the Guardian obtained a copy. What does Harry say happened during the attack? He writes that he offered his brother a glass of water. “He set down the water, called me another name, then came at me. It all happened so fast. So very fast. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dog’s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out,” Harry writes. House adjourns as speakership evades McCarthy even after sixth vote
The House remained paralyzed yesterday, after the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy failed for the sixth time to capture the speaker’s gavel as his critics stood firm in their opposition to his candidacy. After the House adjourned for a few hours, McCarthy and his allies went into negotiations with the Republican holdouts without a clear path forward to end the standoff, then pushed back a seventh vote on the House leadership until today. The House held a total of three inconclusive votes in the speakership election on Wednesday, mirroring the three votes held a day earlier. Across all six ballots, no speaker candidate successfully captured the 218 votes expected to be needed for a victory. The stalemate marked the first time in a century that a House speaker was not chosen in the initial vote. After the sixth vote on Wednesday evening, the House moved to adjourn until at least 8pm ET, giving Republicans more time to reach a solution, then pushed back the deadline again, voting to adjourn until noon the following day. “It looks messy,” said the congressman Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin, in a speech nominating McCarthy for speaker on Wednesday, “but democracy is messy.” What’s happening in the House while this is going on? All House business, including the swearing-in of new members, has come to a halt until the speakership is determined. The continued stalemate has infused even routine votes, like the vote on whether to adjourn the House until today, with unusual drama. There was shouting, arguments and confusion on the floor of the House last night. Alarm as US states pass ‘very concerning’ anti-homeless laws
Alarm is growing as numerous anti-homeless laws are being passed across the US as funding for social services is widely reduced, raising welfare concerns among advocates for the unhoused. In Missouri, a new state law that took effect on 1 January makes it a crime for any person to sleep on state property. For unhoused people, sleeping in public parks or under city highways could mean up to $750 in fines or 15 days in prison for multiple offenses. Homelessness advocates have decried the law, claiming that it unfairly targets Missouri’s homeless populations. The law was signed by Missouri’s governor, Mike Parson, last June. “We are absolutely hearing that law enforcement is using this new law that’s coming as reason to displace people already,” said Sarah Owsley, advocacy director for the non-profit Empower Missouri, to St Louis Public Radio, days before the law went into effect. A swath of people opposed the Republican-backed measure, including Parson’s appointed department of mental health director, Valerie Huhn, reported the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. What else is happening across the country? Other cities and local municipalities in America have also passed measures targeting homeless individuals, through criminal consequences or forced hospitalization. Cities across the country have also seen a backlash to attempts by officials to remove homeless encampments or limit where unhoused people can camp. In other news …

The number of populist leaders around the world has fallen to a 20-year low after a series of victories for progressives and centrists over the past year, according to analysis from the Tony Blair Institute showing the number of people living under populist rule has fallen by 800,000 in two years. The report says 1.7 billion people were living under a populist leader at the start of 2023, compared with 2.5 billion in 2020. The research claims 2023 could be an equally decisive year for populism, with critical elections in Turkey and Poland. Those two elections could result in the fall of two of the most influential populist governments in the world.

There may be other movie sets and productions where people are not in a forgiving mood and studio chiefs will be terrified of legal market forces driving new legislation.

In a clip from Harry: The Interview, which will be broadcast at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX on Sunday, Prince Harry speaks about his memories of meeting mourners following the death of his mother in 1997. Speaking to the presenter Tom Bradby, the duke said: “Everyone knows where they were and what they were doing the night my mother died. “I cried once, at the burial, and you know I go into detail about how strange it was and how actually there was some guilt that I felt, and I think William felt as well, by walking around the outside of Kensington Palace.”
“I’ve seen the videos, right – I looked back over it all. And the wet hands that we were shaking, we couldn’t understand why their hands were wet, but it was all the tears that they were wiping away.” He adds that he and his brother, William, were unable to show any emotion as they met the mourners. “Everyone thought and felt like they knew our mum, and the two closest people to her, the two most loved people by her, were unable to show any emotion in that moment,” he added. In a previous clip released by ITV ahead of the interview, Prince Harry has said he saw “the red mist” in his brother, Prince William, when his older sibling allegedly attacked him during a confrontation over the younger duke’s relationship with Meghan Markle. “He wanted me to hit him back, but I chose not to,” he said of his brother, who he earlier claimed in his book had physically attacked him – as was first reported by the Guardian.

2806;2806; ‘Born into a time of chaos’: how being pregnant amid a climate disaster can affect children;2023-01-18T11:00:02Z;['N/A'];"[""Children's health"", 'Climate crisis', 'Psychology', 'Environment', 'Extreme weather', 'Pregnancy', 'New York']";;"When Superstorm Sandy hit in October 2012, Celia Sporer-Newman was about eight months pregnant and working full-time as a paramedic in Queens, New York.
Sporer-Newman had worked through previous disasters, including Hurricane Irene the year before, but this felt different. She saw news reports that said Sandy was going to be worse than anything New Yorkers had seen before. “What if I go into labor?” Sporer-Newman wondered. “I was like, [with] my luck, I’ll be at work in an ambulance standing in, like, 12ft of water.” Four days before Superstorm Sandy made landfall and about three weeks before her due date, Sporer-Newman gave birth to a baby boy named Izzy. He was 7lb 6oz and jaundiced, and otherwise appeared healthy. But as the rain from Sandy began to come down, Sporer-Newman and her baby would face challenges beyond their expectations. In the US, hurricanes are increasing in frequency and intensity due to the climate crisis. Disasters cause obvious problems: people’s homes are damaged or destroyed, neighbourhoods are flooded, businesses fail and workers lose jobs. A study released this fall suggests there may be other more insidious, long-term effects. Children who were exposed to Superstorm Sandy while in the womb have “substantially” higher risks for developing depression, anxiety and attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders, including ADHD. The research, published in September in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, surveyed 163 preschool-age children and found that those exposed to Sandy in utero were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders and nearly four times as likely to be diagnosed for attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders. The study also found a sex difference in diagnosis among girls and boys. Girls were more at risk of anxiety and depression, and boys were more at risk of ADHD. About 86% of the study’s participants were from racial and ethnic minorities and low-income backgrounds. Dr Yoko Nomura, the study’s lead author and a professor of psychology at City University of New York’s Queens College, said she did not anticipate the magnitude or consistency of these findings. “Superstorm Sandy turned out to be really a bad, bad guy,” she said.
Much has been said about how Sandy paralyzed New York City, resulting in at least 44 deaths and causing $19bn dollars in damages. Healthcare providers in the city were hit especially hard. Flooding and storm damage caused six hospitals to close, leading to the evacuation of nearly 2,000 patients. The hospitals that remained open struggled to meet the needs of incoming patients.
All of a sudden, expecting parents were forced to change their birth plans. One study participant reported having gotten stuck alone in an elevator. “[She was afraid she would] have a baby in the elevator without anybody’s help,” Nomura said. Sporer-Newman participated in the study. “All I could think about was how stressed I was,” she said, thinking back on Superstorm Sandy and Izzy’s birth. Though Izzy was born a few days before the storm made landfall, researchers included him in the group with kids of mothers who watched news reports of the storm. She went into labor ahead of her scheduled C-section and gave birth without an epidural – there was no time for one, she said. “I don’t know if the stress induced [labor] or … I had so many other things to do that I just wasn’t paying attention to my own body,” Sporer-Newman said. Sporer-Newman wanted to get home before the storm struck and left the hospital with her son against medical advice. She said hospitals can get overwhelmed and didn’t want to risk an evacuation. She felt her chances of staying safe were better at home and, as a medical professional, she was able to monitor herself and her baby. She wasn’t able to take Izzy to his check-ups at seven days and then at 12-15 days owing to the city’s post-Sandy standstill. Her pediatrician’s office was closed and, when it did open, was overcrowded with patients.
At Izzy’s one-month visit, the doctor said that he was not gaining weight. He was taken to the emergency room, where he remained hospitalised for 10 days. He was diagnosed as “failure to thrive”, meaning his weight was below average, and he was not receiving the nutrition he needed to grow. But hospital staff couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong. The baby cried and fussed a lot and, in retrospect, Sporer-Newman wonders if he was in pain. Eventually, doctors and his mother learned ways to help Izzy gain and maintain enough weight that allowed him to go home. Sporer-Newman said if she had brought Izzy to his early doctor’s visits, then his struggle to gain weight would have been noticed and treated earlier. Now, she wonders if the unease around the storm affected the medical attention Izzy received. “He was born into a time of chaos. I’m not blaming anybody for missing things … but like, maybe he would’ve had a little bit more attention,” she said.
Jada Shapiro has been a doula for more than 20 years in New York City. She said the emotional toll and the accompanying uncertainty from traumatic events like Sandy is profound on pregnant people. “I don’t think people totally understood that it was possible that a hospital would actually shut down or not function,” she said. “And when you don’t feel safe, labor doesn’t work as well.” In the aftermath of Sandy, Shapiro helped to organise a program that matched parents displaced by the hurricane with volunteer doulas who offered support via phone and email until March 2013. “Doulas really make a big difference in terms of providing emotional support and physical support to laboring parents and to new parents,” she said. Participants in Nomura’s study pointed to an array of stressors surrounding Sandy, Nomura said. Food pantries flooded. Widespread power outages affected phone and internet services, making it difficult to stay in touch with friends and family. Some participants took in extended family members whose homes were flooded or who lost electricity; that meant spending hours in tight corridors with several houseguests. “All those things accumulate as a source of stress,” said Nomura. One way stress gets passed down to the child in utero is through the placenta, an organ that delivers nutrients and oxygen to a growing foetus, said Jia Liu, a neuroscientist and research professor at Cuny. She worked with Nomura on a separate study, which used data from some of Nomura’s subjects, on how environmental stressors affect brain function. Its goal was to identify cellular and molecular changes that are related to a baby’s temperament early in life. Nomura and a team of researchers collected the placental tissues of all 33 participants who gave birth after the storm and followed their children from six to 12 months of age. The new parents were asked to fill out questionnaires to assess their baby’s temperament. The study found a significant association between a baby having a temperament described as “slow to warm up” with high stress levels during pregnancy.
Liu said researchers identified changes in two specific groups of genes expressed in the placenta. First, genes that regulate inflammation increased in number, which researchers believe was a response to stress in the womb. Second, genes that control how easily molecules (eg toxins, metabolites) cross from the mother to foetus via the placenta decreased in number. Both groups have a prominent impact on the foetus’s neurodevelopment. And that affected infant behavior. Liu found that infants whose mothers had been highly stressed due to the storm were, on average, less active and had greater difficulty adjusting to new people and environments. The results of that study were published by the Frontiers in Genetics this year.
Both studies are in line with existing research examining the impact of stress on the health of pregnant people and their children, said Garett Sansom, an environmental epidemiologist at Texas A&M University. But he cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from such relatively small studies. “I think it’s a really good first step to behoove other researchers to begin to look at this more,” he said, adding that he would have wanted to know more about the experiences of the families before Sandy that might have contributed to the results, including access to care or any other environmental justice issues in local communities that worsen public health. As natural disaster events become more common, Sansom said he expects there will be ample opportunity to broaden this field of research. “I think this is something that’s going to be of growing concern in the years and decades to come,” he said.
Today, Izzy Newman is ten years old and in the fifth grade. His mother describes him as active, empathic and happy, but said that he struggles with focusing and sometimes misplaces his belongings. Sporer-Newman recalled that one question in Nomura’s study asked parents if their child said please and thank you. “The answer is absolutely,” said Sporer-Newman. “And meanwhile he’s bouncing, like literally on his feet going, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.’” She said his personality is different compared to her other three boys. He will run a block ahead of the family on walks and they will stroll behind, struggling to keep up with him. Sporer-Newman said she plans to have Izzy tested for ADHD. Such a diagnosis could be an opportunity for early intervention, said Nomura, who led the study published in September. It would help him access certain accommodations, like a quiet room without distractions to take tests, which may help him in school. “In all of his jittery movements, inability to sit still, brilliant mind. We love him. All of our kids are different. We love them each for what they are,” said Sporer-Newman.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/18/study-pregnant-climate-disaster-children-behavior;guardian;environment;2806
5264;5264;Frank Lampard to remain in charge of Everton for FA Cup amid serious doubts;2023-01-04T18:38:21Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Frank Lampard', 'Everton', 'FA Cup', 'Manchester United', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Frank Lampard will be in charge of Everton for their FA Cup third-round tie at Manchester United on Friday amid doubts over his long-term future at Goodison Park. The Everton manager is under severe pressure following a run of eight defeats in 11 matches in all competitions and one win from 10 Premier League games.
After the latest, a shambolic 4-1 home defeat by Brighton on Tuesday, Lampard said a decision on his future was beyond his control with Everton hovering one point and one place above the relegation zone. They dropped into the bottom three after results on Wednesday night. Lampard arrived at Everton’s Finch Farm training complex early on Wednesday morning and took a warm-down training session as planned in the afternoon. His press conference to preview the FA Cup tie will also go ahead as scheduled on Thursday. The 44-year-old held talks with the director of football, Kevin Thelwell, and chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, at Finch Farm, although that was part of a pre-planned visit by the pair and it is the club’s owner, Farhad Moshiri, who will ultimately decide whether to seek the eighth permanent manager of his chaotic tenure. Lampard is acutely aware he needs a reaction at Old Trafford, and to avoid a repeat of the heavy defeat against Brighton, to buy time before two critical league games against fellow strugglers Southampton and West Ham.
There is an acceptance at Everton that the team’s forward options must be improved this month, with Richarlison sold in the summer, Dominic Calvert-Lewin restricted to six starts this season by injury and new signings Neal Maupay and Dwight McNeil failing to have an effect. The dreadful run of results, however, that culminated in fans turning on the board and their own players at Goodison on Tuesday, has cast doubt on how much longer Lampard will have to work with any new signings with Everton ensconced in another relegation battle.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/frank-lampard-to-remain-in-charge-of-everton-for-fa-cup-amid-serious-doubts;guardian;sports;5264
1512;1512;MPs to recall Royal Mail boss to parliament to face questions;2023-01-24T16:06:25Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Royal Mail', 'UK news', 'Business'];;"The chief executive of Royal Mail is to face a rare recall to parliament to face questions over the accuracy of evidence he gave to a committee of MPs. Simon Thompson, Royal Mail’s boss, has been summoned back by the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, after giving evidence in a sometimes testy exchange last week. The rare recall of a witness by a parliamentary committee is likely to increase pressure on Thompson, who is already having to deal with a long-running and bitter dispute with workers over pay and working conditions, as well as a recent ransomware attack that crippled Royal Mail’s deliveries from the UK to other countries. In a letter to Thompson published on Tuesday, the Labour MP Darren Jones, the committee’s chair, wrote: “Following the session, I received a significant amount of correspondence from Royal Mail employees across the country, challenging some of the statements you made to the committee. The committee is now not confident that all the answers you gave during the session were wholly accurate.” Thompson gave testimony to MPs last Tuesday. The committee raised concerns over the accuracy of his evidence on whether the company punished workers on the basis of evidence of productivity-tracking devices, whether workers were instructed to prioritise parcels over letters, and over the extent of sick pay. Jones said: “Since Mr Thompson appeared before the committee last week we’ve had significant quantities of evidence that suggest his answers may not have been wholly correct. “Giving inaccurate information to a parliamentary committee, whether by accident or otherwise, is taken very seriously. We must get to the bottom of these inconsistencies on behalf of parliament and intend to do so during this additional hearing.”
More than 100,000 workers represented by the Communications Workers Union (CWU) have taken strike action on 18 days in the last year, with seven days in December alone that included Christmas Eve. The union sent out ballot papers on Monday to members to renew its mandate for further strike action. Royal Mail restarted deliveries of international items last week, after a week of disruption that caused a huge backlog of undelivered items. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “We welcome the opportunity to expand on any points on which the committee would like clarification, and share the steps we are taking to resolve this dispute and secure the long-term future of Royal Mail for our people and customers. “As the CWU launches its third ballot for industrial action today, we are seeing an increasingly false narrative circulating on our pay and change dispute,” the spokesperson said. “This is designed to create fear and uncertainty among our employees as the CWU builds support for further damaging strikes, instead of focusing on agreeing a deal to deliver what our customers need and give a pay rise to our people who have already lost about £1,800 each after 18 days of strikes.” A CWU spokesperson said the union welcomed the decision to recall Thompson and added that the allegations “deserve to be treated with the utmost seriousness”. “Politicians tasked by voters to conduct scrutinising work with the greatest possible knowledge and clarity have grave concerns about Simon Thompson’s evasive conduct,” the spokesperson said.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/24/mps-to-recall-royal-mail-boss-to-parliament-to-face-questions;guardian;business & economy;1512
3303;3303;Happy Valley recap: series three, episode three – that confrontation scene deserves Baftas;2023-01-15T22:00:24Z;['Michael Hogan'];['Television', 'Happy Valley', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Sarah Lancashire', 'Sally Wainwright', 'Drama'];;"Spoiler alert: this recap is published after Happy Valley airs on BBC One in the UK. Do not read on if you haven’t watched episode three. By ’eck, Sarge, what an enthralling hour of TV. The series reached its midway mark with little green men and large trouserless ones. Here’s your team briefing on the third episode … Table for two by the window Last week climaxed with Sgt Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) confronting her sister Clare (Siobhan Finneran) about the betrayal over the prison visits. Here, we were flung straight back to that Sheffield cafe. Clare’s “moderately interesting-looking sandwich” turned to dust in her mouth as Catherine simmered with rage about her secretly taking her grandson Ryan (Rhys Connah) to see Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) in the nearby Category-A clink (actually HMP Wakefield, as spotted by eagle-eyed commenters). Catherine’s righteous fury was all the more potent for being expressed in hushed tones. As tears rolled down her cheeks, she listed Tommy’s heinous crimes against the family. Clare, a bundle of guilt, was soon crying, too. Who needs stunts, CGI or exotic locations when you’ve got Sally Wainwright’s script and two actors at the top of their game?
It emerged that Ryan had been writing to his incarcerated biological father since he was 10, but only in the past year had Bad Jesus – recently transferred to Sheffield – been able to pass a message to his son, via an ex-con. Ryan had then asked Clare’s boyfriend, Neil Ackroyd (Con O’Neill), to escort him on a prison visit. “Soft, weak” Neil had agreed, which Catherine later speculated could be linked to him losing access to his own teenage children due to alcoholism. When Neil confessed all to Clare after the first visit, she had tried to put a stop to it, but Ryan had a meltdown, never having been told the full extent of Tommy’s monstrousness. Clare had accompanied them the next time, to reassure herself there was nothing untoward going on – apart from a multiple murderer manipulating an impressionable teenager, that is – and consequently allowed the trips to continue. She naively believed it wasn’t just a journey of self-discovery for Ryan, but could also help rehabilitate Tommy. She begged the bewildered, blazing Catherine not to let it come between them. Fat chance. What a devastating scene that 11-minute two-hander was. Baftas and Café Amico carrot cake all round. Center Parcs: Spanish Branch
Beaming, bouncing and calling him “buddy”: Tommy was so visibly thrilled by Ryan’s visit that it was almost sweet. Does he have some hold or leverage over Neil? He certainly spoke like he did, brusquely ordering the flaky third wheel to “go and get the tea and biscuits”. When Neil mentioned Catherine’s name and Tommy bridled, he sheepishly apologised. Not just weak; positively cowed. Tommy advised Ryan to stand up to bullies (the irony), asked him to come to his impending murder trial (how wholesome) and hatched pipe-dream plans to go skydiving or bungee jumping together someday. Neil posited that such pie-in-the-sky ideas were “self-kidology” to keep him going during his lifelong sentence. Or was he planning to escape abroad with Ryan and make them reality? Alexa, what’s Spanish for bungee? ‘Who’s rattled your cage, grandmother?’ When Catherine stormed out of the cafe, swearing under her breath, she saw a brief, haunting vision of her daughter, Becky, who killed herself 15 years ago. She gasped, winded by grief, before banging her head on a shop window to banish such thoughts and striding off. Never underestimate the power of a no-nonsense mam on a mission. She confided in her ex-husband, Richard (Derek Riddell), about how she had planned to tell Ryan about “that shitpot” when he turned 18 and let him make his own choices, while making clear it was her or Tommy. Now, she gave him the same ultimatum two years early. In the meantime, Ryan sofa-surfed at Clare and Neil’s – an arrangement that couldn’t last in their bijou flat with noisy neighbours. Endearingly, Ryan’s best mate, Cesco (Freddy Smith), said he could move in with him. Well, until his mother swiftly kiboshed the idea: “No bloody way!” During a doorstep handover, Catherine explained that Tommy had a “a kink in his brain, a psychological deformity” but it wasn’t “necessarily hereditary”. Reassuring herself as much as Ryan, you felt. She stopped short of telling him how his mother had died, let alone why, but Ryan soon had the former confirmed by Clare. A lovely human touch how, even amid such a momentous chat, they broke off for brief chats about gaming and his tea going cold. “What you having?” “Stew.” “That’ll be all right.” The ripples from Ryan’s prison visits soon spread. PC Ann Gallagher (Charlie Murphy) – whom Tommy “abducted, terrorised and raped for the best part of a week” in series one – was seriously shaken and having flashbacks to her ordeal. “Shit timing,” with her starting her CID secondment the next day. Her father, Nevison (George Costigan), and her partner, Daniel (Karl Davies), rallied around. Is it too shallow to mention how their period pile looks a stunner? [Googles property prices in Calder Valley.] Caught with his trousers down Remember the woman who fell to her death from a fourth floor window last week? We learned that she was 28-year-old Danielle, who was registered blind and trying to escape from her own flat. Gangsters had used it to stash dirty money; when Danielle had realised, they had locked her in the bedroom and kept her hostage for weeks. When she made a desperate bid for freedom, the captor who had posed as her boyfriend, Josip (Anthony Skrimshire), was caught on CCTV leaving with two rucksacks – presumably as much of the cash as he could carry. CID had his address under observation and prepared to swoop.
Except they weren’t the only ones. Enforcers Ivan (Oliver Huntingdon) and Matija (Jack Bandeira) had recruited Josip. Now their boss, Viktor (Anthony Flanagan), said “the chief” (presumably the “respectable businessman” Darius Knezevic) had ordered them to kill Josip “before the Feds get to him”. Cue Line of Duty-esque convoy scenes as police and gangsters converged on the same address. The Feds won the race. Josip fled into the loft, climbed through to next door and fled, Catherine gave chase, grappling him on the ground when he tripped. As his trousers fell down farcically, Josip bloodied her nose with his elbow. “Fuck you, buster,” snarled Catherine, channelling all her frustration into two wince-inducing punches before arresting him for false imprisonment and money laundering. As Ivan and Matija watched aghast, Catherine spotted them circling the block and noted down their licence plate. Either they or Josip had been on the take. There had been £70,000 in the flat. Police found only £40,000. “Man, we are fucking dead,” muttered Matija. Talking of which … From Mr Bean to Dr Death As predicted by his abused wife, Joanna (Mollie Winnard), last week, PE teacher Rob Hepworth (Mark Stanley) flipped from bad cop to good cop by offering Ryan a shoulder to cry on. Across town, Jo – bearing fresh bruises again – and permaflustered pharmacist Faisal Bhatti (Amit Shah) pressed “go” on their plot to kill Rob. If the clumsiness with which Faisal snuck around to see his partner-in-crime was any indication, stumbling and bumbling like the world’s worst ninja, it wouldn’t exactly be the perfect murder. So it proved.
The pair hatched a plan for Jo to drug her husband’s Friday night drink. Once he was unconscious, Faisal would inject a fatal air bubble into his bloodstream, then drive the corpse to Huddersfield’s red light district in Rob’s car and dump it at a roadside, making it look as if he had drunkenly gone kerb-crawling and met his end. Shit got a bit too real for Jo, who back-pedalled and admitted she had lied. Rob didn’t know it was Faisal who had been illegally supplying her with diazepam. Faisal was incandescent that she had almost tricked him into murder. As they clashed, he impulsively grabbed a rolling pin from the kitchen counter and bludgeoned her. Anyone else reminded of Adeel Akhtar and Joanna Froggatt in Sherwood? As Jo lay twitching on the floor, Catherine left an answerphone message about the lab analysis results on the seized pills, further spooking Faisal. “Shit timing” again. He produced a syringe to finish off poor Jo. Her husband would be prime suspect. Not only had Catherine seen evidence of coercive control, but Hepworth had told Ryan “my marriage isn’t a happy one”. It couldn’t happen to a nicer bloke. Line of the week “What a fucking mess” – Clare’s pithy summary of the family situation. Notes and observations Was the subplot about UFO sightings merely comic relief, or might those strange lights in the sky prove significant? Drug-runners or people-traffickers, perhaps? Last week’s episode was scheduled against ITV’s Prince Harry interview, beating it in the ratings by more than a million. Yorkshire 1, Sussex 0. The emotional tête-à-tête between Catherine and Richard culminated in him apologising for leaving her 15 years ago. Never too late for a reconciliation … Just me, or was Catherine’s civilian colleague Joyce (Ishia Bennison) looking over her shoulder at the lab report with a little too much interest? Bent or nosy? Ivan has twice mentioned his imminent wedding – the day after Tommy’s court date in Leeds. There are rarely wasted details in Wainwright scripts. Will Ryan really choose psycho-dad over robo-gran? Is the net closing on the Knezevic crime empire? Will Lakeland see a spike in sales of marble rolling pins?

4939;4939;Ministers could help the patients dying in NHS hospital corridors right now – they just choose not to | Rachel Clarke;2023-01-06T12:43:39Z;['Rachel Clarke'];['NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Politics', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Conservatives'];;"With NHS staff being forced to witness our patients dying in corridors, in cupboards, on floors and in stranded ambulances, we can only thank our lucky stars that the country’s second most powerful politician is the man who last year published Zero: Eliminating Unnecessary Deaths in a Post-Pandemic NHS. Because the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, cannot possibly stand back and permit these crisis conditions to continue, can he? He knows better than anyone – having written 320 pages on precisely this fact – that avoidable deaths are the very worst kinds of death, the ones that sicken families and clinicians to their core.
Let’s remind ourselves of how strongly Hunt feels about this subject. The blurb of his book, published only last May, rings out with moral righteousness. “How many avoidable deaths are there in the NHS every week?” he asks. “150. What figure should we aim for? Zero. Mistakes happen. But nobody deserves to become a statistic in an NHS hospital. That’s why we need to aim for zero.” He even offers a road map towards achieving that end that, unusually for a politician, centres on radical candour. Don’t lie. Don’t deflect. Don’t spin. Don’t cover up. Be honest and open about mistakes and failures because this is the first, essential step to fixing them. To the collective despair of frontline staff, the government’s actual, as opposed to rhetorical, response to the humanitarian crisis gripping the NHS is a perverse inversion of everything the chancellor purports to hold dear. First, Downing Street tried to ignore it. The day after the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), Adrian Boyle, estimated that between 300 and 500 people were dying avoidable deaths every week as a result of the total collapse of emergency services, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, was chirpily tweeting about the merits of parkrun. Next, the government tried denial, with one of Rishi Sunak’s spin doctors flatly refusing to accept the assertion that the NHS was in crisis. Perhaps to them, political spinning seems like a game. But as someone who has to hear the moans and face the anguish, I would say that attempting to dismiss real people’s avoidable deaths – their actual, unnecessary experiences of misery, indignity and terminal suffering – is a form of dishonesty so stone-cold disgraceful it shouldn’t come within a million miles of government. Mercifully, for sheer no-nonsense, evidence-based pushback against the facile denials churned out by the government, Boyle and the RCEM vice-president Ian Higginson – both of whom are frontline emergency consultants – have been outstanding. Take Higginson’s recent turn on Times Radio immediately after the government’s efforts to discredit those figures for avoidable deaths. The association between delayed inpatient admission and increased mortality is well established. One study shows that for every 82 patients whose inpatient bed transfer is delayed beyond six to eight hours from arrival in the emergency department, approximately one extra death occurs. So Higginson rightly condemned the unedifying “battle of machismo and denial going on” before politely posing the following – devastating – question: “Is there an acceptable number [of avoidable deaths] that our colleagues in NHS organisations and politicians are seeking? Or do we simply accept that right now patients are dying waiting for ambulances, in car parks, outside hospitals?… This is a real problem that affects real people every day of the week.” Hunt, of course, has already provided the answer to Higginson’s first question. Zero. Zero is the acceptable number of avoidable deaths in the NHS. So how – why – are we here yet again in the wretched situation of frontline staff trying to tell the truth about patient harm while political leaders with the power actually to do something about those harms focus instead on managing optics? The government claims it has given the NHS all the funding it needs. It hasn’t. Sunak stated in his new year speech this week that since September, “we’ve put half a billion pounds into what’s called early discharge, to help move people into the community this winter”. He hasn’t. Only £200m – 40% – of that emergency funding has actually been given to the NHS and local authorities. The remaining £300m has not materialised and will not be disbursed until, possibly, late January. With one in seven hospital beds across England occupied by medically fit patients without the care packages they need to safely leave hospital, that is unforgivable. Because every bed space we can possibly release is quite literally a matter of life and death for the patients at home with heart attacks and strokes waiting for ambulances that never come. Be under no illusions. If it wanted to, the government could reduce the avoidable death toll this minute. It could fund the block booking of care home beds – as it did during Covid – to discharge thousands of medically fit patients from hospitals. It could mobilise an emergency crisis force of volunteer carers to help support patients at home after discharge. It could end the insanity of the pension trap for senior doctors that forces consultants to cut back their hours unwillingly or else face punitive six-figure tax bills. Above all – if it cared about the endemic burnout and hopelessness that propels so many desperate staff these days into quitting the NHS they used to cherish – it could once, just once, break its 12-year obsession with curating NHS headlines, and tell the truth. Because the chancellor is right. Nobody deserves to become a statistic in an NHS hospital. Yet through their collective inaction at a time when so many patients’ lives are actively imperilled, Hunt, Barclay and Sunak have all made it perfectly clear that when push comes to shove, only the right type of avoidable death really matters. The ones caused by political choices? Come on. Not only are those ones irrelevant, they don’t even exist at all.
