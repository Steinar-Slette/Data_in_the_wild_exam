A Supreme Court justice's wife expressed regret for her texts fanning conspiracies about the 2020 presidential election - in one among dozens of witness transcripts rushed out in the final days of activity by a congressional inquiry into last year's riot at the US Capitol.
The committee is racing to make the disclosures this week before it is expected to be disbanded by Republicans when they take over the House of Representatives in four days.
Former President Donald Trump, a Republican, has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"".
His son, Donald Trump Jr; his son-in-law Jared Kushner; former adviser Stephen Miller; his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson were among the 56 witnesses featured in this week's disclosures.
The committee placed the blame for the riot squarely on Mr Trump's shoulders when they released their final, 845-page report last week; many of their conclusions were based on the interviews they are now publishing in full. Taken together, the new transcripts show a White House in disarray after Mr Trump lost the election, and paralysed into inaction as his supporters laid siege to the Capitol on 6 January 2021.
Here are a selection of interesting details from the committee's interviews with Mr Trump's family members, aides and allies.
The panel released interviews with right-wing activists and candidates who had backed Mr Trump's false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him.
One of them, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a conservative operative and wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, came under intense scrutiny after the Washington Post and CBS News reported that she had texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows urging them to continue challenging the election results.
Her texts raised ethical concerns over the wife of a Supreme Court justice engaging in partisan activity.
""I regret all of these texts,"" Ms Thomas told the January 6 committee when interviewed about these communications.
""It was an emotional time,"" she said. ""I was probably just emoting, as I clearly was with Mark Meadows somewhat.""
In her testimony, she told the committee that, ""I worried that there was fraud and irregularities that distorted the election but it wasn't uncovered in a timely manner, so we have President Biden.""
US media had previously reported on Mr Meadows' alleged practice of burning documents.
Stephanie Grisham, the former chief of staff for Melania Trump, testified that the first lady pushed back against a suggestion that she invite her incoming successor, Jill Biden, to the White House for tea. 
Instead, she testified, Mrs Trump wanted to be on the ""same page"" as the president's office, which was resisting some transition efforts.
During the attack, Mrs Trump also refused to send a tweet that encouraged her husband's supporters to engage in ""peaceful protest"" and not ""lawlessness and violence"", Ms Grisham told investigators.
Ms Grisham also gave insight into Mr Trump's actions while the riot unfolded.
She told investigators that she had ""heard from several people in the West Wing"" that Mr Trump ""was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments - some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were"".
""He was kind of revelling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn't like how they looked,"" Ms Grisham said.

The transcripts show the source material for many significant revelations, which trickled out steadily throughout the 18-month investigation and during 10 high-profile hearings this year.
For instance, in a newly released transcript, White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, said she had seen her boss, chief of staff Mark Meadows, burn documents in his office fireplace between December 2020 and January 2021.
Ms Hutchinson, who provided some of the inquiry's most damning testimony about 6 January, said she did not know what the documents contained.
With the committee likely to disband in the coming days, it remains to be seen how much more of their trove of evidence they will make public before the new Congress begins on 3 January, 2023.

With landmark albums from Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny and Rosalía, 2022 was a year where the globe's biggest artists stretched the boundaries of what was possible in pop music.
But it was also a year marked by incredible laziness and craven opportunism. 
Sampling came back in a big way but not a clever one. Classic hits were used as a crutch for weak songwriting, often lifted wholesale instead of being re-contextualised or used as a launchpad for something more inventive. 
David Guetta and Bebe Rexha did it on I'm Good - a pointless remake of Eifel 65's Europop irritant Blue (Da Ba Dee) that was somehow more of a dumpster fire than the original. 
They weren't the only culprits: Nicki Minaj rapped listlessly over Rick James' Superfreak; Central Cee turned Eve's Blow Your Mind into a genuinely unpleasant track called Doja; and Yung Gravy tried to turn Never Gonna Give You Up into a banging rap anthem. He failed.
But we're not here to talk about the year's worst songs. Let's celebrate the best. 
Normally, I compile the BBC's year-end list by averaging the polls published by major music magazines and prominent critics. This year, I caught the flu and ran out of time to crack open the spreadsheet, so here's my personal list.
It's by no means definitive - with 60,000 songs uploaded to Spotify every day, I've listened to a fraction of a fraction of the music that was released in 2022. I've also tried to make the songs work as a playlist, so the rankings are somewhat arbitrary. But enough excuses. Let's play some music.
Warning: Some of the following songs contain language that readers may find offensive.
Who else but Rina Sawayama would have taken a rant about homophobic Christian conservatives and turned it into a sparkling country-pop song with multiple key changes and nods to Shania Twain? 
Crammed with witty one-liners (""damned for eternity, but you're coming with me""), it had a cheeky, light touch that the rest of Sawayama's overwrought second album sometimes lacked. Plus, she had the song blessed by Abba. What's not to love?
Honestly, this could have been any song from Beyoncé's seventh album, Renaissance - a dancefloor fantasia that honours the black, queer lineage of house and disco. 
It's a record that ripples with joy - for life, for music, for movement, for the very act of being Beyoncé - and Cuff It is the album's most accessible cut. Powered by a Nile Rodgers guitar riff, it's a post-pandemic anthem about the excitement of preparing for a night out that's also somehow about Beyoncé's expertise in the bedroom.
Euphoric and funky, it's even better in the context of the album, where it lands in the middle of a four-song sequence that hasn't been bettered all year: Alien Superstar, Cuff It, Energy and Break My Soul.
Often, the biggest hits of the year are bold and primary coloured - whether its Psy's Gangnam Style or Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe. This year, not so much.
As It Was is a vapour trail of a song, silvery and airborne, as Harry Styles searches for meaning amidst break-ups and loneliness and personal turmoil. 
There's no big catharsis or sense of resolution, just a feeling of quiet acceptance - and perhaps that's what made it such an inescapable hit. There's a sense that we're all just getting on with life after the upheavals of the last few years, and Styles' soothing meditation is the perfect soundtrack.
Sometimes you wonder how much mileage is left in Taylor Swift writing songs about Taylor Swift, and then she comes out with something as self-deprecating and funny as Anti-Hero and all is forgiven.
From acknowledging that she disguises her narcissism as altruism ""like some kind of congressman"" to imagining her own murder, Anti-Hero is a parody of self-mythology that hinges on one of the year's most meme-able lyrics.
""It's me, hi! I'm the problem, it's me!""
The scene-setting opener to Rosalía's riotous third album, Motomami, Saoko growls and purrs and constantly contorts over its two-minute running time.
Dripping with attitude, the song is about the Spaniard's refusal to conform. ""Una mariposa, yo me transformo,"" she sings. ""A butterfly, I transform"".
Underneath, the music shifts with her, from hip-hop to reggaeton, with a jazz piano break and chopped up vocal samples. A thrilling, fearless record that informed everything else Rosalía released in 2022.
Returning after a five-year break, US rock band Paramore have lost none of their energy or bite. 
""If you have an opinion / maybe you should shove it,"" Hayley Williams sings, simultaneously seething and exhausted at a divided world.
""Whether it's racism, or conspiracy theories… I think about how the internet is supposed to be this great connector, but drives us further inward and further apart,"" she told the LA Times. ""I've watched people be so awful to each other. How could we go through these things together and come out worse?"" 
The song has no answers. In fact, Williams retreats even further. ""This is why I don't leave the house,"" she sings in the chorus. 
But when that house contains guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro on supremely funky form, why would anyone venture outside?
Anxiety is an unrelenting master that has plagued Florence Welch her entire life.
In Free, she depicts it as a bored child, picking her up and putting her down, chewing her up and spiting her out ""a hundred times a day"".
Tempted to dull her senses with medication, she instead finds release in music. As the song's nervous, ticking beat fades and the music swells, she declares: ""For a moment, when I'm dancing, I am free.""
Rema's Calm Down was a major hit in Africa earlier this year, crossing over to the US and UK after Selena Gomez added a verse for this remix.
The lyrics are based on a true story. Nigerian star Rema fell for a girl at a party, but her friends stopped him from getting too close. In the song, he's still trying to seduce her. She's inviting, but remains in control: ""Wanna give you it all but can't promise that I'll stay / And that's the risk that you take.""
Sweet and seductive, the song is one of several Afrobeats tracks to make an impact in 2022, alongside Burna Boy's Last Last and Fireboy DML's Peru. 
With a tip of the hat to James Brown, Payback is the strutting, funky highlight of Kojey Radical's Mercury Prize-nominated album Reasons To Smile.
A hymn to black excellence, it also sees the 29-year-old staking his claim to be one of the UK's best rappers, as he declares: ""Black lists, black skin couldn't hold me down / A black queen gave birth to a golden child.""
Less than eight weeks after winning the Mercury Prize for her 2021 album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, Little Simz dropped a new record with little-to-no warning.
But rather than a victory lap, No Thank You seemed to be an angry response towards the music industry itself. 
""They don't care if your mental is on the brink of something dark / As long as you're cutting somebody's payslip,"" she fumed on the opening track, Angel.
Gorilla is mellower, full of brass fanfares and a slinky bassline lifted from Jurassic 5's classic Concrete Schoolyard (which in turn samples Ramsey Lewis' Summer Breeze), but it contains that same surging confidence. 
""Name one time where I didn't deliver,"" Simz demands. There's no answer.
You can listen to a playlist of all 25 songs in this list on the following streaming services:
Cutting people out of your life is healthy. That's the message from Rebecca Lucy Taylor, aka Self Esteem, on this percussive declaration of self-preservation.
The ex who gets back in touch? The friend who undermines your confidence? Stop giving them your precious time.
""If it feels like someone is taking [liberties], they usually are,"" she explained. ""Not to be all 'you deserve better' about it but it's very likely you do, indeed, deserve better.""
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' first new song in almost a decade, Spitting Off The Edge Of The World is a smouldering, sleazy song of comeuppance for politicians who put profit ahead of the climate catastrophe.
""Cowards, here's the sun,"" drawls Karen O. ""Melting [your] houses of gold.""
The droning guitars and crashing drums constantly threaten to collapse on themselves, as though the world is juddering to a halt even as O sings. 
Apocalypse never sounded so thrilling.
As declarations of love go, ""I'm a bullet in a shotgun waiting to sound"", is pretty extreme. But Sophie Allison, aka US indie musician Soccer Mommy, stands by it. ""Beauty and pain tend to coincide, as do beauty and ugliness,"" she told Pitchfork. ""Love is hard even when it's easy"". 
That tension gives Shotgun a tangible realism. The itchy, lo-fi verses capture the banality of a long-term relationship (""I like dessert and alcohol and watching you as you get drunk"") before the chorus blossoms into a dreamy, loved-up hook. 
Because love is always there, you just have to pull the trigger.
It may have been recorded in London, but Pull Up is steeped in the sun-kissed vibes of Koffee's hometown of Spanish Town, Jamaica.
The laid-back Afrobeats track finds the singer arriving for a night out in a succession of luxury cars, flexing her status while setting her sights on one particular party-goer.
Breezy and infectious, it's a perfect encapsulation of Koffee's positive spirit and ear for melody.
Originally released in 2020, Cat Burns' anguished break-up anthem became a viral hit on TikTok at the start of the year, earning the singer a platinum record, a support slot with Ed Sheeran and a Brit Award nomination.
""My brain just cannot compute that [the song] is at that level. It's mind-boggling,"" she told the NME - but the success was well-deserved.
Where other break-up songs channel anger or despair, Burns' richly-observed lyrics convey the disbelief of someone who's been betrayed by the one person they should have been able to trust. Devastating.
Of the millions of people who got through heartbreak this year by listening to Soy El Unico, very few will have realised it was created by a 13-year-old who'd never written a song before.
Yahritza Martinez, from Mexico's Yakima Valley, was inspired after seeing other people's relationship dramas on TikTok - and one line in particular stuck with her.
""It was, 'Oh, you're not gonna find anybody better than me.' That's where I got the idea from,"" she told the LA Times.
When the singer (now aged 16) and her brothers uploaded a snippet of the song to their own TiKTok account in February, it swept through people's For You pages, eventually topping the US Latin songs chart. Since then, the break-up ballad has amassed 69 million views on YouTube, as fans fall in love with the trio's stripped-down take on Música Mexicana. 
Has a record ever been more aptly titled than Escapism? 
Released independently after Raye extricated herself from a record label that refused to let her release a debut album, this single broke all the rules of modern pop. It's long, it's messy, it changes tempo half-way through. 
And yet, it became the singer's first ever top 10 hit as a solo artist, because every single one of those choices was driven by the emotional arc of the song, not some boardroom-driven formula.
""I feel on top of the world right now,"" Raye told the BBC at the Mobo Awards. ""I could throw up. I feel like I'm in a simulation, it doesn't feel real.""
You know all that stuff I said about 2022 being a terrible year for sampling, and songwriters relying on nostalgia for easy streams? Here's where that argument goes out the window.
In what she jokingly referred to as her ""major label sell-out"" era, Charli XCX took September's 2006 Europop hit Cry For You and transformed it from a boilerplate break-up song into a story of lust and obsession.  
The desperation of those lyrics combines with the insistent, unrelenting synth lines to create a more compelling, full-blooded song than the original. It's a masterclass in updating a classic.
Fourth place at Eurovision, Sweden was robbed.
With a stone-cold beat and a blown-out bass line, Cash In Cash Out was a blistering comeback for Pharrell, even if it stalled at number 73 in the UK charts.
21 Savage takes the opening verse, bragging that ""Pharrell made this so it's a million dollar beat""; before Tyler takes over with the surreal couplet: ""I hit the beach in a furry hat / She got a guy but she purrin' back"".
Both stars are at the top of their game, tossing out one-liners and switching flows on the fly. ""It's like lettin' two pit bulls loose, you know?"" Pharrell told Apple Music. 
I wavered over whether to include this. It's not exactly cool to like Lewis Capaldi, I guess. But there's something about the way he sings - the conviction in his voice, and the naked candour of the lyrics: ""I'd rather hear how much you regret me... than forget me"".
When it came on the radio, I always left it on and if I was on my own, I'd even sing along. Which is about the best litmus test for a pop song I can imagine.
Plus, you have to admire anyone who accepts a music video pitch that goes: ""It's your song, but we do a shot-for-shot recreation of Club Tropicana"". 
The best Taylor Swift song by an artist who isn't Taylor Swift since Olivia Rodrigo became a breakout star in (checks notes)... Oh God, was that only last year?
Chappell Roan is a rising star from Missouri, whose breakout song is a candid account of a relationship that's going nowhere. 
She's a little more blunt than Swift (don't play the chorus to your mum) but anyone who's ever been told, ""I'm not ready to tell people we're together"", by someone who's simultaneously happy to go to bed with you, will be fully on her side.
""Beauty is a knife that I'm holding by the blade / Swallowing my pride so I won't eat anything.""
On Dying On The Inside, Nessa Barrett sings with unflinching honesty about the eating disorder that's plagued her since she was 12 years old. 
Smart and self-aware, she observes how the media's emphasis on beauty and size only compounds her problems - with people complimenting her appearance when she's actively unwell.
It's a song that changes your perspective by inviting you inside a mental illness. Barrett, who is receiving treatment, says she cried when she finished it - and hopes the song will help others too.
""I want to remind them that they're not alone,"" she told Nylon. ""I want everyone to know that they are beautiful no matter what, and that it's unfair for them to put so much pressure on themselves. And that I know how hard that is.""
Kieran Hebden, aka Four Tet, aka KH, had quite the summer. Not only did he win a long-running royalties battle against Domino Records, but he dropped one of the biggest dance anthems of the year.
Looking At Your Pager is an absolute dancefloor monster, that flips a sample of American girl group 3LW onto a gnarly electronic bassline that sounds like a lawnmower devouring a power station.
First previewed at a live show in 2021, the song lingered in a copyright battle as fans begged Hebden for an official release. Then, in April, he took to Instagram with the phrase ""the sample has been cleared"" - and the song of the summer was born. Well, almost...
Dance music came back with a vengeance in 2022 - with hits by LF System, Nia Archives and Fred Again cross-contaminating club nights and daytime radio.
The biggest, and baddest, of them all was Eliza Rose's BOTA, which bolted a feel-good vocal hook onto the syrupy keyboard riff from 90s house classic Let The Beat Hit 'Em.
Released in the middle of the heatwave, it eventually hit number one in mid-September, when it was finally safe to play without melting the dancefloor.

10;['Benedict: The pope who resigned from the papacy'];['2022-12-31T10:02:29.000Z'];['BBC News'];['the vatican'];['pope', 'benedict', 'papacy', 'world', 'resigned', 'withdraw', 'simply', 'sorry', 'speech', 'remarks', 'seen', 'regarding', 'outraged'];"
Benedict XVI was already 78 when he became Pope in 2005. Age and ill health quickly took their toll, prompting his resignation less than eight years later. 
No other pope had stepped down since Gregory XII in 1415 and Benedict was the first to do so voluntarily since Celestine V in 1294.
When he became 265th Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church it was the culmination of the rapid, and highly controversial, rise of Joseph Ratzinger.
Supporters portrayed him as a highly intellectual man who laboured to protect the spiritual inheritance bequeathed to him by Pope John Paul II.
To his critics he was the ultimate exponent and guardian of the Church's dogmatic approach to issues like abortion and contraception. The outrage he sometimes caused seemed typical of a man who was never afraid of upsetting people - if he believed something had to be said or done.
Joseph Aloysius Ratzinger was born into a profoundly Catholic family on 16 April 1927, in the southern German state of Bavaria. He was the son of a police officer with, as he later put it, ""simple country roots"".
His youth was indelibly marked by World War Two. Forced to join the Hitler Youth, he served in an anti-aircraft unit which defended a BMW plant outside Munich.
Later he dug anti-tank trenches before deserting in the dying days of the war. ""In three days of marching, we hiked down the empty highway, in a column that gradually became endless,"" Ratzinger recalled.
""The American soldiers photographed us, the young ones, most of all, in order to take home souvenirs of the defeated army and its desolate personnel.""
From 1946 to 1951, he studied philosophy and theology at Munich University. And, in June 1951, together with his brother Georg, he was ordained a priest.  
After completing a doctorate in theology, Father Ratzinger, as he was, became a university professor, teaching dogma and fundamental theology at a number of places, including Freising, Bonn and Munster.
At the time, Ratzinger was a champion of the reformist liberal agenda that drove the Second Vatican Council. Indeed, after taking up a post at Tübingen University, in southern Germany, in 1966, he became a close friend of the leading liberal theologian, Hans Küng.  
Küng, who brought Ratzinger to Tübingen, would later be barred from teaching by his former colleague, after he rejected papal infallibility.  
And, when 1,360 prominent and radical theologians signed a famous statement in 1968 asserting their freedom to explore the faith, he was among them. The group rejected the Vatican's dominance arguing that Catholics should have the freedom to question the decisions of the Roman Curia - the Vatican departments that help run the Church.
It was the political upheavals of 1968 that led to a dramatic change in Joseph Ratzinger's theological outlook. Student protests, mirroring those in the United States and Paris, broke out in Tübingen: literature branding the Cross as ""a sadomasochistic artefact"" appeared throughout the university and lectures were disrupted by tomato-throwing radicals.
Profoundly shocked by this outbreak of radical theology, which he characterised as ""brutal"", Ratzinger left Tübingen for the more conservative University of Regensburg.
As his former assistant, Wolfgang Beinert, puts it: ""Ratzinger believed that he was in some way responsible, guilty of the chaos, and that the university and society and church were collapsing.""
From that point on, Joseph Ratzinger no longer entertained any thoughts of reforming the Church, of breaking down its rigid hierarchical structure and of encouraging collegiality between the Vatican and Catholic bishops.
Instead, he became an enthusiastic advocate of orthodoxy and continuity, a firm bulwark against dissent in what he considered to be an increasingly disjointed and permissive world.
Joseph Ratzinger became a prime candidate for rapid advancement and it was no surprise when his ideological soul-mate Pope Paul VI appointed him Archbishop of Munich, and then cardinal, in 1977.
The call to Rome was not long in coming. In 1981, Pope John Paul II appointed Ratzinger as prefect of the Vatican's office to protect the purity of Church theology - once known as the notorious Holy Inquisition.
Ratzinger had criticised the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith as ""an all too smoothly functioning [body] which prejudged every question almost before it had come up for discussion"".
But he took to his work with typically energetic enthusiasm. 
During the 1980s, he spearheaded the Church's campaign against ""liberation theology"", a potent blend of Catholicism and Marxism particularly popular in Latin America.
He also took an uncompromising line within the Roman Catholic church. As theological enforcer for Pope John Paul, he had called priests and academics to Rome to explain themselves before requiring them to sign repudiations of their thinking.
Others would be ""silenced"" or even excommunicated. Liberals were appalled, soon nicknaming him the ""Panzerkardinal"", while conservatives viewed Ratzinger's actions with approval.
Later, he would attack what he saw as ""religious relativism"", the belief that no one faith can claim to be the sole vessel of truth or to represent the world's only saviour.
In 2000, he published Domine Iesus (The Lord Jesus), a controversial document that stated, in no uncertain terms, the Roman Catholic Church's view that it was the one true Christian denomination, and that all others were ""deficient"".  
In 2001, he persuaded John Paul to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all allegations of sexual abuse against priests. This had previously been under the control of individual dioceses.
Ratzinger argued that there should be no statute of limitations on such allegations and for a fast-track dismissal of offenders. His determination to tackle the problem ruffled feathers at the Vatican.
Following John Paul's death in April 2005, it was Cardinal Ratzinger, as Dean of the College of Cardinals, who presided over the funeral Mass, delivering the homily, based around Christ's words ""follow me"".
Days later, that is exactly what he did, triumphing in the papal conclave after a mere four ballots to become the spiritual leader of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics.
His belief in the supremacy of the Catholic church was bound to cause friction and it surfaced in a controversial speech he gave in his native Germany in September 2006.  
Invited back to the University of Regensburg where he'd been a theology professor, he quoted comments by a 14th-Century Christian ruler who had said that the Prophet Muhammad's belief in a Holy war was evil and inhumane.
Although he didn't explicitly endorse the opinion - he did go on to discuss in detailed terms the reasons why spreading faith through violence should be regarded as unacceptable.
Muslims around the world were outraged, regarding the speech as a full-blown attack on their faith - and Pope Benedict was forced to apologise. However, he didn't withdraw the remarks as many had demanded, instead he simply said he was sorry that some of his comments had been seen as offensive.
His expressions of regret failed to convince some commentators, who pointed out that the Pope believed interfaith dialogue was difficult while Christians were denied religious freedom in some Muslim countries.
There was further controversy during the Pope's visit to South America in 2007 when, during a speech in Brazil, he suggested that native populations had been ""silently longing"" for the Christian faith brought by colonisers.
There were protests from many indigenous groups with one organisation claiming that ""representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.""
On his return to Rome the Pope acknowledged that it was not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonisers against the indigenous population. However, he repeated his view that ""Catholicism in South America had favourably shaped their culture for 500 years"".
He was less outspoken during what was seen as a potentially sensitive visit to the Middle East in 2009. On his arrival he made a speech attacking anti-Semitism and later, at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem, he called for the suffering of the victims never to be ""denied, belittled or forgotten"".
But, after meeting the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, he also called for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state with ""internationally recognised borders"".
His state visit to the UK in September 2010, the first ever by a reigning Pope, was an opportunity for him to speak out against the critics of organised religion.
""Today, the United Kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society. In this challenging enterprise, may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate.""
His health had been worsening prior to his election, and the additional burdens of papal office took their toll, although it was only later revealed that he had been fitted with a heart pacemaker in 2005.
On 11 February 2013, he told his cardinals that he would leave office on account of his advancing years and continued ill health. The announcement was made without any warning and delivered, as befitted an academic theologian, in Latin. He was succeeded by the current Pope - Francis I.
Benedict retired to a Mater Ecclesiae monastery located within the Vatican Gardens.  He chose to retain his papal name - rather than revert to being Joseph Ratzinger - but preferred to be known simply as ""Father Benedict"". He had been in declining physical health for a number of years.  
He caused controversy in April 2019, when he blamed clerical sexual abuse - the scandal he had tried to tackle as a cardinal - on ""the all-out"" sexual freedom of the 1960s, and the consequent rejection of God's teaching. 
Three years later, a report commissioned by the Catholic Church accused Benedict of having failed to act to prevent instances of child abuse while archbishop of Munich in the 1970s. The former Pope denied the claims.
An urbane and cultured man, Pope Benedict was an accomplished pianist, with a penchant for Mozart and Brahms. He also spoke eight languages, including German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
Like his mentor, John Paul II, Pope Benedict believed there was a completely Christian alternative to the humanistic philosophies of the 20th Century: Marxism, materialism and liberalism.
But he believed that Christianity's influence would ""rise again like the mustard seed, in insignificantly small groups whose members intensively live in combat with what is evil in the world, while demonstrating what is good.""

The UK government has confirmed passengers arriving in England from China will have to provide a negative Covid test before they board a flight. 
Several countries - including the US, Japan, Italy and Malaysia - are now enforcing testing on visitors from China following the effective ending of Beijing's zero-Covid policy,
But do such restrictions work?
Australia imposed some of the strictest travel restrictions. From 2020, it closed its borders to non-residents and banned Australians from travelling abroad (with a few exceptions). 
Countries such as the UK were more lenient. They required international arrivals to use quarantine hotels and take Covid tests.
After the pandemic began in 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated it didn't generally support travel bans, as they were ""usually not effective"". 
It said: ""Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time.""
After the emergence of the Omicron variant it again warned against blanket travel bans, saying they would not stop the global spread.
""They can adversely impact global health efforts... by dis-incentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data,"" it said. 
The WHO's director general said he was ""very concerned over the evolving situation in China, with increasing reports of severe disease"".
He said that the WHO needed more detailed information to understand the risks created by the situation on the ground in China.
And on Twitter he added: ""In the absence of comprehensive information from China, it is understandable that countries around the world are acting in ways that they believe may protect their populations.""
Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group told BBC News: ""Trying to ban a virus by adjusting what we do with travel has already been shown not to work very well.
""We've seen that with the bans on travel from various countries during the pandemic, that hasn't stopped those viruses travelling around the world eventually.""   
The word ""eventually"" is important here, because studies suggest that travel restrictions tend only to delay the spread of the virus spreading in a country, but cannot keep it out completely.
A report in the British Medical Journal found that international border restrictions could delay the spread by two months.
One of its authors, Dr Karen Grepin from Hong Kong University, told Reality Check: ""We have learned during the pandemic that universal measures, applying to all travellers not just those from certain countries, are more effective than targeted measures, for example against Chinese travellers.
""The only type of travel restrictions that have been shown to be effective during the pandemic are those that involve lengthy quarantine periods and I don't think there is a lot of appetite for such measures at this point.""  
Research published in the journal Nature, in December 2020, said restrictions worked well as Covid first began to spread around the world, but became less effective the later they were introduced.
A study by the WZB Berlin Social Science Center in Germany looking at travel restrictions and death rates in more than 180 countries reached similar conclusions and added:
Another scientist advising the UK government, Prof Mark Woolhouse, told Reality Check that restricting arrivals from China to the UK would not do much to limit the number of Covid cases in this country. 
""We have far too many Covid-19 cases here in the UK at present for imported cases to make a significant contribution,"" he said.
It has also been suggested that restrictions would prevent potential new variants of Covid reaching the UK.
However, if there is such a variant, said Prof Woolhouse, travel restrictions would be too late.
""It will almost certainly have got here already,"" he said,
""Measures could only work if the variant happens to emerge during the period the measures are in place and even then they will only delay, not prevent, the arrival of the variant.""
Besides, a new variant is not more likely to come in from China than from anywhere else in the world. 
""Though China is clearly experiencing a substantial wave there is no reason to suspect that wave will be a crucible for the emergence of new variants,"" said Prof Woolhouse.
""The next variant is at least as likely to emerge from somewhere entirely different - there are currently around four million reported cases per week worldwide (and surely far larger numbers are unreported). So why concentrate only on China?""
However, the WHO has said it is concerned that China is not sharing information about its latest Covid surge, possibly including the emergence of any new variants.
""Targeted border measures against China may be more of a political statement in response to lack of information-sharing than a sincere attempt to promote public health,"" said Catherine Worsnop from the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy.

The identities of the dozens of victims who lost their lives to a deadly US winter storm are emerging as the snow begins to melt. 
Over 60 people died, most of the them in New York's Erie County, home to the state's second largest city, Buffalo. 
A Congolese refugee, a nursing assistant and a grandmother are among the dead. 
Some were found in their cars or on the frigid pavement, and even in the relative safety of their homes. 
Sophia Clay spent Christmas Eve worried and anxious about her brother, William Clay, 56, who had gone missing. 
""If he comes to your door please help him,"" she wrote in a Facebook post that morning. ""Please pray for his safety."" 
Willie Payne, Mr Clay's brother, told NPR it was a shock when he received a call from Sophia later that day. She told Mr Payne that their brother had been found face down in the snow, dead.
Mr Clay died on his birthday. 
Abdul Sharifu, 26, left at midday on Christmas Eve to get shopping for his pregnant wife, family members told local media. He never returned.
Hours after he departed, he was found dead on a pavement. 
Mr Sharifu, a refugee from Democratic Republic of the Congo, was in the middle of rebuilding his life in Buffalo, having fled his war-torn homeland. 
Ali Sharifu, his cousin, told Buffalo News that Mr Sharifu ""was so excited to become a father"" and was working towards buying a home for his growing family. 
Monique Alexander, 52, left home on Christmas Eve, but never made it back, her daughter Casey Maccarone told ABC News.
""She never said where she was going, just that she would be right back,"" Ms Maccarone said.
Hours went by without Ms Maccarone hearing from her mother. She posted a message to a Buffalo blizzard group on Facebook asking if anyone had seen her.
Later she received a phone call from a man who told her he had found her mother's body buried in the snow. 
Ms Maccarone said her mother's death meant losing the ""rock of the family"".
Anndel Taylor, 22, died after being trapped in her car on the Friday before Christmas Eve. 
Ms Taylor was a certified nursing assistant who had moved to Buffalo from Charlotte, North Carolina, to be with her elderly father. 
Driving home from work, she was just minutes away from her destination when she became stranded, relatives told US media.
Ms Taylor had been sending videos of the blizzard to family members from inside her car. But eventually, the communication stopped. 
Her body was found the next day.
Her mother, Brown Steele, told reporters: ""I want to get to the bottom of why the city was unable to help.""
Timothy Murphy, 27, was found by his cousin on Christmas Day, a family member told the New York Times.
The cousin, Steven, chose to visit the house in Lockport, Niagara County, because Mr Murphy wasn't answering phone calls. Neither was Steven's mother, who also lives at the address.
He called 911 after finding Timothy ""cold"" and unresponsive and his mother unconscious.
Mr Murphy was killed when carbon monoxide accumulated in the house after his external furnace was blocked by snow, officials say.

Watch: Barber in Buffalo opens his doors and saves lives in deadly blizzard.
Carolyn Eubanks, 63, had a heart condition and depended on an oxygen machine, her family told Buffalo News.
Her son and his stepbrother travelled to her house to try to rescue her, but a journey that usually takes 10 minutes by car instead took seven hours due to road closures and stuck vehicles. They were eventually able to park two blocks away from Ms Eubanks' home.
As her son, Antwaine Parker, tried to walk her to his car, she collapsed in the snow. Mr Parker banged on a neighbour's door for help.
The strangers rushed out to help Ms Eubanks inside, but she quickly succumbed.
Her body lay in the house for 24 hours before she was taken to a hospital.
The couple ""allowed my mother to rest in peace on their living room floor"", Mr Parker said.
Stanisława Jóźwiak, 73, was an immigrant from Poland who died after her car slid off the road while she was driving to a market in Buffalo, her daughter told the Washington Post.
Her body was found inside her car on Christmas Day.
Her daughter, Edie Syta, told the Post that it's possible her mother did not understand the severity of the storm warnings because she was not fluent in English.
""So many families are going to be broken,"" she tearfully told the newspaper. ""And they're never going to look at Christmas the same.""

14;['How a secret message in a Colombian song gave hostages hope'];['2023-01-01T00:43:58.000Z'];['By Phoebe Hopson and Lucy Wallis'];['farc', 'colombia'];['secret', 'way', 'team', 'threats', 'mr', 'colombian', 'life', 'gave', 'ortíz', 'message', 'hope', 'song', 'received', 'hostages'];"
With its catchy chorus and powerful lyrics, the pop song Better Days hit the airwaves in Colombia in the summer of 2010. But the song contained a hidden message that its creators could only reveal once the top-secret files about its true meaning were declassified. 
""Malaria was an issue. Ticks were everywhere. When you sat down or tried to sleep ants would be crawling on you,"" says retired Maj Gen Luis Herlindo Mendieta Ovalle, who was held captive by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) from 1998-2010. 
""Then there was the fungus,"" he says, ""because of the humidity, fungus would grow on your intimate parts, and we had no medications to treat it.""
During Colombia's 50-year bitter armed conflict, atrocities were committed on both sides. In the early 2000s kidnapping had become a key strategy for the Farc to fund itself. Colombia's transitional justice tribunal estimates that 21,396 people were kidnapped during the conflict.
Army soldiers and police officers were often the main targets. Chained in secret camps in the Colombian jungle, the conditions endured by the hostages were enough to make any person lose hope. 
Rescue missions were dangerous due to the mountainous terrain and, like Gen Mendieta, some security forces hostages had spent several years in captivity.
At the time, Col José Espejo, then a Colombian army communications officer, knew how important morale among troops was to the success of a rescue operation. 
""We desperately wanted to give the military hostages something that they could hold on to, a message of hope that would maintain their spirit and strength, so they could consider the possibility of escape if the opportunity presented itself,"" he says. 
In order to deliver this message he decided to throw out the rule book and instead turned to Juan Carlos Ortíz, the CEO of an advertising agency. Mr Ortíz's government-funded anti-drug campaign had won an award for innovation, but had also attracted the attention of the Farc, for whom the cocaine trade was a lucrative source of income.
Mr Ortíz received death threats from the guerrillas and had to flee to the US with his family to begin a new life there. But he and his team decided to take up the challenge to come up with a way of getting a message of hope to the hostages.
A meeting with army representatives sparked an idea.
""They told us that Colombian soldiers in their basic training are trained [in] Morse code,"" he says. ""We thought, 'Right, how can we communicate with them via Morse code?' It was a true light bulb moment.""
With hostages kept deep in the jungle and communication from the outside world near impossible, creative director, Alfonso Díaz, says they realised they would only be able to get through to them via radio. 
""During this era, a journalist called Herbin Hoyos - who did a lot for all of the hostages - created a programme called 'Voices of the Kidnapped',"" he says, ""to help reduce their feelings of isolation by broadcasting messages from their loved ones to those in captivity.""
Mr Hoyos, who had also been a former hostage of the Farc, died of coronavirus in 2021. His programme was a lifeline for many during the years it aired and seemed like the perfect place to first broadcast the message.
Mr Díaz says they thought about including the Morse code in a joke, with the beeps apparently covering up swear words, but this didn't seem appropriate. Then he had the idea for a song.
Audio producer Carlos Portela says they initially thought of using ""a cheerful vallenato or a salsa"", but realised this might cause ""the listener's mind to wander"". So they decided instead on a sentimental song with emotional lyrics to help the hostages make the link between the song and the Morse code hidden within it.
""The lyrics to Better Days speak of the heart, of the resilience and the strength that the hostages must possess to be able to move forward and not to despair when they are alone,"" says Mr Díaz, who co-wrote the lyrics with Mr Portela.
They enlisted the help of rock singer Angelo, who had come up through the ranks of Colombia's version of the X Factor, and singer and actor Natalia Gutiérrez. 
Mr Portela, along with composer, producer and sound engineer Amaury Hernández, carried out a lot of research into Morse Code, including how many words per minute a person could decipher. They decided to use a synthesizer in the track to help camouflage the message.
The code was inserted in three different places within the song and the team decided to transmit one simple message: ""19 people rescued. You're next. Don't lose hope.""
After eight months, the song was ready for its first broadcast in 2010 on Mr Hoyos's programme and by-passed the commercial stations to play on more than 130 rural stations across Colombia.

Listen to Angelo and Natalia Gutiérrez sing Mejores Dias (Better Days). The Morse code can be heard at 1:31, 2:31 and 3:32
""There are many millions of people who have listened to the song Better Days, but that wasn't our goal,"" says Mr Ortíz. ""Success for us was to be found in small, specific numbers. It was in the chosen few hearing it and understanding it.""
Gen Mendieta, who had been rescued in the same year, helped the mission by appearing on live TV and asking the rebels to give the hostages access to the radio for company.
""Someone once said, 'Whoever has a book is not alone,"" he says, ""and in our case, it was, 'Whoever has a radio is not alone.'""
But with airplay also came the risk that the Farc would decode the hidden message.
""When you consider that the hostages were faced with the possibility of dying in the jungle, far from their families, to take a risk in the area of communications was both valid and important,"" says Col Espejo.
It was not until hostages started to be released over the next few months and years that intelligence about the success of the song came back. Col Espejo says one rescued hostage spoke of hearing the Morse code message in his psychological evaluation and had passed on its meaning to his fellow captives.
""When the news arrived that the song had worked, I walked down the street with such a feeling of joy that I couldn't stop myself from smiling,"" says Mr Portela.
Many of the production team kept their involvement in the song quiet until very recently.
""Can you believe that my family didn't know?"" says Ms Gutiérrez. "" I never said anything to them for years about it because of the confidentiality clause.""
The song also won its creative team a prestigious design award: The Golden Lion from Cannes. 
The political landscape has significantly changed in Colombia since Better Days received its first radio play. In 2016, the Farc signed a landmark peace deal with the Colombian government and thousands of former rebels have demilitarised. But the country still grapples with violence from other armed groups and widespread drug trafficking. 
Colombia still has a long way to go to face many of the atrocities committed during the armed conflict, including those by the army.  
So the song for Col Espejo, now retired, is bittersweet. 
Better Days, though rooted in the past, remains an anthem for the future too.

A man has died in an avalanche on the north face of Ben Nevis. 
Emergency services were made aware of the avalanche at about 15:35 GMT on Friday and the 48-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. 
Another man, 40, suffered serous injuries and was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William. Their next of kin have been informed.
Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, which was dispatched with a helicopter, said the slide was about 600m (1969ft). 
Ben Nevis, which stands at 1,345m (4,413ft), is Britain's highest peak. 
In a Facebook post, the mountain rescue team said the men were found at number two gully and offered their thoughts to the climber's families. 
The post read: ""With the weather creating some challenging conditions the helicopter was limited to the assistance it could offer.
""This meant that we had an extended extrication of the casualties and eight hours after the initial call we delivered the casualty to the Belford Hospital for further assessment and treatment.""
Another climber, Rob Brown, died in an accident on the north face of the mountain in August.

Anita Pointer, from the Grammy-winning Pointer Sisters, has died aged 74, her publicist has announced. 
She died surrounded by her family at her Beverley Hills home in California. 
Her family said they were deeply saddened by her passing. ""Heaven is a more loving beautiful place with Anita there,"" they said in a statement. 
The second oldest of the four sisters, Ms Pointer and her siblings rose to fame with hits including Jump (For My Love) and Fire. 
With a blend of funk, soul and R&B, the group released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Yes We Can Can, a funky tune which called for unity and tolerance at a time of racial unrest in the US, became the album's breakout hit. 
And in 1975, their hit song, Fairytale, won a Grammy award for Best Country Vocal Performance. The win remains a rarity in a category dominated by white acts. 
The group almost disbanded in 1979 after Bonnie Pointer left to pursue a solo career, but the remaining sisters regrouped and went on to shed their previously retro image for a modern pop sound. 
Throughout the 1980s, they remained a powerhouse in the US charts, and their hits, which included He's So Shy, Jump (For My Love) and Neutron Dance, have stood the test of time, remaining heavily streamed to this day. 
But Pointer's personal life was marked by tragedy. In 2003, her only child - Jada Pointer - died from cancer aged just 37. She went on to raise her granddaughter Roxie McKain Pointer. 
Her family said they were ""comforted in knowing she is now with her daughter Jada and her sisters June & Bonnie and at peace"".

The conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its second calendar year. We asked several military analysts how they think events on the ground will unfold in 2023.
Could it conclude in the coming year and how - on the battlefield or at the negotiating table? Or might it grind on to 2024?
Michael Clarke, associate director of the Strategic Studies Institute, Exeter, UK
Those who seek to invade another country anywhere across the great Eurasian steppes are condemned eventually to winter in it. 
Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin all had to keep their armies moving in the face of a steppes winter, and now - his invasion going backwards on the ground - Vladimir Putin is digging his forces in for the winter to await a new Russian offensive in the spring.
Both sides need a pause but the Ukrainians are better equipped and motivated to keep going, and we can expect them to maintain the pressure, at least in the Donbas. 
Around Kreminna and Svatove they are very close to a big breakthrough that would throw Russian forces 40 miles back to the next natural defensive line, close to where their invasion effectively began in February. 
Kyiv will be reluctant to halt when the immediate prize is so great. Ukrainian offensives might, nevertheless, pause down in the south-west, following the recovery of Kherson. 
Crossing over to the east side of the Dnipro river to pressure Russia's vulnerable road and rail links into Crimea might be too demanding. But the possibility of Kyiv launching a surprise new offensive can never be ruled out. 
For 2023, the key determinant will be the fate of Russia's spring offensive. Putin had admitted that about 50,000 of the newly mobilised troops are already at the front; the other 250,000 of those just mobilised are training for next year. 
There is no scope for anything but more war until the fortunes of those new Russian forces are settled on the battlefield. 
A short and unstable ceasefire is the only other prospect. Putin has made it clear he will not stop. And Ukraine has made it clear it is still fighting for its life. 
Andrei Piontkovsky, scientist and analyst based in Washington DC
Ukraine will win by restoring completely its territorial integrity by spring 2023 at the latest. Two factors are shaping this conclusion. 
One is the motivation, determination and courage of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian nation as a whole, which is unprecedented in modern war history.
The other is the fact that, after years of appeasement of a Russian dictator, the West has finally grown up to realise the magnitude of historical challenge it  faces. This is best illustrated by a recent statement by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg.
""The price we pay is in money. While the price the Ukrainians pay is in blood. If authoritarian regimes see that force is rewarded we will all pay a much higher price. And the world will become a more dangerous world for all of us.""
The exact timing of the inevitable Ukrainian victory will be determined by the speed at which Nato can deliver a new game-changing package of military assault weapons (tanks, planes, long-ranged missiles). 
I expect Melitopol will become the key battle point in the coming months (maybe weeks). Having taken over Melitopol, Ukrainians will easily move to the Azov Sea, effectively cutting off supply and communication lines to Crimea.
Russian capitulation will be formally agreed upon at technical talks after devastating Ukrainian advances on the battleground.  
The victorious powers  - Ukraine, UK, USA - will shape a new international security architecture. 
Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London
Vladimir Putin expected Ukraine's passive acceptance of its more powerful neighbour's actions, with no meaningful involvement of other countries. This grave miscalculation has led to a protracted conflict, with seemingly no end in sight.
The winter will be difficult, as Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure will try to break the morale and endurance of an already shattered population. But Ukrainian resilience has proved to be remarkable. They will stand firm. The war will drag on. And on.
The prospects for negotiation are bleak. For a potential peace deal the core demands of at least one side need to change. There is no evidence that this has happened, or that it will happen soon.
How will the end come, then?
The costs of the war, both material and human, might break the level of commitment of the Russian political elite. The key will be inside Russia.
Past wars in which miscalculation was a crucial element, such as Vietnam for United States, or Afghanistan for the Soviet Union, only ended in this way. Domestic political conditions shifted in the country that had miscalculated, making exit - either ""honourable"" or not - the only viable option.
This may only happen, however, if the West stands firm in its support for Ukraine, in the face of increased domestic pressures linked to the costs of the war.
Sadly, this will continue to be a long-protracted political, economic and military battle of resolve. And by the end of 2023 it will most probably still be ongoing.
Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe
It's too early to plan a victory parade in Kyiv but all the momentum is with Ukraine now and there is no doubt in my mind that they will win this war, probably in 2023.  
Things will move slower over the winter but there's no doubt that Ukraine's forces will be better able to cope than Russia's because of all the winter equipment coming from the UK, Canada and Germany.
By January, Ukraine could be in a position to begin the final phase of the campaign which is the liberation of Crimea.
We know from history that war is a test of will and a test of logistics. When I see the determination of the Ukrainian people and soldiers, and the rapidly improving logistical situation for Ukraine, I see no other outcome but a Russian defeat.
The Russian pull-out from Kherson has partly led me to this conclusion. Firstly as a psychological boost for the Ukrainian people, secondly as a profound embarrassment for the Kremlin and thirdly by handing Ukraine's forces a key operational advantage - all approaches into Crimea are now within range of Ukrainian weapon systems.
I believe that the end of 2023 will see Crimea fully restored to Ukrainian control and sovereignty though there may be some sort or agreement that allows Russia to phase out some of its naval presence in Sevastopol… perhaps even to the end of the treaty (approximately 2025) that had existed before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.  
Reconstruction efforts will be under way on the Ukrainian infrastructure along the Azov Sea coast, including the important ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, and the reopening of the North Crimean Canal that diverts water from the Dnipro to Crimea will be another important project receiving attention.
David Gendelman, military expert based in Israel
Instead of ""how it's going to end"" here is what each side would like to achieve in the next phase.
Only about half of Russia's 300,000 mobilised troops are already in the fighting zone. The rest, together with the forces freed for action after Kherson withdrawal, gives the Russians an opportunity to launch an offensive. 
The occupation of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will continue but a major Russian breakthrough like a drive from the south to Pavlograd to encircle the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas is less likely.
More probable is a continuation of current tactics - a slow grinding of Ukrainian forces on narrow directions and a slow advance, like in Bakhmut and Avdiivka areas, with possible same tactics in Svatove-Kreminna area. 
Continuing targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure and other attacks on Ukrainian rear will complete this war of attrition strategy.
Significant Ukrainian forces were also freed after a Russian retreat from Kherson. For them the most strategically valuable direction is south, to Melitopol or Berdyansk, aiming to cut the Russian mainland corridor to Crimea. That would be a major Ukrainian victory, and that is exactly why Russians are fortifying Melitopol.
Another option for Ukraine is Svatove - success there would endanger the whole northern flank of the entire Russian frontline. 
The big question is how many Ukrainian forces are free and available for the offensive at this point, and what timetable General Zaluzhnyi has on his desk stating how many new reserve brigades and corps that are being built will be ready in one, two or three months from now, including manpower, armoured vehicles and heavy weapons. 
After the mud freezes, we will get the answer to this question. And this answer will get us a little closer to ""how it's going to end"".

At least nine people have died in a crowd crush during New Year festivities in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
A number of children were killed in the incident, which unfolded at a shopping centre that hosted a fireworks display.
One eyewitness explained that people - including his friend - suffocated after getting caught between crowds that were moving in opposing directions.
Big gatherings for New Year's Eve were allowed for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Kampala police said people had attended a concert at Freedom City Mall in large numbers.
A crowd surge was said to occurred when partygoers tried to head back inside - having gone outdoors to see the midnight fireworks.
Five people - described as ""mostly children, juveniles"" - were said to have been killed after being stepped on.
The death toll was later put at nine after a number of people were taken to hospital. 
An eyewitness, Ramadhan Aphongo, told local broadcaster NTV that a friend was among the victims: ""She was enjoying, she was having fun, but due to loss of breath... eventually she died.""
An investigation is under way.

A video posted on Twitter showed the pair belting out a rendition of Abba's Waterloo at The Fife Arms in Braemar.
Ms Spiteri sings the famous chorus while Dame Judi plays the piano, as well as offering the occasional backing vocal.
The Texas frontwoman was shocked by the Oscar winner's musical abilities, mouthing: ""What a pianist!""
They shared the piano stool throughout the impromptu performance which followed a dinner and ceilidh at the venue.
Ewan Venters, CEO of Artfarm which owns The Fife Arms, posted the video on social media, and it was soon amassing thousands of views.
He told BBC Scotland the crowd's reaction to the performance was ""joyful"".
""Judi Dench and Sharleen Spiteri were staying at the hotel and we had an impromptu moment at the piano,"" he said.
""It was a happy evening with lots of guests and locals clapping.""
He said the pair burst into song just before the midnight fireworks.
""It was a classic Scottish Hogmanay party at The Fife Arms,"" he said.

21;"[""'My autism made me an artist but I wanted a family'""]";['2023-01-02T00:20:57.000Z'];['By Charlie Jones'];['david downes', 'nhs: what is autism'];['socially', 'school', 'struggling', 'trying', 'artist', 'outside', 'autism', 'family', 'girlfriend', 'happened', 'different', 'wanted', 'little', 'friends'];"
 At two years of age, David Downes began to draw. It would be another few years before he learned to talk, and another 30 until his autism diagnosis.
""I could draw before I could communicate. Looking back it was obvious but there wasn't as much awareness back then,"" says the 51-year-old landscape artist, who lives in Manningtree, Essex.
David has a photographic memory, which he puts down to his neurodivergent brain. He can recall the places he has visited in brilliant detail and paint them from his recollections.
""I'm lucky to have this capacity to visualise and also to get obsessive about stuff. As a child I started drawing churches, trees, flocks of birds and road junctions because they were the things I was fascinated by.""
But his autistic traits haven't always helped David in life. 
He felt different from his friends growing up in Brome, Suffolk. He was bullied at high school and found comfort in keeping an illustrated diary. His head teacher did not believe he had produced the drawings - so his artistic talent was not recognised.
It was his mother, who recently passed away and who David describes as his inspiration, who encouraged him to go to art school.
He found exams difficult because he struggled to retain information and did not get the grades to get into Norwich Art School, which was seen as the best in the area, so he went to one in Ipswich.
""My work was really hit and miss. I was very bad at copying, I could draw it out of my head much easier than if it was in front of me.""
David went on to study illustration at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge and then at Brighton University, where he did a postgraduate diploma in illustration.
""Socially I was still struggling to make friends and I was trying to fit in. People actually want to be different at art school. But I was so different that it was annoying. I was always a little bit on the outside. I was desperate to find a girlfriend but it never happened,"" he says.
David still did not have an autism diagnosis, but suspected he was on the spectrum. 
He decided to document his struggles in a visual autobiography and used it to gain a place at the prestigious Royal College of Art in London, which he describes as ""like winning the World Cup"".
After graduating, David was unsure which path to take - as an illustrator or a fine artist. ""You come out of the Royal College and you just presume you're going to make it. I felt like I was more of a fine artist, but I tended to do work that was quite illustrative.""
It was not long until he won his first major contract, a commission by the BBC to record the corporation's most important architecture at the turn of the century and he became the BBC's artist in residence for two years.
David was eventually diagnosed with autism at the age of 32 and he spoke to a counsellor, who helped him get a part-time job in an art shop.
""I was struggling to run a business and make a living from my art and I needed some kind of understanding of what was going on,"" he says.
His professional life started going well again, and in 2012 he was commissioned by The Savoy Hotel to create a piece depicting the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, which still sits in the entrance of the world famous hotel.
David got involved with the National Autistic Society and became vice president, regularly speaking and painting live at fundraising events for the charity.
But at the same time, he was struggling with relationships. He could not find a partner, despite throwing himself into internet dating, and felt his dreams of being a father were over.
David started seeing a hypnotherapist while in his early forties and paid him in drawings. 
""He would hypnotise me and say 'David you're a really great artist, you're unique, you're different. You're going to meet someone who is going to understand your issues'.""
David went on to meet his partner Rachel in a pub in Stoke Newington in London. The couple lived in California for three years, which he says opened his mind to doing different types of work.
""It was a challenge living there and having to almost start again as an artist, after being well known in London, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone,"" he says.
They decided to move back to England, to Manningtree, and Rachel fell pregnant with their daughter Talia, who is now two. 
During Covid, David felt inspired to document the pandemic, which he says helped him cope with the stress of it, and he started doing much more imaginary and surreal work.
""My best work as always been autobiographical or describing the times that we live in,"" he says.
David recently opened a gallery in Manningtree, which had always been a dream of his, but he ""never thought it would come true"".
""To have the opportunity to display my work and have chats with people, it's incredible. I feel like it has also given me more of an identity as an artist,"" he says.
David is now turning his attention to the cost of living crisis and wants to create some pieces documenting it in the new year.
""Before my mum died, she said to me 'your father and I never thought you'd meet someone and be a father,"" he says.
""I'm proud of everything I've achieved in the art world but having a family is the most important thing of all.""

22;['The nun and the monk who fell in love and married'];['2023-01-02T00:01:20.000Z'];['By Aleem Maqbool'];['catholicism', 'religion', 'the church of england'];['robert', 'monastery', 'live', 'prayer', 'sacrament', 'monk', 'god', 'nun', 'think', 'fell', 'really', 'love', 'realise', 'married'];"
Sister Mary Elizabeth had lived a devout, austere and mostly silent life as a nun, spending most of her days in her Carmelite cell in northern England. But a fleeting encounter with a similarly devout monk would lead him to send her a message bearing words that left her reeling, ""Would you leave your order and marry me?"" 
Twenty-four years after becoming a nun, it was a brief touch of the sleeve of a monk in the parlour of the convent in Preston, Lancashire, that changed everything for Sister Mary Elizabeth. 
The prioress of the order had taken her to meet the friar Robert, who was visiting from the Carmelite priory in Oxford, to see if he wanted anything to eat. But Sister Mary Elizabeth's superior was called away to take a phone call, so the two were left alone.
""It was our first time in a room together. We sat at a table as he ate, and the prioress didn't come back so I had to let him out.""
As Sister Mary Elizabeth let Robert out of the door, she brushed his sleeve and says she felt something of a jolt.
""I just felt a chemistry there, something, and I was a bit embarrassed. And I thought, gosh, did he feel that too. And as I let him out the door it was quite awkward.""
She recalls that it was about a week later that she received Robert's message asking if she would leave to marry him.
""I was a little bit shocked. I wore a veil so he never even saw my hair colour. He knew nothing about me really, nothing about my upbringing. He didn't even know my worldly name,"" she recalls.
Before entering the Carmelite order at the age of 19, Sister Mary Elizabeth had been Lisa Tinkler, from Middlesbrough. 
Though her parents had not been religious, an aunt's pilgrimage to Lourdes awakened something in six-year-old Lisa, such that she asked her father to build an altar in her bedroom. 
""I had a little statue of Our Lady on it and a little Lourdes water bottle. Actually, I thought it was the bottle that was holy and not the water - so I was just filling it from the tap and drinking the water,"" she says.
Lisa would make her own way to one of the Roman Catholic churches in her home town and sit alone in the second pew - where she says she developed an overwhelming love for the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, and ultimately a feeling she had a vocation.
A weekend retreat at a monastery while she was still a teenager convinced her of her calling. The monastery was run by Carmelite nuns from an order that had origins in the 12th Century and where the life was particularly spartan, secluded and strict - but she decided that was precisely the life she wanted to lead.
Though Lisa had wanted to join immediately, her mother - who was troubled by her daughter's decision - secretly wrote to the monastery to delay her departure for a few months, so Lisa could spend one more Christmas at home. She joined in the new year.
""From then I lived like a hermit. We had two recreation times a day, about half an hour, when we could speak, otherwise you were on your own in your cell. You never worked with anybody, always on your own,"" she says.
Over the years, Sister Mary Elizabeth felt her vocabulary diminish as she had little more to talk about with the other nuns - who were all decades older than her - except the weather and the nature in the garden. She saw her mother four times a year through a grill.
""When I had my 21st birthday, my cake and my cards were all passed through the drawer. And when my nephew was born he was passed through a kind of turntable,"" she chuckles, looking back on it all quite fondly.
She describes the way she felt her ""interior world"" open up as the outside world closed to her. There was a sense of feeling content and fulfilled. But, that day in the convent parlour, it all changed with the touch of a sleeve and a message asking if she would walk away from monastic life and get married. 
Sister Mary Elizabeth didn't give Robert an answer to his question and did not know what to do. 
He may have known nothing about her, but she knew a little about him. 
On his visits from Oxford to the Carmelite retreat centre in Preston he had occasionally come to say mass at the nearby monastery and Lisa had watched his sermons from behind a grill. 
Through hearing his anecdotes as he preached, she got snippets of a life growing up in Silesia in Poland near the German border, and about a love of mountains. Though she says at the time it did not feel like it had a profound impact on her. 
Now, suddenly, that had changed.
""I didn't know what it feels like to be in love and I thought the sisters could see it in my face. So I became quite nervous. I could feel the change in me and that scared me,"" she says.
Sister Mary Elizabeth eventually plucked up the courage to say to her prioress that she thought she had feelings for Robert, but the response she got was disbelief.
""She couldn't understand how it had happened because we were in there 24/7 under her watch all the time. The prioress asked how I could have fallen in love with so little contact,"" she says.
Sister Mary Elizabeth had imagined the reaction of her family, or of her bishop, if she left. She also wrestled over whether her relationship with God would change. 
But the interaction with her superior caused her to do something uncharacteristically impetuous.
Lisa and Robert's story is explored further in the first episode of a new series of Beyond Belief at 16:30 GMT on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 2 January - afterwards it will be available on BBC Sounds
""The prioress was little bit snappy with me, so I put my pants and a toothbrush in a bag and I walked out, and I never went back as Sister Mary Elizabeth,"" Lisa tells me now.
Robert had her messaged to say he was planning to visit Preston again that evening. This time, it was to meet a Carmelite friend for advice at a nearby pub, the first person from the order he had trusted to tell of his and Lisa's predicament. 
Lisa guessed they would be meeting at the Black Bull about a mile up the road, so that was where she decided to head.
But instead of it being a joyful moment, Lisa was thrown into deep turmoil that November night in 2015.  
""The rain was lashing down as I was walking along the Garstang road. The traffic was coming towards me with bright headlights and I just thought 'I could just finish this,'"" she says, referring to a momentary suicidal thought.
""I was really struggling, I thought I should just stop this from happening and Robert could get on with his life. But I also wondered if he really meant what he said about getting married.""  
But Lisa kept walking until she found herself on a Friday night drenched, without a coat, in her habit outside the Black Bull. She only plucked up the courage to go inside when she saw the monk inside through an open door. 
""When I saw her, my heart stopped,"" says Robert. 
""But actually I was paralysed by fear not by joy, because I knew in that moment that I had to be entirely for Lisa, but I also knew we were not practically ready for that,"" he says.
Robert had been a Carmelite friar for 13 years by this point. He was a thinker, academic and theologian who came to monastic life in a search for meaning during what he describes as a crisis of faith and identity. 
Looking back now, he feels his roots made that confusion almost inevitable - growing up in a region that recently transitioned from Germany to Poland, with a Lutheran father and Catholic mother.
But it was a dark period after a failed relationship that led him to continue his search for fulfilment in England where, in spite of the Lutheran Protestant theology he had settled on, it was in a Carmelite Roman Catholic monastery where he found his solace.
""I didn't know much about Carmelites before and had not considered being a monk. In fact, I was always very suspicious of this kind of expression of faith,"" Robert says.
But he says the order taught him how to embrace darkness, difficulties and crisis to the point where he felt settled. However, the encounter with Lisa - who he barely knew then as Sister Mary Elizabeth - turned his life upside down.
""That touch of Lisa's on my sleeve started a change, but while I felt something gradually growing in my heart, I don't think I ever reached a point where I felt I was crazily falling in love, because in becoming a monk or a nun they teach you how to deal with emotions like love,"" says Robert.
He explains that his message to Lisa asking if they could marry was almost an intellectual tussle with himself.
""When she appeared at the pub the little demon in me was terrified. But my fear was not religious or spiritual, it was purely about how I would start a new life at the age of 53,"" he says.
The transition was difficult, particularly at the beginning. Lisa remembers a moment just before Christmas, soon after they had both left their monastic lives. 
""I looked at Robert and he was distressed and crying. At that moment we both hit rock bottom and it felt like we should just take something like Romeo and Juliet and just end it,"" says Lisa. 
""It was so hard because he both felt so alone and so isolated and didn't know the way forward. But we just held hands and we got through it,"" she says.
They describe the moment at the job centre when they both burst into tears when asked about their transferrable skills - and another time when they were driving from Preston to Yorkshire.
""I had ordered a book in Polish about nuns who had left their orders for various reasons. I read and translated it for Lisa in the car, but she had to pull over on the M62. We both needed to cry because their stories were so emotional and we could relate to them,"" says Robert.
What brought them peace was the thing that guided them to their monasticism in the first place - connecting with their personal faith.
""All through your religious life, you're told your heart is supposed to be undivided and given to God. Suddenly I felt like my heart was expanding to hold Robert, but I realised it also held everything else that I had. And I didn't feel any different about God, and that was reassuring to me,"" says Lisa.
Lisa first found work at a funeral home and later as a hospital chaplain. Though he was upset by a letter from Rome telling him he was no longer a member of the Carmelite order, Robert was soon accepted into the Church of England.
They both did get married, and now share a home in the village of Hutton Rudby in North Yorkshire - where Robert has been made a vicar of the local church. They are still on a journey to adjust to life outside the monastery.
Lisa in particular, who had been isolated for 24 years and not had the academic life Robert had before, talks of feeling like an observer in the outside world. Only now is she working out what hair styles and clothes work best for her after a life in a habit.
They both still yearn for elements of monastic life, Lisa even says that if it was not for Robert, she would return to being a Carmelite nun tomorrow.
""We became so used to the silence and the solitude, that's hard to find in the business of the world, you get pulled in so many different directions, so it's a constant struggle for me and Robert to remain centred and grounded,"" says Lisa. 
But they have found a solution that works.
""I often think I live in a monastery here with Robert, like two Carmelites where everything we do is given to God. We anchor ourselves in prayer but love can make a sacrament of everything you do and I realise nothing has really changed for me,"" she says.
Lisa says they both agree there are three of them in the marriage.
""Christ is at the centre and comes before everything. If we were to take him out of the equation, I think it wouldn't have lasted really.""
Lisa and Robert's story is explored further in the first episode of a new series of Beyond Belief at 16:30 on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 2 January - afterwards it will be available on BBC Sounds.

Rescuers in Vietnam are trying to free a 10-year-old boy trapped deep inside a narrow shaft at a building site.
Reports say Ly Hao Nam was searching for scrap metal when he fell into the hollow concrete pile in southern Dong Thap province on New Year's Eve.
Teams have battled since then to free him, pumping oxygen into the 35m-deep support pillar to help him breathe.
He was heard crying for help two days ago but gave no response when a camera was lowered down the hole on Monday.
""We are trying our best. We cannot tell the boy's condition yet,"" one rescuer at the bridge construction site in the Mekong delta told AFP news agency. 
Officials have been amazed that anyone could fall down the shaft in the pillar, which measures just 25cm (10in) in diameter.
Photos from the scene have shown the boy's parents watching anxiously as rescuers try to reach their son.
Emergency teams have tried to lift the pile with cranes and excavators, but so far with no success. 
They have also softened the soil around the pillar to try to free it, but that has made it tilt and complicated rescue efforts, Reuters news agency reported.

The authorities in Malawi have suspended primary and secondary schools opening in two major cities following a cholera outbreak that has so far killed 595 people. 
Schools in the capital, Lilongwe, and the commercial hub, Blantyre, will remain closed for at least two more weeks after the Christmas holidays. 
The cholera outbreak began in March 2022 but has become acute lately.
Nineteen people died on New Year's Eve alone. 
Cholera is contracted by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can affect children and adults, causing severe diarrhoea, and can kill within hours if left untreated.
Health authorities say that the onset of the rainy season could be making the situation worse as flood waters mixed with waste pollute water sources. A lack of proper drainage in both cities is also a factor. 
The outbreak has spread to nearly all of Malawi's 28 districts.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control says it is concerned about the rise in cholera deaths in Malawi, which it attributes to patients not getting treatment in time.
Monday's announcement has angered some parents who say their children were already on their way to school, which had been due to reopen on Tuesday.
Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said the government regretted any inconvenience and that ""the late advice was taken solely in the interest of the safety of our learners"".
She said that school reopening will be delayed for at least two weeks, but further advice would be given.

Watch: Senegal's parliament brawls after woman MP hit by colleague
Two opposition MPs in Senegal have been given six-month jail sentences for kicking a pregnant colleague in the stomach during a budget debate. 
The male lawmakers attacked Amy Ndiaye after she criticised an opposition religious figure. 
The judge also ordered Mamadou Niang and Massata Samb to pay Ms Ndiaye five million CFA francs ($8,100; £6,750) in compensation. 
The incident was widely condemned and sparked a debate about women's rights. 
In a video widely shared online, Mr Samb is seen walking towards Ms Ndiaye and slapping her during a routine budget debate on 1 December. She then retaliates by throwing a chair, but at the same time gets kicked in her belly by another male colleague. A melee then breaks out as other MPs try to calm the situation.
Ms Ndiaye, a member of the ruling Benno Bokk Yakaar coalition, fainted in parliament after the attack and there were fears that she would lose the baby. 
Despite leaving hospital she ""remains in an extremely difficult situation,"" her lawyer Baboucar Cissé told news agency AFP. 
Despite the video evidence, lawyers for Mr Niang and Mr Samb argued in court that their clients had not physically attacked Ms Ndiaye.
They also argued unsuccessfully that the two lawmakers were immune to prosecution. 
""They are going to remain in prison pending an appeal,"" one of their lawyers, Abdy Nar Ndiaye, told AFP.
There has been tension in Senegal's parliament since the government lost its majority in legislative elections in July last year.

Police have charged a 19-year-old with two counts of attempted murder over an attack on three police officers near Times Square on New Year's Eve. 
Trevor Bickford - who was also charged with two counts of attempted assault - travelled to NYC by train from Maine before the attack, police said.
US media reported his family recently told the FBI they feared he was being radicalised by Islamist extremists. 
Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the attack was ""unprovoked"".
The three officers - one of whom suffered a fractured skull after being struck by the machete - were all released from hospital on Sunday. 
Mr Bickford is believed by investigators to have travelled to the city on 29 December after withdrawing thousands of dollars in cash from his bank account and purchasing the knife later used in the attack. 
He allegedly launched his attack shortly before 22:00 local time on Saturday near an area that had been set up for New Year's Eve celebrations, Ms Sewell said. 
During the attack he attempted to strike police over the head with his weapon, before one of the officers fired their weapon and hit him in the shoulder, officials said.
Mr Bickford remains in hospital under police custody because of the injuries sustained in the attack. 
According to US media reports, his mother and aunt had reported him to the FBI over their fear that he had been radicalised by extreme Islamists. 
CNN, citing law enforcement sources, reported that was interviewed by FBI agents in Maine in mid-December after he said he wanted to travel overseas and help fellow Muslims. 
The network also reported that a backpack found at the scene contained a diary in which he expressed his desire to join the Afghan Taliban and believed he would die in the attack. 
Ahead of New Year's Day, the NYPD had released intelligence reports suggesting that some terrorist groups were preparing for a potential attack.
""Throughout December, multiple pro-ISIS users disseminated extremist propaganda graphics broadly calling for attacks in advance of the New Year, advocating a wide range of low-tech tactics,"" the assessment report said.

WATCH: Debris covers Australia's Gold Coast after mid-air helicopter collision
A mid-air collision between two helicopters in Australia could have seen many more deaths, authorities say.
A British couple and two Australians died in the crash on Monday near Sea World on Queensland's Gold Coast. 
Three others - including two children - were seriously injured.
The cause of the crash is not yet known. Officials say it happened less than 20 seconds after one helicopter took off from a sandbar and collided with another aircraft that was landing.
All those killed and critically injured were in the ascending helicopter, which crashed within seconds after its main rotor blade struck the cockpit of the other aircraft, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said. 
The second helicopter landed upright on the sandbank. Five of the six people on board suffered minor injuries.
The landing was a ""remarkable achievement"" given the helicopter was damaged ""where the pilot was sitting"", ATSB chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.
""We are very fortunate that we're not standing here with far more deaths,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
The UK victims - a woman, 57, and a man, 65 - were married and had a next of kin in Australia, Queensland Police said. They and another woman who died, a 36-year-old Australian, have not been identified. 
The fourth victim was 40-year-old Ashley Jenkinson, an experienced Sea World Helicopters pilot who lived in the area.
Mr Jenkinson was a ""big guy with a big heart"", said one friend quoted by local media. The Brisbane Times reported he was originally from England and had helped with recovery efforts after devastating floods in Lismore, New South Wales, last year.
A boy, 10, and a woman, 33, remained in a critical condition in hospital on Tuesday, police said. A nine-year-old boy with serious injuries was described as stable.
Both helicopters were operating tourist flights for Sea World - one of several popular theme parks on the Gold Coast. Its owner, Village Roadshow Theme Parks, has offered condolences and said Sea World Helicopters is an independent operator. 
The ATSB says it will conduct interviews and meticulously scour the helicopters, scene, footage, and other evidence before speculating on what caused the crash. It called on eyewitnesses to come forward.
Police said boat operators had rushed to help after the crash at about 14:00 local time (04:00 GMT), including by giving CPR.
Authorities had faced challenges accessing the sandbank and later securing evidence amid tidal changes, officials said.
The ATSB's preliminary report is due in six to eight weeks.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the country had been left shocked by the ""terrible and tragic incident"". 
The UK foreign office has said it is supporting the victims' families and will remain in contact with local authorities.

American motorsport legend and YouTube star Ken Block has died in a snowmobile accident in Utah at the age of 55.
A competitive rally driver in series such as Rally America and Global Rallycross, he earned wide renown later in life for his ""Gymkhana"" video series on YouTube.
The 10-part series, in which he performed daring racing feats, earned him nearly two million subscribers.
Block also co-founded the skate-wear clothing brand DC Shoes.
Hoonigan Industries, another clothing company he owned, confirmed its founder's passing in a statement on Instagram on Monday.
""Ken was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband. He will be incredibly missed.""
Block was riding a snowmobile up a steep slope in Wasatch County, Utah, when the vehicle upended, landing on top of him, the local sheriff's office wrote on Facebook.
He was pronounced dead at the scene from the injuries he sustained.
The sheriff's office said that Block had been riding with a group but was alone when the crash occurred.
A competitive rally driver since 2005, Block was Rally America's Rookie of the Year in his first season and went on to win rallycross medals at the X Games and podium finishes at the World Rallycross Championship.
He also competed in other actions sports, including motocross, skateboarding and snowboarding.
But Block found a second wind on YouTube, where millions watched him navigate dangerous tracks and obstacle courses in a range of vehicles.
He was featured twice on the BBC's Top Gear programme, as well as in four EA Sports racing video games.
The American Rally Association said it was ""gutted"" at the news of Block's passing.
""He was a massive influence on everything he touched, including the global world of rallying,"" it said in a statement on Facebook.
Fellow racers also paid tribute to Block, with former British Formula One world champion Jenson Button calling him ""a talent that did so much for our sport"".
Nascar Xfinity Series driver Ryan Vargas said watching Block's videos ""shaped my personality and interest in cars"".

36;"[""It's not over for Kevin McCarthy's Speaker bid - here's why""]";['2023-01-03T19:11:34.000Z'];['By Kayla Epstein'];['us congress'];['mr', 'kevin', 'bid', 'spectre', 'votes', 'spent', 'pack', 'speaker', 'biggs', 'round', 'representative', 'republicans', 'heres', 'received', 'mccarthys'];"
Republican Kevin McCarthy has lost a first-round vote to become the next Speaker of the House of Representatives, the first time a nominee has been defeated in a century.
This does not immediately end his candidacy - he may yet prevail in subsequent rounds of voting. 
Or he could see his dream of leading Congress' lower chamber destroyed as another contender emerges.
The California representative needs at least 218 votes to win.
There are only 222 Republicans in the chamber this year so Mr McCarthy could only afford to lose four votes from his party. In the first round, he got just 203 votes as 19 Republicans refused to back him.
All 212 Democrats voted for their party leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York. 
The House will keep voting for speaker until a candidate is elected. The chamber cannot proceed with any other business until they have chosen a speaker. That includes swearing in new members of Congress, and adopting new rules and legislations.
It's not yet clear how many rounds of balloting it will take for members to decide today's contest. The process could take the rest of the day, or even continue for several days if no consensus is reached.
The last time a candidate for speaker failed to secure the necessary votes on the first round of ballots occurred in 1923. It took nine ballots and several days to select a speaker.
Past speakers have faced obstacles coming into a new Congress, but have managed to rally their caucus behind them by the time the official vote arrived. But Mr McCarthy has faced opposition from far-right members of his own party ever since Republicans secured control of the House in last November's midterm elections.
The pack is led by Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, who has put himself forward as an alternative if long-shot candidate, and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who spent much of the last Congress under the spectre of a federal investigation. Mr Biggs received 10 votes in the first round, while nine Republicans backed other candidates.
The holdouts oppose his speakership on ideological and personal grounds, and have spent weeks negotiating Mr McCarthy to win concessions, such as changes to a procedure to oust a sitting speaker. 
Mr McCarthy told his caucus in a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning that he believed as many as 20 Republicans would vote against him on the first round of balloting, Capitol Hill press reported. But he remained confident he would ultimately emerge victorious.

37;"[""Vietnamese boy trapped in pillar has 'limited' hope for survival""]";['2023-01-03T17:52:07.000Z'];['By Rachel Russell'];['vietnam', 'asia', 'asia pacific'];['boy', 'lowered', 'trapped', 'limited', 'response', 'help', 'heard', 'pillar', 'try', 'rescuers', 'hope', 'vietnamese', 'fell', 'locate', 'survival', 'received'];"
There is ""limited"" hope over rescuing a 10-year-old Vietnamese boy who has been trapped in a concrete pillar for three days, rescuers say. 
Thai Ly Hao Nam fell into the 25cm (12-inch) wide shaft of the pillar while looking for scrap metal in southern Vietnam on New Year's Eve. 
Soldiers and engineering experts have been removing mud and water in an attempt to bring the pillar up.
The boy is likely to be badly injured if he does survive, one official said.
""Hope for him to be alive is limited,"" said Doan Tan Buu, a local official in Dong Thap province where the accident happened. 
Oxygen has been pumped into the 35m-deep support pillar to help the boy breathe.
The 10-year-old was heard crying for help after he fell into the pillar, but rescuers said they received no response from him on Monday as they lowered a camera down to try to locate where he was. 
Around 100 soldiers and professional equipment have been deployed at the site since Saturday.
The area has also been sealed off from the public while the rescue effort takes place.
Vietnamese media outlet VnExpress shared a graphic to show how rescuers were using a 19-metre-long metal pipe to try to remove mud from around the pillar and lift it out.
It comes after two days of rescue efforts using cranes and excavators were unsuccessful. 
Mr Buu said: ""We had tried our best to rescue the boy using on-the-spot measures and equipment.
""We later had to ask for help from national levels and people with [more] expertise.""
Officials added they did not know how the boy had managed to get trapped.

38;['Ghana fishing: Abuse, corruption and death on Chinese vessels'];['2023-01-04T02:11:58.000Z'];['By George Wright & Thomas Naadi'];['fishing', 'china', 'ghana', 'fishing industry'];['chinese', 'death', 'lot', 'ghana', 'increasingly', 'abuse', 'pull', 'told', 'haul', 'waters', 'vessels', 'worse', 'storms', 'lost', 'weight', 'corruption', 'fishing'];"
When it comes to abuse and corruption on Chinese fishing vessels in Ghana, Bright Tsai Kweku has seen it all.
He has seen Chinese crew treating local fishermen like ""slaves"", he says. 
""They beat them, they spit on them, they kick them,"" Mr Kweku says. ""I have been through that before."" 
Mr Kweku works as a bosun - an officer in charge of equipment and the crew. He says he has been forced to work for three days without sleep, had food withheld from him and been forced to drink dirty water. 
The fate of some of his fellow fishermen has been even worse, he says.
Mr Kweku says one of his colleagues fell sick with cholera on board a Chinese vessel but the crew refused to bring him back to shore for treatment. He didn't make it back alive.
He saw another get badly burned on a vessel after a fire ignited onboard. Another colleague got caught by a propeller. Neither survived and the families have not received proper compensation, he says. 
These are just a few examples of the alleged widespread abuse and neglect linked to Chinese fishing vessels operating off Ghanaian shores.  
The UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) says at least 90% of the industrial trawlers operating in Ghana are owned by Chinese corporations, in contravention of Ghanaian laws on the ownership of vessels fishing under the local flag. A substantial proportion of these vessels have engaged in illegal practices, EJF says.
A recent EJF report investigates what it says are illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and human rights abuses by China's Distant Water Fishing (DWF) fleet in Ghana. The ownership and operational control of China's DWF fleet is complex and opaque, and is the largest in the world. 
All 36 crew members interviewed by EJF had been forced to work more than 14 hours a day and received inadequate food. 
In response, China's embassy says it is a ""responsible fishing country"". 
""We have always worked with other members of the international community to crack down on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and have done a lot in effectively combating illegal fishing,"" its press office tells the BBC.
One of the worst disasters involving a Chinese vessel in Ghanaian waters took place eight months ago. 
On 6 May, the MV Comforter 2 sank in stormy conditions. Fourteen crew were rescued, but 11 remain missing, presumed dead, including the state-appointed observer. The body of the Chinese captain was found. 
One of the survivors, who requested anonymity and we will call Michael, recalls the horrors that unfolded that day. 
Despite storms getting increasingly worse, he says the Chinese crew told the fishermen to pull in an excessive haul in one go. The boat already had a lot of fish on board, and it lost control, capsizing under the weight of the haul and the choppy waters.
Michael and nine others managed to grab hold of a floating oil drum for almost 24 hours, before a fisherman found them.
""It was a terrifying night,"" he says. ""We didn't know whether we would make it or not.""
Michael hasn't recovered physically or mentally from the disaster, and says the Ghanaian company officially in charge of the vessel, Boatacom, has not paid him any compensation.
""I'm not happy at all, the company keeps giving us excuses. Sometimes I feel pain all over my body. I need medical attention, but I don't have money,"" he says. 
Kojo Ampratwum, managing director of Boatacom, tells the BBC the firm has submitted its reports to the insurance company and is waiting to hear back.
Tracing who owns the MV Comforter 2 and other vessels operating in Ghana is complicated. 
Foreign ownership of industrial trawl vessels operating under the Ghanaian flag is illegal, but some Chinese firms get around this via Ghanaian front companies. 
Through its research, EJF says the Chinese Dalian Mengxin Ocean Fishery Company is the ultimate owner of the MV Comforter 2 and that it is part of the Meng Xin fleet. 
The Meng Xin fleet has also been linked to one of the most notorious cases on Ghanaian waters in recent times - the disappearance of fisheries observer Emmanuel Essien.
Since 2018, Ghana has appointed fisheries observers on board all industrial trawlers operating under the Ghanaian flag. Their job is to collect data on fishing activities and report on illegal practices at sea. 
Essien had earned a name as a dedicated and thorough observer, but this had led to problems. He got into a fight with a Chinese national who had stopped him from filming crew illegally discarding fish at sea, says his brother James Essien.
Emmanuel's final report to the Fisheries Commission was on 24 June 2019. In the report - a copy of which was provided to the BBC - he outlines illegal fishing activities and states: ""I humbly plead with the police to investigate further."" 
On 5 July, Essien went missing from the Meng Xin 15 trawler.
James says that his brother had dinner with the rest of the crew before they headed back to their cubicle to sleep. The next morning he was nowhere to be seen. 
More than three years on, the family still has no answers. A police investigation found ""no signs of violence or anything incriminating"".
""I want the truth to come out,"" James tells the BBC, in tears.
The Mengxin Ocean Fishery Company could not be reached for comment.
Essien's disappearance is one of many factors that have had a chilling effect on Ghana's fisheries observers.
Ghanaian observers who spoke to the BBC explain how a culture of fear, corruption and neglect are pushing them to take bribes to bury evidence of illegal fishing and abuse on Chinese vessels. 
""Most of our colleagues are taking money,"" says one observer, who requested anonymity and we will call Daniel. 
""They are being bribed and taking money from the Chinese and submitting reports to the ministry that are not true."" 
All the observers interviewed say their wages are poor and it often takes as long as five months to get paid, meaning kickbacks from Chinese and Ghanaian crew managers are necessary to feed their families. 
""If you reject the bribe you go home hungry,"" says another observer, who we will call Samuel. 
""Most of those observers do take bribes. That's what we do to take care of our families.""
Some feel too scared to report the truth. 
""Sometimes what they do is throw the observer into the water - it has happened before,"" Samuel says. ""Because of the fear we normally don't report issues like that.""
One former observer, who has since left Ghana, tells the BBC he was once called to the office of a high-ranking official within the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development after he reported illegal practices at sea.
He says the official asked him to present the evidence, and then proceeded to delete it from his phone. But he had the evidence backed up on a laptop and threatened to post it on social media.
Then he says he started receiving threats.
At one point he was so nervous that he would not sleep at his own house because people knew where he lived and he was worried about being attacked, or worse. 
One day, when he was cycling near the fishing harbour in Tema, a port city east of the capital Accra, he says a Ghanaian official spotted him and tried ramming him with his vehicle. 
""He was trying to hit me with his car at the fishing harbour. I saw him so I jumped to the gutter… this guy was mad,"" he says. 
He eventually decided to leave the industry after receiving death threats. 
""I became miserable in life because when I'd go to the harbour, everyone was looking at me. I couldn't find any work to do. I became like a stranger, like I'm a bad person. It was so hard for me.""
He now avoids the harbour when he's back in Ghana.
""People try to threaten me. These guys are very serious,"" he says.
Steve Trent, founder and head of EJF, says the high concentration of Chinese ownership within trawl fleets is a problem across West Africa, accusing them of often flouting the law.
But in Ghana, the problem is ""particularly acute"", he says.
""These Chinese owners have commonly put a Chinese captain in charge of the vessels to command the mainly Ghanaian crew and it is these Chinese captains that have driven the abuse,"" Mr Trent says. He blames the abuse on the owners seeking to ""maximise profits and minimise costs"". 
EJF investigations have uncovered systemic corruption ""at virtually every level and including fisheries officials, police and navy officers"" tasked with enforcing regulations, he says.
While there has been some progress on illegal fishing in Ghana, Mr Trent says a lot more needs to be done.
""We need to see the loopholes and deceit by which illegal foreign ownership, now concentrated with the Chinese, are eliminated,"" he says.
The Ghanaian government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Mr Kweku wants the government to allow fishermen to properly unionise, and says a system must be put in place so people are under contract before being sent out to work at sea. 
A mixture of abuse, disappearances and poor pay has taken a lasting toll on his mental health, and that of many others.
""We lost a lot of fishermen at sea but nothing is done about that. Two or three observers are missing,"" he says. 
""We are all afraid of going to sea but there is no work on land, so you must force yourself to go.""

39;['US FDA clears path for pharmacies to sell abortion pills'];['2023-01-04T06:04:08.000Z'];['By Sam Cabral'];['abortion', 'prescription drugs', 'us abortion debate', 'united states'];['pharmacies', 'pregnancy', 'used', 'fda', 'drug', 'pills', 'taken', 'path', 'prescription', 'sell', 'clears', 'abortion', 'misoprostol', 'restricted', 'weeks', 'typically', 'second'];"
Retail pharmacies in the US can dispense the abortion pill mifepristone for the first time, under a new rule change by the Biden administration.
Patients currently obtain mifepristone - part of a two-drug regimen that is safe and effective in inducing abortion - in person from a health provider.
A prescription is still required under the new rule, but patients can now pick up the pill in-store or by mail order.
The move could significantly expand access to abortion through medication.
Abortion pills have become more sought after in the wake of last year's Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion, with several states banning or sharply restricting access to abortion.  
More than half of US abortions are already done with pills rather than by surgery, according to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.
In December 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had said it would permanently lift the requirement for patients to obtain a prescription in person via a healthcare provider, as part of its pandemic-driven move toward telemedicine.
On Tuesday, the FDA updated its website with the new requirements, saying the drug ""can be dispensed by certified pharmacies or by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber"".
Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro, the two US companies who make the drug, confirmed in separate statements that the agency had informed them of its decision.
The move has been hailed as ""an important step"" forward by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
""Although the FDA's announcement today will not solve access issues for every person seeking abortion care, it will allow more patients who need mifepristone for medication abortion additional options to secure this vital drug,"" the organisation said in a statement.
Mifepristone is taken in combination with a second drug called misoprostol, typically taken within 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy to induce what is known as medication abortion. Misoprostol, which is commonly used for miscarriage management, is not a restricted drug and can easily be obtained at pharmacies via prescription. 
Pharmacies - from large chains to corner drugstores - can now apply for certification to distribute mifepristone, which will allow them to directly service customers with a prescription from a certified prescriber. Drug chains CVS and Walgreens have both said they are reviewing the new requirements.
But the political landmines surrounding abortion are likely to influence whether or not, and where, pharmacies will offer the pill.
Women in the more than dozen states where abortion has been banned will also likely need to travel to other states to obtain medication abortion.

An ex-funeral home owner and her mother have been sentenced to prison in Colorado after dissecting hundreds of bodies and selling the body parts.
Prosecutors said Megan Hess, 46, and Shirly Koch, 69, dissected some 560 corpses and sold body parts without permission between 2010 and 2018.
Both women pleaded guilty to fraud earlier this year.
Hess will jailed for 20, while Koch was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
According to federal prosecutors in Colorado, the mother-daughter duo harvested body parts, and entire bodies in some cases, for sale.
Hess - who ran the Sunset Mesa Funeral Home in the town of Montrose - charged families up to $1,000 (£834) for cremations that never took place and offered them free of charge in exchange for body part donations in some cases, prosecutors said.
""These two women preyed on vulnerable victims who turned to them in a time of grief and sadness,"" Leonard Carollo, the FBI's special agent in charge in Denver, said in a statement.
""But instead of offering guidance, these greedy women betrayed the trust of hundreds of victims and mutilated their loved ones.""
The case was triggered by a Reuters investigation, which led to an FBI raid of the home in 2018. It is illegal in the US to sell organs, but the sale of body parts is currently not regulated by US federal law.
Emotional victim statements dominated Tuesday's sentencing hearing.
""When Megan stole my mom's heart, she broke mine,"" said Nancy Overhoff, according to the Denver Post. Erin Smith said: ""We came today to hear the handcuffs click.""
Describing it as ""the most emotionally draining case I have ever experienced on the bench"", Judge Christine Arguello ordered the two women be sent to prison immediately.

41;"[""Romeo and Juliet: Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting sue over 1968 film's 'sexual abuse'""]";['2023-01-04T09:17:34.000Z'];['By Steven McIntosh'];['film'];['sue', 'films', 'trusted', '16', 'franco', 'friend', 'metoo', 'sexual', 'lead', 'hussey', 'olivia', 'violate', 'romeo', 'abuse', 'whiting', 'juliet', 'leonard', 'took', 'options', 'trust'];"
The stars of the Oscar-winning 1968 film Romeo and Juliet are suing Paramount Pictures for sexual abuse over a nude scene they appeared in.
Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were teenagers when they made the movie.
In a new legal case, the English actors, now in their 70s, claim director Franco Zeffirelli encouraged them to do nude scenes despite previous assurances that they would not have to.
Paramount has not yet publicly responded to the claim.
The two actors are seeking damages of more than $500m (£417m), based on suffering they say they have experienced and the revenue brought in by the film since its release.
They claim Zeffirelli, who died in 2019, initially told them they would wear flesh-coloured underwear in the bedroom scene.
But on the morning of the shoot, they allege the director told them they would wear only body make-up, while assuring them the camera would be positioned to not show nudity.
In the final film, Whiting's bare buttocks and Hussey's bare breasts were briefly shown during the scene.
Zeffirelli told them they must act in the nude ""or the picture would fail"" and their careers would be hurt, the pair claim in the lawsuit. The actors ""believed they had no choice but to act in the nude in body makeup as demanded"".
Whiting was then aged 16 and is now 72, while Hussey was 15 when the film was shot and is now 71.
The pair are suing Paramount for sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud.
The lawsuit accuses the Hollywood studio of sexually exploiting the two young actors and distributing nude images of adolescent children.
The court filing says Whiting and Hussey have suffered emotional damage and mental anguish for decades as a result of the way they were treated.
The film was a huge success at the time, and has been shown to generations of students studying the Shakespeare play since.
It was nominated for four Oscars, including best director and best picture, and won two - for cinematography and costume design.
The lawsuit was filed on Friday in Santa Monica Superior Court under a California law that has temporarily suspended the statute of limitations - which means action cannot normally be taken once a certain time has elapsed - for child sex abuse.
The suspension has led to a host of new lawsuits and the revival of many others that were previously dismissed.
""What they were told and what went on were two different things,"" Tony Marinozzi, a business manager for the two actors, told trade publication Variety.
""They trusted Franco. At 16, as actors, they took his lead that he would not violate that trust they had. Franco was their friend, and frankly, at 16, what do they do? There are no options. There was no #MeToo.""
Solomon Gresen, a lawyer for the pair, added in a statement: ""Nude images of minors are unlawful and shouldn't be exhibited.
""These were very young, naive children in the 60s who had no understanding of what was about to hit them.
""All of a sudden they were famous at a level they never expected, and in addition they were violated in a way they didn't know how to deal with.""
In a 2018 interview with Variety, Hussey defended the nude scene.
""Nobody my age had done that before,"" she said, adding that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. ""It was needed for the film.""
In a separate interview with Fox News, also conducted in 2018, she said the scene was ""taboo"" in the US, but that nudity was common in European films at the time.
""It wasn't that big of a deal,"" she said. ""And Leonard wasn't shy at all! In the middle of shooting, I just completely forgot I didn't have clothes on.""

42;['If not Kevin McCarthy for US House Speaker, then who else?'];['2023-01-04T11:10:31.000Z'];['By Sam Cabral'];['republican party', 'us politics', 'us congress', 'united states'];['mccarthy', 'jordan', 'mr', 'kevin', 'support', 'votes', 'speaker', 'round', 'spoke', 'rounds', 'representative', 'house', 'received'];"
Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has failed to be elected Speaker of the US House of Representatives - but if not him, who else could fill the role?
After three consecutive rounds of voting on Tuesday, the first day of a new Congress, Mr McCarthy fell short of the 218 votes he needed to clinch the job.
Until the House has its presiding officer in place, the body is not swearing in its new members or moving on with its legislative business.
The voting will continue on Wednesday and the California congressman insists he can eventually win over his detractors. 
He remains the favourite to get the famous gavel in his hands but as time goes on, other options may become more palatable.
The Louisiana congressman, 57, has been Mr McCarthy's deputy since 2019.
Mr Scalise, who is entering his eighth term in the House, survived being shot and wounded by a left-wing extremist while practising for the annual congressional baseball game in 2017.
In an internal Republican Party election this past November, he was elected unopposed by his colleagues for the position of majority leader, the second-highest rank in the House.
On Tuesday, he nominated Mr McCarthy for speaker in the third round of voting, telling his colleagues to come together if they want to ""get big things done"".
But Matt Rosendale, a Montana congressman who is one of the 20 Republican holdouts blocking Mr McCarthy's bid for speaker, appeared to throw cold water Tuesday on the possibility of a Speaker Scalise. He said neither Mr McCarthy nor anyone who has been in Republican House leadership over the past 10 years were acceptable to him.
Elected to the House in 2014, Ms Stefanik was the youngest woman elected to Congress at the time, aged 30.
Once the vice-president of Harvard University's prestigious Institute of Politics, the New Yorker won election to the House as a moderate.
But the 38-year-old has veered sharply to the right in recent years, most notably by her outspoken support for Donald Trump.
In May 2021, as Republicans ousted Liz Cheney from leadership over her criticisms of Mr Trump, Ms Stefanik was elected to replace her as chair of the House Republican Conference, making her the fourth highest ranking member of the party. She was re-elected to the position this November.
Ms Stefanik also nominated Mr McCarthy for speaker in Tuesday's first round of voting and was seen taking notes throughout the session.
The revolt against Mr McCarthy has been led in part by Andy Biggs, an Arizona congressman who is part of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mr Biggs, 64, was nominated by a colleague as an alternative option for Speaker on Tuesday but received only 10 votes, including his own, in the first round.
Another name pitched for Speaker was Representative Jim Jordan, a conservative firebrand from Ohio. Mr Jordan, 58, received only six votes in the first round, but then consolidated support from all of Mr McCarthy's detractors in the next two rounds. But the congressman, who is in line to assume chairmanship of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, insists he does not want the job and spoke in favour of electing Mr McCarthy on Tuesday.
Neither Mr Biggs nor Mr Jordan are seen as lawmakers who could be acceptable to a majority of their colleagues as speaker.
In three successive ballots, all 212 Democrats in the chamber voted for their own leader, New York congressman Hakeem Jeffries. But the likelihood of six Republicans crossing the aisle to support Mr Jeffries as the consensus pick for Speaker is very low.
Candidates for speaker must be nominated by members of the House, but they don't need to be elected lawmakers of the chamber, according to the US Constitution. 
The chamber has always elected a House member as speaker, but it has seen nominations of non-House members in the past, including Joe Biden in 2019. 
Could we hear a Republican nominate Donald Trump for speaker on Wednesday?

43;['The making of a young Hero of Ukraine'];['2022-12-22T06:04:45.000Z'];['By Quentin Sommerville'];['russia-ukraine war', 'ukraine'];['hero', 'making', 'way', 'russians', 'southeast', 'stark', 'ukraine', 'temperature', 'wind', 'young', 'skin', 'summer', 'trees', 'rifle'];"
This is a war where Ukrainian fathers and sons serve on the same frontlines. And this was how it was for 22-year-old Eugene Gromadskyi - at least at the very beginning.
On the first day of the invasion, he stood shoulder to shoulder with his father Oleg on the outskirts of Kharkiv, as column after column of Russian men and armoured vehicles sought to capture their city.
In those crucial first hours he was in command of  a unit, which, outnumbered and outgunned, attacked and destroyed Russian vehicle columns and captured prisoners. For this, Eugene would earn the country's highest military honour. His father would face a different fate.
Eugene has been in the thick of it for almost the entire war. He started out as a lieutenant in the National Guard, now he's a senior lieutenant in the army's 92nd Mechanized Brigade, which is named after Ivan Sirko, a 17th Century Cossack military leader. The intelligence platoon Eugene commands describe themselves as Sirko's Rowdy Boys - their motto is ""Revenge for all"". ""They are my family,"" he tells me
It is a December morning in Kupyiansk, some 120km (75 miles) south-east of Kharkiv, and the temperature is -7C, even before the howling wind hits you and finds its way into every inch of loose clothing or exposed skin.  It is mostly open ground - there is no cover from the wind, nor from the Russians who in places are within rifle range. Lines of trees, which in the summer provided camouflage, are now stark and bare. There is nowhere to hide.
But Eugene glows with vitality. He explains that the early days of the war were frustrating. Ukrainian forces took back a village or two, there was little momentum. They were on the defensive and under-prepared, then a summer stalemate set in. But in September, a coordinated counter-offensive began, starting from Balakliya and going all the way down to Kupyiansk. 
Ukraine's growing military confidence, and Eugene's are inseparable. 
I first met him in early March. He had recently graduated from university and was full of courage but fresh to conflict and on the defensive. What he didn't tell me at the time was how he and his comrades under his command had captured the Russian prisoners. His bravery a matter for record, he was later awarded the country's top military honour, Hero of Ukraine, Order of the Gold Star. 
Eugene has countless missions under his belt, and like the landscape around him, bears the scarred lessons of conflict.
War toughens the heart, and death is its companion. Eugene has lost many men close to him, so I ask, given the high casualty rate - Ukraine says 13,000 of its soldiers have been killed so far in the war - does he fear death?
""Death is one of [war's] problems. Death loves brave ones. And courage must be used cleverly. There is no need to be afraid of death,"" he says. But he reconsiders for a moment, and continues: ""The person who is not afraid is already dead… I don't think about mortality, I think only about life, about life of my comrades and the life of my unit.""
We ride inside one of his platoon's armoured personnel carriers (APC). The noise is deafening, even before its 30mm cannon opens fire on some farm buildings where they suspect Russians are hiding. Condensation drips from the metal roof, two dim lights emit a pale-green glow, and the vehicle's eight, sturdy wheels slip and slide through the mud, swaying us from side to side. I feel as if I'm in a submarine.
Above the din, Eugene explains why the September operation was key: ""It was really important for the boys that we were able to accomplish a counter-offensive. Everyone was very motivated, they were taking back their own territory, taking back homes of their own families. It was really needed."" As if to underscore this point, in the front seat of the APC is Sasha. He only recently joined the platoon after his village was liberated from the Russians.
A black-and-white targeting screen offers the only view of the road ahead. It is a quagmire - there are few obstacles as fiendish, or varied, as Ukrainian mud. One moment it's a deep, sucking soup, the next a thick putty clogging machinery, weighing down boots, and gumming up everything. We drive past one soldier who is hammering frozen chunks of it off his stranded truck with a mallet.
Small wonder, then, that in these conditions, and in the face of stiff resistance from enemy forces, the counter-offensive is bogged down here. And so are we - the APC can go no further. It doesn't pay to be trapped out here in open ground, so we turn around. Days later another Ukrainian vehicle would become stuck at the same spot. A Russian helicopter attacked, causing significant casualties.
Inside the APC, despite the din, Eugene falls into a deep sleep. He had only two hours rest the night before, and he remains sound asleep until the vehicle makes it back to base and the heavy steel handle by his ear clunks open.
The unit, which has its own Instagram page, is crammed into a few rooms in an abandoned house. A huge pot filled with potatoes and pork sits atop a wood-burning stove. Eugene eats standing.
The counter-offensive has taken its toll on Ukrainian equipment and men along this front. A punishing winter lies ahead. But Eugene, as ever, is optimistic.
""I think it will be very difficult, but we will manage,"" he says. ""Our reserves of troops are growing, the ones who were getting trained abroad. They will be additional reserves, additional forces who will help us with further offensives. For now, there are difficulties especially with the weather. But it doesn't stop us because we are taking back our land step by step, corner by corner.""
Ukraine's defence had an improvised and precarious feel at the start. The country was underprepared. Before the invasion President Zelensky had dismissed talk of war, saying that the country should keep calm, it would celebrate Easter in April and come May, the country would be occupied with sun, holidays and BBQs, not war.
A week into the war Kharkiv was still in turmoil. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, busloads of reinforcements arrived then quickly disappeared again, pushed forward to halt the Russians who were still trying to force their way into the city. It was freezing cold, but the air was electric with a desperate, hurried energy. But the lieutenant was coolheaded, ""Call me Eugene,"" he said, in English, with a smile.
I saw a very young man - surely too young to be in command - who like his country was battling against the odds in a war with Russia. He lacked a winter uniform and army boots, instead he was wearing trainers. ""I can move fast in these,"" he joked. 
We jumped into one of the few armoured vehicles around and headed to the front, a fur Russian army hat, from a captured soldier, swinging from the ceiling as we bumped along rutted, snow-covered roads.
The snows thawed, spring became summer, and Ukraine held on. Eugene and I kept in touch, and he would send videos of him and his men in battle. In one, he's smiling broadly while riding atop a tank. We met again in late April on a warm afternoon in Kharkiv. There had been no holidays nor BBQs for him.
He was still fighting, though now well beyond the city limits. His uniform was filthy, and he stayed only a short while, before heading back to the front. A patch on his uniform read, ""Stop: no touch, no talk, no eye contact"".

He was in good spirits, grinning as ever. And despite the hardships of battle, he was clearly in his element. He still believed Ukraine could win. By then Russia's military inadequacies had been exposed and western military aid was beginning to make a difference, though a large-scale push against the invading Russian forces still hadn't happened. There were questions over whether it ever would.
Eugene Gromadskyi needs little reminder of what Russian aggression has cost him - it's there every time he looks in the mirror. On the left side of his face a deep red scar is still healing.
We had lost touch in May. It's not unusual for soldiers to go offline, but 10 days went by and still he was out of reach. Eventually, he reappeared and sent a selfie as way of an explanation. He was in hospital, his face swollen and barely recognisable. It looks like he is trying to smile, but he can't, so instead gives a defiant hand gesture.
At the Kupyiansk front, he told me what had happened. ""Me and my comrade were on a combat mission,"" he explains.
""We came under fire and a shell exploded near me and shrapnel hit my face, near my lip and apparently came out at my temple. [In hospital] an operation was performed, I was put back together, they didn't need to use metal plates.""
He checked himself out of hospital after only 10 days and returned to the front with a broken jaw. ""It wasn't nice,"" he says and smiles broadly.
But Eugene had suffered an even greater wound on the first day of the war. 
In the early hours of 24 February, he had been commanding a small unit of National Guardsmen in the village of Pyatikhatky, when he was joined by his father, Oleg.
Oleg had been asleep in the family apartment on the edge of Kharkiv when he was awoken by his wife Natalia, who said she could hear Russian Grads nearby. The former army officer had trained hundreds of young recruits in battlefield care, so she knew her artillery.
Duty and service to their country runs through the veins and history of the family - seven generations have served in the Ukrainian and Soviet military. Ukraine was under attack, and Oleg, an army veteran who had retired at the rank of Colonel, would answer the call.
He posted a message on Facebook, rallying friends and former servicemen to gather weapons and equipment to defend the city, and went to join his son. 
Some Russian forces had already made it into Kharkiv but were driven back. The fighting was intense - Oleg manned a machine gun, while his son gave support with an automatic grenade launcher. They were outgunned and had to retreat. Oleg stayed behind to gather weapons, and father and son planned to regroup further back. But as he left his position, Oleg's car was caught in a rocket attack. 
He was killed instantly.
Natalia had been sheltering in a city metro station, when she was told her husband had died. During breaks in the shelling, she headed to the area where she had been told Oleg had been killed. She discovered his body on the city's outskirts. 
""I picked up my husband and took him to morgue. It was just me and him. I said goodbye over there. I conducted a body examination to make sure it was him.""
Eugene was in the midst of battle when he learned of his father's death. He would later return home and bury Oleg alone. But for the moment, he set aside grief and took charge of another combat unit of 20 men. Cut off from their command, they destroyed more Russian vehicles, killing and capturing enemy soldiers.
""To this day, [my father's] friends and comrades who served with him write to me,"" Eugene tells me. ""They say, 'We are proud we served with your father because he was a man of honour and as he said, so he did.' He always kept his officer's word.""
On 24 September, at a ceremony in Kyiv, President Zelensky, made Eugene a Hero of Ukraine, bestowing on him the country's highest military order for bravery in the early defence of Kharkiv. His father's close friend, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, looked on as he received his medals. 
Eugene was so nervous he forgot his own name.
In this country of 44 million people, only 652 have received the medal since the honour was created in 1998.
Eugene's medals now sit in a suitcase in the family apartment. Shortly after Oleg died, Natalia left Kharkiv as Russian attacks intensified. She returned in the early summer, but precious items remain packed, ready for her to leave again if necessary.
Natalia's kitchen is full of home-made Christmas decorations, and an 11-year-old Pekingese Businka is at her feet. It is dark - there is no power, no water or light, because of Russia's ongoing missile attacks.
She tells me how much she misses Oleg. ""He was a patriot. He is a real patriot of our country. A Ukrainian. Fun, friendly, people loved him a lot,"" she says. The couple were about to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary when he was killed.
I ask Natalia if she ever imagined she would have to sacrifice so much. ""I gave my husband; my son is there. And I devoted my youth to Ukraine as well - to my country.""
She makes me tea and serves homemade cookies, and tells me that I should visit again. 
""When did you last see Eugene,"" I ask. She looks towards the door, remembering - perhaps expecting.  ""A month ago,"" she replies, ""for two minutes at the door,"" and she starts to cry.
The following day I am travelling back to the front, and so I ask Natalia if there is anything I could take to her son - even just a message.
She wipes away a tear, and says, ""My son, you should know that I'm always waiting for you. Always. In any weather, any time, day or night."" She pauses, then insists she will wait, ""until victory, only with victory"".

44;['What is known about new Covid variant XBB.1.5?'];['2023-01-04T16:55:12.000Z'];['By Fergus Walsh'];['tracking sars-cov-2 variants', 'lineages (raw) - covid-19 genomic surveillance – wellcome sanger institute'];['better', 'variant', 'wait', 'based', 'xbb15', 'samples', 'week', 'need', 'spreading', 'picture', 'covid', 'known'];"
A new Covid sub-variant is causing some concern in the US, where it is spreading rapidly. 
Some cases have been recorded in the UK, so what do you need to know about XBB.1.5?
It is yet another offshoot of the globally dominant Omicron Covid variant, which itself followed the earlier alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants. 
Omicron has outperformed all previous versions of coronavirus since it emerged in late 2021, and has given rise to many sub-variants which are even more contagious than the original.  
Symptoms of XBB.1.5 are thought to be similar to those of previous Omicron strains, but it's still too early to confirm this. Most people experience cold-like symptoms. 
XBB.1.5 itself evolved from XBB, which began circulating in the UK in September 2022, but which has not been classified as a so-called ""variant of concern"" by health authorities. 
XBB had a mutation that helped it beat the body's immune defences, but this same quality also reduced its ability to infect human cells. 
Prof Wendy Barclay from Imperial College London said XBB.1.5 had a mutation known as F486P, which restores this ability to bind to cells while continuing to evade immunity. That makes it spread more easily. 
She said these evolutionary changes were like ""stepping stones"", as the virus evolves to find new ways of bypassing the body's self-defence mechanisms.
Scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Wednesday that XBB.1.5 has a ""growth advantage"" above all other sub-variants seen so far.
But they said there was no indication it was more serious or harmful than previous Omicron variants. 
The WHO said it would keep a close watch on lab studies, hospital data and infection rates to find out more about its impact on patients.
Over 40% of Covid cases in the United States are estimated to be caused by XBB.1.5, making it the dominant strain in the country.
At the beginning of December, it accounted for only 4% of cases so it has quickly overtaken other versions of Omicron.  
Covid hospital admissions have been rising in recent weeks across the US.  
The UK Health Security Agency is due to release a report on variants spreading in the UK next week, and may refer to XBB.1.5.   
Nothing is certain, but it does look likely. 
The UK had five Omicron waves in 2022, and further spikes in cases are inevitable. 
Figures for the week to Saturday 17 December from the Sanger Institute in Cambridge suggested that one in 25 Covid cases in the UK were XBB.1.5.  
But that was based on just nine samples, so we'll need to wait for a week or two to get a better picture of how it is spreading.  
Prof Barclay said she expected more hospitalisations in the UK if the variant takes off here, ""as we expect it to do"".  
Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia, said: ""The balance of probabilities is that XBB.1.5 will trigger a wave here later this month, but we can't be sure.""  
NHS England has said the fears of a ""twindemic"" of Covid and flu have been realised, with both viruses putting strain on an already stretched NHS. 
Prof Barclay said she was not especially concerned about the general UK population because there was ""no indication"" that XBB.1.5 would ""breakthrough"" the protection against severe illness provided by vaccines. 
But she is worried about its effect on the vulnerable, including the immunocompromised, who get less benefit from Covid jabs.  
Prof Hunter said he'd seen no evidence that XBB.1.5 was more virulent, meaning it was no more likely to ""put you in hospital or kill you"" than existing Omicron variants.  
He added: ""It's ironic that everyone is focussing on possible variants emerging from China, but XBB.1.5 came out of the US."" 
Prof David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine acknowledged that there was still a fair amount to learn about this latest variant. 
But he said it was unlikely to cause major problems in countries like the UK which have high levels of vaccination and previous infections.  
His concern was for countries like China, where there was both low take-up of vaccines and little natural immunity because of prolonged lockdowns.  
""China needs to share clinical information on people infected in order to see how the variant behaves in a non-immune population,"" Prof Heymann said.

45;"[""Pope Benedict had 'undeniable' presence on Francis, says archbishop""]";['2023-01-04T17:32:26.000Z'];['By Aleem Maqbool'];['pope francis ireland visit', 'pope francis', 'roman catholic church'];['pope', 'benedict', 'ministry', 'manage', 'francis', 'stick', 'archbishop', 'presence', 'think', 'principles', 'popes', 'undeniable', 'lord', 'little', 'long'];"
Pope Benedict was still a ""powerful presence"" in the Vatican despite his retirement - the most senior British figure there has told the BBC. 
The comments, by Archbishop Paul Gallagher, have come as the reigning pope, Francis, makes final preparations for the unusual event of a pontiff presiding at the funeral of his predecessor.
After Thursday's burial of former pope Benedict XVI, there will be just one man wearing white in the corridors of the Vatican for the first time in nearly a decade.
It is rare for a senior Vatican figure to have spoken frankly about the relationship between the two popes.
""I think it is inevitable that the fact Pope Benedict has been living during these years of Pope Francis's pontificate - it does have an effect,"" said the archbishop, who has been the Vatican's foreign secretary for much of the current papacy.
""I do not think it has obstructed Pope Francis in any way. He has done and said and decided what he wanted to do, but it is a powerful presence of your predecessor,"" he said candidly.
In 2013, Pope Benedict became the first pope in more than 600 years to step down.
Archbishop Gallagher said that for Pope Francis, that was similar to the experience many other people go through doing a job in the shadow of a predecessor - and being compared to them.
Observers of Vatican affairs during this unusual time suggest that whether Benedict courted it or not, he became something of a lightning rod for internal criticism of Pope Francis.
""Obviously there have been, in the Church, people who have looked to Benedict to contrast certain decisions that have been made by Pope Francis,"" said Archbishop Gallagher. 
The relationship between the two popes had been excellent, said the archbishop, but critics of the current pope had tried to exploit their differences.
Over the past year, there has been much discussion here about the health of Pope Francis, who has cancelled some foreign trips on health grounds and spent most of his time in a wheelchair during other visits. 
There was speculation that, although Pope Francis said he was prepared to step down if he felt he could not carry out the duties of the role in the way he would like to, he was reluctant to consider resigning while his predecessor was around.

Watch: Pope Benedict XVI through the years
His foreign secretary, Archbishop Gallagher, acknowledged that events of the past week had changed the equation to potentially allow the current Pope to consider all options more freely.
""If we had three popes, that would be a little bit difficult to manage. But now that Pope Benedict has gone to the Lord, I think that Pope Francis will stick to those principles that he has established - that he will continue in this ministry as long as he believes that he is capable,"" he said. 
He clarified that he did not think a decision about stepping down was in any way imminent.
Although the number of people who have come to pay their respects to Pope Benedict as he lies in state has far exceeded the figure the Vatican initially said it was expecting, it does not come close to the huge crowds that were drawn here in 2005 after the death of the popular Pope John Paul II.
That is partly, as Archbishop Gallagher acknowledges, because of Benedict XVI's style of papacy, being viewed as more of a thinker than a pastor or a skilled politician. 
Although the archbishop said he thought the writings and theological works of the Pope Emeritus would be studied long into the future.
There has also been much discussion in recent days about the complicated legacy of the former pontiff, particularly the issue of inadequately dealing with sex abuse perpetrators.
""I think that the evaluation [of Benedict XVI's legacy on abuse] is obviously going to be critical, but I do believe that the election of Pope Benedict was a game changer in how the Church looked at the reality of abuse in the church,"" said Archbishop Gallagher, suggesting that the late Pope started initiatives that Pope Francis has since moved forward with.
""Whether enough was done at the right speed, that will be left to history and I do not think anybody here would say that we have completed the job.""

47;"[""Damar Hamlin: How anti-vaxxers exploited player's collapse""]";['2023-01-04T22:59:22.000Z'];['By Mike Wendling and Rachel Schraer'];['anti-vaccination movement', 'disinformation', 'fake news'];['damar', 'hamlin', 'collapse', 'previously', 'film', 'match', 'looked', 'suddenly', 'players', 'exploited', 'mentioned', 'released', 'times', 'nearly', 'antivaxxers', 'little'];"
Online activists used the on-field collapse of American football star Damar Hamlin to spread anti-vaccination messages starting just minutes after Monday night's incident. 
In what has become a familiar pattern since Covid vaccines became available about two years ago, several influential accounts used the event to spread anti-vaccination content. 
They included the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who tweeted: ""Before the covid vaccines we didn't see athletes dropping dead on the playing field like we do now... Time to investigate the covid vaccines.""
That tweet was viewed around a million times within a day. But the idea that young, healthy athletes have never collapsed suddenly before Covid vaccines is easily disproven. 
A US study looking at athletes over four years found many unexplained deaths were in fact caused by cardiac arrest - a cause more common in male and African-American players. 
A study from 2016 notes that there are approximately 100 to 150 sudden cardiac deaths during competitive sports in the United States each year. 
While rare and potentially dangerous cases of heart inflammation have been associated with some Covid vaccines, these real cases have been muddled together with unrelated illnesses and misinterpreted, sometimes cherry-picked data. 
Combined with a wave of anti-vaccine activity online throughout the pandemic, it has given birth to a group of activists who ascribe nearly any tragic or unexplained death to vaccines. 
The loudest voices in the anti-vaccination lobby have followed this pattern throughout the pandemic, even though heart problems are a symptom of Covid itself. 
Hamlin, a defensive back for the Buffalo Bills, suffered a cardiac arrest during Monday night's high-profile matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. 
On Wednesday he remained in hospital, but an uncle said he was showing signs of improving. There has been no further information about any underlying causes which could have contributed to his cardiac arrest. 
Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a non-profit campaign group based in London and Washington, found that mentions of an anti-vaccine film quadrupled after the player's collapse. 
CCDH chief executive Imran Ahmed said activists were ""cynically exploiting tragedy to baselessly connect any injury or death of a notable person to vaccinations"".
The day after the match the documentary Died Suddenly, which was released in November last year, was mentioned nearly 17,000 times, the CCDH says. The BBC previously looked into the claims in the film and found little or no evidence behind many of them. 
Caroline Orr Bueno, a researcher on misinformation who has spent a decade looking at the anti-vaccination movement, says the film gave rise to communities of people across several social media platforms primed to hunt for news events to back up their views.  
""They believe the anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are seeing,"" she says, ""and they are joining in out of genuine concern without necessarily knowing that they're being misled."" 
A Twitter account promoting the Died Suddenly video sent out a message just minutes after Hamlin was transported off the field in Cincinnati claiming there was an ""undeniable pattern"". 
When contacted for a response, the owners of the account responded with a list of anecdotal reports of athletes suffering heart problems.
Backers of the film and other anti-vaccination activists collect news reports of heart attacks and unexplained deaths, automatically ascribing them to Covid-19 vaccines. 
This focused obsession has created a hypersensitive pattern-spotting spiral, with activists and followers often believing the link between every sudden athlete death and vaccines is ""obvious"", although there is scant solid research to back up their claims. 
While it might seem unusual for young, healthy people to experience heart problems, there are important differences between a heart attack and cardiac arrest. 
Most heart attacks are caused by blockages in arteries and are associated with older people as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and diet. 
Most cardiac arrests are caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system which keeps it pumping. These heart rhythm malfunctions are often genetically inherited and can be seen in young people who appear otherwise healthy. 
Premier League fans will remember the dramatic moment in 2012 when Bolton's Fabrice Muamba collapsed, having suffered a cardiac arrest. The 23-year-old's heart stopped beating for 78 minutes.
A 2018 study by the Football Association looked back over 20 years of data from screening more than 11,000 players and found not only were cardiac deaths more common than previously thought - although still rare - but that most of them were in people with no previously diagnosed heart problem. 
One of the first clear examples of anti-vaccination activists taking advantage of a high-profile news event was the televised collapse of Danish football star Christian Eriksen during the European football championships in June 2021. 
Influential accounts immediately began blaming Covid vaccines. 
Only after the initial wave of speculation and misinformation was it revealed by the director of Eriksen's club at the time, Inter Milan, that the midfielder had not received a Covid-19 vaccine prior to his collapse.
In November, Twitter stopped enforcing its Covid misinformation policy, a development that Imran Ahmed of the CCDH called ""particularly worrying"". 
""Anti-vax lies are deadly and platforms must stop allowing dedicated spreaders of disinformation from abusing their platforms and the trust of other users.""
The BBC has contacted Twitter and Marjorie Taylor Greene for comment.

48;['Why this congressman is using Superman comic for swearing-in'];['2023-01-04T23:45:06.000Z'];['By Brandon Drenon'];['us congress', 'united states'];['swearingin', 'taking', 'article', 'test', 'congressman', 'comic', 'united', 'unorthodox', 'superman', 'office', 'technically', 'states', 'using', 'trust'];"
Incoming US congressman Robert Garcia will be sworn in using the US Constitution - and a Superman comic.
In a tweet on Tuesday, he said it is one of three items he will use that ""mean a lot to me personally"". 
The other two are a photo of his parents, who he said were lost to Covid-19, and his citizenship certificate. 
Mr Garcia is still waiting to take the oath of office, however, after Republicans failed to elect a speaker.
A Democrat from Long Beach, California, and the city's former mayor before being elected to the House of Representatives, he has a record of sharing his graphic novel fandom on Twitter. 
""Anyone who understands comics knows that comics are an essential part of American fiction,"" he tweeted in November. ""And the lessons learned are invaluable."" 
Mr Garcia - who will take the oath using a vintage Superman comic from 1939 - cites lessons that are distinctive to his upbringing as both an immigrant and a member of the LGBT community.
The congressman-elect was brought to the US from Peru by his mother when he was five years old. He is openly gay and married.
In 2021, after DC Comics announced the new Superman would be bisexual, Mr Garcia tweeted: ""I became a Superman fan as a kid because I related to him. An immigrant, a sense of justice, and a secret identity.""
Although using the Superman comic may be a bit unorthodox when taking the oath of office, technically it's not illegal, per Article IV of the US Constitution. The Article states, in part, that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States"".
As a result, ""there is no required text upon which an incoming officeholder must take their oath"", said Jane Campbell, president of the United States Capitol Historical Society. 
Throughout history, Ms Campbell said, newly elected members of Congress have used different texts, including Hebrew Scripture, Jewish religious texts, copies of the Quran and the Bhagavad Gita (the Hindu sacred text).
In 2007, Democrat Keith Ellison from Minnesota, the first Muslim elected to Congress, took the oath using a Quran once owned by Thomas Jefferson.
Many of the mementos, like Jefferson's Quran and the Superman comic, are loaned by the Library of Congress for this occasion. Other props loaned by the Library for a ceremonial swearing-in include Rosa Park's pocket Bible and the Biblia Hebraica, the first complete Hebrew Bible published in America. 
But no comic books, yet. 
As the vote for speaker of the House concludes its sixth fruitless round, the world may have to wait a little longer before Superman and Mr Garcia can break the congressional record books.

49;['How small businesses survive global market shocks'];['2023-01-05T00:11:17.000Z'];['By Jill Martin Wrenn'];['female entrepreneurs', 'global trade'];['small', 'street', 'market', 'theyre', 'price', 'global', 'shocks', 'trying', 'resources', 'survive', 'businesses', 'quite', 'outset', 'ms'];"
Sherene Headley got a big surprise when she checked the invoice from her manufacturer in China this past autumn.
The founder and chief executive of Mokkah, a London-based company that makes shoes in large sizes for women, had ordered 57 pairs of black suede boots to sell to customers.
But the manufacturer's invoice, which was priced in US dollars, was about 20% more expensive than Ms Headley had expected.
When the British pound sank to a record low against the US dollar in September, her fledgling company's overseas buying power dropped with it. The pound's fall makes goods priced in dollars much more expensive to buy.
For any business, that can be a shock; for a new business, it can be debilitating.
""A lot of small businesses, their margins are quite small when they're trying to get their businesses out there,"" Ms Headley says. ""So I knew from the outset that I could never compete with the High Street [on price] because we just haven't got the resources to be able to do that.""
From its inception, Mokkah has been a lean, bootstrapped company. Using Crowdfunder, the fundraising platform, Ms Headley raised £13,000 in June 2020, to launch the firm.
Thanks to advice from her business mentor, Ms Headley prices her products high enough to protect against unexpected increased costs.
""Luckily for me, who is new to business, I was able to put some measures in place so my selling rate for the UK would work out OK, even with this increased conversion,"" Ms Headley says.
""It would still allow me the space to be able to be like, 'this is what I could plug back in to get another pair of shoes, or another sample made'.""
While the pound has stabilised since September, it is still historically low against the US dollar.
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.
You might think that this would help Ms Headley boost exports to the US, as her shoes are cheaper to buy in dollars than they would be if the pound was higher. However, the weak pound has meant that the cost of global shipping has risen sharply for UK exporters.
""The real challenge I would say, when it does come, is if I was to increase my sales abroad,"" says Ms Headley. ""At the moment, I do have quite a few customers that buy from America, but the bulk of my sales are here in the UK.""
For small manufacturers in the US, the high value of the dollar makes their products more expensive for overseas customers, making it harder for them to win export orders.
Molly Fienning, chief executive of South Carolina-based Red Clay Hot Sauce, says she would still love to expand her company's overseas sales in the years ahead.
""We need to find that right [overseas] partner,"" she says. ""We want to really own our backyard, and own the South, then own the US, then think about global.""
Ms Fienning says that in addition to the currency issue, she has seen the cost of key business expenses, such as the price of cardboard boxes and how much she has to pay freight firms, reach their highest levels since she became chief executive in 2018.
To insulate the business from any currency swings, Red Clay only sources its ingredients from within the US. These include sweet peppers, raw honey and white wine vinegar.
""We started with all Southern products, and then as we've scaled, we've needed more peppers and more honey,"" Ms Fienning says.
Now, the company sources peppers from up and down the east coast of the US, from Florida to New York, and uses honey manufacturers in Georgia and Colorado.
Back in the UK, experts say that currency volatility is just one of numerous challenges for small firms. ""I would say in general small UK companies are being challenged on several fronts,"" says financial commentator Todd Benjamin.
""These include Brexit, a weaker currency if importing materials, higher labour costs due to wage inflation, higher taxation due to the chancellor's announcement in the Autumn Statement, and an economy that is weaker for the foreseeable future.""
In Istanbul, Pinar Büyükbalci, associate professor of entrepreneurship at the city's Yildiz Technical University, says that global investors are increasingly wary of investing in emerging economies that have seen their currencies drop sharply against the dollar, such as Turkey and its lira.
""What we have been witnessing over the last year and a half is the very strict and cautious approach of foreign investors, when thinking about making further investment in start-ups in Turkey, and also in all other emerging markets,"" she says.
Timuçin Bilgör, the president of the Turkish-based investor network, Buba Ventures, agrees that it is now more difficult for new firms to find overseas investment. ""The challenge is finding money,"" he says, adding that investors want to see more proof of success before they take the plunge. 
With higher interest global rates, funds are also now more expensive. ""The money is not cheap anymore,"" says Mr Bilgör. 
The bottom line for new businesses is to prepare for anything, and to try to add padding to prices to allow for shocks.
""So when it came to me creating my brand, luckily I was able to build in certain room for issues,"" says Mokkah's Ms Headley. ""I didn't really expect it to be a currency thing, and I'm hoping that with time it starts to improve.""

Family members of Anjali Singh, the 20-year-old whose death in a horrific hit-and-run case has sparked protests in India, remember her as a cheerful person who loved making Instagram Reels and playing with children. BBC Hindi's Dilnawaz Pasha pieces together a portrait of the woman whose dreams came to a violent end on a cold winter night.
On her now-deactivated Instagram profile, Anjali uploaded videos of herself wearing glossy clothes while dancing and lip-syncing to popular Bollywood songs, like she didn't have a care in the world.
Her real life was starkly different. 
Anjali was the sole breadwinner of a family that depended on free food distributed by the government to economically disadvantaged Indians. She earned a living by offering make-up services to women in her neighbourhood and doing small jobs at weddings and other events.
It was a hard life, but they never gave up hope, says her mother Rekha. Until now.
Anjali died in the early hours of New Year's Day after her scooter and a car collided in India's capital Delhi. Police say that the five occupants of the car panicked after the collision and kept going for miles, dragging her body along. They have been arrested.
According to the post-mortem report, the provisional cause of Anjali's death was ""shock and haemorrhage due to injury to the head, spine, left femur and both lower limbs"". 
Anjali's family had alleged that she was sexually assaulted because her                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 body was naked when it was recovered, but police have said that the post-mortem exam showed no signs of this.
While the investigation continues, Anjali's relatives are struggling to come to terms with what has happened.
Anjali belonged to the Dalit (formerly untouchable) community, which is at the bottom of a harsh, unforgiving caste hierarchy in India. She lived in a small house, with one room and a kitchen, in north-west Delhi's Mangolpuri area.
Anjali was the second of six siblings and had dropped out of school as a teenager to support her family. 
Rekha, whose husband had died eight years ago, worked as a low-paid assistant in a school but lost her job during the Covid lockdown. That was around the time she developed chronic kidney disease which made it impossible for her to work.
""Anjali then took on all the responsibility for the family,"" her mother says.
She learnt how to do make-up at a local beauty parlour and soon began helping neighbours who wanted to dress up for weddings and other functions. She would also earn some money by working at weddings, where she was usually part of a group of women who welcomed guests.
Two of her sisters, including a younger sibling, were married. But Anjali said she would settle down after her younger brothers, who are studying at a local government school, finished their education.
""She said she would only marry if her partner agreed to stay with us so she could continue taking care of us,"" Rekha says.
Though life was hard, Anjali remained cheerful and optimistic.
""She was always smiling. She loved making Reels and videos, and dressing up,"" her mother says.
Anjali was also well-known in her neighbourhood - Rekha says her daughter's complaints to local politicians had ensured that the potholes on their street were fixed. Around the time of her death, she had been trying to get a proper drain built in the area.
""Our neighbours even asked her to contest municipal elections, and she promised them she would do so in future,"" Rekha says.
Five years ago, Anjali took out a loan and bought a scooter to help her travel around. She was close to paying it off when she died - while riding the same scooter.

51;['US House in disorder amid popcorn and palace intrigue'];['2023-01-05T05:07:10.000Z'];['By Holly Honderich'];['washington dc', 'republican party', 'us congress', 'united states'];['palace', 'disorder', 'wriggling', 'representative', 'amid', 'strapped', 'sling', 'popcorn', 'intrigue', 'gomez', 'meant', 'hodge', 'rounds', 'vote', 'house', 'took'];"
By the time the House of Representatives adjourned late on Wednesday after Republicans failed on their sixth attempt to elect a new speaker, tempers had flared, a chorus of booing had erupted, and gleeful Democrats munched popcorn as turmoil engulfed the other side of the aisle.
After two days of backroom dealings, Republicans and Democrats could not even agree on whether to call it a night - the knife-edge vote to adjourn prompted shouts and confusion. On CNN, an anchor pondered: ""Is this normal?""
What should have been a straightforward vote for Republicans, who hold a majority in the lower chamber, has turned into a political drama that has paralysed the third branch of American government.
Wednesday was day two of the chaotic saga, as a group of hard-line Republicans refused repeatedly to support party leader Kevin McCarthy, denying him his long-coveted speaker position and bringing all other House business screeching to a halt. 
""Well, it's Groundhog Day. Again,"" congresswoman Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said from the floor as she again nominated Mr McCarthy to lead the chamber.
Now the deadlock in the 118th Congress will drag on into Thursday - the longest vote for a speaker in a century.
When the members of the House entered the chamber on Tuesday, there was a sense of celebration in the air. 
The first day of a new Congress is typically a family affair. Parents, spouses and children crowded the chamber and surrounding hallways, hoping to see their loved ones take the oath of office.
For four-month-old Hodge Gomez, that meant meant naps and nappy changes in the US Capitol while his father, California Representative Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat, took part in the first rounds of ballots. Network cameras at one point captured a chubby-cheeked Hodge wriggling in a sling strapped to his father's chest as the congressman cast his vote.
""He loved it,"" Mr Gomez said. 
But as the first ballot became a second, then a third, that initial enthusiasm faded. Members paced back and forth in the chamber, some letting their heads loll back over their chairs. Pennsylvania Democrat Madeline Dean handed out chocolate to a bored-looking Representative Larry Nadler. 
Mr McCarthy sat placidly in his chair, managing to laugh ruefully amid the dysfunction around him. 
After a long night of negotiations, the lawmakers returned on Wednesday. 
Speaking from the House floor to nominate Mr McCarthy, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin attempted something of a pep talk, reminding his colleagues how lucky they were to be there. 
""It looks messy,"" he said. ""But democracy is messy.""
Indeed, over the next nine hours and three roll-call votes, it kept looking messier. 
Throughout the day, increasingly weary-looking Republicans navigated the chamber, gathering for huddles and increasingly animated debate as Democrats looked on. 
Florida's Matt Gaetz - a leader of the anti-McCarthy group - held court with as many as 15 Republicans at one time, including some of Mr McCarthy's allies. At one point, he cornered Steve Scalise, Mr McCarthy's deputy, gesticulating animatedly while Mr Scalise simply shook his head, covering his face with his hands. 
""He's a desperate guy,"" Mr Gaetz said of Mr McCarthy. ""I'm ready to vote all night, all week, all month and never for that person.""
The calm exterior that Mr McCarthy had managed to present a day earlier slipped slightly on Wednesday. Looking increasingly agitated, the California Republican fidgeted with his glasses, stared at his phone and left his seat repeatedly for discussions outside the chamber. 
With each passing vote, tension seemed to build. In a speech nominating Mr McCarthy for a sixth ballot, Ms Cammack, the Florida Republican, claimed that Democrats had been drinking alcohol on the House floor, a baseless allegation that drew furious boos and shouts from the other side of the aisle.
As Democrats, the minority party, tried to put forward their leader, Hakeem Jeffries, for speaker, the Republican rebels countered by nominating another black congressman, Byron Donalds. 
One of the Republican dissidents, Texas congressman Chip Roy, noted it was the first time in history that two African Americans had been nominated for the high office. Lawmakers from both parties rose to applaud.
But such flashes of bipartisanship were rare. 
Some Democrats could not hide their delight at the Republican disarray. Several tweeted pictures of themselves bringing buckets of popcorn to the chamber floor. President Joe Biden, departing the White House for an event in Kentucky, described the congressional deadlock as ""really embarrassing"".
Increasingly, too, there was a feeling of disbelief that a typically ceremonial vote had come to this. Each time a rebel Republican rose to nominate a challenger to McCarthy the sound of groans grew louder, as members prepared for another futile round of voting.
Despite all the horse-trading, little has changed. Mr McCarthy has vowed to keep fighting, meaning another day of political disarray is probably in store.

A survivor of a deadly helicopter collision in Australia had tried to warn a pilot of impending danger, a video appears to show.
In the footage, a passenger in the backseat of the aircraft is seen tapping the pilot's shoulder.
Pilot Michael James turns his head in response, while the passenger then grips his seat.
The helicopter and another collided a moment later, killing a UK couple and two Australians on the other aircraft.
The footage - obtained by Australia's 7 News - was filmed on board a Sea World sightseeing helicopter that was descending on the Gold Coast on Monday afternoon. 
Mr James managed to land the helicopter safely after the rotor blade of an ascending helicopter crashed through its windscreen. 
Five of the six people on board the descending helicopter suffered minor injuries. 
Three other people on board the other aircraft were badly injured, after it fell rapidly to the ground.
The four people killed were Sydney resident Vanessa Tadros, British couple Diane Hughes, 57, and her 65-year-old husband Ron, and 40-year-old Sea World Helicopters pilot Ashley Jenkinson.
The footage will be passed on to experts investigating the tragedy, 7 News reported. 
Investigators say they are looking into what caused the collision, including the situation in the two cockpits.

India's Supreme Court is set to decide on Thursday whether thousands of people in the northern state of Uttarakhand will be evicted from their homes.
Government officials have alleged that the residents have encroached on land that belongs to Indian Railways.
In December, the Uttarakhand high court asked railway authorities to clear the land after giving a week's notice to occupants.
But residents have been protesting, saying they have nowhere to go.
Media reports say around 50,000 people will be left homeless if the Supreme Court decides to uphold the high court's order. They live in neighbourhoods situated on a 2km-strip (1.24 miles) of land near Uttarakhand's Haldwani railway station. 
On 20 December, a two-judge bench of the high court had asked the railways to ""use the forces to any extent determining upon need"" to evict the ""unauthorised occupants"" after giving them a week's notice.
The legal battle began after a public interest litigation on illegal mining in the area was filed in 2013 - later, the scope of the case was widened to include the alleged encroachments as well.
From 1 January, the residents started getting eviction notices, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
Hundreds of people - including women and children - have been protesting for days against the order.
Some residents told The Times of India newspaper that they were being harassed without cause and asked how schools and hospitals could have operated in the area without permission.
""How can one deny the structures that were made during the British era? The railways has no documents to support its claim,"" one man told the newspaper.
A senior official has said that the Indian Railways has ""old maps, a 1959 notification, revenue records from 1971, and the results of"" a 2017 survey to prove their claim.
The state's chief minister has said that his government will follow whatever the Supreme Court decides.
Uttarakhand, a hilly state, is currently experiencing a cold wave, with the minimum temperature hovering around the 1C mark.

Last year was the UK's warmest year on record, the Met Office has confirmed. 
The average annual temperature in 2022 was more than 10C for the first time, the national weather service said.
The mean temperature across the 12 months was 10.03C - topping the previous all-time high of 9.88C in 2014.
It means 15 of the UK's top 20 warmest years on record have all occurred this century - with the entire top 10 within the past two decades.
Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: ""Although an arbitrary number, the UK surpassing an annual average temperature of 10C is a notable moment in our climatological history.
""This moment comes as no surprise, since 1884 all the 10 years recording the highest annual temperature have occurred from 2003.
""It is clear from the observational record that human-induced global warming is already impacting the UK's climate."" 
All four nations set records for heat in 2022, with England seeing the highest average temperature at 10.94C, followed by Wales (10.23C), Northern Ireland (9.85C) and Scotland (8.50C).
A spell of heatwaves in June 2022 led to the UK experiencing its fourth warmest summer on record - and temperatures broke the 40C mark for the first time, leading the Met Office to issue its first-ever red warning for extreme heat. 
The record of 40.3C was recorded at Coningsby in Lincolnshire on 19 July.
The hot summer and months of low rainfall also dried up rivers, damaged crops and fuelled wildfires, with an official drought declared in large parts of England. 
The Met Office said that a UK mean temperature of 10C would have been expected once in 500 years in a natural climate - before humans started producing the emissions responsible for climate change with activities such as burning fossil fuels. 
But it said this was now likely to occur every three to four years.
It isn't just the UK that is feeling the heat.  
We'll get the figures for global average temperatures next week and last year is expected to have been the fourth or fifth hottest year on record.
And this year is expected to be even hotter worldwide.
That is not just because greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, it is also because we are expecting a change in a weather system in the tropical Pacific, known as the El Nino.
Last year it was in a cooling phase - La Nina - but this year it will switch into its warming phase, with unusually warm water off the coast of South America.
This typically drives up average global temperatures.
A recent report on climate extremes in the UK found that recent years have seen both higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells.
That trend is predicted to continue. It is possible that by 2100, the UK could see 40C days every three to four years.
By this point, the Met Office said - with medium levels of greenhouse gas emissions - the 10C average temperature could occur almost every year.

57;['China Covid: How is it tackling the latest surge in cases?'];['2022-12-05T00:20:31.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'china', 'vaccination', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['cases', 'market', 'kong', 'living', 'surge', 'german', 'available', 'hong', 'currently', 'macau', 'nationals', 'china', 'covid', 'latest', 'mainland', 'tackling'];"
Hospitals in China are reported to be filling up with Covid patients after infections surged when the country relaxed its lockdown rules.
The government says it is ramping up its vaccination programme. 
In December, China dropped mass testing in cities and regions where there have been outbreaks. 
People are no longer required to go into quarantine in state facilities if they or someone they have been in contact with tests positive.
There are reports of hospitals filling up with patients and a growing demand for funeral services.
But officially, China is reporting relatively low numbers of Covid cases and a tiny number of deaths.
Because it has ended its mass testing programme, Chinese authorities no longer have reliable figures for the number of Covid infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked it to provide specific data on disease severity and hospital admissions.
The WHO has also asked for more data on vaccination rates, especially amongst vulnerable groups and those over 60 years old.
The EU has confirmed that it's ready offer surplus vaccines to China, which has so far largely relied on its own home-produced vaccines.
Official figures for November 2022 suggest Chinese health authorities have now vaccinated 40% of over-80s with two jabs and a booster. 
People in this age range are the most vulnerable to the virus. 
This is a big improvement on China's past performance.
In April 2022, fewer than 20% of over-80s had had two jabs and a booster. 
China is now reported to have set a goal for 90% of its over-80s to receive either the initial two vaccination jabs, or both plus a booster, by the end of January.
However, vaccinations alone may not be enough to halt the surge in Covid cases.
Experts believe that because the Chinese population has been locked down so much, many people have not picked up ""hybrid immunity"".
This means they haven't gained protection both from being vaccinated and from being exposed to the virus through other people.  
When China's government started rolling out vaccines in late 2020, it prioritised the working-age population. 
It did not test its vaccines on many elderly people, and told them it could not say whether the jabs were safe for this age group.
The head of China's Covid expert panel, Prof Liang Wannian, says that made some people reluctant to get their jabs.
""Many old people have underlying diseases,"" he says. ""They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated.""
China has mainly used only its domestically-produced vaccines: CoronaVac, made by a company called Sinovac, and Sinopharm.
Both use parts of a dead coronavirus to expose the body to Covid and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. 
But studies suggest they are less effective than the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, widely used in Western countries. 
Research published in December last year, which looked at data from Singapore, found that mRNA vaccines worked better than Chinese vaccines in preventing severe illness in the over-60s.
These train the immune system to attack the spike protein on the virus - the part of the virus which infects the body's cells. They offer greater protection against severe disease or death. 
China claims to have made about half of all the world's Covid vaccine stock. But the government has not given approval to foreign-produced mRNA vaccines for general use in mainland China. 
BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer to produce a Covid vaccine, has also worked with a Shanghai-based company, Fosun Pharma, to develop the same mRNA-based vaccine.
This has been made available to German nationals living in China, and is also available in Hong Kong and Macau. However, it is not currently authorised for the Chinese mainland market.
China is reported to be developing its own mRNA vaccine, but it remains unclear how much progress has been made as the Chinese authorities have said little about it publicly.
When asked about the EU offer to send surplus stock of mRNA vaccines, a Chinese official spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China already had an adequate supply of vaccines.
""China's Covid situation is predictable and under control,"" she told a news conference on 3 January.

The police in Kenya are investigating the death of young fashion designer and LGBTQ activist Edwin Chiloba after his body was found dumped in a metal box by the roadside near the town of Eldoret.
The motive for the killing is unknown, a police spokesperson is quoted in the Star newspaper as saying.
But rights organisations in Kenya, where gay sex is outlawed, are linking it to his sexuality.
One group estimates that more than half of LGBTQ Kenyans have been assaulted.
""Words cannot even explain how we as a community are feeling right now. Another soul lost due to hate. You will be missed,"" rights organisation galck+ posted on Twitter.
""Edwin's death reminds us that queer bodies continue to be under attack all over the country,"" the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission wrote on Instagram.
Tributes on social media describe Chiloba as ""an amazing human"" and an ""iconic fashion designer"".
Last month on Instagram Chiloba wrote that he was ""going to fight for all marginalised people"" saying that he himself had been marginalised.
His body was discovered on Wednesday.
A witness is quoted as saying that someone in a vehicle without a number plate was seen leaving a metal box at the side of the road.
It was reported to the police, who went to open the box to find the corpse.
""We don't know for now why he was killed that way. Experts are handling the matter,"" police spokesperson Resila Onyango is quoted as saying.

Brazilian surfing legend Márcio Freire has died while surfing the huge waves in Nazaré off the coast of Portugal.
The 47-year-old fell while practising on Thursday.
Freire was one of three pioneering Brazilian surfers featured in the 2016 documentary, Mad Dogs, about an attempt to conquer the giant ""Jaws"" wave in Hawaii.
He had moved to the US state to surf the biggest and most dangerous waves in the world.
According to reports, Freire was practising tow-in surfing - where surfers use artificial assistance, such as a Jet Ski, to catch faster moving waves than they would be able to if they were paddling by hand - when he fell.
He was taken back to the beach; there, rescuers found him in cardio-respiratory arrest, but he was unable to be revived and was pronounced dead at the scene, Portugal's National Maritime Authority said in a statement.
Freire was seen as a big-wave pioneer in the surfing community, who travelled the world to surf giant waves. 
""We didn't have any safety. It was pure courage guided by the desire to go down a huge wave,"" he is quoted as saying in Mad Dogs by Surfer Today. 
""The risks were many without proper safety. If an accident happened, it would be the end of the journey.
""Nothing forced us to do what we did. It was all for ourselves, for our personal satisfaction."" 
Tributes have been pouring in on social media, starting with fellow big-wave professional surfer Nic von Rupp, who paid tribute to Freire in an Instagram story: 
""Today we lost one of ours. Always had loads of respect for Márcio as one of the paddle pioneers at jaws. Today I saw him surf all day in Nazare with a huge smile.
""With that smile is how I'm going to remember him."" 
Fellow Brazilian surfer Thiago Jacare also paid tribute to his friend on Instagram, calling him ""more than an idol"" and ""a true hero"".
The area where Freire died boasts some of the biggest and most terrifying waves in the world, caused by the Nazaré Canyon on the seabed off the coast of Portugal.
It was in Nazaré where German surfer Sebastian Steudtner set the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed in October 2020.
Several accidents have occurred there but until Thursday, none had ever been fatal.

There is concern over the spread of Covid in China following the recent easing of strict lockdown measures.
There have been reports that hospitals across the country are under pressure amid a fresh wave of infections.
Officially, there have only been 13 Covid deaths throughout December.
However, China has limited criteria for confirming Covid-19 deaths, which only includes those who die directly from respiratory illnesses caused by coronavirus, and not deaths caused by its knock-on effects. 
The counting method does not correspond with WHO guidance, and results in a figure that is way below the death toll in many other countries.
China has already stopped mass testing and it is only recording positive cases at hospitals and fever clinics where the patient has Covid symptoms. Asymptomatic cases and positive results from home testing kits are not recorded in the data. 
Currently the official count only records about 5,000 cases a day.
UK-based research company Airfinity said its model estimates cases in China could reach more than three million a day in January.
Despite the official numbers being low, the World Health Organization has warned the healthcare system in China could be under severe pressure.
Reuters have reported that Chinese hospitals have been overwhelmed during the Christmas period, with footage showing long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms.
Videos have been emerging on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals.
By cross-referencing with other images posted online, the BBC has been able to verify two videos of overcrowding at a children's hospital in the city of Tianjin in northern China.
However we have not been able to verify many of the other videos which have emerged. 
It's difficult to confirm how severe the situation is compared with normal as China strictly controls information coming out of the country.
The BBC's team in Beijing have reported on long queues outside health clinics, and on the high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies.
Temporary health centres are being set up along with intensive care facilities across the country.
National broadcaster CCTV has reported that Beijing's Chaoyang Hospital will boost its capability as the number of incoming patients increased by fourfold.
It's also been reported that in Shanghai an extra 230,000 hospital beds have been made available. 
There has been a sudden lifting of many of China's Covid restrictions following November's protests against strict lockdowns across the country.
Before the recent relaxation, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy. 
The measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities.
Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished.
A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes).
Chinese authorities have also said they will fully open borders from 8 January with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals.
Several countries including the US have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its ongoing Covid surge.
Overall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
However, less than half of people aged 80 and over have received three doses of vaccine. The vaccination rate back in April among this age group was much lower - less than 20%.  
The authorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"".
There are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain.
China has refused to use Western vaccines widely.
The government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House:
""I think it's Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""

71;['What is the energy price cap and what will happen to bills?'];['2021-08-06T06:15:54.000Z'];['BBC News'];['energy customer switching', 'ofgem', 'personal finance', 'energy industry', 'cost of living', 'oil & gas industry'];['scheme', 'cap', 'price', 'support', 'typical', 'households', 'help', 'happen', 'guarantee', 'kwh', 'bills', 'using', 'energy'];"
Help with energy costs will be less generous from April, with bills for a typical household going up to £3,000. 
However, there will be more support for the most vulnerable.
The assistance provided to businesses is also expected to reduce from March. 
From April, some groups across the UK will receive cash payments to help with energy costs:
Further details will follow.
Under the current energy price guarantee, a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will pay £2,500 annually.
The guarantee began in October, and was originally meant to last for two years, before the government said it would end in April 2023. 
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt then said the guarantee would continue, increasing by £500 to £3,000 from April. 
Without government support, the average energy bill would have risen to £4,279 in January 2023, regulator Ofgem said.
Previously, Ofgem set the maximum suppliers could charge households per unit of energy. 
But after prices soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the government announced its price guarantee would replace this energy cap.
The £3,000 figure for a typical household is based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year. 
A kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill.
However, most households aren't typical. 
Bills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of occupants, the type of property and its energy efficiency.
The price guarantee applies directly to all households in England, Scotland and Wales, with the ""same level of support"" available in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. 
A National Grid scheme running between November and March rewards households and businesses using less peak-time electricity. 
Not using high-energy appliances such as washing machines in the late afternoon or early evening will generate discounts of up to £100. 
Customers need a smart meter to sign up for the trial, which will run on 12 ""test days"".  
People who don't use use high-energy appliances for one hour of each test day will get up to £3 per kilowatt hour off their bill.
Under the energy bill relief scheme:
The scheme applies to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales, with a parallel scheme in Northern Ireland.
Unlike domestic customers, businesses were only ever promised help for six months until March 2023. 
The government said subsequent help would be ""targeted to those most affected"". An announcement was expected before Christmas, but was postponed until the new year. 
Support is expected to be cut significantly for most firms. 
Energy costs soared because the conflict in Ukraine reduced supplies of Russian gas. 
Prices also rose because demand for energy rocketed after Covid restrictions ended. 
All households are automatically getting a one-off £400 discount on their fuel bills, spread over six months between October 2022 and March 2023.
Households in Northern Ireland - which has its own energy market - will receive a single payment of £600 starting in January, more than in the rest of the UK because of the widespread use of heating oil.
Eight million low-income households who get certain benefits or tax credits have received £650 in two payments. 
Pensioner households got £300 and some disabled people were paid £150. 
This help was being partly funded by a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas companies. 
Vulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and the Warm Home Discount scheme. 
Energy companies also run hardship funds, although the regulator Ofgem said most firms needed to do more to help struggling customers.

Every month there's a new figure for inflation - it estimates how much prices are rising across all the goods and services in the economy.
In the 12 months to November 2022 the figure was 10.7%. That means things costing £1 in November 2021 cost more than £1.10 the same time the following year.
Our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with the BBC, shows you what the inflation rate is for your household, and identifies the items in your household budget that have gone up the most in price over the past year.
Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home. Recently this has been slightly lower than the more widely-reported measure, called CPI, and in November 2022 it was 9.3%.

A retired teacher has been charged with sexually assaulting a child after a BBC investigation revealed dozens of allegations about his time at a British school.
David Price will face trial in South Africa, where he taught after leaving England in the 1980s.
A former pupil in South Africa contacted police in December after learning of the earlier allegations in Radio 4's In Dark Corners series. 
Mr Price, 76, denies the charges.  
Journalist Alex Renton, who was taught by Mr Price, has spoken to six men who allege they were sexually assaulted by the teacher at Ashdown House in East Sussex in the 1970s. There are 42 allegations against him in total. 
The prestigious boarding school was known for preparing boys for Eton College. Past pupils include former prime minister Boris Johnson and King Charles's cousin, David Linley, now the Earl of Snowdon, who were both taught by Mr Price. There is no suggestion either were abused at the school.   
After returning to his native South Africa, Mr Price continued to teach. He was arrested in the country by British police in 2019 and has since been fighting extradition to the UK. 
The latest allegations relate to his time at a prestigious all-boys school in Cape Town in the 1980s.
The alleged victim contacted Mr Renton after seeing South African media coverage of the BBC's In Dark Corners series - which investigated sexual abuse at Britain's elite boarding schools.
He claims he was first groped by the teacher in 1985 at the age of about 10 while showering at Western Province Preparatory School in Cape Town. 
""From that day on he would contrive situations to get me alone,"" he said. 
He said he was made to touch the teacher's genitals. 
""I didn't know what was happening. So I did this and he finished off. And I remember just retching. And he said 'listen, you obviously can't tell anyone, they're not going to believe you'.""
Mr Price left the school in December 1987. A spokeswoman says the school never received any complaints he sexually assaulted children. His career as a teacher continued, including some years at a live-in school for deaf children.
Some former pupils at Ashdown House, who have been waiting to have their allegations heard in a British court, welcomed the action by South African prosecutors. 
""Maybe our best hope is for South Africa to bring him to justice within South Africa because the extradition is not working,"" one said. 
Ashdown House closed in 2020. The Prep School Trust, which took over the school in 2009, said it had cooperated fully with all enquiries into the allegations and had ""worked tirelessly to ensure no such incidents could ever happen in the school again"".
The BBC series has also spoken to dozens of former pupils who allege they were abused by teachers at the prestigious Scottish schools Fettes College and Edinburgh Academy.

For the first time Nicky Campbell discusses the abuse he received at school
After listening to the series, BBC presenter Nicky Campbell revealed he had himself been abused at Edinburgh Academy by teacher Hamish Dawson, who has died. 
He said he was haunted by the sight of his friend being abused in the school showers by a different teacher.
The teacher - who cannot be identified for legal reasons and is referred to as ""Edgar"" in the Radio 4 series - joined Edinburgh Academy in 1968. Five years later he moved to Fettes College. He left in 1979 after being asked to step down. 
Like Mr Price, he is also from South Africa, and continued to teach when he returned to the country. He too was arrested in 2019 and has been fighting extradition to the UK. 
A court statement from the teacher in 2019 admits to ""inappropriately"" touching boys in the UK, but he denied having done so in South Africa. A later statement in 2021 appears to retract this admission. 
The BBC has spoken to a man who claims he was assaulted by the teacher as a pupil at Rondebosch Boys School in Cape Town, where ""Edgar"" taught from 1980 to 2006. 
He said the teacher would use untidy uniforms as justification to ""have physical contact with you or to have his hands wandering over you"". 
""That would then progress to grabbing me and pushing me up against the wall,"" he said. ""He would push himself up against me.""
A spokeswoman for the school said they had no record of any allegations of misconduct or impropriety involving the teacher. She said she could not confirm the recruitment processes of the time. 
Mr Price and ""Edgar"" have the same legal team in South Africa. The BBC asked their lawyers to put the allegations to both men, but did not receive a response.
Both Western Province Preparatory School and Rondebosch Boys School have now written to alumni urging them to come forward if they were molested by either teacher. 
More than 30 former pupils who allege physical and sexual abuse at Edinburgh Academy and Fettes College have formed a Whatsapp group to support each other. 
""Along with that sense of solidarity comes a sense of total and utter frustration,"" said Mr Campbell, who is a member of the group. 
The teacher's appeal against extradition is due to be heard in South Africa in March. 
Fettes College said it had ""co-operated fully with the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, including providing the Inquiry with all documentation pertaining to this matter"".
Edinburgh Academy said it was ""working closely with the relevant authorities including Police Scotland and the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry"".

Joe Biden has walked along the US-Mexico border in Texas to see up close one of his presidency's biggest issues.
He visited a migrant centre in El Paso and joined Border Patrol agents in touring a section of the border wall.
The number of migrant crossings has spiralled in recent months, making the Democratic president vulnerable to the accusation he is soft on security.
Last week he announced tougher measures to expand the nationalities of those who can be sent back to Mexico.
But that left the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, unimpressed - he said the president was failing to enforce immigration laws.
""You have violated your constitutional obligation to defend the States against invasion through faithful execution of federal laws,"" he wrote in a letter which he handed to the president upon his arrival.
The governor's party said it intends to use its newly acquired control of the House of Representatives to investigate the Biden administration's handling of immigration.
Mr Biden's visit, his first since becoming president two years ago, was also expected to include meetings with border officials to discuss migration and the increased trafficking of fentanyl and other opioids. 
El Paso, on the south-west edge of Texas, is one of the most common crossing points, often used by Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country.
A controversial Trump-era policy that enabled the rapid expulsion of illegal border crossers was due to expire in December but kept in place by a Supreme Court ruling after an outcry from Republicans.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been taken to a hospital in Florida with abdominal pain. 
It comes a day after thousands of his supporters stormed government offices in the Brazilian capital. 
Mr Bolsonaro was admitted to a hospital near Orlando on Monday.  
The former president was stabbed in 2018 and has since been taken to hospital several times with abdominal pain. 
In a statement, a source close to his family said his condition was ""not worrying"", according to Reuters. The story was initially reported by Brazilian news outlet O Globo.
His wife later confirmed the news to AFP.
Mr Bolsonaro left Brazil for the United States about ten days ago. He refused to take part in the handover of power to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last week. 
Visa questions
US President Joe Biden is facing pressure from members of his party to remove Mr Bolsonaro from the country.
""Bolsonaro should not be in Florida,"" Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro told CNN. ""The United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who has inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil. He should be sent back to Brazil.""
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another Democrat in Congress, in a tweet called on the US to ""cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida"".
US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday that the US has received ""no official request"" from the Brazilian government relating to Mr Bolsonaro's visa. 
Mr Bolsonaro was attacked during a campaign rally in the state of Minas Gerais in September 2018.  He went on to win the election later that year. 
In October, he narrowly lost his bid for re-election to former President Lula after a divisive campaign.

About 10 of the files were discovered in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center in Washington in November by Mr Biden's legal team, said his lawyer.
The batch has been handed over to the National Archives. 
Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, is facing a probe for taking classified files to Florida after his presidency.
According to the BBC's US partner CBS News, the FBI is involved in the inquiry into classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, and US Attorney General Merrick Garland has been asked to review the papers. 
A source familiar with the matter told CBS News the batch did not contain nuclear secrets and had been contained in a folder in a box with other unclassified papers.
Richard Sauber, special counsel to President Biden, said in a statement to CBS on Monday that the files were discovered just before the midterm elections by Biden attorneys who were clearing out the office space.
Mr Biden kept an office at the think tank, which is about a mile from the White House, from 2017 to 2020.
Mr Sauber said: ""Since that discovery [of the documents], the president's personal attorneys have co-operated with the [National] Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives.""
Mr Trump reacted on Monday on his social media site, Truth Social, asking: ""When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?""
Mr Trump is under investigation for allegedly resisting requests to give back about 300 classified documents that he took to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving office. The National Archives tipped off the authorities in that case.

Congressman James Comer, the new Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on Monday that the Biden files raised questions about the justice department's neutrality.
He told reporters: ""This is further concern that there's a two-tier justice system within the DoJ [justice department] with how they treat Republicans versus Democrats, certainly how they treat the former president versus the current president.""
Neither the Penn Biden Center nor National Archives immediately commented.
In September, President Biden appeared on CBS and was asked for his reaction to a photo showing the documents recovered at Mar-a-Lago. 
""How anyone could be that irresponsible?"" the president said.

Their own Twitter account later confirmed the news, saying ""the world has lost a true angel"".
The sister duo were well known in US politics, particularly for their YouTube and television appearances fervently supporting Mr Trump.
Florida congressman Matt Gaetz was one of several prominent Republicans to respond to Mr Trump's announcement, tweeting ""sad news"".
Her cause of death was unknown but in November there was a plea for prayers for Diamond on their Twitter account.
The sisters grew up in North Carolina to Christian evangelist parents and were Democrats until they switched to support Mr Trump.
They first came to national prominence during the Trump presidential campaign in 2016 and soon became a favourite of his.
Regular appearances on Fox News followed and then a show of their own on subscription channel Fox Nation.

Business Secretary Grant Shapps has denied doctoring a picture on his Twitter feed to remove former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Mr Shapps posted a picture of a ministerial visit to Spaceport Cornwall, as he hailed the first rocket launch from UK soil.
But social media users spotted that Mr Johnson, who also went on the trip in 2021, had disappeared from the picture.
Mr Shapps says he was not aware it had been edited and has now deleted it.
An identical photo remains on the Number 10 Flickr account, dated 9 June 2021.
It shows Mr Johnson and Mr Shapps side-by-side in Cornwall during a visit to LauncherOne.
The then-Conservative leader is wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words: ""Prime Minister"".
A source close to Mr Shapps said: ""Grant wasn't aware anyone had edited the picture. 
""He removed it as soon as it was pointed out. Obviously he wouldn't endorse anyone rewriting history by removing the former PM from a picture.
""He was proud to serve in Boris Johnson's government.""
The first ever satellite mission launched from UK soil ended in failure on Monday, after the rocket suffered an ""anomaly"".
A jumbo jet operated by the American Virgin Orbit company carried a rocket out of Newquay, Cornwall, to release it over the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket ignited and appeared to be ascending correctly, before the mission failed.
The satellites it was carrying could not be released and were lost.
Labour's public health minister Andrew Gwynne took a swipe at Mr Shapps in a Commons debate on the government's planned strikes legislation.
""Perhaps he should spend less time on photoshop and more time on the day job sitting down and negotiating,"" he told MPs.

Model Tatjana Patitz has died, aged 56, her modelling agency has announced.
No cause of death has been revealed. The German-born model was living in California at the time of her death. 
Patitz, who rose to fame in the 1990s, became one of the decade's most prominent supermodels. She also appeared in music videos for Duran Duran and George Michael. 
In a 1988 interview with Vogue magazine, she attributed her success to ""not looking like anyone else"".
""People always said that I looked special... And I was going to make it because of that,"" she said at the time.
Patitz was born in Hamburg in 1966, to an Estonian mother and a German father. 
Her family soon relocated to Sweden, where she entered a contest at the age of 17. She came third and it took several years for her career to take off. 
By 1988, however, she was being shot by high-profile fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh. 
Patitz also featured on the famous 1990 British Vogue cover alongside fellow supermodels Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, cementing her status as one of the five ""original"" supermodels of the 1990s. 
She also starred in George Michael's Freedom! '90 music video and worked on campaigns for Chanel, Calvin Klein and Versace. 
Anna Wintour, global editorial director of Vogue, said: ""Tatjana was always the European symbol of chic, like Romy Schneider-meets-Monica Vitti... She was far less visible than her peers - more mysterious, more grown-up, more unattainable - and that had its own appeal.""
The Peter Lindbergh Foundation paid tribute to ""Tatjana's kindness, inner beauty and outstanding intelligence"".
""She will be immensely missed,"" a Twitter statement by the Foundation said.
Patitz's most recent catwalk appearance was in the Etro show in February 2019 as part of Milan fashion week, according to Reuters news agency.
She is survived by her 19-year-old son, Jonah.

84;"[""Nigeria's cash crunch: Hunting out savings from under mattresses""]";['2023-01-12T00:29:16.000Z'];['BBC News'];['africa today podcasts'];['small', 'mattresses', 'crunch', 'savings', 'cash', 'senior', 'ruling', 'personally', 'hunting', 'party', 'notes', 'nigerias', 'went', 'supply', 'tender', 'provide'];"
In our series of letters from African journalists, Mannir Dan Ali, former editor-in-chief of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper, looks at the latest cash crisis to hit Africa's most-populous nation weeks before elections.
Cash is king in Nigeria - electronic banking it still in its infancy. In fact very few people keep their money in banks - and it is often joked that most put any savings they have under their mattresses.
According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), less than 20% of the local currency in circulation is held by the banks.  
CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele explained that of the 3.2 trillion naira ($7bn; £5.8bn) in circulation, up to 2.7 trillion was outside the vaults of commercial banks. 
This is one of the reasons why he made a shock announcement in October that three of the country's higher denominations were going to be replaced.
The main design change appears to be the colour of the banknotes. The 1,000 naira note has changed from brown to blue; the 500 from purple to green and the 200 from brown and blue to pink.
The problem for a country where things rarely go according to plan, is that the switch has to happen in a six-week window - and after the end of January the old notes will no longer be legal tender.
Midway through this window, the new notes are like gold dust and it is very difficult to get hold of them.
I have only handled 10 of the crisp new notes, which I managed to get hold of when I went to a bank in the capital, Abuja, last week.
I had tried to withdraw new notes from an ATM, but they are all still dispensing old notes.
The bank teller who handed over to me the 10 banknotes, worth just over $20, said this was the maximum anyone could get.
He even asked me to fill out my details in a notebook by his counter - a way to ensure that only genuine bank customers are getting the new notes and not those diverting them to money changers who are charging a premium for the new cash.
Even the rich and powerful are facing problems getting hold of them. 
On the day the new notes became legal tender, just before Christmas, I overheard a senior member of the ruling party complaining that though he personally went to his local bank, the manager there said he could only provide him with a small amount because the banks have only a very limited supply of the new notes. 
These anecdotes underline the challenge of completing the currency switch. If in the major cities of Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kano most people are yet to have sight of the new notes, it is inconceivable that they will be in circulation in sufficient numbers nationwide by the end of the month.
If the exercise is to succeed there is also an urgent need to mount a publicity campaign. 
Already social media is awash with instances of market women turning down the new currency, which they consider to be a poor imitation of the old one - in addition to being fearful of being conned by fraudsters. 
And changing the colour of the naira is unlikely to deter kidnapping for ransom, which is prevalent in many parts of the country.
Not to be left behind, the extortionists are said to be asking for ransom in the new currency, never mind that people cannot get hold it.
Many Nigerians are in danger of losing their savings altogether.
A large number of the 774 local governments in Nigeria do not have bank branches and even in the present era of electronic monetary transactions, such services are not commonly available in rural areas. 
Of course it tends to be in rural areas where there is the peculiar practice of people keeping money in mattresses or under their beds. 
Mr Emefiele has blamed this hoarding for the currency crunch. But in reality it is not the average Nigerian that is to blame for the bulk of the stockpiling.
Analysts say this tends to become an issue before elections when politicians are accused of using cash to buy favours.
During the 2019 election, social media had pictures and a video of a bullion van supposedly full of cash going into the residence of a senior political influencer.
His aides denied accusations that it was for vote-buying.
But the practice of giving voters money to cast their ballot for a particular candidate is not uncommon here.
The currency change may be well-intentioned, to level the political playing field before the 25 February vote, yet the timing of it all is causing concern.
The senate has asked for the switchover period to be extended but the CBN is sticking to its guns.
To make matters worse, Governor Emefiele has disappeared. He has been out of the country for weeks, facing various accusations of mismanagement, which some argue may be politically motivated.
Nonetheless it means the chances of completing the exchange by 31 January look slim.
President Muhammadu Buhari will be stepping down in May to handover to his successor after completing two terms in office as a democratically elected leader.
Yet for some it brings to mind the currency change that took place in the 1980s when Mr Buhari was the military head of state. It was a time when well-off private business people lost fortunes.

Lisa Marie Presley, the only child of Rock legend Elvis, has been rushed to hospital after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest, US media has reported.
The singer, 54, was found unresponsive at her home in Calabasas, California, sources told US outlet TMZ. 
The LA County Fire Department told CNN that emergency responders had been dispatched to an address in the city.
But they declined to confirm the name of the patient, who they said was rushed to hospital.
Sources close to the star told TMZ that Presley had suffered a ""full arrest"" before a bystander administered epinephrine - commonly known as adrenaline - to help her regain a pulse. Her current condition is unclear. 
Presley's agent refused to comment on the reports, but US media said her mother Priscilla was seen arriving at the West Hills hospital in Los Angeles. 
Born in 1968, Lisa Marie went on to follow in her father's footsteps and forged a career in music. The star released three albums, with her 2003 debut studio album selling hundreds of thousands of copies and receiving generally positive reviews. 
The star is also well known for a series of high-profile marriages to pop legend Michael Jackson, actor Nicholas Cage and musicians Danny Keough and Michael Lockwood. 
She had three children, including the actress Roxy Keough. 
Presley was last seen in public on Tuesday night at the Golden Globes Awards in Beverley Hills. 
Accompanied by her mother, the pair were seen breaking down in tears as they watched Austin Butler win the Best Actor prize for his portrayal of her father. 
During an emotional speech, the actor thanked the Presley family for their help during the film. 
""Thank you guys, thank you for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me,"" Butler said. ""Lisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever.""

Watch: Biden says documents weren't sitting out on the street
Congressional Republicans are demanding to see visitor logs for US President Joe Biden's homes, arguing that the discovery of classified files at one of his residences is a national security risk.
Mr Biden acknowledged on Thursday that sensitive material was found in the garage of his home in Delaware.
The White House deflected when asked if the visitor logs would be provided. 
The justice department has appointed an investigator to look into the files.
News that sensitive documents dating from Mr Biden's time as vice-president had been found in a private office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank in Washington, emerged earlier this week, followed by a subsequent disclosure that a second cache was discovered at Mr Biden's home.
The first batch was found on 2 November, just before the US midterm elections, but only became public on Monday. 
Mr Biden kept an office at the think tank after he left the White House in 2017 until he launched his presidential campaign in 2019. 
On Thursday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland revealed in a news conference that a second cache of files had been found on 20 December at Mr Biden's private home in Wilmington, Delaware. 
He added that Mr Biden's lawyers had called investigators on Thursday morning to notify them of an additional document, also found at the same residence.
Citing the ""extraordinary circumstances"", the attorney general appointed Robert Hur, a former senior justice department official during the Trump presidency, to lead an investigation in the Biden files.
Kevin McCarthy, the newly elected Republican Speaker of the House, questioned the timing of the first disclosure and accused Mr Biden of knowingly mishandling the sensitive papers.
""He knowingly knew [sic] this happened going into [the] election, going into interviews. This is what makes America not trust their government,"" Mr McCarthy said on Thursday. 
Other Republicans demanded the president release a log of all the people who had visited Mr Biden's Delaware home.
James Comer, a Kentucky congressman and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News: ""We need to know who all has had access to the president."" 
Colorado Republican Ken Buck wrote a letter to the White House on Thursday calling on Mr Biden to ""release all visitor logs"".
Elise Stefanik, the number three House Republican and New York congresswoman, said that the visitor logs were ""a clear matter of national security"".
Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, is also under investigation by the justice department after more than 325 classified files - including some marked with Secret and Top Secret designations - were discovered by FBI agents executing a search warrant last year at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr Biden again said that his lawyers had notified officials of the discovery and that he took the matter seriously.
The president - who previously described Mr Trump's alleged mishandling of classified material as ""totally irresponsible"" - added that the documents were found locked in a garage next to his 1960s Chevrolet Corvette sports car, ""not sitting out in the street"".
Lawyers also searched Mr Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, but said they found no additional files.
An attorney for the president, Richard Sauber, said they were co-operating closely with the justice department.
He predicted the investigation would show ""these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake"".
Asked whether the Delaware visitor logs would ever be released, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre countered that the Biden administration had restored public disclosure on White House visitor logs that had been restricted under Mr Trump.
In 2017, the Trump administration also refused to reveal the names of most of the visitors to Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach during his presidency.

Biden documents: Who is special counsel Robert Hur?
According to a CNN analysis in October, Mr Biden had spent more than a quarter of his presidency working from his houses in Wilmington or Rehoboth Beach.
Also on Thursday, Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the attorney general should ""immediately"" end the investigation he faces over the Mar-a-Lago cache, claiming the special counsel ""hates"" him.

Announcing her condition on Twitter and Instagram, the presenter said: ""My husband is helping me type this, as I'm finding it hard to write and my speech is most affected.
""I'm desperate to make a full recovery and return to work.
""Thank you to the medical teams at Frimley and St George's, and my family and friends who've got me through the last fortnight.""
In response, Formula 1 Racing tweeted: ""Thinking of you Jennie, and wishing you all the very best with your recovery.""
The McLaren racing team said: ""The entire team sends their love and strength as we look forward to seeing you back in the paddock.""
Broadcasters Hazel Southwell, Laura Winter and Dan Walker are among those who have tweeted messages of sympathy.
Jennie Gow has covered Formula 1 and other motorsport events for the BBC, ITV, Netflix and Sky TV.
The Southampton-born presenter, who grew up in Wargrave, Berkshire, began her broadcasting career at BBC Radio Solent before working for commercial radio stations in the south of England.

Organised crime is moving into the lucrative market of extreme dog breeding, a BBC investigation has found.  
Bulldogs, including the new American Bully breed, are being bred with hugely exaggerated characteristics - such as excessive skin folds or large, muscular frames.
The RSPCA warns criminals are breeding and selling these dogs to launder money and make huge sums, often at the expense of animal welfare. 
Reporter Sam Poling went undercover to investigate the extreme dog breeding trade.
I'm shocked when my phone pings with a message from the Facebook account of Thomas Rayment -  a convicted county lines drug dealer I know to be in prison. 
""Hi. Is it a male or female you are wanting. We have some pups available.""
For months, I'd been using a false name, pretending to be bulldog-loving businessman Stefan Delaney, hanging out in Facebook groups dedicated to bulldogs and American bullies. 
My goal was to find out who the main players were in the world of extreme dog breeding. 
Now it looked like it was beginning to pay off. 
Rayment has been in prison since 2021, serving six years for running a prolific county lines drugs gang, supplying heroin and crack cocaine to the north of England.
But could he really be brokering dog deals from behind bars?
Rayment claims to run the UK arm of a big international dog breeding business called Muscletone Bullys UK. He's frequently tagged in posts by other prominent figures in the American Bully network. 
From his Facebook account I'm sent photos of two extreme American bullies - Brandon Blockhead and Kleo - who have just had a litter of puppies. 
""This boned-up Gorilla is no joke he's extreme as they come,"" reads the description of Brandon Blockhead on Rayment's website. He has ""one of the best headpieces we have ever seen all on a super short compact frame"". 
The tops of his ears have been cut off - an illegal practice in the UK called ear cropping. 
The penalty for doing this can be up to five years in prison for causing suffering to an animal. It's a practice I see time and time again during my months of investigating.
Dogs, Dealers and Organised Crime
Reporter Sam Poling goes undercover to reveal the increasingly close relationship between organised crime and dog dealing.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
In the past three years, more than 1,000 incidents of illegal ear cropping have been reported to the RSPCA. Some dealers do the cropping themselves, without using anaesthetic on the dogs. Most cases involve American bullies.
This kind of extreme dog breeding is big business. On the Muscletone Bullys UK website, pups are on sale for tens of thousands of pounds. 
After some back and forth with Rayment's account, I finally receive the message to my fake Facebook profile that I've been desperately waiting for. My alter ego Stefan Delaney is invited to a meeting in Wigan to discuss a deal. 
My plan is to pose as Stefan's girlfriend and say he's running late. 
I arrive at the address. It's a dog fertility clinic. A man lets me in and shows me around. He's called Ryan Howard. He tells me he's Rayment's business partner. 
I feign confusion about Rayment and that's when Howard breaks the news.
""Tom's not here because he's in jail,"" he tells me.
""I don't tell everybody but you lot know who he is so I'm not going to lie to you. You have been speaking to Tommy.""
Howard tells me he has about 120 dogs in his business but he only looks after 15 of them.  
The other dogs are housed through a network of what's known as ""co-owns"". 
In a co-own, a dealer gets someone else to house the dog. That person then gets paid a percentage from the sale of any pups. 
It means the dealer can have a massive network of dogs which they can continue to profit from without the authorities having any idea how many they have.
In a statement to the BBC, Muscletone Bullys UK said: 
""We are well-known for breeding the highest quality extreme American bullies without compromising the dogs' health or well-being. Thomas Rayment does not communicate with anyone illegally and has others running his socials. We do not condone or take part in illegal ear cropping.""
The statement added that the business has ""never co-owned a dog as a deliberate ploy to… escape the scrutiny of the licensing authorities.""
Ian Muttitt, a chief inspector with the RSPCA's Special Operations Unit, says over the past five years organised crime gangs have become increasingly involved in the extreme dog breeding trade. 
But what is the appeal of dog dealing to criminals? First, he says, it's lucrative. Second, it's useful for money laundering.
""It's anything where illegal money has been obtained. So drugs, firearms, other organised crime.
""It can then be laundered through the sale of these dogs or vice versa.""
The legal risks are also far less serious. Muttitt explains that dealing drugs, for example, carries much higher penalties than animal cruelty offences.  
I logout of Stefan Delaney's fake Facebook profile one last time. It's clear the network I've uncovered is not only huge, but sophisticated. That's going to make cleaning up this trade very difficult for the authorities as profit-driven dealers continue to put wealth over health at all costs.

Firearms deaths are a fixture in American life.
There were 1.5 million of them between 1968 and 2017 - that's higher than the number of soldiers killed in every US conflict since the American War for Independence in 1775. 
In 2020 alone, more than 45,000 Americans died at the end of a barrel of a gun, whether by homicide or suicide, more than any other year on record. The figure represents a 25% increase from five years prior, and a 43% increase from 2010. 
But the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against sectors of the population fiercely protective of their constitutionally-enshrined right to bear arms. 
While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018.
The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. 
More recent data also suggests that gun ownership grew significantly over the last several years. One study, published by the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults - just under 3% of the population - became first new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. 
This, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. 
A separate study, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2021, linked a rise in gun ownership during the pandemic to higher rates of gun injuries among - and inflicted by - children. 
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a total of 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries of all causes during 2020, the last year for which complete data is available. 
And while mass shooting and gun murders generally garner more media attention, of the total, 54% - about 24,300 deaths - were suicides. 
A 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found there was a strong relationship between higher levels of gun ownership in a state and higher firearm suicide rates for both men and women. 
Advocates for stricter gun laws in the United States often cite this statistic when pushing lawmakers to devote more resources to mental health and fewer to easing gun restrictions.   
In 2020, 43% of the deaths - amounting to 19,384 people - were homicides, according to data from the CDC. The figure represents a 34% increase from 2019, and a 75% increase over the course of the previous decade. 
Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the data.  
The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. 
That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. 
Deaths from the ""mass shootings"" that attract international attention, however, are harder to track. 
While the country does not have a single definition for ""mass shootings"", the FBI has for over a decade tracked ""active shooter incidents"" in which ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area"". 
According to the FBI, there were 345 ""active shooter incidents"" in the United States between 2000-2020, resulting in more than 1,024 deaths and 1,828 injuries. 
The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 30 people dead. 
Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014, according to polling by Gallup.  
Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. 
Eleven percent surveyed said laws should be ""made less strict"".   
The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan and extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. 
""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,"" the same Gallup study noted, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. 
Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. 
Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. 
Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists.
Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy.  
In January, the NRA filed for bankruptcy as part of a fraud case against some of its own senior staff. Even after the move, it vowed to continue ""confronting anti-Second Amendment activities, promoting firearm safety and training, and advancing public programs across the United States"".
Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. 
A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. 
Similarly, on 12 April Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit.  
The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"".

The song Naatu Naatu from the hit Telugu-language film RRR has won a best original song Oscar nomination.
It's the first Indian feature film to be nominated for anything other than best international film at the Academy Awards, which take place in March.
The song has been a favourite at award ceremonies and has already won a Golden Globe and a Critics' Choice Award.
It will be up against heavyweights Lady Gaga and Rihanna, whose songs are nominated in the same Oscars category.
Hosts Riz Ahmed and Allison Williams announced the news at the nominations presentation in Beverly Hills on Tuesday. This year's ceremony will be held in Los Angeles on 12 March.
The last time an Indian won an Oscar for a film's music came in 2009, when composer AR Rahman won best original song and best original score for the song Jai Ho from the film Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Briton Danny Boyle. 
Naatu Naatu has had thousands grooving to its beat. Ever since it made it to the Oscar shortlist in December, fans of the song have been hoping for a win. 
Hours before the nominations were announced, #NTRforOscars trended on Twitter, as fans expressed their desire for an Oscar nomination and win for the film. 
Their hopes are high as Naatu Naatu has been picked as a favourite to win this year by several Oscar prediction lists in trade magazines.
The four-and-a-half-minute song was filmed in front of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's official residence in 2021. 
The energetic dance moves performed by the film's lead actors, Ram Charan and Jr NTR, have inspired viral trends on social media in India and globally.
After the film lost out to Gujarati-language movie Chello Show as India's official entry to the Oscars, RRR director SS Rajamouli launched an intensive publicity campaign last year and submitted the film for nominations in 14 categories, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.
The historical fantasy film, which tells the fictional story of two real-life Indian revolutionaries fighting against British rule, has been one of India's most expensive films. 
It features dazzling action sequences and several peppy dance tracks and patriotic anthems.
The film has been a rollicking success in India and abroad. Social media videos from screenings in the US have shown people hooting and cheering as they watch the movie. 
The film has received rave reviews from critics and has also been praised by A-list Hollywood directors such as Edgar Wright and James Gunn.
After it won Best Foreign Language Film and Naatu Naatu won Best Song at the 28th edition of the Critics' Choice Awards, MM Keeravani, the song's composer, shared photos with James Cameron at the awards ceremony and said the Oscar-winning director had watched the film twice and had complimented him for his music.

Tensions flared up at one of India's best-known universities over the screening of a BBC documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots.
Students accused officials at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) of cutting off power and internet supply to stop Tuesday evening's screening. 
University officials have not commented on the allegation yet.
India has said that the BBC documentary lacks objectivity and is ""propaganda"".
It has invoked emergency laws to block the documentary on YouTube and Twitter.
The JNU administration had earlier asked the students' union not to hold the screening, as it could ""disturb the peace and harmony of the university campus"".
Although the power cut prevented the public screening, student leaders distributed QR codes to people and asked them to stream the video on their laptops and phones.
There was a heavy police presence on campus. A BBC Hindi reporter who was there said while students were watching the documentary, stones were thrown at them by ""a group of 20-30 people"". Students say they have filed a police complaint. 
The first episode of India: The Modi Question - a two-part series - aired in the UK on 17 January. The second part was broadcast on Tuesday. 
India's foreign ministry has criticised the documentary, calling it ""a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative"".
The BBC said the series examines ""the tensions between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority and explores the politics of Mr Modi in relation to those tensions"". In a statement it added that the Indian government was offered a right to reply, but had declined.
The first episode of the documentary tracked Mr Modi's first steps into politics, from his rise through the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to his appointment as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.
It highlighted a previously unpublished report, obtained by the BBC from the British Foreign Office, which raises questions about Mr Modi's actions during the religious riots that broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire, killing dozens. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in the violence, one of the worst since Independence.
The report claims that Mr Modi was ""directly responsible"" for the ""climate of impunity"" that enabled the violence.
Mr Modi has long rejected accusations that he had any responsibility for the violence and has not apologised for the riots. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.
Although the documentary was not aired in India, several opposition leaders and government critics shared links to it on social media. 
An adviser to India's government said it had ordered Twitter to block tweets linking to the documentary, while YouTube had been instructed to block uploads of the video. 
Twitter confirmed to the BBC that it had blocked 50 tweets based on a request by India's ministry of information and broadcasting on 20 January under the country's information technology law. 
A YouTube spokesperson said the video had been ""blocked from appearing by the BBC due to a copyright claim"". A BBC spokesperson said: ""As is standard practice, we follow procedure to have illegal uploads of any BBC content removed.""
The JNU students' union has said it will hold another screening of the documentary. Several other organisations have also held screenings or announced plans to do so.

A new homeowner said his staircase and walls had been ""trashed"" after delivery men left a sofa jammed on the stairs.
Luke Ansell ordered the sofa, costing more than £2,000, from online retailer designersofas4u.co.uk after moving in to a brand new house in Bournemouth.
He said the sofa company's delivery men got it wedged but left saying they had no time to rectify it. 
The company said it had carried out an investigation and disputed his account.
Mr Ansell posted a picture of the stricken sofa on a local Facebook group and four ""lovely members of the community"" came to help him move it upstairs.
Many of the online comments drew comparisons with the episode of TV comedy Friends, in which a sofa is similarly stuck on a staircase and gave rise to the shout of ""pivot"".
The handmade leather sofa was ordered 15 weeks ago and Mr Ansell said he paid extra for ""white glove"" delivery to the new-build house he had recently moved in to. 
He described how the two designersofas4u.co.uk delivery staff arrived on 19 January and assessed there was enough room to take the sofa up to the second-floor office.
In the event they got it to the stairwell but no further, he said.
""They got jammed and tried to get it back out but got stuck. They said, 'There's nothing more we can do, we haven't got time, we have to go'.
""It's an absolute nightmare. They even asked me to sign a note to say it had been delivered - there was quite a confrontation.""
He said it left plasterwork and wood panelling in the home badly damaged.
The Blackburn-based company told the BBC it was carrying out an ""internal investigation"".
It subsequently emailed Mr Ansell disputing his description of the events, claiming the sofa had been ""left in a safe place on the landing"".
It offered to replace the damaged sofa as a ""goodwill gesture"".

102;"[""Transgender rapist Isla Bryson to be moved from women's prison""]";['2023-01-26T12:25:42.000Z'];['BBC News'];['prisons', 'transgender people'];['views', 'rapist', 'minister', 'officials', 'right', 'transgender', 'bryson', 'understand', 'moved', 'womens', 'rape', 'isla', 'prison', 'scotland'];"
A trans woman who raped two women before she changed gender will not serve her sentence in a female jail, Scotland's first minister has said. 
Isla Bryson was remanded to Cornton Vale women's prison after being convicted of carrying out the rapes when she was a man called Adam Graham. 
Bryson decided to transition from a man to a woman while awaiting trial. 
Nicola Sturgeon has now said Bryson will be removed from the prison soon and will not serve her sentence there.
She was expected to be moved to a male wing of a male prison on Thursday afternoon. 
Bryson is due to be sentenced next month after being convicted on Tuesday. It is thought to have been the first time a trans woman has been convicted of raping women in Scotland. 
But where that sentence should be served has been the subject of heated debate, with concerns being raised about the safety of other women in the female jail if Bryson was placed there.
The Scottish Parliament passed legislation last month aimed at making it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex, but Ms Sturgeon has said the changes did not play any part in the Bryson case. 
The Gender Recognition Reform Bill has been blocked by the UK government over its potential impact on equalities laws that apply across Scotland, England and Wales.

Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs Isla Bryson will not serve her sentence in a female jail.
Speaking at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said she agreed that it was not possible to have a rapist within a women's prison.
Referring directly to the Bryson case, she said: ""It would not be appropriate for me, in respect of any prisoner, to give details of where they are being incarcerated.
""But given the understandable public and parliamentary concern in this case, I can confirm to parliament that this prisoner will not be incarcerated at Cornton Vale women's prison.
""I hope that provides assurance to the public.""
The first minister said any prisoner who posed a risk of sexual offending was segregated from other prisoners including while a risk assessment was carried out.
She said: ""There is no automatic right for a trans woman convicted of a crime to serve their sentence in a female prison even if they have a gender recognition certificate.
""Every case is subject to rigorous individual risk assessment and the safety of other prisoners is paramount.""
Ms Sturgeon said she expected that Bryson would not be at Cornton Vale in Stirling by the end of a 72-hour segregated assessment period, which would end on Thursday. 
The first minister also stressed it was careful that people ""do not, even inadvertently, suggest that trans women pose an inherent threat to women"", adding: ""Predatory men, as has always been the case, are the risk to women.""
Speaking to journalists outside the chamber, Ms Sturgeon said she had not given any ""formal direction"" to the Scottish Prison Service on removing Bryson from Cornton Vale.
A spokesman for the first minister would not say if it was now Scottish government policy to bar all rapists from female prisons.
Scottish Justice Secretary Keith Brown said on Wednesday that he trusted the prison service to decide on the correct venue for trans prisoners. 
Cornton Vale was until recently Scotland's only women's jail, but is being replaced by a series of smaller purpose-built facilities across the country - including HMP Stirling, which is being built on the same site.
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said his party had ""warned for months"" during the debate over the gender reforms that ""violent criminals just like the sex offender, the absolute beast we are discussing today, would try to exploit loopholes in the law and attack and traumatise women.""
He added: ""It should not have taken public disgust and a slew of negative headlines about a double rapist being sent to a women's prison for Nicola Sturgeon to realise this was completely unacceptable and wrong.
""She and her justice secretary have the power to impose a blanket ban on all rapists being sent to women's prisons, so why is she refusing to exercise it?
""It suggests Nicola Sturgeon's screeching U-turn in the Bryson case was down to fears over the political risk to herself rather than the safety risk to women prisoners.""
It came as Bryson's estranged wife, Shonna Graham, 31, said she had a ""lot of sympathy for real trans people"" but claimed her former partner's transition was a ""sham for attention"" and that Bryson is attempting to fool the authorities.
Ms Graham told the Daily Mail: ""Never once did he say anything to me about feeling he was in the wrong body or anything"", and accused Bryson of being abusive in their relationship.
During the rape trial, Bryson claimed she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29, and is currently taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.
Bryson said that in 2016 she was ""struggling with my sexuality and having issues emotionally"".
The first minister insists this was a decision taken by the Scottish Prison Service following its usual individual risk assessment procedures. 
Asked by journalists if she had intervened in the process, Nicola Sturgeon said she did not formally direct the SPS to move Isla Bryson to a male prison.  
But I understand that officials were ""crystal clear"" about her views on the matter. There was no doubt in their minds that the first minister agreed with  the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, who said ""It cannot be right for a rapist to be in a women's prison.""
Bryson will be moved to a male wing of a male prison on Thursday afternoon. Nicola Sturgeon believes that is the right call. 
Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said on Wednesday that the prime minister was aware of the Bryson case and ""understood the concerns"".
UK Justice Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted that ""transgender women without a Gender Recognition Certificate are sent to male prisons as a matter of course"" in England and Wales. 
He added: ""Our further, common-sense changes will mean transgender women who have committed sex crimes or retain male genitalia can't be held in women's prisons, bar the most exceptional cases authorised by Ministers.""
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also criticised the decision to hold the rapist in a women's jail.
Speaking to the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, Ms Cooper said: ""It should be clear that if someone poses a danger to women and committed crimes against women, they should not be being housed in a women's prison.
""That is straightforward and I think most people would agree with that.""
A spokesperson for LGBT campaigning group Stonewall said: ""It is appropriate that the prison service individually assess all prisoners and carry out detailed risk assessments that are about the safety of both the prisoner and those that they will be in contact with.
""Indeed, this is already the policy across the HM Prison and Probation Service in England and Wales, and the Scottish Prison Service.""

India has approved its first nasal Covid vaccine.
Made by Bharat Biotech, iNCOVACC is administered in the form of drops and stimulates an immune response in the tissues that line the nasal cavity.
In September 2022, China had approved an inhaled Covid vaccine, administered in the form or a spray.
Scientists say that nasal vaccines may offer added immunity in the lining of the nose and upper airways, where Covid typically enters the body.
Research teams in the UK and the US have also been investigating nasal spray vaccines.
In November, India's drug regulator approved the use of iNCOVACC as a heterologous booster dose -  a booster for people who had previously received two doses of Covishied or Covaxin, the two main Indian vaccines - in emergency situations among adults. 
In December, it was approved by the drug regulator as a primary vaccine and as a subsequent booster shot in adults.
The vaccine will cost 800 rupees ($10; £8) per dose in private hospitals and 325 rupees per dose in government hospitals and can be booked on the government's online platform. Two doses are to be taken 28 days apart.
iNCOVACC uses a adenovirus as a carrier for the genetic code that teaches the body how to fight the infection. Adenoviruses used in the vaccines are harmless transporters which have been modified so they cannot replicate or cause infection.
Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, told ANI news agency that the vaccine was ""easy to deliver"" as it didn't need a syringe or needle, and that it produced a broader immune response as compared to injectable Covid vaccines. 
India has administered over two billion Covid jabs so far. More than 70% of the Indian population has taken at least two doses, according to the federal health ministry.
In January 2022, India began giving boosters to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 years with comorbidities. It was later expanded to all adults. However, the pace of booster doses administrated has been slow.

A mentally ill woman was discovered in a ""mummified, almost skeletal state"" after lying dead for more than three years in her flat, her family say.
Laura Winham, 38, was ""abandoned and left to die"" by the NHS and social services before her body was found by her brother in May 2021, they claim.
She is thought to have died in November 2017 after being referred to social care twice in the previous years.
The NHS and Surrey Police have been contacted for comment. 
Surrey County Council said it was a ""truly tragic case"" and that it would provide information for an upcoming inquest into the death.
Ms Winham, who had schizophrenia, lived in social housing in Woking, Surrey, and had become estranged from her family.
In 2014, a referral was made to Woking Community Mental Health Recovery and her GP, flagging that she appeared to have ""untreated mental health issues"", her family said. This was not followed up. 
After visiting Ms Winham in October 2017, in what was probably the last time anyone saw her alive, Surrey Police officers reported to Surrey County Council that she had been ""self-neglecting, had little food, and appeared unaware of how to access local services for help"".
Shortly after this visit, the markings on Ms Winham's calendar stopped. One of the last entries read: ""I need help"".
Her sister Nicky said despite the ""warning signs"" about her deteriorating mental health, ""everyone seems to have turned a blind eye"".
She added: ""Everybody who was in contact with Laura and had a duty to her at some stage simply wiped their hands of her and forgot her. 
""She was abandoned and left to die.
""It's just heart-breaking to think of how she lived in her last few years, unable to ask for help, without anyone there for her.""
Iftikhar Manzoor, of Hudgell Solicitors, who are acting for the family, said: ""Laura was referred to adult social care teams twice, firstly in 2014 and then by the police in October 2017. 
""Assessments of her needs were not carried out. Without doubt these were clear missed opportunities to intervene and carry out a welfare check.""
A spokesperson for Surrey County Council said it was a ""truly tragic case"".
""It's important that every aspect of this complex case is reviewed and we're committed to participating fully in the inquest process,"" they added.
They confirmed they would provide any information needed to support the coroner's inquiries.

Seven people have been shot dead at a synagogue in East Jerusalem, with at least three others injured.
The incident happened in the city's Neve Yaakov neighbourhood at around 20:15 local time (18:15 GMT). 
Police described the attacker as a ""terrorist"" and said he had been ""neutralised"".
Speaking at the scene, Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai called it ""one of the worst attacks we have encountered in recent years"". 
The US has condemned the attack. A spokesperson for the state department, Vedant Patel, said: ""We stand with the Israeli people in solidarity.""
Several other countries have also expressed their concern, including Australia and the UK. 
""To attack worshippers at a synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day, and during Shabbat, is horrific. We stand with our Israeli friends"", British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly wrote on Twitter.
Holocaust Memorial Day remembers the victims of the Holocaust, when six million Jews were killed by the Nazi regime in Germany. 
Local media report that the attacker was killed by security forces as he was fleeing.
""The attacker is a resident of East Jerusalem,"" said district police commander, Doron Turgeman. ""We are completing operations at the scene.""
Shortly after the incident, Israel's controversial far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the shooting. 
Mr Ben-Gvir promised to bring safety back to Israel's streets but there is rising anger that he has not yet done so, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem. 
Tensions have been high since nine Palestinians - both militants and civilians - were killed during an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.  
This was followed by rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, to which Israel responded with air strikes.

Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols
Footage of a traffic stop that has seen five ex-Memphis police officers charged with murder appears to show them taking turns to brutally kick and punch a motorist.
Tyre Nichols, 29, is heard crying out repeatedly for his mother during the arrest in Memphis on 7 January. 
The videos show a Taser being used on Mr Nichols before he flees. Clips then show him being held down and beaten.
Protests are planned on Friday night in Memphis and other US cities.
Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January.
US President Joe Biden said in a statement: ""Like so many, I was outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death.""
Memphis Police Department released four graphic videos on Friday evening of the traffic stop.
The first clip shows officers pulling Mr Nichols out of his vehicle and shouting at him to get on the ground. 
""I didn't do anything!"" he says. Officers then force him to the ground and demand that he lies flat.
Within seconds one of the officers uses a Taser on him, and Mr Nichols leaps up and manages to run away.
A second video appears to show the view from a CCTV camera on a pole across the street of a residential area, as two officers hold Mr Nichols down while others take turns kicking and punching him and striking him with what appears to be a baton.
They drag him across the ground and prop him sitting up against a squad car.
The third and fourth videos show police body camera footage of the beating, with Mr Nichols being held down, pepper-sprayed and assaulted as he appears to repeatedly shout: ""Mom!""
Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, has said her son was only about 70 metres (230ft) from home when Memphis police officers ""murdered him"".
The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III, and Justin Smith - were fired last week.
They all face charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.

The Associated Press, the biggest news agency in the United States, has apologised after it was ridiculed for warning journalists against referring to ""the French"".
The AP stylebook Twitter account had recommended writers avoid using ""the"" in phrases like ""the disabled, the poor and the French"".
It said this could be dehumanising.
The French embassy responded by briefly changing its name to the ""Embassy of Frenchness in the United States"".
The tweet was the source of mockery on Twitter, with many making jokes about the inclusion of ""the French"". It received more than 20 million views before being deleted. 
""We deleted an earlier tweet because of an inappropriate reference to French people. We did not intend to offend,"" AP tweeted.
""Writing French people, French citizens, etc., is good. But ""the"" terms for any people can sound dehumanising and imply a monolith rather than diverse individuals,"" it added.

Communities hit by Nigeria's worst recorded floods are at the centre of an exhibition by photographer Gideon Mendel. He took portraits of people standing amid their drowned homes in the southern state of Bayelsa:
In late November last year I travelled to Nigeria, more than a month after the floodwater had arrived and I found many houses were still inundated. 
With the water slowly receding, my subjects were able to take me to their homes, often travelling by canoe. 
""This is the third time I have experienced a flood, but this is by far the worst,"" said Gift Ikuru (pictured above) from Ogbia municipality.
""All of my belongings are destroyed. There is no shelter for us, so we have been sleeping on the roadside.""
I was repeatedly moved by the welcome I received in this community - from people dealing with such difficult circumstances. So many people wanted to have their experience documented that I often had a queue of people waiting to be photographed.

Shiphrah Timbiri Otuoke breaks into spontaneous song as she stands in front of her flooded home
My subjects embraced this moment of witnessing, facing the camera with such dignity, like Shiphrah Timbiri Otuoke (above).
She broke into spontaneous song as she stood outside her home, expressing sorrow but also a resilience shown by so many in Ogbia where many own small plots of land to grow crops.
""On our farm the water was above our heads so we had to take the risk of diving to harvest our cassava,"" she said.
""It brought so much destruction and hunger to our community. I am a sociology student and the flood was a disaster to me academically. I lost so many learning hours. My textbooks, handouts and notebooks are all damaged. I don't know where to start from now because I support myself with farming as a student.""
The residents living on the lower level of Dorcas Apartments, accommodation for university students, have been all flooded.
""None of us have had any assistance in this terrible situation,"" said Joy Christian, whose husband is a caretaker of the building.
""We have seen huge rains this year, more than ever, but we know that this flood came from a dam being opened in Cameroon,"" said Eruabai Ase Otuaba (above).
""We thought the 2012 floods were the worst but the level is much higher this time. There is nowhere to sleep and the water came with sickness. With so many mosquitoes malaria is here.
""I am living with my family on the top level of the incomplete building. We have to use this contaminated water for washing and drinking.""
Ms Otuaba said the displaced families had received no help from the government.
""The floodwater destroyed our store of food supplies from our family farm so we have nothing to feed on. The foundation of our house is also damaged. We do not know if it still will be standing after having so much water inside.
""But in our community we support each other. When there is food we share it. I have a degree in business studies, but I am not employed at present. I work on our family farm.""
""We were told that a flood is coming but we did not prepare for something of this magnitude, particularly because in this community flooding is rare,"" said farmer Prince Ogiasa Lume Otuoke (above).
""The flood came suddenly. There was no time for preparation as the water was overflowing with extreme force. I did not have the chance to dive into the water and save my crops. 
""Our main crop here is plantain, and for the planting we need the suckers. But they will have all rotted away under the floodwater.""
According to the UN's disaster relief agency (Ocha), the flooding in Nigeria affected more than three million people.
More than 600 people lost their lives and another 1.5 million people were forced to flee their homes. It extensively damaged houses, farms and basic infrastructure and decimated livelihoods across the country.
""The damage to staple foods such as cassava, rice, and plantain, among other crops, risks aggravating the already alarming food and nutrition crisis across Nigeria,"" said Ocha's Matthias Schmale.
""The experience was not easy. We have been moving from one place to another for shelter. We are now living in the upstairs of an incomplete building,"" said Iruaro Robert Otuaba, a school student (above right).
""We lost our personal belongings but I was most upset to see all my children's schoolbooks in the water,"" said his mother Edigiraru Donald (above left).
""All the crops from our farm are destroyed. We are seriously suffering now because I can't do any business to survive.""
This is the outside of a church in Ogbia, showing how slow it was taking for the waters to recede.
""I remember the flood when 2012 when I was a boy, but that was not nearly as bad as this. Nobody in our community expected it to be this huge,"" said Mr Otuaba.
For farmer Orubo Oro Tombia (above), from neighbouring Yenagoa municipality, the worst aspect has been the loss of cassava stems: ""It is a disaster to me in so many ways and the cause of so much stress.
""The farmland is submerged so all the stems are dead. That means there will be no crop in the coming year.""
""We know that many things caused this flood. A dam over the border in Cameroon released water, and our government has failed to prepare for this by building a dam to curtail it,"" she said.
""I also believe that climate change caused the unusual rains and the overflow of the dam. I have a canoe, so at least I am able to move around and return to my home.""
Fidelia Shedrack Igbogene (above), also in Yenagoa, said her family were the only ones left on her street as they had an upper floor: ""Where we are here there is no comfort because the building is unfinished. Mosquitos feast on us. The situation is terrible and bad. 
""I make a living farming fish and we had two fishponds. They were washed away and I have lost all my fish.""
""I am a university student. Many of my academic books are damaged, and how can I study when I am living like this?"" said Winner Odums (above) in Ogbia.
""It's hard for my family to survive with food prices so high and all of our farm produce destroyed. With all the water still here it makes life unbearable.""
Many people have been struggling to find refuge - this is Dorcas Apartments where only the upper levels were accessible.
""Someone gave us his place to stay but now he has just asked us to leave so we are now staying by the roadside,"" said Aruaman Ase in Ogbia.
""I work in a student building and most of their belongings under my watch as the apartment caretaker are gone, submerged under floodwaters,"" said Alawei Christian (above).
""This is my fourth experience of flooding, but it is much worse this time, the biggest of all of them. It has really affected my family. We have lost so much, including 25 chickens.""
""There has been some help offered, but not nearly enough,"" said Mr Christian.
""Imagine a bag of rice and beans for hundreds of people in the community. We received just a single cup measure of rice and beans.""
Farmer Janet Eke Otuoke is sleeping at her brother's home in Ogbia: ""We are seven people in that small room with our children, living and managing together.
""I also lost all my cassava stems, so for us to plant next year it means we would need to buy them. But each stem goes for more than a 1,000 naira [$2.20, £1.75], which is far beyond our means. 
""My appeal to government is that they should help us to continue farming and also help with the properties that have been so damaged.""

More than 50 people have been killed in two separate travel-related accidents in Pakistan on Sunday. 
At least 41 people died when a bus fell into a ravine and caught fire in the south-west, while in the north-west at least 10 children drowned in a boating accident. 
All the dead recovered so far at the lake were aged between seven and 14.
At the bus crash site, a local official said the bodies were ""beyond recognition"".
The crash occurred near the southern city of Bela, in Balochistan Province, when it was travelling to the port city of Karachi.
Local official Hamza Anjum told AFP news agency that 40 bodies were found alongside three injured people, one of whom died shortly after. The two remaining survivors were in a ""serious"" condition. 
The bus reportedly hit a pillar on a bridge before the crash. 
""We will investigate the causes of the accident,"" Mr Anjum said, adding that DNA tests would be used to determine the identity of the remains. 
The boat capsized on Tanda Dam, a lake near Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, close to the border with Afghanistan. 
Local police official Mir Rauf told AFP that as well as the 10 who died, 11 children had been rescued, with six in critical condition. Another nine are believed to be missing. 
The boat they were travelling on was carrying more than two dozen people on a daytrip from a local madrassa - Islamic school - when it overturned.
""A rescue operation is under way,"" Mr Rauf said.
Furqan Khan, the deputy commissioner of Korat, told Reuters there had been incidents in the past and police had closed the lake for recreational trips. 
Video footage by local broadcasters and on social media showed rescuers in the water.

A phone belonging to a woman who went missing while walking her dog was found on a bench near the riverbank where she disappeared, police have said.
Nicola Bulley, from Inskip, was last seen walking on a footpath by the river off Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre, at about 09:15 GMT on 27 January.
A major search was launched for the 45-year-old involving police, the fire service and mountain rescue teams.
The force said officers were ""extremely concerned"" about her.
Supt Sally Riley from Lancashire Police said: ""We appeal for anyone who may have been driving through the village of St Michael's last Friday morning... or who may have dashcam footage that could be of use to us, or people who may have been dog-walking in the area or on the tow path to come forward.""
Asked about lines of inquiry, she said: ""The police are keeping a really open mind about what could have happened but we do believe that the likelihood is that Nicola has gone missing and this is not a crime inquiry, but we are keeping an open mind.""
Ms Bulley is described as white, 5ft 3ins (1.6m) tall, with light brown shoulder-length hair. 
She speaks with an Essex accent and was last seen wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive green ankle wellies. 
She went missing while walking her dog, a brown-coloured spaniel, which was later found close to where she was last seen.
As well as Inskip and St Michael's, Ms Bulley also has links to Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire Police said.
Earlier Ch Insp Chris Barton said the force was ""extremely concerned"".
He said: ""Firstly, if anybody saw her on Friday morning and has not yet been spoken to by police, or if anybody has any other information about where she might be, please get in touch with us straight away.
""We are following a number of lines of inquiry and are keeping an open mind at this stage about what has occurred. 
""We appreciate there is a great deal of concern in the local area and that people want to help, however we would ask that nobody puts themselves in any danger.
""If anybody has any questions or concerns they are welcome to speak to officers in the area.""

118;['No trans prisoners have attacked women, says justice minister'];['2023-01-30T11:32:53.000Z'];['BBC News'];['prisons', 'lgbt', 'transgender people'];['attacked', 'female', 'sexual', 'minister', 'justice', 'remanded', 'trans', 'prisoners', 'history', 'placed', 'transgender', 'women', 'estate', 'violence', 'prisoner'];"
Justice Secretary Keith Brown has said there are no transgender prisoners with violence convictions against women in  the female prison estate.
It comes after it emerged that violent prisoner Tiffany Scott, previously known as a man called Andrew Burns, applied to transfer to a women's jail. 
On Sunday, a ""pause"" was placed on the transfer of transgender inmates.
Official figures show that there are currently five transgender women being held in the women's prison estate.
Mr Brown told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme no trans prisoners with a history of violence against women were being held in female prisons.
He also said that none of those was considered a threat.
Mr Brown said: ""This changes on a regular basis but it is my understanding there are no transgender women in the female estate that have violence against women convictions. 
The minister added that, in exceptional circumstances, a trans woman could be moved to the female estate, but that would require the approval of Scottish ministers.
""It will always be the case, has always been the case, similar in relation to a gender recognition certificate, that these things are not determinative of where somebody is placed,"" he said.
""You cannot insist on that right if you're a transgender woman or man, to be placed in the estate where you want to be placed.
""It will only happen as a result of a multi-party assessment, a rigorous risk assessment that goes on and that is what determines where people are placed.""
Mr Brown announced on Sunday that there would be a ""pause"" on transgender prisoners with a history of violence against women being placed in female jails in Scotland.
The order said that no transgender person already in custody with a history of violence against women would be moved from the male to female estate and also that no newly-convicted or remanded transgender prisoner with any history of violence against women (including sexual offences) would be placed in the female estate.
He said this pause would last ""at least"" as long as two reviews were ongoing.
An urgent review into the case of trans woman Isla Bryson, who was convicted of raping two women before changing gender, is under way. 
There was a public outcry when Bryson was initially remanded to Cornton Vale women's prison and she was later moved to a men's jail.
Mr Brown has confirmed the ""lessons learned review"" would be completed by Friday.
MSPs also voiced their outrage after reports emerged on Sunday that Tiffany Scott - who was convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl before her transition - was due to be moved to the female estate.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, Mr Brown said a decision on Scott's placement ""wasn't taken"" and had not been given approval from the risk management authority, adding: ""There is so much in the public domain which is incorrect.""
Scott has a history of violence and is serving an order for lifelong restriction, meaning she will only be released when she is no longer considered an ""unmanageable risk"" to public safety.
A second, longer-term review is also ongoing by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS).
The review of 2014's Gender Identity and Gender Reassignment Policy began in 2019 and has involved consultation with prison staff who have experience of working with transgender people in Scotland's prisons, transgender men and women in prison,  men and women living in custody across the Scottish prisons estate and discussions with over 30 stakeholders.
Mr Brown said that if a review recommended a specific unit for trans people, they would consider it.
""Whatever the review comes back with, we will look at,"" he said.
""In relation to one of the cases (Bryson) nobody was put into the general population. That was somebody who was put into a place where they were segregated and the protections that were necessary were in place and that was standard practice. 
""But the review is ongoing. Let's see what  the review comes back with and of course we will consider any recommendations which are made.""
The Scottish Conservatives have demanded a parliamentary update from Nicola Sturgeon on the safety of female prisoners.
Russell Findlay, the party's community safety minister, has submitted an urgent question after ""days of SNP chaos, confusion and U-turns"". 
The Tories have called for the ""pause"" on criminals with a history of violence against women being housed in female prisons to be made a permanent ban.
Shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray told the programme that events of the past week had been ""botched"" by the Scottish government and the justice secretary.
""I think in all reasonable terms people would see the current issues that are going on around the Isla Bryson case as being unreasonable,"" the Labour MP said.
""The Scottish government really do need to sort this out because the Equality Act is clear that single-sex spaces, including women's prisons, have got to be protected under the law, and it looks in this case as if people are being put in danger,"" he said.
""I don't think it does either the prison community, the Scottish government, or indeed the trans community any favours whatsoever.""

120;"[""Abdullah al-Howaiti: Saudi child 'offender' sentenced to death at retrial""]";['2022-03-03T15:08:37.000Z'];['BBC News'];['capital punishment', 'saudi arabia', 'human rights in saudi arabia'];['retrial', 'death', 'child', 'saudi', 'alhowaiti', 'judge', 'telling', 'offender', 'torture', 'threat', 'jewellers', 'pleaded', 'sentenced', 'abdullah', 'rights', 'interrogators', 'near', 'showing'];"
A Saudi man has been sentenced to death for a second time after being convicted at a retrial of a crime he allegedly committed as a child, his family says.
Abdullah al-Howaiti was 14 years old when he was arrested in 2017 on charges of murder and armed robbery.
The Supreme Court had overturned his original conviction last year.
Human rights activists said CCTV footage showed he was not at the scene of the crime and that he was tortured into signing a false confession.
Abdullah al-Howaiti was first sentenced to death in 2019, after he was convicted by the Criminal Court in Tabuk province of shooting dead a policeman while robbing a jewellery shop in the town of Duba. 
Five other defendants were handed 15-year prison terms for allegedly aiding and abetting the crimes.
All six had pleaded not guilty, telling the judge that interrogators coerced their ""confessions"" through torture or the threat of it, human rights activists said. The judge also ignored CCTV footage showing that Howaiti was not near the jewellers at the time of the crime. 
The Court of Appeal in Tabuk upheld the conviction in January 2021. But the Supreme Court threw it out in November and ordered a retrial
""The Tabuk Criminal Court rules with injustice and sentences the minor Abdullah with qisas,"" Howaiti's mother Um Abdullah tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, referring to a crime under Sharia, or Islamic law, for which the victim or their family is given the right of retribution.
""After the Supreme Court overturned the first ruling because of false confessions, today it pronounces an unjust conviction just like last time.""
Um Abdullah appealed to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to intervene to save her son from the ""injustice"".
Reprieve also condemned the verdict, saying it ""makes a mockery of Saudi Arabia's claim to have eliminated the death penalty for children"".
The Gulf kingdom, whose justice system is based on a strict interpretation of Sharia, announced in 2018 that a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison would be applied to juvenile offenders convicted of ""tazir"" crimes, for which punishments are left to the judge's discretion.
However, the provision does not apply to two categories of crimes that carry fixed punishments - ""qisas"" offences, such as murder, and ""hudud"" offences considered against the rights of God, including adultery and apostasy.

122;['Alfredo Cospito: Hunger-striking Italian anarchist moved amid protests'];['2023-01-31T12:43:47.000Z'];['BBC News'];['organised crime', 'italy'];['team', 'protests', 'space', 'moved', 'hours', 'nadia', 'anarchist', 'living', 'italian', 'amid', 'hungerstriking', 'alfredo', 'total', 'severe', 'cospito', 'regime', 'terrorist', 'number'];"
A convicted Italian anarchist who has been on hunger strike for weeks has been moved to a jail in Milan amid growing fears his health is worsening.
Supporters of Alfredo Cospito, 55, have torched cars and threatened officials in protest at his jail conditions.
Cospito has been refusing food for more than 100 days.
The new restrictions, usually reserved for mafia bosses, include one monitored visit from family members and one telephone call a month.
The measures, known as 41bis after an article of the Italian criminal code, were introduced in their current form in 1992, after the mafia killings of judges Paolo Falcone and Giovanni Borsellino, and were originally meant to cut off Mafia bosses from the outside world and other inmates, and to prevent them from ordering criminal acts from behind bars. 
Now, however, the 41bis prison regime can be imparted on people who have been found guilty of crimes ranging from terrorism to tobacco smuggling and kidnapping.
Critics of the 41bis - including former prisoners who experienced it - say that the solitude faced by those who live through it is ""unbearable"" and that cells are barely big enough for a bed. 
Aside from only receiving one monitored visit from family members a month, prisoners are also banned from interacting with other prisoners or meeting with third parties, have to spend their one recess hour a day in isolation, have no access to the prison's communal areas and are kept under 24/7 surveillance.
Some legal experts have said that the 41bis is ""a medieval form of punishment"".
The lawyers for far-left terrorist Nadia Lioce, who has been living under the 41bis regime for two decades, have said that because of the severe limitations on the number of hours she can see her family or legal team she has effectively only interacted with people for a total of 15 hours in the space of a year. 
Italian media reported Lioce's lawyers as saying she is now so ""psychologically isolated"" that, when her mother and sister visit, she is unable to speak to them for more than a few minutes.
Amnesty International and the European Court of Human Rights have both criticised several aspects of the 41bis, and in 2007 a US court refused to extradite a convicted Mafia drug trafficker on the grounds that the 41bis regime he would face in Italy would have ""constituted torture"".
Cospito is serving two jail sentences - 10 years for a gun attack on the CEO of a nuclear engineering company in Genoa in 2012 and 20 years in prison for bomb attacks against a Carabinieri police school in Fossano, masterminded whilst in prison. His partner is also serving time. 
He was moved on Monday from a prison in Sardinia to Milan's Opera prison - a facility for inmates who need critical medical care. He has lost more than 40kg (6.2 stone) during the course of his hunger strike but the government has refused to lift the terms of his imprisonment.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said her government will not be intimidated by the threats of violence.
Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said on Tuesday that the wave of violence and vandalism in recent days proved a link continued to exist between Cospito and other anarchists and ""that would tend to justify maintaining the 41bis"".
Protests against his incarceration have included attacks against Italian diplomats in Germany, Spain and Greece as well as in South America. Threatening letters containing bullets have been sent to officials. 
In the most serious attack, the car of senior diplomat Susanna Schlein was destroyed by a petrol bomb in Athens in early December.
Several cars were set alight in Rome and Milan in further incidents on Monday night.
Cospito's case is due to be heard by Italy's highest court in March.

The US military commitment to the Pacific was underlined in a White House meeting between the leaders of the US and Japan. But behind the scenes, this renewed focus on Asia has sparked a fierce debate within one of its most fabled military forces, writes defence analyst Jonathan Marcus.
A bitter family row has erupted in one of the US military's most hallowed institutions, the US Marine Corps.
A host of its former senior commanders are lining up to attack the current leadership over plans for its reinvention.
At issue is a plan to adapt the service for a potential conflict against China - a plan dubbed Force Design 2030. Almost from its inception this plan has been under attack with a cohort of retired generals taking the unusual approach of going to the press to air their frustrations.
Retired senior officers have been meeting regularly; speaking at seminars and think tanks; and devising their own alternative to a plan which they see as a disaster for the Marine Corps' future. 
One prominent critic is the former US Navy Secretary and former Senator for Virginia, Jim Webb, who served as a Marine officer in the Vietnam War and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015. 
Writing in the Wall Street Journal, he described Force Design 2030 as ""insufficiently tested"" and ""intrinsically flawed"". He warned that the plan ""raised serious questions about the wisdom and long-term risk of dramatic reductions in force structure, weapons systems and manpower levels in units that would take steady casualties in most combat scenarios"".
So what has got them all so upset? 
Launched in 2020 by the Marine Corps Commandant General David H Berger, the plan is intended to equip the Marines for a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region rather than counter-insurgency wars like Iraq and Afghanistan.
The new plan sees the Marines as fighting dispersed operations across chains of islands. Units will be smaller, more spread out, but packing a much bigger punch through a variety of new weapons systems. Huge amphibious landings like in World War Two or massive deployments on land - like in Iraq - will probably be things of the past.
Most unpopular is the plan to cut back on foot soldiers and give up all its tanks. Such proposals have led some critics to feel the Corps is turning its back on its past. 
While it has close ties with the US Navy it is a separate service which grew dramatically in World War Two and has taken a prominent role in recent campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Public perceptions of the Marine Corps are powerfully influenced by the World War Two experience. Anyone who has seen John Wayne in the 1949 feature film The Sands of Iwo Jima or the more recent mini-series The Pacific produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will remember the large-scale amphibious operations; men storming ashore from landing craft and so on. 
This is not the way the new plan sees the Marines as fighting.
Its traditional role as America's military first responder, capable of taking on disparate challenges around the globe, is what critics believe could be compromised by the new plan with its clear focus upon China and the Indo-Pacific.
So what exactly is in the plan?
Money for the new weapons systems, totalling $15.8 billion,  are to be funded by the cuts which amount to some  $18.2 billion.
In addition to the new rocket artillery systems, there are to be new anti-shipping missiles that can be fired from land and new unmanned aerial systems. The goal is to equip and train the Marine Corps for a new kind of warfare that the fighting in Ukraine has already prefigured.  
The primary guiding factor of Force Design 2030 is what the Marines' Commandant refers to as distributed operations, breaking up large forces into widely distributed smaller units but ensuring that they have sufficient military punch to make a real difference. 
Military specialist Mike O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, rejects the central criticism that the new focus on China might impair Marine operations elsewhere. The Marines will go where they are ordered, he says, and the new strategy probably won't impact on operations as much as some think. 
""What really has mattered in this regard is the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years - THAT is the big change, irrespective of (and mostly before) General Berger's vision was even developed.""
Many commentators insist that change is essential if the Marines are to face up to the challenges of the modern battlefield. 
Dr Frank Hoffman - himself a former Marine officer - is now a Distinguished Research Fellow at the US National Defense University. ""I think the critics are looking backwards to a gloried past, and fail to see the strategic picture vis a vis China and technology in a really disappointing way,"" he says. 
While the withdrawal of the Marines' tanks has drawn particular criticism, Dr Hoffman believes it is the right course. There will still be plenty of armoured vehicles, he argues, just not ""the heavy tanks and their supporting cast of refuellers"". 
""It's an adaptation to cover a deeper area with a more accurate mix of firepower such as we are seeing in Ukraine. The Corps has used its aviation element to have this range in the past, and now it will have a mix of traditional artillery and a family of missiles that will increase the lethality and range of its fire support."" 
These are all steps that many would say are justified by the lessons from Ukraine.
The utility and importance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); rocket artillery; and the ability to strike at great range with great accuracy have all been underlined in the Russia-Ukraine war and are very much part of the Marines' new plans. But their envisaged battlefield is very different - not the forests and steppe lands of Ukraine but island chains reaching across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.
Force Design 2030 is very much an evolving programme. There have already been changes and there will be more. And while the direction of travel has been established there are still huge problems to resolve, not least the logistical challenges posed by a force likely to be distributed over a vast area.
Amphibious shipping will play a key role here. And as Nick Childs, the Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the IISS in London explains, new kinds of ships are going to be needed. 
""Just relying on their traditional large amphibious ships would leave them too vulnerable to the kinds of modern weaponry that they are likely to face"", he says. ""So new kinds of smaller ships in greater numbers will be vital, so that the Marine Corps can operate in a more agile and dispersed way.""
But getting more ships is not going to be easy. Smaller ones can be built quickly and in a wide range of shipyards but not necessarily at at the pace needed. The US Navy also needs significant numbers of new warships and it is far from clear that there are the funds or the ship-yard capacity needed. 
It's the age-old problem of matching strategic priorities to resources. And the crisis in Ukraine underlines that old threats can reappear just as a force is trying to focus itself in an entirely new direction.

128;"[""Kim Johnson: Labour MP apologises for calling Israeli government 'fascist'""]";['2023-02-01T15:08:31.000Z'];['BBC News'];['israel', 'kim johnson', 'labour party'];['calling', 'apologises', 'response', 'fascist', 'question', 'mr', 'kim', 'mp', 'sunak', 'word', 'johnson', 'mention', 'israeli', 'israel', 'inside', 'johnsons', 'labour', 'ms'];"
Labour MP Kim Johnson has apologised for describing Israel's recently-formed coalition government as ""fascist"".
The Liverpool Riverside MP made the comment whilst pressing Rishi Sunak over ""human rights violations"" against Palestinians at PMQs.
She apologised around an hour later, after being ordered to do so by party bosses. 
The MP said she acknowledged using the term 'fascist' was ""particularly insensitive"" given Israel's history.
""While there are far-right elements in the government, I recognise that the use of the term in this context was wrong,"" she added.
The BBC has been told she was told to apologise by party whips for remarks described as ""unacceptable"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman.
Israel's new government, formed after elections in November, includes senior ministers from the ultranationalist far right.
There is domestic and international concern it will inflame the conflict with the Palestinians, damage the judiciary and restrict minority rights.
Benjamin Netanyahu, who has returned as prime minister after his Likud party formed a coalition with ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies, has promised to pursue peace and safeguard civil rights.
Ms Johnson also apologised for saying that right group Amnesty International had described Israel as an ""apartheid state"".
""Whilst I was quoting accurately Amnesty's description, I recognise this is insensitive and I'd like to withdraw it,"" she added. 
In his initial response to Ms Johnson's question, Mr Sunak did not directly criticise her use of the word ""fascist,"" but said she had ""failed to mention the horrific attack on civilians inside Israel as well"".
""It's important in this matter to remain calm and urge all sides strive for peace, and that's very much what I will do as prime minister,"" he added.
Fellow Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge criticised Ms Johnson's remarks, calling them ""unacceptable and dangerous"".
She added that the comments were an ""insult"" to the legacy of Dame Louise Ellman, Ms Johnson's predecessor as Liverpool Riverside MP who temporarily quit Labour over the party's handling of antisemitism allegations under Jeremy Corbyn.
However, the decision by Sir Keir's spokesman to denounce Ms Johnson's language was criticised by Momentum, the Corbyn-supporting left-wing pressure group.
Writing on Twitter, the group accused the Labour leader of an ""outrageous abuse of power"".
It accused Sir Keir of wanting to ""silence wholly legitimate criticism of the Israeli government"".
